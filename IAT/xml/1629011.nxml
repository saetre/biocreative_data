Metamorphosis is triggered by the steroid hormone ecdysone in the absence of the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone and is carried out by self-destructive mechanisms of programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The developmental process of different larval tissues during metamorphic transformation showed that tissues such as the silk gland and gut are completely histolyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while other tissues such as fat body undergo reorganization with histolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and predetermined imaginal tissues differentiate and grow into organs and external structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The ecdysone-induced transcription factor Broad-Complex (BR-C) plays an important regulatory role in metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is required for differentiation of adult structures as well as for the programmed death of obsolete larval organs during metamorphosis. The <italic>Bombyx </italic>BR-C RNAi disrupted the differentiation of adult compound eyes, legs and wings, and also perturbed the programmed cell death of larval silk glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the <italic>Bombyx </italic>BR-C function uncovers the programmed cell death of larval fat body and larval gut during silkworm metamorphosis. It is still unclear what gene products function in the programmed cell death of larval fat body and/or larval gut. Therefore, we asked whether cathepsins are involved in the metamorphic events of silkworm because, to date, studies in insects reveal that cathepsins also participate in developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, a study has shown that the temporal activity profile of an aspartic proteinase is associated with fat body histolysis during <italic>Ceratitis capitata </italic>early metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies of insect cathepsins strongly implicate the involvement of activated proteinases in metamorphic events. Thus, it is of interest to know whether cathepsin has any functional roles in insect metamorphosis through a loss-of-function test.</p><p>Here, we have focused on cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartic proteinase, as a metamorphosis-specific proteinase involved in metamorphic events. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of metamorphosis in the silkworm, we first cloned the <italic>Bombyx mori </italic>cathepsin D (<italic>BmCatD</italic>) gene from the silkworm. We examined the expression profile of <italic>BmCatD </italic>during development; <italic>BmCatD </italic>is induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone and baculovirus infection, and is expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific pattern in the larval fat body of the final instar and in the larval gut of pupal stage. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of <italic>BmCatD </italic>function disrupts two classes of metamorphic events in <italic>Bombyx</italic>, larval-pupal transformation and programmed cell death of larval gut.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>A novel aspartic proteinase (BmCatD) gene cloned from the silkworm B. mori</title><p>The <italic>BmCatD </italic>cDNA was isolated by searching <italic>B. mori </italic>ESTs that encode a protein of 385 amino acids (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY297160">AY297160</ext-link>). Comparison of amplicon size between the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed the presence of nine exons and eight introns in <italic>BmCatD </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The two catalytic centers and aspartic acid residues, as well as the six cysteine residues characteristic of aspartic proteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], were conserved in BmCatD, indicating that BmCatD is a member of the same family as all other insect aspartic proteinases identified to date. BmCatD showed the closest amino acid identity with the aspartic proteinase of the mosquitoes <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>(64% identity) and <italic>Aedes aegypti </italic>(63% identity).

We found that recombinant BmCatD expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells was N-linked glycosylated, but its N-linked glycosylation is not necessary for enzyme activity and that the purified recombinant BmCatD exhibited a high proteolytic activity at pH 3.0&#x02013;3.5, establishing BmCatD as an aspartic proteinase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BmCatD is expressed in a developmental stage- and tissue-specific manner and its expression causes programmed cell death</title><p>To examine the expression of <italic>BmCatD </italic>in various tissues during development, we first performed Northern blot analysis. We found that <italic>BmCatD </italic>was expressed in the fat body of the final (fifth) larval instar, but not in the pupal fat body, and was also seen in the gut during pupal development. Next, developmental stage- and tissue-specific profiles of <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression were performed using total RNA obtained from fat body and gut during the fifth larval instar to pupal stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In the fat body, <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA was expressed from day 3 in the fifth larval instar to day 2 in the spinning stage (upper panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA in larval gut was expressed during the entire pupal stage including prepupae (upper panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The expression level of <italic>BmCatD </italic>was relatively low in the prepupal stage, increased dramatically on day 1 of the pupal stage, and thereafter gradually reduced but remained until adult eclosion. These results showed that the expression pattern of <italic>BmCatD </italic>was specifically started in the fat body on day 3 of the fifth larval instar and completely disappeared on day 1 of the prepupal stage. In larval gut, expression of <italic>BmCatD </italic>was precisely detected on day 1 of the prepupal stage, indicating that <italic>BmCatD </italic>is differentially and spatially expressed during development and its expression proceeds in a precise tissue- and developmental stage-dependent manner. Consistent with Northern blot data, the expression pattern of BmCatD protein, which was confirmed by Western blotting using the antibody of recombinant BmCatD that was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, was observed in the fat body of the fifth larval instar (middle panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and in the larval gut of pupal stage (middle panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>BmCatD </italic>expression profile and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the fat body and gut of <italic>B. mori</italic>.

Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in fat body and gut cells was assessed by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis (lower).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-6-49-2"/></fig><p>The prospective fates of these tissues such as fat body and gut during metamorphic transformation are different. The larval gut is completely histolyzed during the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; on the other hand, the fat body undergoes reorganization with histolysis during larval-pupal transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It seems logical that the histolysis of larval fat body and larval gut represents a programmed cell death response. Therefore, we assayed whether the histolysis of larval fat body and larval gut is accompanied by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation that is a rapid and accurate indicator of the involvement of apoptosis in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To determine whether the <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression correlates with the histolysis of larval fat body and larval gut during metamorphosis, we analyzed the induction of programmed cell death in the fat body and gut tissues. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> also shows internucleosomal DNA fragments, seen as programmed cell death-specific laddering on agarose gel electrophoresis, for the fat body and gut during metamorphosis. The DNA fragmentation by histolysis of larval fat body was observed from day 3, peaked on day 7 in the fifth instar, and dramatically reduced on day 2 in the spinning stage (lower panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In the larval gut, DNA fragmentation initiated on day 1 of the pupal stage and thereafter gradually increased until adult eclosion (lower panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These results suggest that in fat body and gut, <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression was accompanied with DNA fragmentation. In addition, the DNA fragmentation rapidly and severely occurred in larval gut in the pupal stage. The result suggests that the developmental profiles of <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression, as judged by DNA fragmentation, differed between the larval gut, which undergoes programmed cell death during the pupal stage, and larval fat body, which survives into the adult phase but undergoes reorganization during larval-pupal transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>BmCatD is induced by ecdysone and viral infection</title><p>Metamorphosis is regulated by changes in the titer of the steroid hormone ecdysone in the absence of the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In order to determine if <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression is an ecdysone-triggered response, we examined effects of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) on <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA expression using the fat body of the fifth instar larvae. When 20E was injected into day 1 fifth instar larvae, <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA was clearly detected in the fat body on day 2 of the fifth larval instar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-b</xref>), although no <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression was observed in the control during this period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-a</xref>). On the other hand, topical application of JHA reduced <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-c</xref>). These results show that <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression is up-regulated by 20E and down-regulated by JHA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), implicating that these hormonal responses can explain ecdysone-induced expression of <italic>BmCatD </italic>in the fifth larval instar. Especially, 20E administration highly induced programmed cell death of larval fat body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating that the onset of larval fat body histolysis coincides with the expression of <italic>BmCatD</italic>. During insect metamorphosis, pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone direct the destruction of obsolete larval tissues and the replacement of larval tissues and structures with adult forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Day 3 of the fifth larval instar in the silkworm is a critical period for larval growth, and during this period, prothoracic glands begin to secrete detectable ecdysteroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval development triggers pupation, and the ecdysteroid activity induced by another ecdysone pulse again increases dramatically just before pupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The larval silk gland and larval gut begin programmed cell death in response to an increase in ecdysteroid concentration in the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>BmCatD </italic>is expressed exclusively in the larval fat body on day 3 of the fifth instar and in the larval gut on day 1 of the prepupal stage, and suggest that the expression of <italic>BmCatD </italic>is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner by ecdysone fluctuations.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Hormonal and viral regulation of <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA expression.

This raises the possibility that BmCatD may be involved in the induction of metamorphosis of host insects infected with baculovirus. To examine this possibility, we carried out transcriptional induction analysis of <italic>BmCatD </italic>in baculovirus-infected silkworm larvae. When BmNPV was injected into larvae on day 1 of the fifth instar, <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA was detected in the fat body on day 2 of the fifth larval instar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-d</xref>), although no <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression was observed in the controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-a</xref>). Consistent with this, the induced programmed cell death of larval fat body by viral infection was clearly observed on day 2 of the fifth larval instar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Furthermore, the level of <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression was found to be higher in virus-infected larvae than in uninfected controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This result indicates that viral infection induced the <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression, which resulted in the induced programmed cell death in larval fat body, and suggests that <italic>BmCatD </italic>was involved in the induction of metamorphosis in the host insect infected with baculovirus. During virus replication, the prothoracic gland of host insects was observed to maintain characteristics indicative of ecdysone biosynthetic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The haemolymph ecdysteroid level and prothoracic gland activity in baculovirus-infected larvae were higher than in controls, which continued until the late stages of viral infection, even during the time that controls had ceased to secrete ecdysone after molting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, these observations indicate that viral infection resulted in the up-regulation of <italic>BmCatD</italic>, as shown in 20E treatment, and suggest that <italic>BmCatD </italic>up-regulation is the result of alteration of host's hormonal system by viral infection.</p><p>To further understand the correlation between hormonal system and viral infection, we injected larvae on day 1 of the fifth instar with <italic>Bombyx mori </italic>nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) just after JHA treatment, which down-regulates <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression. Interestingly, in both JHA and BmNPV treatments, <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression was up-regulated in a viral infection-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-e</xref>), thus indicating that viral infection plays a role in the regulation of <italic>BmCatD </italic>expression, regardless of the presence or absence of JHA. The host's hormonal system, altered by viral infection, induces metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which suggests that metamorphosis induction due to virus infection functions as a viral defense system of the host insect. In contrast, baculoviruses are known to contain the unique <italic>p35 </italic>gene, which blocks virus-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the inhibition of DNA fragmentation at later stages of viral infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) was likely due to P35 of BmNPV. This result was consistent with previous observations indicating that baculovirus infection blocks the progression of fat body degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of BmCatD function disrupts metamorphic events in the silkworm</title><p>It is known that in the fat body of insects, the lysosomal system is involved in cellular remodeling, which is associated with metamorphosis and termination of egg maturation cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, there has been relatively little research into the substantial functional role of CatD in metamorphosis in insects, especially in <italic>Lepidoptera</italic>. Therefore, we next asked whether BmCatD is functionally involved in the metamorphosis of the silkworm, and whether silkworms have any defects in the <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNA interference (RNAi) process. In order to determine the functional role of BmCatD in silkworms during metamorphosis, we reduced the endogenous <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA levels in the fat body of silkworm larvae by using RNAi, and then confirmed the reduced <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA levels by using Northern blot hybridization. <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA levels in fat body of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi-mediated silkworm larvae were significantly reduced compared to the control silkworm larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To characterize the functional role of BmCatD in silkworm larvae, it is important to obtain silkworm larvae containing little or no <italic>BmCatD</italic>. This approach relies on the degree of <italic>BmCatD </italic>reduction caused by RNAi, as a measure of RNAi function, in order to explore the proposed role of BmCatD in silkworm larvae.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effects of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi on <italic>B. mori </italic>development.

Compared to controls, all of which underwent regular larval-pupal transformation, three-fourths of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi on day 3 fifth instar larvae arrested during larval-pupal metamorphosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In this case, a large portion of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi-mediated silkworm larvae was nonpupated (58.3%) and 16.7% of larvae were abnormally pupated. Similar effects were respectively seen in 55% and 48% of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi on day 4 and 5 fifth instar larvae, and the abnormal pupation rate was relatively high in these cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The arrest of larval-pupal transformation was observed in <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi-mediated silkworm larvae and indicated that BmCatD is necessary for the larval-pupal metamorphosis in the silkworm. It is formally conceivable that BmCatD might have additional functions in other developmental processes, and reduction in BmCatD via RNAi in these processes might directly or indirectly contribute to developmental arrest.</p><p>We next tried to determine whether <italic>BmCatD </italic>could induce DNA laddering in larval gut during pupal development. To provide evidence that BmCatD is involved in programmed cell death of larval gut, we also reduced the endogenous <italic>BmCatD </italic>mRNA levels in the gut of silkworm pupal stage by using RNAi and then examined the pattern of DNA fragmentation in the larval gut. As observed from the Northern blots (lower panels of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), <italic>BmCatD </italic>levels were reduced in the larval gut of <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi-mediated silkworm pupae. Compared to controls, which undergo rapid and severe DNA fragmentation in the larval gut from day 3 of the pupal stage, <italic>BmCatD </italic>RNAi-mediated silkworm pupae exhibited an inhibition of DNA fragmentation in larval gut (upper panels of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). When <italic>BmCatD </italic>dsRNA was injected repeatedly into pupae on day 1 and 5 of the pupal stage, the inhibition of DNA fragmentation in larval gut was more clearly affected. These results indicate that loss of BmCatD causes a defect in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of larval gut, pointing to an important role of BmCatD in programmed cell death of larval gut.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of the larval gut in RNAi-mediated <italic>B. mori </italic>pupae. <italic>BmCatD </italic>dsRNA was injected into pupae on day 1 (B), 5 (C) or both 1 and 5 (D) of the pupal stage, respectively.

Recently, most studies of molecular mechanisms of metamorphosis in silkworm have focused on the metamorphosis-specific transcriptional factor BR-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].
