APC/C-Cdc20 is required for polyubiquitination and degradation of securin and cyclin B at anaphase onset. The spindle assembly checkpoint delays APC/C-Cdc20 activation until all kinetochores attach to mitotic spindles. In this study, we demonstrate that a HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) ubiquitin ligase, Smurf2, is required for the spindle checkpoint. Smurf2 localizes to the centrosome, mitotic midbody, and centromeres. Smurf2 depletion or the expression of a catalytically inactive Smurf2 results in misaligned and lagging chromosomes, premature anaphase onset, and defective cytokinesis. Smurf2 inactivation prevents nocodazole-treated cells from accumulating cyclin B and securin and prometaphase arrest. The silencing of Cdc20 in Smurf2-depleted cells restores mitotic accumulation of cyclin B and securin. Smurf2 depletion results in enhanced polyubiquitination and degradation of Mad2, a critical checkpoint effector. Mad2 is mislocalized in Smurf2-depleted cells, suggesting that Smurf2 regulates the localization and stability of Mad2. These data indicate that Smurf2 is a novel mitotic regulator.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ACA, anticentromere antibody; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; HECT, homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus; MCC, mitotic checkpoint complex.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic progression is controlled by spatiotemporal changes in protein modifications, i.e., phosphorylation mediated by several mitotic kinases and ubiquitination mediated by multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nurse, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gutierrez and Ronai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2007</xref>). The E3 activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is sequentially activated by Cdc20 and Cdh1, plays a central role in coordinating mitotic progression by targeting multiple mitotic regulators to polyubiquitination-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nasmyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters, 2006</xref>). APC/C-Cdc20 is required for degradation of securin and cyclin B at anaphase onset. Securin keeps separase from inducing proteolysis of cohesin, which holds a pair of sister chromatids together during early mitosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint delays APC/C-Cdc20 activation until all chromosomes become aligned at the metaphase plate with proper spindle attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Musacchio and Hardwick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bharadwaj and Yu, 2004</xref>). Perturbation of this checkpoint results in chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. The spindle assembly checkpoint depends on multiprotein complexes including Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3, known as the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). The physical assembly of MCC and its target Cdc20 is regulated according to the status of the spindle&#x02013;kinetochore attachment and tension. Among the MCC components, Mad2 undergoes very dynamic changes in its conformation and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howell et al., 2004</xref>). Current models suggest that unattached kinetochores are associated stably with Mad1 and Bub1, whereas Mad2 in differential conformations dynamically interacts with kinetochore-bound Mad1 and cytoplasmic Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nasmyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu, 2006</xref>), which keeps APC/C-Cdc20 inactive in the presence of unattached or untensed kinetochores.</p><p>Consistent with the key function of Mad2 in the spindle assembly checkpoint, recent studies using transgenic and knockout mouse models suggest that optimal control of Mad2 is critical for genomic stability and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Michel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sotillo et al., 2007</xref>). Mad2 transcription is known to be regulated in E2F- and Myc-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernando et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Menssen et al., 2007</xref>). Although phosphorylation of Mad2 controls the association of Mad2 with Mad1 and APC/C-Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wassmann et al., 2003</xref>), it remains obscure whether Mad2 undergoes other posttranslational regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that a HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) family E3 ubiquitin ligase, Smurf2, plays an essential role in the spindle assembly checkpoint, regulating the stability and localization of Mad2. Smurf2 has been known as a negative regulator of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway, targeting receptors and signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroschein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moren et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that Smurf2 targets TGF-&#x003b2; receptors to proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</xref>). Smurf2 also has been shown to ubiquitinate Smad2, the TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;related transcriptional cofactor SnoN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonni et al., 2001</xref>), the GTPase Rap1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwamborn et al., 2007</xref>), the RING-H2 protein RNF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Subramaniam et al., 2003</xref>), the Runt domain transcription factors Runx2 and Runx3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaneki et al., 2006</xref>), and &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2006</xref>). Although diverse transcriptional control by Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination is well documented, it was unknown that the expression and localization of Smurf2 are cell cycle regulated, and the E3 activity of Smurf2 is critical for the spindle assembly checkpoint. The novel function of Smurf2 suggests that a network of ubiquitination machinery maintains the genomic stability during mitotic progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Smurf2 is required for mitotic control during unperturbed cell cycle progression</title><p>Pub1p, a fission yeast HECT family E3 ligase, regulates G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle progression by ubiquitinating Cdc25p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nefsky and Beach, 1996</xref>). The mammalian HECT family includes Smurf1, Smurf2, AIP4/Itch, and Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kee and Huibregtse, 2007</xref>). Our recent study on the TGF-&#x003b2; regulation of Cdc25A ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray et al., 2005</xref>) led us to examine whether Smurf proteins, which are known to modulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>), were involved in mitotic regulation. We first examined the levels of Smurf2 protein in HeLa cells synchronized by a thymidine-aphidicolin protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). The expression of Smurf2 protein was highest 6&#x02013;8 h after release, which slightly preceded the peaks of cyclin B1 and Cdc25A expression around G<sub>2</sub>/M transition. Smurf1 expression was constant throughout the cell cycle (unpublished data). Thus, Smurf2 is a cell cycle&#x02013;regulated protein that accumulates during late G<sub>2</sub> through early mitosis. We then examined the subcellular localization of Smurf2, which revealed concentrated localization of Smurf2 at centrosomes in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). The specificity of Smurf2 polyclonal antibody used for immunofluorescence microscopy was verified by immunoblotting with Smurf2-depleted cells (Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1</ext-link>). Smurf2 localized at perinuclear centrosomes during interphase as well as at centrosomes aligned bipolarly in metaphase cells, demonstrating colocalization with a centrosomal marker, &#x003b3;-tubulin. Similar centrosomal localization of Smurf2 was observed in HeLa cells using Smurf2 monoclonal antibody and pericentrin antibody, another centrosomal marker, as well as in U2OS cells transfected with Flag-tagged Smurf2 (Fig. S1, b and c). We then examined Smurf2 localization in MCF-10A cells undergoing mitosis and cytokinesis in which the protein exhibited a dynamic relocalization pattern. Smurf2 localized predominantly at centrosomes during metaphase, whereas focal signals for Smurf2 were also observed in noncentrosomal structures in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). During anaphase, a portion of Smurf2 apparently relocalized to the center of the spindle midzone, which is rich in microtubules stained with &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody. During telophase, Smurf2 was found concentrated at the midbody in the intercellular bridge. Similar Smurf2 relocalization during mitosis was observed in HeLa cells (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Smurf2 is a cell cycle&#x02013;regulated protein localizing specifically in the centrosome, mitotic midzone, and midbody.</bold> (a) HeLa cells were synchronized by a double-thymidine protocol.

We designed several siRNAs based on the coding region of human Smurf2 mRNA and tested the silencing efficiencies. Of them, siRNAs &#x00023;1 and &#x00023;4 as well as a pool of four siRNAs showed marked down-regulation of Smurf2 protein in transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Morphological examinations readily detected several multinucleated HeLa cells transfected with Smurf2 siRNA &#x00023;1 but not with control double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, b and c</xref>). Similar multinucleation was observed in cells transfected with siRNA &#x00023;4 or the pooled anti-Smurf2 siRNAs, whereas other siRNAs with poor knockdown efficiencies had no effect on nuclear morphology. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that most control HeLa cells initiated cytokinesis shortly after metaphase and did not revert from cytokinesis during 5 h of monitoring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 e</xref> and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, a majority of Smurf2 siRNA-transfected cells did not display well-defined cytokinesis after mitotic rounding up (time 0). Although formation of the cleavage furrow was observed, &#x0223c;84% of cells with Smurf2 depletion failed cytokinesis, leading to a binucleated state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 d</xref>). Similar multinucleation phenotypes were observed in U2OS and MCF-10A cells with Smurf2 depletion (unpublished data). Thus, Smurf2 is required for successful cytokinesis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Smurf2 silencing inhibits mitotic progression and cytokinesis.</bold> (a) Smurf2 levels determined by immunoblotting in HeLa cells (top) and U2OS cells (bottom) 48 h after transfection with anti&#x02013;Smurf2 siRNA (siSm2) or nonspecific dsRNA (siNS).

We first examined the morphology of mitotic control and Smurf2-depleted HeLa cells during mitosis by staining for the microtubule marker &#x003b1;-tubulin, Smurf2, and chromosomal DNA (Fig. S2 b, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1</ext-link>). Of a total of &#x0003e;600 cells examined per group, 7.3% and 8.0% in control and Smurf2-depleted cells, respectively, displayed characteristics of mitosis (i.e., chromatin condensation and formation of mitotic spindles). Although 4.7% of control cells were found to be in metaphase, only 1.9% of Smurf2-depleted cells exhibited typical metaphase morphology with aligned chromosomes. The decrease in the metaphase population suggested that Smurf2 depletion might affect mitotic progression. To further assess the impact of Smurf2 depletion on chromosomal dynamics during mitotic progression, we depleted Smurf2 in HeLa cells stably expressing a GFP&#x02013;histone H2B fusion protein (GFP-H2B). Cells were then monitored for chromosome movement by time-lapse microscopy, which readily showed that Smurf2-depleted cells initiated anaphase in the presence of misaligned chromosomes. Over 75% of Smurf2-depleted cells exhibited misaligned chromosomes or failed to form a metaphase plate during monitored metaphase&#x02013;anaphase transition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>; and Video 2). During anaphase, most Smurf2-depleted cells showed defective segregation such as lagging chromosomes or no appreciable chromosome segregation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>). In contrast, &#x0003c;10% of control cells exhibited such defects during mitosis. We also measured the interval between nuclear envelope breakdown and the onset of anaphase, focusing on cells that displayed discernable elements of chromatin segregation. In control cultures, the median interval was &#x0223c;55 min, whereas that in Smurf2-depleted cultures was &#x0223c;23 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, e and f</xref>; and Video 3). These data indicate that Smurf2 depletion leads to premature anaphase onset together with chromosomal alignment and segregation defects. Thus, Smurf2 seems to play a significant role in the temporal control of the metaphase&#x02013;anaphase transition, a process normally regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Smurf2 silencing leads to chromosomal misalignment at metaphase and premature onset of anaphase with defective chromosome segregation.</bold> HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-H2B were transfected with Smurf2 siRNA &#x00023;1, and chromosomal movement was monitored 24&#x02013;25 h after transfection by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy.

To examine whether Smurf2 is involved in the checkpoint, cells progressing synchronously through G<sub>2</sub> toward M were treated with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. For examinations of Smurf2 localization, cells were fixed as they progressed into prometaphase arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Interestingly, Smurf2 localized in a focal fashion and was closely associated with the immunoreactivities against human anticentromere antibodies (ACAs), which recognize several centromere proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Earnshaw et al., 1986</xref>). The localization of Smurf2 at centromeres was observed only transiently in cells undergoing nocodazole-induced arrest at prometaphase. This localization pattern is consistent with a putative role for Smurf2 in the spindle assembly checkpoint. We then determined cellular levels of mitosis regulatory proteins in Smurf2-depleted and control cells synchronously progressing into mitosis in the presence of nocodazole (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Cellular levels of Smurf2 and the APC/C-Cdc20 substrates securin, cyclin B1, and aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fang et al., 1999</xref>) accumulated as control cells progressed through the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition 8&#x02013;10 h after release from the thymidine block. Cyclin A2 was markedly down-regulated during nocodazole-induced prometaphase arrest as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fry and Yamano, 2006</xref>). Strikingly, securin, cyclin B1, and aurora B failed to accumulate in Smurf2-depleted cells. In contrast, Smurf2 depletion affected minimally or only modestly the levels of Emi1, cyclin A2, and the APC/C-Cdh1 substrates Plk1 and Cdc20. These proteins are not direct targets of APC/C-Cdc20, whereas cyclin B1, securin, and aurora B are well-characterized substrates. These data suggest that Smurf2 depletion results in premature activation of APC/C-Cdc20. Flow cytometry further demonstrated that control cells were arrested with 4N DNA content 14 h after release from the thymidine block, whereas 17% of Smurf2-depleted cells had 8N DNA, which is consistent with binucleation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>). 26 h after release, 63% of Smurf2-depleted cells exhibited 8N DNA. These data suggest that Smurf2 depletion resulted in continued cell cycle progression in the presence of nocodazole without successful cytokinesis. To confirm that Smurf2 depletion permitted inappropriate APC/C-Cdc20 activity in the presence of nocodazole, we attempted to silence Cdc20 in Smurf2-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 d</xref>). siRNA-mediated codepletion of Cdc20 and Smurf2 resulted in restored mitotic accumulation of cyclin B1 and securin (but not Mad2; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 d</xref>, fourth row) in synchronized cultures of nocodazole-treated HeLa cells. Aurora B is also up-regulated modestly by the codepletion. Importantly, the addition of Cdc20 siRNA did not significantly affect the silencing efficacy of the Smurf2 siRNA or the levels of cyclin A2 and Plk1. These data suggest that Smurf2 is required for the spindle assembly checkpoint&#x02013;mediated inhibition of APC/C-Cdc20 and mitotic accumulation of securin and cyclin B1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Smurf2 is a novel regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint.</bold> (a) Smurf2 localizes at centromeres when the spindle checkpoint is active.

Cells lacking Mad2 demonstrate a severely compromised spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michel et al., 2004</xref>). Immunoblotting demonstrated that Mad2 was markedly down-regulated in Smurf2-depleted cells, whereas Mad2 levels were relatively constant during cell cycle progression of control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, b and d</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy also confirmed that no specific localization of Mad2 was detected at centromeres of Smurf2-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 e</xref>), whereas localization of BubR1 at centromeres was unaffected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 f</xref>). Moreover, Smurf2 depletion down-regulated not only endogenous Mad2 but also transfected Mad2 in asynchronous HeLa cells (Fig. S3 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1</ext-link>). Mad2 down-regulation by Smurf2 depletion was confirmed in U2OS cells using Smurf2 siRNA &#x00023;1 and &#x00023;4 as well as pooled siRNAs (Fig. S3 b), suggesting that this is not an off-target effect of siRNAs. We then examined whether Smurf2 siRNA affected Mad2 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>). Despite the rapid decline of Mad2 protein levels, Mad2 mRNA levels were essentially unaltered in Smurf2-depleted cells, indicating a posttranscriptional mechanism. We suspected that Mad2 levels may be determined by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, like many other cell cycle regulators. To examine whether Mad2 is ubiquitinated, Mad2 was immunoprecipitated from Smurf2-depleted or control HeLa cells treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 b</xref>). Smurf2 depletion robustly increased polyubiquitinated forms of Mad2, and proteasomal inhibition by MG132 further accumulated polyubiquitinated Mad2. We also found that Smurf2 physically associates with Mad2. Endogenous Smurf2 and Mad2 coimmunoprecipitated with each other from extracts of untransfected HeLa cells that progressed from S phase into mitosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 c</xref>, and see Fig. S4 for controls). These data suggest that Smurf2 normally protects Mad2 from polyubiquitination-dependent degradation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Smurf2 is required for stability and functional localization of Mad2.</bold> (a) Smurf2 silencing rapidly down-regulates Mad2 protein but not mRNA.

Transfection of a Mad2 expression plasmid resulted in marked overexpression of Mad2 in cells without Smurf2 depletion, which did not significantly affect the expression of securin, cyclin B1, or other mitotic regulators during synchronous progression into nocodazole-induced arrest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 d</xref>). In Smurf2-depleted cells, transfection of Mad2 resulted in accumulation of Mad2 to levels comparable with mock-transfected control cells. However, these cells exhibited almost undetectable levels of securin and cyclin B1, indicating that ectopic expression of Mad2 was insufficient to restore the checkpoint. Cyclin A2, which is known to be degraded even during spindle assembly checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fry and Yamano, 2006</xref>), was nearly undetectable in nocodazole-treated cells of all cohorts. Apparently, the lack of phenotypic rescue was associated with mislocalization of exogenously expressed Mad2 because most Mad2 immunoreactivities of nocodazole-treated cells did not colocalize with the signals from ACAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 e</xref>). The mean intensity of Mad2 signals normalized by ACA signals in a cell expressing exogenous Mad2 in the presence of siSmurf2 was 74% lower than that in a cell expressing exogenous Mad2 in the presence of siNS (3.208 &#x000b1; 0.217 vs. 0.823 &#x000b1; 0.068, mean &#x000b1; SEM, from centromeres examined in eight cells per group). These data suggest that Smurf2 may regulate not only the stability but also the localization of Mad2.</p><p>We next examined whether the E3 ligase activity of Smurf2 is important for its function to control the spindle assembly checkpoint. The cysteine-716 residue of Smurf2 is critical for its E3 ligase activity because Smurf2(C716A) protein is catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression plasmid for Smurf2(C716A) and synchronized them at early S phase with double-thymidine treatments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>). Cells were then released into a nocodazole-containing medium. Immunoblotting showed that cells transfected with Smurf2(C716A) failed to accumulate securin with significant reduction in Mad2 levels. Interestingly, cyclin B1 accumulation during G<sub>2</sub>/M progression was minimally affected, which is analogous to previous observations in <italic>Mad2</italic> heterozygous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michel et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, transfection with wild-type Smurf2 affected none of these proteins (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801049/DC1</ext-link>). This finding is consistent with the effects of Smurf2 siRNA, suggesting that Smurf2(C716A) can act as a dominant-negative mutant. Furthermore, cells transfected with Smurf2(C716A) showed a significant increase in cells displaying misaligned chromosomes, lagging chromosomes during mitotic exit, and multinucleation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, b and c</xref>). These data suggest that the E3 ligase activity of Smurf2 is required for proper control of the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of a catalytically inactive Smurf2 impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint with Mad2 destabilization.</bold> (a) Immunoblotting for mitotic regulators in HeLa cells transfected with Flag-tagged Smurf2(C716A) or a control plasmid.

During unperturbed mitotic progression, Smurf2 dynamically relocalizes from the centrosome to the center of the anaphase spindle midzone and finally to the midbody in the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis. Smurf2 is also observed at unattached centromeres during spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Smurf2 depletion impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint, leading to increased misalignment and missegregation of chromosomes, premature anaphase onset, and defective cytokinesis. The function of Smurf2 in the spindle assembly checkpoint is mediated at least partly by the stability and localization of Mad2 because Smurf2 depletion results in enhanced polyubiquitination and rapid destabilization of Mad2 protein. Mad2 destabilization presumably leads to premature activation of APC/C-Cdc20, which is associated with impaired mitotic accumulation of the APC/C-Cdc20 substrates such as cyclin B1 and securin. The silencing of Cdc20 in Smurf2-depleted cells restores mitotic accumulation of these proteins, confirming the antagonistic function of Smurf2 against APC/C-Cdc20 activity. Ectopic expression of Mad2 is insufficient to restore the spindle assembly checkpoint in Smurf2-depleted cells, apparently because Mad2 mislocalizes in the absence of Smurf2. Collectively, Smurf2 is a novel regulator of the Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><p>Mad2 interaction with kinetochore-associated checkpoint proteins, such as Mad1 and Bub1, is required for the inhibition of APC/C-Cdc20 until the proper alignment of all mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nasmyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu, 2006</xref>). Mad2, together with BubR1 and Bub3, exhibits rapid movement on and off kinetochores, transiently interacting with Mad1- and Bub1-associated centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howell et al., 2004</xref>). This dynamic regulation of Mad2 is critical for the diffusible inhibitory signal against cytoplasmic APC/C-Cdc20. This study presents evidence that Smurf2 activity is required for the normal progression of mitosis as well as for spindle disruption&#x02013;mediated mitotic arrest. Similarly, cells with Mad2 or BubR1 depletion show various mitotic defects (i.e., failure in chromosome segregation, premature anaphase onset, and cytokinesis defects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gorbsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>). Analogous phenotypes have been observed in cells with depletion of USP44, a deubiquitinating enzyme that counteracts disassembly of Mad2&#x02013;Cdc20 complexes by removing ubiquitin from Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stegmeier et al., 2007</xref>). The binding of Mad2 to Cdc20 requires a substantial conformational change of Mad2, which Mad1 seems to facilitate at the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu, 2006</xref>). Although it remains to be elucidated how Smurf2 regulates the stability and localization of Mad2, it is tempting to speculate that the E3 ligase activity of Smurf2 is involved in regulating Mad2 conformation. Smurf2 levels are highest before the metaphase&#x02013;anaphase transition, when Smurf2 localizes predominantly at spindle poles/centrosomes. Mad2 also has been found at spindle poles before anaphase onset, possibly via microtubule-mediated transit between kinetochores and spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Howell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2004</xref>). Depletion of Mad2 and BubR1 results in kinetochore-independent premature anaphase onset, whereas knockdown of other spindle checkpoint components (e.g., Bub3 and Bub1) impairs only kinetochore-dependent checkpoint function, not the timing of anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>). Our data demonstrating premature anaphase onset in Smurf2-depleted cells support a hypothesis that a functional interaction of Smurf2 and Mad2 that occurs dynamically between spindle poles/centrosome and kinetochores may control the spindle assembly checkpoint. Of course, it is possible that Smurf2 plays multiple roles in mitosis and cytokinesis by affecting multiple downstream targets in addition to Mad2. A previous study showed that Smad2, 3, and 4 bind to microtubules in the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;, colocalizing with tubulin at the bipolar spindle and midzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dong et al., 2000</xref>). These Smad proteins can function as a cofactor of multiple E3 ligases, including SCF (skp1-Cul1-F-box), APC/C, and Smurf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ogunjimi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the cofactor Smad protein might complex with Smurf2 alongside microtubules and modulate Smurf2 activity.</p><p>Regulation upstream of the spindle checkpoint components has been understudied. The transcriptional control of Mad2 by E2F and Myc was recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernando et al., 2004</xref>); however, it had been unknown whether cellular levels of Mad2 protein are regulated by ubiquitination. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that Mad2 undergoes polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The experiments using Smurf2 siRNA and Smurf2(C716A) showed that the E3 ligase activity of Smurf2 is required to prevent Mad2 from polyubiquitination and degradation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Smurf2 physically associates with Mad2. Although Smurf2 is likely to affect the modification and/or conformation of Mad2 at close proximity, the precise mechanism remains to be determined. A hypothetical mechanism is that Smurf2 directly modifies Mad2 by monoubiquitination or Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haglund and Dikic, 2005</xref>), and such a modification somehow alters the conformation of Mad2 to a stable form and promotes its dynamic localization at kinetochores critical for surveillance of spindle integrity. For instance, the chromatin passenger complex protein survivin undergoes Lys63 polyubiquitination, which is required for centromere localization of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vong et al., 2005</xref>). When the level of active Smurf2 is low, Mad2 undergoes an alternative form of ubiquitination, presumably Lys48-linked polyubiquitination mediated by an undefined E3 ligase, and is recruited to proteasomal degradation. Another possibility is that Smurf2 plays an indirect role in the control of Mad2 stability. Smurf2 may antagonize the action of an unidentified E3 ligase required for proteasomal degradation of Mad2, possibly by ubiquitinating and destabilizing the E3 ligase. In this case, Smurf2 depletion would up-regulate the E3 ligase by stabilization, leading to enhanced Mad2 polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Further biochemical investigations are needed to evaluate these hypotheses regarding the Mad2 regulatory function of Smurf2.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Putative roles of Smurf2 in regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830267f07"></graphic></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Monoclonal antibody against human Smurf2 has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>).
