A database search for proteins resembling these three factors revealed high similarities to two amino acid sequences deduced from unassigned genomic reading frames in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The amino acid sequence derived from the Bacillus reading frame is 47% identical to E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium RF-2, strongly suggesting that it represents B.subtilis RF-2. Our comparison suggests that the expression of the B.subtilis gene is, like that of the E.coli and S. typhimurium RF-2 genes, autoregulated by a stop codon dependent +1 frameshift. A comparison of prokaryotic and mitochondrial release factor sequences, including the putative B.subtilis RF-2, leads us to propose a five-domain model for release factor structure. Possible functions of the various domains are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4423"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4424"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4425"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4426"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4428"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
