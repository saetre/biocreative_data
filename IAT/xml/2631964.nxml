However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling FGFR2 expression remain poorly understood. Here we have identified a role for the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) in constitutive activation of FGFR2. A unique DNase I hypersensitive site was detected in the region encompassing nucleotides -270 to +230 after scanning a large range covering 33.3 kilobases around the transcription start site of FGFR2. Using a PCR-based chromatin accessibility assay, an open chromatin conformation was detected around the proximal 5&#x02032; fragment of FGFR2 gene. Deletion constructs of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of FGFR2 were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. After transient transfection in C3H10T1/2, ME3T3-E1, and C2C12 as well as primary osteoblasts, a minimal region -86/+139 that is highly homologous to the human sequence and bears a CCAAT box was identified as the core promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the CCAAT box was the binding site for NF-Y. Deletion of NF-Y consensus sequence resulted in the total loss of NF-Y promoter activity. Overexpression of NF-Y protein and transfection of NF-Y small interfering RNAs in the cells substantially changed the promoter activity. Moreover, NF-Y small interfering RNAs greatly inhibited the endogenous FGFR2 transcription level and the chromatin accessibility and H3 acetylation across the promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrate that interaction of NF-Y at the CCAAT box is pivotal to FGFR2 gene transcription partly through the construction of a local open chromatin configuration across the promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The work was supported by 211 project, <grant-sponsor>National Natural Science Foundation of China</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>30400270</grant-num>, <grant-sponsor>National 973 program</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>2001CB510106</grant-num>, and <grant-sponsor>Science and Technology program of Guangzhou</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>2006Z1-E0031</grant-num>.

Human and mouse genetic studies have established that FGF signaling also plays an essential role in skeletal development. FGF2 is produced by osteoblasts and stored in a bioactive form in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), where it acts as a local regulator of bone formation.</p><p>The FGF family of molecules transduces signals to the cytoplasm via a family of transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Four distinct gene products encode highly homologous FGF receptors (FGFRs 1-4). FGFR2 is expressed in mesenchymal cells during condensation of mesenchyme before deposition of bone matrix at early stages of long bone development and is also expressed in the cranial suture. Later in development and in the postnatal life, FGFR2 is found in preosteoblasts and osteoblasts together with FGFR3. It was found that the recessive phenotype of FGFR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice is characterized initially by decreased expression of Cbfa1/Runx2 and retarded long bone ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2 were found to induce changes in osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and survival in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). In human osteoblasts it was found that single missense point mutations (S252W and P253R) of FGFR2 activate the expression of early and late osteoblast differentiation genes, including alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen (COLIA1), and osteocalcin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), a phenotype that is mediated in part through protein kinase C activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). These suggest that FGFR2 is a positive regulator of ossification.</p><p>NF-Y is a heterotrimeric transcriptional activator composed of three subunits (NF-YA, -B, and -C), which complexes with CCAAT box sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). NF-Y subunit sequences are highly conserved among eukaryotes, and both NF-YB and NF-YC contain conserved putative histone fold motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), showing most similarity to histones H2B and H2A. Thus, NF-Y subunits are capable of participating in formation of the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Studies from several laboratories have suggested that NF-Y functionally and physically interacts with other transcription factors or nuclear proteins both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). NF-YB and NF-YC have been demonstrated to interact with TATA-binding protein (TBP) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), and NF-Y may, therefore, serve a structural role by recruiting TBP and/or TAFIIs to connect upstream activators with the general polymerase II transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The interaction between NF-Y and GCN5 results in the modulation of NF-Y transactivation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Chromatin structure plays a vital role in transcriptional regulation by restricting the access of transcription-associated proteins to promoters, and it is likely that the interaction of NF-Y with histones and with other coregulators of transcription performs a critical and central function in the organization of core promoter activation.</p><p>Despite the extensive studies reviewed above, transcription factors that interact with the FGFR2 proximal promoter region have yet to be identified and functionally characterized. The aim of the present study was to define the functional cis-acting DNA elements responsible for basal activity of the FGFR2 core promoter in mouse osteoblast-like cell lines and thereby provide a basic model to aid future studies of FGFR2 promoter regulation. We find that one CCAAT box within the mouse FGFR2 proximal promoter region can specifically bind NF-Y transcription factors and that mutation or deletion of these sites diminishes FGFR2 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated the <italic>in vivo</italic> occupancy of the FGFR2 promoter by NF-Y transcription factor. We also showed that overexpression of NF-Y proteins results in the activation FGFR2 promoter, and knock down of NF-Y expression level leads to down-regulation of FGFR2 mRNA level and inhibition of FGFR2 transcriptional activity. Moreover, NF-Y is able to &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; and maintain the local chromatin structure across the FGFR2 promoter. We also demonstrated that NF-Y affected the effects of BMP-2 on FGFR2 expression and even the osteogenesis through controlling the basal expression of FGFR2.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials and Cell Culture</italic>&#x02014;Antibodies against NF-YA, -B, and -C were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

PCR was performed using sets of oligonucleotide primers specific for the mouse FGFR2 gene sequence, of which the forward primer was KpnI-site-linked, and the reverse primer was XhoI-site-linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). C3H10T1/2 genomic DNA was used to generate the pGL3/01 (-758/+139) construct, which was used as the template for the other constructs. These PCR products were digested with KpnI and Xho and subcloned into the KpnII/XhoI sites of the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega). Substitution mutation constructs were generated by the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara) using the pGL3/06 plasmid as template. For eight-base substitutions, we introduced the nonspecific sequence ATGCATGC into the substitution sites and ATGCAT for 6-base substitutions. For pGL3/07 (-48/+109), pGL3/08 (+2/+139), and pGL3/09 (+102/+139), Erase-a-base kit (Promega) was used to generate the mutant constructs.

Compared with the other often used methods, such as primer extension, nuclease protection assays, and classic 5&#x02032;-RACE, 5&#x02032;-RLM-RACE is more sensitive, and cDNA can be amplified only from full-length capped mRNA. In our study, total RNA from C3H10T1/2 cells was extracted for mapping the transcription start site. Using the GC-Rich PCR system and nested primers, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, the transcription start site of FGFR2 in C3H10T1/2 cells is 17 nucleotides upstream from the beginning of the keratin growth factor receptor cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) or 37 nucleotides upstream from the reported bek cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>Open Chromatin Structure around the Transcription Start Site</italic>&#x02014;It is generally accepted that local chromatin structure affects gene transcription. We used the DNase I hypersensitivity site to reveal regions of open chromatin around the FGFR2 gene into three osteoblast-like cell lines, including C3H10T1/2 (a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line), MC3T3-E1 (an osteoblast cell line), C2C12 (a myoblast cell line), and primary mouse osteoblasts (OB), all of which express the endogenous FGFR2 gene and may be induced to differentiate into mature osteoblasts. The genomic fragments between -27091 bp and +6230 bp (relative to the transcription start site) were analyzed. The results showed the appearance of two bands by Southern blot. The band of 33.3 kb represents the original EcoRV-EcoRV restriction fragment of FGFR2, and the lower band represents a single DNase I hypersensitive site that was estimated to be about 6.3 kb upstream of the EcoRV site at +6230 bp, adjacent to the transcription start site of FGFR2 promoter, located at the -270/+230 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). This result suggests that this DNase I hypersensitive site is associated with the basal transcription of FGFR2 in osteoblast-like cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional analysis of mouse FGFR2 promoter in C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, C2C12, and primary OB.</bold><italic>A</italic>, a panel of 5&#x02032; terminal deletion-luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into the cell lines.

CHART-PCR evaluates the accessibility of genomic DNA to nuclease (such as DNase I, restriction enzyme, or micrococcal nuclease) by comparing the quantity of intact DNA from a nuclease-treated sample to that of an untreated sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Chromatin recovered from both DNase I-treated and untreated cells was quantitated by real-time PCR. In addition to the region between nucleotides -270 and +230, another two representative regions were also included in CHART-PCR analysis: nucleotides -1892 to -2028 is a distal region upstream the transcription start site and nucleotides +4256 to +4393 is a fragment in the open reading frame. Thus, we were able to evaluate the nuclease accessibility of FGFR2 gene from 5&#x02032; distal region to the open reading frame (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>Nuclease accessibility is expressed as the percent protection level that is calculated as the amount of DNA recovered from the digested cells relative to the undigested cells and inversely proportional to the protection level. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>, DNase I digested all regions of the gene in C3H10T1/2, with the protection levels ranging from 20% to 83% compared with undigested samples. The region spanning the proximal promoter (covered by primer sets P2, P3, and P4) was more sensitive to DNase I digestion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>); particularly, the P3-covered region (-143 to +45) exhibited the lowest protection level of about 20%. In comparison, higher levels of protection against DNase I digestion were seen at the +4256 to +4393 region and the -1892 to -2028 region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Thus, DNase I accessibility is limited to the proximal promoter region (especially to the region of -143 to +45) and correlates closely with the results of DNase I hypersensitivity assays.</p><p><italic>Deletion Analysis of the FGFR2 Promoter</italic>&#x02014;To examine the transcriptional activity of the sequences at the 5&#x02032; end of the FGFR2 gene, various fragments of the proximal sequence were cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. A 5&#x02032; deletion series with a fixed 3&#x02032; end at the +139 position (relative to transcription start site) we generated through PCR amplification from genomic DNA of C3H10T1/2 cells. The constructs were transfected into C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, C2C12, and primary OB. Although there were probably repressing activities between nucleotides -86 and -215, all the deletion constructs (containing -86/+139 fragment) tested were capable of inducing a significant increase in luciferase activity compared with that of a promoter-less vector (pGL3-Basic) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This observation suggests that the most proximal 225 nucleotide of the FGFR2 gene is capable of initiating transcription. To confirm the role of the sequence between -86 and +139 (the proposed core promoter), a 3&#x02032; terminal deletion without this sequence was tested for promoter function in the cell lines. The results showed that when the proximal sequences are deleted, promoter activity was reduced to background levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Identical results were obtained with all the cell lines. These results demonstrate that the sequences between -86 and +139 are necessary for transcriptional initiation.</p><p>To define potential cis-acting regulatory elements, we undertook a comparative analysis of the -86/+139 region between mouse and human genes. Alignment of the mouse fragment with the corresponding fragment from the human FGFR2 gene revealed striking similarities (82%). No apparent TATA box could be identified upstream of the transcription initiation site, but both promoters are highly GC-rich (mouse, 72%; human, 75%). A search for transcription factor binding sites using an online software (MatInspector) revealed two putative Sp1/Sp3 and one NF-Y potential binding sites that are similar in relative position and sequence in both species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutational analysis of the mouse FGFR2 core promoter (</bold>-<bold>86/</bold>+<bold>139).</bold><italic>A</italic>, the schematic structures of the reporter constructs are shown on the <italic>left</italic>.

Because this DNA fragment is highly GC-rich and difficult for PCR reaction, we used Erase-a-base technique (Promega) instead of PCR amplification to produce three new deletion clones, denominated pGL3/07, pGL3/08, and pGL3/09. Deletion of nucleotides -86 to -48 (containing the NF-Y binding site) reduced luciferase activity to about 20%. Further deletions to nucleotide +2 (a fragment containing the SP1A binding site) inhibited the reporter activity further. Fragment +2 to +139 (containing the other SP1B binding site) and (+102/+139) lost all of the transcription activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results suggest that binding of NF-Y transcription factors to FGFR2 proximal promoter may be responsible for most of the transcriptional activity of the promoter. To further test the possible NF-Y binding, we have generated a series of 8-base pair mutations between nucleotides -86 and -48 within pGL3/06 (-86/+139) construct through a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis technique (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Particularly, the mutation in pLUC3/06M2 which disrupts the NF-Y binding site reduced promoter activity by more than 90%. No significant changes in promoter activity had been observed in other mutant constructs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Characterization of NF-Y Transcription Factors Binding to the FGFR2 Promoter Region in Vitro</italic>&#x02014;To test DNA-protein interactions in the promoter region, we performed EMSA using the DNA sequence from -86 to -60 bearing the CCAAT box. One strong DNA-protein complex (BS1) and a weak fastmigrating complex (BS2) were detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). To determine whether the putative NF-Y binding site is involved in the formation of these complexes, a 10-, 50-, and 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to -86 to -60 sequence was used to compete with the complexes. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, the competitor competed away the complexes possibly by sequestering the available transcription factors present in the nuclear extract. These data indicate that the CCAAT box have protein binding capacity. In contrast, the unlabeled mutated oligonucleotide bearing the disrupted CCAAT box was unable to compete for protein binding capacity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To test if NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC are involved in the formation of the protein-DNA complexes detected in the EMSA, we performed supershift assays by using the polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-YA, -NF-YB, and -NF-YC antibodies. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, both the major complex BS1 and BS2 were inhibited by all the three antibodies in nuclear extracts from C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, C2C12, and primary OB. Particularly, treatment of NF-YB antibody almost completely disrupted the major DNA-protein complex band. Preimmune rabbit IgG did not cause a shift or loss of the complexes, demonstrating the specificity of the super-shift assays. These results suggest that NF-Y can specifically interact with the wild-type -86 to -60 sequence probe.</p><p><italic>Association of NF-Y with the FGFR2 Promoter in Vivo</italic>&#x02014;We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to examine whether NF-Y interacts with the FGFR2 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, both anti-NF-YA and anti-NF-YB antibodies specifically enriched the region containing the FGFR2 proximal promoter. To confirm the specificity of the DNA binding activity of the factors at the FGFR2 promoter, PCR amplifications of the FGFR2 coding sequence, which has no binding sites for any of the regulators tested, were included in parallel experiments as negative controls. The results of ChIP experiments performed with these antibodies indicate that the basal transcription of FGFR2 in living cells involves recruitment of NF-Y to its promoter.

These results suggest that NF-Y transcription factors are sufficient to activate the FGFR2 promoter through interaction with the CCAAT box.</p><p>We next investigated the necessity of NF-Y in basal FGFR2 transcription. To address this, we inhibited NF-YA and NF-YB expression using siRNA. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with NF-YA- or NF-YB-targeted siRNAs and a scramble siRNA as control.

Moreover, hyperacetylation of histones is associated with increased physical accessibility of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Because inhibition of NF-Y expression may result in a more closed chromatin configuration at the FGFR2 locus, we postulated that the histone acetylation level may also be decreased. ChIP assays were performed with the same primer sets as those used in CHART-PCR. Using antibodies specific for diacetylated H3 (K9 and K14) revealed a pattern of local acetylation at the proximal promoter region and 5&#x02032; region of the coding sequence. In both instances acetylation is more pronounced at the promoter region. On the other hand, DNA fragments at the distal region failed to be enriched in the precipitation, indicating that H3 acetylation of FGFR2 gene is localized to actively transcribed regions. Treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with 20 n<sc>m</sc> NF-YA or NF-YB siRNA for 48 h reduced the H3 acetylation level remarkably at both the proximal promoter and 5&#x02032; coding sequence regions. At the -143 to +45 region, H3 acetylation was inhibited to 42 and 38% after NF-YA and NF-YB siRNAs treatment, respectively. Interestingly, knockdown of NF-Y proteins resulted in the inhibition of H3 acetylation by about 30% at the 5&#x02032; coding sequence region that is 4 kb downstream the CCAAT box, suggesting that NF-Y proteins may serve to control the histone modification in a long range across the FGFR2 gene.</p><p><italic>Overexpression of FGFR2 Promotes BMP-2-induced Osteogenesis</italic>&#x02014;BMPs are the only signaling molecules that can singly induce <italic>de novo</italic> bone formation at orthotopic and heterotopic sites. To provide evidence for the functional role of FGFR2 in BMP-2-induced osteogenesis, we introduced the gene constructs for the fusion proteins of FGFR2-FLAG into C3H10T1/2 cells. After stable transfection into C3H10T1/2, three clones (C1-C3) were selected as determined by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Additionally, stable transfection of the dominant negative form of FGFR2 and dominant negative FGFR2-FLAG (clones dC1-dC3), which contains only the extracellular fragment of the protein and was secreted into culture medium as soluble FGFR2, slightly inhibited mineralization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, FGFR-2 expression was dose- and time-dependently up-regulated upon BMP-2 exposure. The similar results had been observed with C2C12, MC3T3-E1, and primary OB (supplemental Fig. 2). Unfortunately, we failed to identify the BMP-2-responsive element on FGFR2 promoter after searching a long range of 33.3 kb around the transcription start site by DNase I hypersensitivity assays using the probe as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref> (data not shown).

To our knowledge, these data provide the first demonstration that the functional FGFR2 core promoter is composed of a CCAAT box. We show that in this core promoter (i) NF-Y binding at the CCAAT box is crucial for FGFR2 promoter activity, (ii) the two putative Sp1 boxes adjacent to the CCAAT box have no obvious activity, and (iii) NF-Y binding may result in an open chromatin configuration associated with local histone acetylation. Therefore, the present study delineates the fundamental elements of a core promoter structure that will be helpful for future studies on the differential regulation of FGFR2 expression in osteoblast.</p><p>NF-Y is an ubiquitous transcription factor that activates the basal transcriptional activity of various promoters through CCAAT boxes. More than 25% of eukaryotic promoters contain CCAAT boxes, in most cases within 100 bp from the transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). NF-Y may create a core promoter architecture that is suitable for assembly of a preinitiation complex. In a previous study, Duan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) have shown that a CCAAT box is required for the formation of the transcription initiation complex containing RNAP II, TATA-binding protein, and TFII B. In our study overexpression of NF-Y subunits could activate the FGFR2 promoter, and knockdown of NF-Y expression resulted in an inhibition of the promoter activation as well as endogenous FGFR2 transcription level. Therefore, we show directly that NF-Y is crucial for FGFR2 promoter activity in osteoblast-like cells.</p><p>The promoter of the FGFR2 gene resides in a CpG island that lacks the classical TATA box motifs found in many eukaryotic promoters. Sequence analysis of the FGFR2 promoter revealed two putative Sp1 binding sites (GC boxes) within a 50-bp DNA fragment, designated Sp1A and Sp1B. The positioning of the basal transcriptional machinery in a TATA-less promoter can occur independent of InR sequences when Sp1 binding sites are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). In such instances Sp1 is capable of stabilizing transcriptional initiation complexes downstream. In this report localization of the start site of transcription was achieved through 5&#x02032;-RLM-RACE, and it was shown that transcriptional initiation occurs between the two putative Sp1 binding sites. Our start site is localized to the same position as that previously described by Skorecki and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), strongly suggesting that the two Sp1 binding sites could facilitate organization of the transcription initiation complex. In fact, as revealed by luciferase reporter assays, pGL3/07 (containing both the Sp1 binding sites) gave to an average of 2-fold activation of luciferase activity in all the three cell lines compared with the control pGL3/basic vector. In contrast, pGL3/08 (containing only the Sp1B binding site) exhibited no significant difference in transcription activity compared with the control vector (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These results suggested that Sp1A may serve as another crucial transcriptional activator in addition to NF-Y. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding studies (EMSA) using the -48 to +2 fragment as the labeled probe demonstrated no apparent DNA-protein complexes (data not shown). Anti-Sp1/Sp3 antibodies also failed to enrich the DNA fragment in the precipitates as demonstrated by ChIP assays (data not shown). Because Sp1 and NF-Y have been shown to coordinately regulate many gene promoters and to physically interact with each other and with TATA-binding protein as well as general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that coordination of the factors binding to Sp1 sites and the CCAAT box constitute the FGFR2 core transcription machinery. Therefore, we created the combinational mutation constructs in which double or multiple site-directed mutation of the CCAAT box, Sp1A, and Sp1B binding sites were introduced into the reporter vector. But the data revealed no significant coordination among the three binding sites (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out that the contribution of Sp1A and Sp1B may vary in different cellular contexts. Finally, it should be noted that other binding sites for transcription factors not yet identified may regulate FGFR2 promoter function through the -48/+2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) promoter fragment. A detailed mutation scanning analysis will be needed to identify such sites.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>NF-Y is important for BMP-2-induced FGFR2 expression.</bold><italic>A</italic>, FGFR2, dnFGFR2 (dominant negative form) expressing vectors and pcDNA3.1 were stably transfected into C3H10T1/2.

It is generally accepted that chromatin structure serves as an important means to control gene expression. An open chromatin configuration, which is more accessible to transcription factors and general transcription apparatus, is necessary for substantial activation of gene transcription. Here, we present the first evidence that binding by NF-Y may produce a more open chromatin structure across FGFR2 promoter.</p><p>Biochemical analyses of the NF-Y complex have demonstrated that the NF-YB:YC subunits associate through a subdomain in the DNA binding subunit interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), referred to as the histone-fold &#x0201c;handshake&#x0201d; motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), which resembles an &#x003b1;-helical structure first identified in the core histone proteins as primarily responsible for dimerization of the H2A/H2B and H3/H4 histone pairs. The NF-YB:YC histone-fold is mosthydrophobic amino acids that project along one face of an &#x003b1;-helix. Thus, NF-Y has a high intrinsic affinity for nucleosomal structures thanks to the NF-YB-NF-YC histone-like subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>) and thereby disrupts the compaction of the chromatin, resulting in a more open configuration. In our study we observed that knockdown of NF-Y expression may drastically inhibit the accessibility to DNase I and as a result suppresses the endogenous FGFR2 transcription level. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that binding of NF-Y presets the local chromatin configuration for FGFR2 promoter activation.</p><p>In a previous study NF-Y has been shown to interact with the coactivator p300 and P/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), which possesses a histone acetyltransferase activity important for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). It is well known that hyperacetylated H3 or H4 may promote the release of DNA from the core histones, reduce nucleosome occupancy, and thus, increase chromatin accessibility to transcription apparatus. In fact, we did observe H3 hyperacetylation at the proximal FGFR2 promoter, propagating downstream even into the open reading frame (covered by P1 primers, shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Importantly, suppression of NF-Y transcription by siRNAs reduces the acetylation level throughout all the aforementioned acetylated regions including the 5&#x02032; open reading frame region.</p><p>In this study we investigated the role of FGFR2 on osteoblast differentiation by characterizing the phenotype of C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with the full-length mouse FGFR2 gene and the dominant negative form. We provide the first evidence that the activation of FGF/FGFR2 signaling promotes osteoblastic differentiation caused by BMP-2 treatment in mesenchymal stem cells. Both BMPs and FGFs are key instructive signals produced at signaling centers of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). The pattern of temporal and spatial expression of FGFs and BMPs strongly suggests cooperative actions of these signaling molecules during limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). It has been reported that BMPs are expressed at the bone fracture site and that local application of rhFGF-2 at the fracture site accelerates fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). Additionally, the synergistic effect of FGF-4 in BMP-2-induced ectopic bone formation has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). In our experiment, growth factors belonging to FGF family in the culture medium bind their receptors (FGFR2) and lead to the activation of FGF/FGFR2 signal pathway, coordinating with BMP-2 to induce osteogenesis. Overexpression of full-length FGFR2 or dominant negative form may enhance or inhibit the process, respectively.</p><p>However, in our study, we failed to the identify BMP-2-responsive element in a long range of genomic DNA containing the proximal promoter region. We think that it may be located in a site beyond the proximal promoter, even downstream of the gene, acting as an enhancer. Although NF-Y only determines the basal expression of FGFR2 gene, it provides a regulatory base for BMP-2 to stimulate FGFR2 expression. We believe that NF-Y must play a physiologically important role in the regulation of BMP-2-induced FGFR2 expression and even osteogenesis, considering that FGFR2 is a positive regulator of ossification.</p><p>Taken together, our results lead to the hypothesis that NF-Y, characterized by histone-like protein structures, binds to the nucleosome bearing the CCAAT box and acts as a docking partner for recruiting acetyltransferase such as p300 and P/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) to the promoter. Then histones are hyperacetylated, and tight and compacted chromatin structure is disrupted with more accessibility. In summary, NF-Y might opens and maintains an accessible chromatin for basal activation of FGFR2 transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M808992200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M808992200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Nakamura, T., Hanada, K., Tamura, M., Shibanushi, T., Nigi, H., Tagawa, M., Fukumoto, S., and Matsumoto, T.
