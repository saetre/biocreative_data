When serum glucose is elevated, &#x003b2; cells release insulin, which signals muscle, liver, and fat to take up and store glucose. While it is clear that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx is a key factor in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, the role of other second messengers, such as cAMP, remain unclear. Studies dating back three decades suggest that glucose itself elevates cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charles et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grill and Cerasi, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rutter, 2001</xref>); however, in the absence of a mechanism for glucose-induced cAMP generation, the significance of these findings was questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montrose-Rafizadeh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rutter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delmeire et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In &#x003b2; cells, metabolism of glucose leads to an increase in intracellular ATP, which in turn induces the depolarization of the plasma membrane through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 1989</xref>). Subsequently, membrane depolarization causes the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels and elevation of cytosolic calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rutter et al., 1993</xref>). The resultant rise in intracellular calcium is required for insulin release. This rise is also linked to an increase in the second messenger cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charles et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rutter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>). Coordinated release from calcium stores results in calcium waves, which are temporally and spatially linked to fluctuations of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyachok et al., 2006</xref>). These studies convincingly demonstrated that cAMP is generated consequent to glucose metabolism, but the specific source of the second messenger remained unclear.</p><p>In contrast to the controversy surrounding glucose-induced cAMP generation, it is well accepted that cAMP is produced in &#x003b2; cells in response to incretins released by the intestine in response to food intake. The incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) increases cAMP levels by activating a specific G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor (GLP-1 receptor), resulting in stimulation of one of a family of G protein&#x02013;responsive, transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thorens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Usdin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moens et al., 1996</xref>). Although unable to elicit insulin secretion on its own, GLP-1&#x02013;induced cAMP potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delmeire et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyachok et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A recent study examining glucose-induced cAMP generation in the Min6 &#x003b2;-cell line using a FRET-based cAMP sensor revealed a temporal distinction between glucose-induced and GLP-1&#x02013;induced cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>). In response to exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, or to the pharmacological stimulator of tmACs, forskolin, cAMP production was stimulated within the first minutes of agonist addition. In contrast, the cAMP rise observed in response to high glucose media required more than 6 min. These different kinetics are consistent with distinct mechanisms of cAMP generation.</p><p>Cellular cAMP levels are determined by the relative activities of adenylyl cyclases, which synthesize the second messenger, and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which catabolize it. Various studies have demonstrated that the glucose-induced cAMP rise occurs in the presence of PDE inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charles et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>), revealing the actions of glucose must be mediated by changes in the rate of cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclases. In mammals, there are two families of cAMP-producing adenylyl cyclases, tmACs and &#x0201c;soluble&#x0201d; adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Both families of adenylyl cyclase include members whose activity can be stimulated by calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamenetsky et al., 2006</xref>). The tmAC family consists of nine G protein&#x02013;responsive cyclases, of which two (tmAC types I and VIII) can be activated by calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</xref>) and are found in &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delmeire et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>). Our laboratory identified a distinct source of cAMP in mammalian cells, sAC, which is insensitive to G proteins and forskolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck et al., 1999</xref>). Unlike tmACs, sAC is not exclusively linked to the plasma membrane but distributed to several subcellular compartments, such as the mitochondria, the nucleus, and the centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bundey and Insel, 2004</xref>). sAC activity has been extensively characterized in vitro, and its activity can be modulated by bicarbonate anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaiswal and Conti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litvin et al., 2003</xref>), or synergistically by calcium and bicarbonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litvin et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, because its affinity for substrate, ATP, is in the millimolar range, cellular sAC activity is predicted to be sensitive to cellular levels of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litvin et al., 2003</xref>). Bicarbonate regulation of sAC was shown to be physiologically relevant in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess et al., 2005</xref>), bronchii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>), and epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pastor-Soler et al., 2003</xref>), while calcium stimulation of sAC was found to be essential for cellular responses to nerve growth factor in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stessin et al., 2006</xref>) and tumor necrosis factor in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The two classes of adenylyl cyclases can be distinguished by pharmacological inhibitors. The P site ligand 2&#x02032;5&#x02032;-dideoxyadenosine (2&#x02032;5&#x02032; ddAdo) potently inhibits tmACs (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 3&#x02013;16 &#x003bc;M) and inhibits sAC only at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gille et al., 2004</xref>); in contrast, KH7, a molecule identified in our laboratory by a chemical library screen, is a potent inhibitor of sAC (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 2&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M) and inert toward tmACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stessin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>). Here we use these pharmacological inhibitors, along with genetic knockdown of sAC, to identify the sources of GLP-1&#x02013;induced and glucose-induced cAMP in INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells are an extensively characterized cell line used for &#x003b2;-cell studies, and in particular, studies of glucose-induced responses, including insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheenen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maechler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hohmeier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang and Holz, 2003</xref>), and they are a stable subline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merglen et al., 2004</xref>) of the cell line used most extensively to study the cAMP-mediated, glucose-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK (extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frodin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khoo and Cobb, 1997</xref>). We now show that sAC-generated cAMP and tmAC-generated cAMP play distinct roles in both glucose-induced cAMP generation and activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2. While both tmACs and sAC contribute to the total intracellular cAMP level in the presence of high glucose, tmACs are mainly responsible for basal cAMP production while sAC is responsible for the glucose-induced component. We further find that glucose-induced, sAC-generated cAMP is uniquely responsible for the ERK1/2 activation observed subsequent to glucose metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>INS-1E cells were a gift from Claus Wollheim (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland).

We included the broad specificity PDE inhibitor IBMX to facilitate cAMP measurements and to focus on cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclases. Despite the presence of IBMX, cellular levels of cAMP were greatly reduced by 15 min.

Thus, our whole cell measurements replicate the distinct time courses for hormonally stimulated versus glucose-induced cAMP generation previously seen in studies using intracellular cAMP sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al., 2005</xref>).

For second messengers, such as cAMP, this is achieved by compartmentalization of the second messenger and its effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buxton and Brunton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaccolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</xref>). Compartmentalization of a cell into multiple cAMP signaling microdomains permits this second messenger to mediate various, independent cellular processes. Here, we identify two temporally and mechanistically separate cAMP signaling cascades in INS-1E cells, a model for pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. GLP-1 induces a rapid elevation of cAMP via stimulation of membrane-anchored tmACs, while glucose induces a delayed elevation of cAMP via stimulation of sAC. Because sAC isoforms are not tethered to the plasma membrane, like tmACs, but are distributed throughout the cytoplasm and in organelles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2004</xref>), we presume GLP-1&#x02013; and glucose-regulated cAMP microdomains are spatially distinct as well. However, determination of their subcellular localization requires further study using targeted, intracellular cAMP sensors.</p><p>A rapid and transient response induced by the incretin, GLP-1, is consistent with it being mediated via GPCR stimulation of a tmAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thorens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle and Egan, 2007</xref>). Each step of a GPCR signaling cascade, from receptor desensitization to intrinsic timing of the G protein activation cycle, ensures its transient nature. Furthermore, the functions of an incretin may be well served by a pulse of cAMP. Incretins represent tonic signals that need to be interpreted once by &#x003b2; cells, for example, by a spike of cAMP, to prepare them for coming nutrients.</p><p>The INS-1E cell response to glucose was different; cAMP production was delayed when the cells were moved into high glucose. In contrast to the incretin-induced pulse of cAMP, which primes the &#x003b2;-cell for coming nutrients, the slow increase in second messenger would be an appropriate response to a chronic signal, like elevated glucose. Our cAMP accumulation experiments were performed in the presence of IBMX, to enable in vitro measurements of accumulated cAMP; therefore, it is unclear whether the sustained cAMP elevation observed here would be reproduced in vivo. Such a study awaits identification of a correctly targeted intracellular cAMP sensor. We speculate that the sAC-dependent elevation of cAMP due to glucose will be maintained for as long as glucose remains elevated; in this way, the glucose-dependent regulation would resemble a thermostat.</p><p>A delayed response is consistent with sAC biochemistry. sAC is directly modulated by ATP, bicarbonate, and calcium, all three of which are elevated downstream of glucose metabolism in &#x003b2; cells. We have shown calcium influx due to glucose is both necessary and sufficient for sAC activation, but calcium stimulation may not be the sole modulator of sAC. Because its Km for substrate ATP of 1 mM matches predicted cytosolic levels, sAC would also serve as a cellular ATP sensor. In addition, cellular bicarbonate levels fluctuate in direct proportion to the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> synthesis. Thus, all three sAC modulators would increase due to glucose metabolism, and sAC activity would only be stimulated after glucose is metabolized. Furthermore, as long as glucose is being metabolized, all three sAC modulators would remain elevated, resulting in sustained stimulation of sAC activity.</p><p>Two recent studies explored cAMP generation in &#x003b2;-cell lines using intracellular, FRET-based sensors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyachok et al. (2006)</xref> focused on the interrelationship between calcium influx and cAMP generation in INS-1E cells. Their data demonstrating cAMP induction by GLP-1 agrees with our studies; i.e., physiological levels of the incretin induce rapid and transient cAMP induction. However, this study did not detect a glucose-induced cAMP rise. Our data suggests this is likely due to the fact that cAMP was measured for short times (&#x0003c;5 min) after glucose addition. The kinetics due to GLP-1 and glucose observed in the second study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landa et al. (2005)</xref>, agree with our data using whole cell cAMP measurements. However, they observed nearly complete inhibition of the glucose-induced cAMP elevation by 50 &#x003bc;M P-site inhibitors. There are a number of differences in the experimental design of our study compared with theirs. Landa et al. use a cytosolic FRET-based probe in mouse Min6 cells, while we are measuring whole cell cAMP in rat INS-1E cells. We found sAC to be distributed throughout INS-1E cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), and its localization is consistent with other proliferating cells, where sAC is found inside the nucleus, at mitochondria, in the centrosome, and throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>). We do not know which subset of sAC is responsible for glucose-induced cAMP. Suppose, for example, that the major elevation of cAMP is due to intramitochondrial-localized sAC, then the major changes we are studying here would not be identified by a cytosolic cAMP sensor. For these reasons, our measurements of whole cell cAMP accumulation are complementary to the previously described cytosolic FRET-based sensor.</p><p>In INS-1E cells, glucose metabolism leads to activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frodin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khoo and Cobb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnette et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briaud et al., 2003</xref>). The glucose-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was shown to be mediated via the cAMP-induced activation of PKA. We now show that the glucose-induced cAMP generation by sAC is responsible for ERK activation, which plays a role in insulin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khoo et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, glucose-induced cAMP generation by sAC is functionally relevant in &#x003b2; cells. It remains to be seen whether glucose-induced, sAC-dependent cAMP generation also plays a role in insulin release.</p><p>The distinct kinetics of GLP-1&#x02013;induced and glucose-induced cAMP generation may underlie the reason for evolution of two types of cAMP signaling cascades in mammalian cells: tmACs, which respond with a spike to a tonic signal like hormones and neurotransmitters, versus sAC, which responds with a sustained signal to prolonged cues, such as glucose sensing by &#x003b2; cells, bicarbonate sensing by sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess et al., 2005</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> sensing in bronchii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2007</xref>), pH sensing in epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pastor-Soler et al., 2003</xref>), migration toward guidance cues like Netrin-1 in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), and responses to growth factors like TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2005</xref>) and NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stessin et al., 2006</xref>) in neutrophils and neurons, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810044_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="jgp.200810044_JGP_200810044_TS1.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the members of the Levin/Buck Laboratory, especially Eric Salazar and Dr. Martin Tresguerres for critical comments on the manuscript, Dr. Martin Tresguerres for microscopy assistance, and P.
