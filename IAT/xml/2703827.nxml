The precise mechanism by which viral infection leads to chronic autoimmune pathology is poorly understood, however it is clear that the early immune response plays a critical role. Previous results have shown that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is integral to the development of experimental-induced autoimmune myocarditis. However, the function of IL-6 during viral-mediated autoimmunity has yet to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>To address the requirement of IL-6 during disease induction, IL-6 deficient mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CB3). Following infection, mice lacking IL-6 developed increased chronic autoimmune disease pathology compared to wild type controls without a corresponding change in the level of viral replication in the heart. This increase in disease severity was accompanied by elevated levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, MCP-1, IL-10, activated T cells and cardiac infiltrating macrophage/monocytes. Injection of recombinant IL-6 early following infection in the IL-6 deficient mice was sufficient to lower the serum cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 as well as the serum chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b2;, RANTES and MIG with a corresponding decrease in the chronic disease pathology strongly suggests an important regulatory role for IL-6 during the early response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While IL-6 plays a pathogenic role in experimental-induced autoimmune disease, its function following viral-induced autoimmunity is not reprised.

While the mechanism by which viral infection leads to autoimmune myocarditis is not completely understood, there is compelling evidence to suggest that interleukin (IL)-6 is involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kanda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kanda2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IL-6 is a pleotropic cytokine that acts during both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and has been observed in the context of infection, inflammation and autoimmunity. IL-6 is typically induced following pathogen stimulation as a part of the innate inflammatory response and its major functions include initiation of the acute-phase response, activation of T cells and stimulation of B cell immunoglobulin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kopf1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

IL-6 functions globally in response to inflammation and infection and it is important in our understanding of the development of autoimmunity.</p><p>Specifically, lack of IL-6 has been demonstrated to be sufficient to prevent a plethora of autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Samoilova1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, pristane-induced lupus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Richards1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, experimental-induced arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Alonzi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Ohshima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, autoimmune myasthenia gravis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Deng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and, most notably with regard to this report, experimental-induced autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Following injection of cardiac myosin peptide emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), EAM did not develop in IL-6 deficient mice (IL-6KO, BALB/c) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. IL-6KO mice had decreased levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, complement component 3 and co-stimulatory molecules following induction of disease. While EAM is a useful model of myocarditis that allows for study of the chronic stage of disease without the complication of the viral infection, it does not mimic the natural acquisition of disease and lacks the complexity of the response to virus. Thus, it is valuable to decipher the role of IL-6 in the context of viral-induced autoimmune myocarditis.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate that IL-6 regulates the development of CB3-mediated chronic myocarditis. In contrast to the EAM findings, IL-6KO mice infected with CB3 developed significantly greater chronic heart disease. Heightened disease was associated with increases in early inflammatory responses including serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10 and MCP-1 as well as T cell activation and cardiac monocyte/macrophage infiltration. The early inflammatory response and chronic disease severity was controlled by supplementing the viral infection with recombinant IL-6 indicating that IL-6 functions as a regulator of the early host response and has a protective role during the progression of CB3-induced chronic myocarditis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>IL-6 deficient C57BL/6 (IL-6KO) and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

An additive effect with CB3 and LPS treatment was observed only in the absence of IL-6. Conversely, increased IL-10 production in IL-6KO mice corresponded to the presence of LPS as levels were elevated following LPS or CB3/LPS treatment. This was only observed in the absence of IL-6. This strongly suggests that production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 is regulated in part by IL-6. The change in MCP-1 levels in IL6KO mice corresponded to viral infection as both CB3 and CB3/LPS treatment resulted in increased production whereas LPS treatment alone did not. This suggests that MCP-1 is regulated by IL-6 following CB3 infection.

Further indicating a regulatory role for IL-6, rIL-6 treatment during the early immune response was sufficient to decrease the early inflammatory response with a corresponding decrease in the chronic disease. These results strongly suggest that IL-6 regulates and controls the initial host response to pathogen insult and that absence of IL-6 early post infection leaves the host susceptible to increased long-term complications of autoimmune myocarditis.</p><p>IL-6 has a pathogenic role in experimental autoimmune models such as EAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, EAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Samoilova1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, pristane-induced lupus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Richards1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, experimental-induced arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Alonzi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Ohshima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and autoimmune myasthenia gravis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Deng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results, however, clearly show induction of chronic disease with heightened severity in the absence of IL-6. Therefore, viral induction of disease follows a different disease pathogenesis with a more complex immune response in which cytokines, such as IL-6, have varied specific roles compared to experimental models of autoimmunity. Our results suggest a regulatory role for IL-6 following viral infection. Previously, the addition of recombinant IL-6 following encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection resulted in a decrease in disease severity of autoimmune myocarditis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kanda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, EMCV infection in mice which overexpress IL-6 leads to increased disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These results and ours suggest that IL-6 functions in a delicate balance as a regulator. Early after infection, IL-6 acts to dampen the strength of initial anti-viral immune response to reduce the risk of developing autoimmunity, however, its long-term presence as a chronic participant leads to heightened chronic disease.</p><p>Specifically, IL-6 is an essential participant in the acute phase response following viral infection. IL-6 deficient mice were unable to control infection by vaccinia virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kopf1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kopf2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In terms of CB3, an inability to control the viral infection would lead to greater viral and host directed cardiac damage and subsequently increase chronic disease. We observed no differences in the quantity of replicative virus between the hearts of IL-6KO and wt mice post infection. This suggests that the ability of IL-6 deficient hosts to control CB3 replication was not an issue. Our data suggests that for CB3 infection, the increase in disease severity is a consequence of a dysregulated immune response due to lack of IL-6 throughout the process.</p><p>Our results suggest that IL-6 functions by regulating the balance of cytokines and chemokines during the early host response to infection. Thus, IL-6 control has both local and systemic implications and greatly differentiates disease outcome. Changes in the cytokine milieu in the early immune response (day 3 PI) following infection have been demonstrated to later influence the development of chronic autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Richer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IL-10 levels were found to be increased in the IL-6KO mice. As IL-10 is associated with the anti-inflammatory response and T cell suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Blackburn1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> this was a surprising observation. Produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages, IL-10 functions to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production by APCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Girndt1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-10 are initiated following the same stimuli in a cell intrinsic manner and this acts to regulate the inflammatory immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Girndt1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the early upregulation of IL-10 may serve to control the increased inflammatory cytokines produced in the absence of IL-6. The window of IL-10 expression is short and also observed to be upregulated by LPS treatment alone. In experimental models of autoimmunity including EAE and EAM, IL-10 suppresses disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Bettelli2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, it has been suggested that increased IL-10 following CB3 infection in human monocytes leads to a dysregulation of the immune response to the virus and ultimately allows for the progression to the chronic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, increased levels of IL-10 in human patients with fulminant myocarditis correlates with increased mortality rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Nishii1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. IL-10 is also increased in mice following CB3 infection and was again suggested to allow for disease progression from the acute stage of disease to the chronic stage of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Gluck1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Schmidtke1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, the increased IL-10 may play a role in increased disease severity. These results highlight the complex balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that are regulated by IL-6.</p><p>The increases in TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 observed in the infected IL-6 deficient mice represent a heightened inflammatory response. Both TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 have previously been associated with both disease development and severity, and likely contribute to the increased disease pathology. TNF-&#x003b1; has been instrumental in overcoming genetic resistance to CB3-mediated autoimmune myocarditis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Lane2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and likely acts downstream of LPS signaling. TNF-&#x003b1; was sufficient to induce spontaneous autoimmune myocarditis in mice constitutively overexpressing this cytokine in the heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kubota1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In patients with enteroviral-induced myocarditis, TNF-&#x003b1; levels are often increased and are associated with increased myocardial necrosis and cellular infiltration in the myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Calabrese1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In our model, TNF-&#x003b1; levels were associated with increased disease severity. In wt mice, similar TNF-&#x003b1; levels were attained following treatment with CB3/LPS or LPS alone regardless of disease outcome suggesting that TNF-&#x003b1; levels are not sufficient for disease observed in these mice. In the absence of IL-6, the level of TNF-&#x003b1; increased with CB3/LPS and was associated with heightened disease severity, clearly indicating a role for TNF-&#x003b1; as an important inflammatory co-factor in disease progression. Taken together, TNF-&#x003b1; functions to increase inflammation associated with the induction of autoimmune heart disease and in the absence of IL-6, an imbalance of TNF-&#x003b1; is induced during the viral response resulting in heightened disease pathology.</p><p>MCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant for mononuclear cells, T cells and NK cells expressing CCR2, the receptor for MCP-1, on their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Shen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Zhao1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further, elevated MCP-1 expression has been correlated with immune cell infiltration in the heart following coxsackievirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Shen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. MCP-1 is expressed in a dose dependent manner during coxsackievirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Shen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and increases over the course of infection thus suggesting that it benefits the host response to CB3 infection. Further, mice deficient in MCP-1 or CCR2 are resistant to the development of experimental-induced autoimmune myocarditis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Goser1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Heart specific expression of MCP-1 is sufficient to induce monocyte/macrophage migration to the heart leading to myocarditis and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kolattukudy1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that MCP-1 and the migration of monocytes/macrophages to the heart is integral to the developing cardiac lesions.</p><p>In our model, the absence of IL-6 results in increased early expression of MCP-1 associated with increased monocyte/macrophage infiltration during both the acute infection and the later chronic stage of disease. In the absence of IL-6, this increase in mononuclear cell migration to the heart could lead to heightened cardiopathology. Increased levels of macrophages and monocytes could lead to greater levels of uncontrolled damage and lesion development without a concomitant increase in viral replication or viral directed pathology. However, the further increase in heart infiltrate following rIL-6 treatment would suggest that this is not the mechanism of increased disease severity. In support, increased macrophage infiltration in the heart was seen with rIL-6 treatment following EMCV infection in correlation with decreased chronic disease pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006207-Kanda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It was suggested that the increased macrophage infiltration could lead to faster clearance of virus and therefore decreased cardiac damage. Following rIL-6 treatment we observed increased innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration in combination with a decreased cytokine inflammatory response. It is likely that this combination results in faster viral clearance and better regulation of the early inflammatory responses and results in decreased chronic disease severity in these rIL-6 treated mice. Since it is likely that both viral and immune directed damage are controlling the outcome, the lack of IL- 6 results in slower clearance with less regulation of the early inflammatory responses leading to more inflammatory activity in the heart and results in heightened chronic disease and cardiac damage.</p><p>We provide evidence that IL-6 acts to regulate the early immune response following coxsackievirus infection. Regulation of the early response in turn controls the severity of the subsequent chronic disease pathology. Immune factors associated with the increased disease severity included early T cell activation and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses following disease induction. Without IL-6 to regulate the early immune response after infection, the heightened early inflammatory response leads to increased chronic myocarditis severity as the disease progresses. These results suggest that, contrary to what was suggested by results from experimental models of disease, anti-IL-6 treatment following viral-induced myocarditis could result in increased damage to the host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006207.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>IL-6KO mice have increased expression of the early activation marker CD69 at 3 days PI.
