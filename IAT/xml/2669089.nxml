Recently, other PR isoforms, PR-S, PR-C and PR-M generated from the same gene have been identified and partially characterised.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and Results</title><p>Using immunohistochemical, western blotting and RT-PCR techniques, evidence is provided that indicates the major PR isoform present in human term fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) and syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta is neither of the classical nuclear PR-B or PR-A isoforms but is the N-terminally truncated 60 kDa PR-C isoform. Evidence is also provided that this 60 kDa isoform resides in the cytoplasm of the expressing cell types. Data are also presented to show that PR-B, PR-A and PR-S isoforms are essentially absent from the amnion and chorion, whereas PR isoforms A, B, C and S are all present in the decidua, with PR-A being the major isoform. The syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta contains the cytoplasmic 60 kDa isoform, but not isoforms PR-A, PR-B or PR-S.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The major PR isoform in the amnion, chorion and placenta is a 60 kDa protein that could be PR-C, suggesting that the cytoplasmic isoform has a specific role in extra-embryonic tissues and may be involved in the regulation of human parturition.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Progesterone receptors (PRs) are members of a superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors comprised of specific domains involved in DNA binding, hormone binding, and transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Progesterone activation of PR in target tissues is mediated via dimerisation and phosphorylation of the receptor, resulting in binding to <italic>cis</italic>-acting progesterone response elements on DNA and the modulation of the promoters of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The human PR-A isoform differs from the PR-B isoform in lacking the first 164 amino acids contained in PR-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both are translated from distinct mRNA transcripts generated from a single gene under the control of separate oestrogen sensitive promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Previous work has identified three additional AUG codons that act as translation sites with a possible methionine site at amino acid 595 that is predicted to generate a protein of approximately 60 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recently, two additional translational start sites at amino acids 289 and 301 have been identified that also produce proteins of approximately 60 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although much work has been performed on PR-B and PR-A, little work has been undertaken on the other seven transcripts generated from the PR gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], despite there being evidence that some of these are translated into functional 38 kDa, 60 kDa, 71 kDa or 78 kDa proteins in malignant progesterone target tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and that these are co-ordinately up-regulated by oestrogens and down-regulated by progestins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Evidence also exists for other PR isoforms such as PR-C, PR-S and PR-T, which could be genomic mediators of progestin action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and for three membrane progestin receptors that are classical G-coupled protein receptor-transduction molecules first identified in the teleost oocyte called mPR&#x003b1;, mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Progesterone receptors have been proposed to play a key role in the control of human labour and parturition whereby the levels of the PR-B isoform, which is often considered to be the dominant isoform, fall prior to and during labour leaving the PR-A isoform as the predominant form leading to a 'functional progesterone receptor withdrawal' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Evidence to support this occurring in the uterine myometrium exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], although more recent evidence suggests that the PR-C isoform is also expressed and may have a functional role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In other human reproductive tissues, such as the decidua, ovary and the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], PR-A appears to be the predominant progestin regulator with PR-B maintaining a supporting role suggesting that progestin signalling in the human uterus at the end of parturition is far more complex than a PR-B to PR-A isoform switching mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Despite there being a paucity of data to support 'functional progesterone receptor withdrawal' in tissues at the fetal-maternal interface, i.e. in the fetal membranes, decidua and placenta, many still consider that only the PR-B and PR-A isoforms are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Recent data have suggested that at least five nuclear PR-isoforms are present in the human decidua and that all five isoforms are decreased after labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, although western blotting techniques also indicated the presence of several PR isoforms in amniotic nuclear extracts, immunohistochemical methods failed to detect any PR isoforms in the amnion and chorion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In the present study examining the pattern of expression of PR isoforms in human fetal membranes (amnion and chorion), decidua and placenta at term, we demonstrate that the major isoform present in the fetal membranes and placenta is a cytoplasmic 60 kDa isoform, an isoform of molecular mass identical to that of PR-C, that PR-B or PR-A are not expressed in the amnion or chorion, and that the 94 kDa PR-A protein is the dominant PR isoform in the decidua.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Local Research Ethics Committee approval for the study was obtained and all patients signed informed consent for their tissues to be used. Fetal membranes and placenta (n = 6) were collected from term patients undergoing elective Caesarean section prior to labour. All tissues were divided into 3 parts; one fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological examination, the other two snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for later RNA and protein extraction. Enriched amnion was obtained by careful peeling of the amnion away from the chorion and decidua. Enriched decidua was obtained using the edge of a microscope slide to carefully remove a thin layer from the inverted fetal membranes. Enriched chorion was obtained by using the edge of the microscope slide to scrape away the remaining decidua. A 2 cm<sup>3 </sup>block of placenta from the mid-part of a cotyledon was taken and washed briefly with sterile PBS before division into 3 parts.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Five &#x003bc;m sections of tissue dried for 48 hr prior to de-waxing and re-hydration through graded alcohol to distilled water were subjected to boiling 10 mM citric acid for 12 min followed by cooling for exactly 20 min before transfer into cold H<sub>2</sub>O to retrieve antigenic sites. Endogenous peroxidase activity and specific binding was blocked with 6% peroxide for 15 min, followed by incubation with non-immune rabbit serum (10% in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) for 30 min, respectively. Endogenous avidin and biotin sites were blocked with Avidin-Binding blocking solutions (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies that detect all known isoforms of PR, clone 1A6 and C-20, were purchased from Novacastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, respectively. The antibodies that detect only PR-B (San27) and antibodies that detect only PR-A (clone 16) in immunohistochemistry were purchased from Novacastra. Monoclonal antibodies diluted in 10% non-immune rabbit serum, at 1:50 (1A6), 1:150 (San27), 1:200 (clone 16) dilutions, and the polyclonal antibody C-20 diluted to 1:40 in 10% swine serum, were applied to sections and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. In some studies, C-20 antibodies were pre-incubated (3 hr at room temperature) with a 7-fold excess of immunising peptide before use. After thorough washing in PBS, biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:400) were applied for 1 hr 30 min, the sections washed and avidin-biotin complexes applied for 30 min. Colour was developed over antigenic sites using 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. After copious washes in deionised water, sections were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in xylene and permanently mounted in XAM (BDH, Poole, UK). Photomicrographs were obtained at the indicated magnifications on a Zeiss Axioplan compound microscope (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK) fitted with a Sony DN-100 digital camera (Nikon, Kingston-upon-Thames, UK). Images were digitally enhanced using proprietary software.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA preparation and RT-PCR</title><p>Total cellular RNA was obtained from 100 mg of tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according the manufacturer's instructions, and genomic DNA contamination removed by treating the samples with RNase-free DNase 1 (Promega, Southampton, UK) for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. After verification of RNA quality by UV-spectrophotometer analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis, one &#x003bc;g of RNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) for one hr at 42&#x000b0;C.

The data revealed the presence of cytoplasmic staining in the amnion epithelial cell, the chorionic trophoblast and the maternal decidual cell. Nuclear staining with these antibodies was only found in decidual cells and positive control tissues such as breast cancer, endometrium and myometrium (positive control data not shown). No nuclear staining was detected in the amnion epithelium and chorionic cytotrophoblast (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Similarly, nuclear staining was confined only to the decidual cells of the basal plate attached to the placenta (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Nuclear staining in classical progesterone target tissues (breast cancer, endometrial, and myometrial cells) confirmed the PR-B and PR-A specificity of the antibodies (data not shown). The conclusion from these studies was that the cytoplasmic isoform found within fetal membranes, decidua and the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta was neither the PR-B nor the PR-A isoform and could represent one of the other PR isoforms. These data were inconsistent with previous observations that the amnion epithelial cell contained both PR-B and PR-A isoforms and that during labour there is a loss of the PR-B isoform in favour of the PR-A isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but is consistent with the immunohistochemical studies of Goldman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To find the identity of the cytoplasmic progesterone receptor isoform, RNA extracts prepared from term fetal membrane and placenta samples were subjected to RT-PCR with several isoform-specific primer sets (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and revealed the presence of a PR transcript in all samples by RT-PCR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; top panels). Analysis with PR-B-, PR-A and/or PR-B- and PR-S-specific primer sets showed that fetal membranes with decidua attached consisted mainly of PR-A transcripts with some transcripts for PR-B, but no PR-S transcripts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Fetal membranes enriched for amniochorion revealed the presence of a transcript for PR that was not PR-B, not PR-A or PR-S leading to conclusion that the cytoplasmic PR isoform present was either PR-C or PR-M previously observed in human breast cancer cells and isolated from human aortic endothelial cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Transcripts for PR-S were undetectable, except in the T47D breast cancer cell control. Samples enriched for decidua revealed the presence of all PR isoforms including PR-S (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), whereas the amnion lacked transcripts for PR-A, PR-B and PR-S and the chorion (which is often contaminated with decidua) produced a major band for PR-A, although small amounts of transcripts for PR-B and PR-S were also detected (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Evidence that the PR isoform in human fetal membranes and placenta at term is either PR-C or PR-M</bold>.

In most mammals, the stability of the relationship in the fetal-maternal interface is disturbed by the fall of progesterone production by the placenta, with the concomitant softening of the cervix, rupture of the fetal membranes and initiation of highly synchronised high-pressure contractions of the myometrium that characterises labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the human, similar events occur in the same coordinated manner except there is no decrease of systemic progesterone concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A hypothesis presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], that a 'switch' in PR isoforms from the more transcriptionally dominant PR-B to the less active PR-A isoform must therefore occur in these tissues, has been convincingly supported by evidence in the myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and in the cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and less convincingly in the amnion and maternal decidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we have shown that human fetal membranes (amnion epithelial cell and chorionic cytotrophoblast) contain mainly high levels of a 60 kDa PR isoform (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) that could be PR-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or a different isoform that is initiated from the AUG codon at amino acid 301 of the full length protein sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas the placental cytotrophoblast is devoid of PR and the placental syncytiotrophoblast contains only this cytoplasmic isoform. By contrast, the maternal decidua contains not only PR-A, as its major isoform, but also PR-B, PR-S and the cytoplasmic isoform. These data differ from those recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] where PR-B and PR-A isoforms were observed in amnion nuclear extracts yet, paradoxically, the antibody used failed to show immunoreactive PR by immunohistochemistry and theoretically, should not detect the PR-C, PR-S, or PR-M isoforms in western blotting, as the epitope for this antibody is found only at the N-terminal region of the PR-A isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, this epitope is present in the PR301 protein and thus that particular antibody could be targeting this protein. In the present study, no PR-B or PR-A isoforms were detected in the amnion or chorion and the hypothesis that progesterone receptor switching occurs within these tissues at term or in labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] is not supported. Although, we cannot rule out the presence of a small amount of PR-B or PR-A isoforms being present in the nuclei of amnion epithelial cells, despite a lack of expression of these isoforms at the mRNA level (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the present study indicates that PR-B and PR-A are of little importance in relation to the 60 kDa isoform in fetal membranes. Additionally, the PR immunoreactivity in the present study that we consider represents either the C or PR301 isoform, was confined to the cytoplasm of the amniotic epithelium and the chorionic cytotrophoblast, and was the major isoform present, whereas no cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was detected in the aforementioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These data are qualitatively similar to that obtained in the baboon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], where PR was not observed in the amnion or chorion, but strong nuclear and weak cytoplasmic staining was observed in the decidua with the JZB39 rat anti-PR monoclonal antibody. Observations obtained with JZB39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which has been shown to only detect the 60 kDa isoform in myometrium and not T47D extracts by immunoblotting, were dependent upon protein concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These data suggest that protein loading in immunoblotting is critical for good detection of the 60 kDa isoform. Indeed, this isoform was weakly represented on western blotting in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas our data show intense expression of the 60 kDa isoform (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) for this exact reason. Alternatively, these discrepant observations may be related to the antibodies used, the use of nuclear extracts compared to whole cell extracts or the presence of contaminating cytoplasm/tissues in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Indeed, there is confusion in the literature concerning the use and specificity of available PR antibodies with some antibodies lacking specificity for particular PR isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], despite the evidence provided by the suppliers that the antibodies are specific. For example, the C-20 polyclonal antibody we used herein is marketed showing 4 distinct bands on western blots for PR in T47D cell extracts. Yet Salamecos &#x00026; Gellersen could not demonstrate any PR-specific bands in T47D cell extracts, COS-7 cells or <italic>in vitro </italic>translated products with the C-20 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have demonstrated the same distinct 4 PR isoforms using our T47D extracts with this antibody, including a strong band for PR-B, yet no PR-B protein was present from proteins generated from the extra-embryonic tissue extracts, despite the presence of transcripts for PR-B (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This could be due to either the loss of translation from the AUG codon at amino acid 1 in these cells, that T47D cells differ from laboratory to laboratory or protein degradation occurred during the preparation of samples. The latter option is unlikely, because myometrial tissue prepared in the same way as the extra embryonic tissues also produced PR-B protein on our blots (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.). The conclusion, therefore, is that the 60 kDa protein detected is generated from a primary translation site in these tissues that arises from either the AUG codon at amino acids 301 or 595.</p><p>In agreement with our studies, Goldman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that PR-A is expressed in the nucleus of the decidua but absent in the amnion by immunohistochemistry, but paradoxically, found all isoforms present by western blotting. By contrast, our western blot studies indicate the major PR isoform in the fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) is a 60 kDa protein that could be the PR-C isoform and that it is localised within the cytoplasm, without immunoreactivity within the nuclei of the same cells and, therefore, we consider that the relevance of the changes in levels of the PR isoforms detected within the amniotic nuclear extracts of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], should be considered with caution.</p><p>Using antibodies that detect all known PR isoforms, we demonstrated that the major isoform in the amnion, chorion and syncytiotrophoblast is the 60 kDa isoform (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This isoform was previously reported as the PR-C isoform in human breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], human fetal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the rat decidua basalis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the guinea pig cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting that the ~60 kDa PR protein in the amniochorion and placenta is PR-C (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The absence of PR-B and PR-A transcripts in amniochorion, which was devoid of decidua (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), confirmed these findings. By contrast, the major isoform in the decidua is considered to be PR-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but in this study PR-B, PR-S and the 60 kDa isoforms are also expressed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In light of the study by Goldman et al., these data need further clarification, but suggest that the 60 kDa PR isoform is an important molecule in the fetal membranes, decidua and syncytiotrophoblast. These data also suggest that a re-evaluation of the roles of PR in the fetal-maternal interface is needed and the idea that PR-A simply acts as a dominant negative regulator of PR-B action is not applicable to these particular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The exact mechanism involved in the synthesis of the N-truncated PR isoforms that include PR-C is unknown, but limited evidence suggests that PR-C may be produced using a third oestrogen dependent promoter that replaces both exon 1 and exon 2 of the full length PGR gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], with an AUG codon at amino acid 595 being the translational start site in a number of mammalian and non-mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The demonstration that PR-C isoforms in the human breast cancer cell do not arise from proteolysis of larger PR-isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] but from two specific PR transcripts that originate from a 11.4 kb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and that specific PR mRNA transcripts are present in human fetal membranes and placenta that are not any of the other recognised PR isoforms (this study), strongly suggests that the 60 kDa isoform is generated through promoter specific transcription in extra-embryonic tissues. The function of N-truncated PR isoforms including PR-C is unclear, although they may act as modulators of PR-A and PR-B transcriptional activities in those cells that produce these isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the human amnion and chorion, dominant negative regulation of PR-B and PR-A transcriptional control seems unlikely in the absence of any measurable PR-A or PR-B isoforms and point towards PR-C specific functions. Because PR-C lacks a full DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but has a nuclear localisation signal and two dimerisation domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the intriguing possibility that PR-C may associate with other transcriptional elements to modulate gene transcription is raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed, evidence exists in the rat myometrium that during labour the 60 kDa PR-C isoform translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Additionally, studies on the promoter activities of PR-B, PR-A and a truncated PR that is equivalent to PR-C have demonstrated that a PR-C-like construct has 3-times the activation potential of PR-B and 1.5-fold the activation of PR-A on stimulation with medroxyprogesterone acetate in early secretory phase human stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and enhances PR-B and PR-A transactivation in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggesting that PR-C may have gene modulatory functions that differ to those of PR-B and PR-A in certain cell types, as has been shown for the main PR isoforms in a tissue-specific context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The 60 kDa protein identified in this study may not be the PR-C isoform that originates from the AUG codon at 595, as presented in the literature, but an isoform that originates at the AUG codon at 301 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the weight of evidence in the literature currently suggests that it is most likely PR-C; indeed, the demonstration that protein produced from the original PR-C plasmid cloned from a cDNA library produced a 60 kDa band on western blot (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) supports this. PR-C plasmids generated from PCR products generated from a PR-B containing plasmid produce proteins of only 38 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], consistent with the molecular mass of PR-M, although the authors suggest that proteins for PR-M, PR-S, PR-C and PR-T isoforms do not exist, suggesting that more research into the nature of proteins produced from these expression plasmids is required. However, the cytoplasmic location and relatively high levels of this 60 kDa protein in the amniochorion are suggestive of a localised function in the cytoplasm rather than a nuclear genomic function for this tissue and that this localisation is important for sustained gestation. It now seems imperative that the identity, regulation and role of the 60 kDa cytoplasmic PR isoform are investigated to further our understanding of the role of progesterone in these tissues in relation to human parturition.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AHT conceived the study, carried out the immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western blotting studies, participated in the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
