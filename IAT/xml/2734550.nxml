ChIP-analysis of LTR under suppression revealed reduced promoter binding of TFIIB and Pol-II, but no change in the binding of CREB or CBP/p300 to the viral enhancer sequence. However, the expression of TORC2, a co-activator of CREB, decreased substantially in the EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this returned to normal levels in <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture. The reduced expression of TORC2 was associated with translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

HTLV-1 infects 10&#x02013;20 million people worldwide; 2&#x02013;3% of infected individuals develop ATL, and a further 0.25&#x02013;3% develop HAM/TSP.</p><p>Tax protein, encoded by the HTLV-1 pX region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], is closely associated with the development of these diseases by triggering in a pleiotropic manner viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and by deregulating the expression of cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the expression of viral genes, including Tax, is almost completely suppressed in the peripheral blood of infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This may explain the long latency in the development of ATL and other HTLV-1 related diseases. It has been assumed that there is a specific mechanism for this <italic>in vivo </italic>-specific suppression, because gene expression of HTLV-1 in peripheral blood cells from infected people, with the exception of two-thirds of ATL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], resumes quickly when the infected cells are moved to <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions, without any stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Such reversible control of the gene expression should benefit HTLV-1 because Tax protein harbors several strong epitopes for cytotoxic T -cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the transient expression of Tax is essential for the propagation of viral infection and/or infected cells under strict surveillance by the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the efficiency of which may vary among individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, evading the suppressed state leading to the reactivation of viral gene expression may be a key step in the development of HTLV-1 associated diseases.</p><p>DNA methylation accumulated in HTLV-1 5'-LTR silences viral gene transcription in leukemic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, further analysis revealed that viral gene transcription is silenced in most carriers, and in about 20% of ATL cases, despite no or only partial methylation of the 5'-LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, in the case of ATL, transcriptional silencing was observed regardless of the acetylation of histones H3 and H4, markers of active transcription, in the 5'-LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, a reversible mechanism that suppresses viral gene transcription without DNA methylation or hypoacetylated histones in 5'-LTR has been postulated but remains to be clarified.</p><p>As observed in other retroviruses, transcription of HTLV-1 is under the control of an enhancer/promoter located in its LTR. The U3 region in the HTLV-1 LTR harbors an enhancer element consisting of three 21 -bp direct repeats that are activated exclusively in the presence of Tax. In the center of each 21 -bp enhancer sequence there are Tax-responsive elements (TRE) or viral cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], to which a variety of enhancer binding proteins, including members of the CREB/ATF family, bind, with or without Tax protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Among them, CREB has been implicated as the primary player in both basal and Tax-activated HTLV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. CREB stimulates HTLV-1 viral transcription by binding to the viral CRE and interacts with Tax, which is also associated with the GC-rich sequences immediately flanking the viral CRE, and recruits CBP/p300 to form a Tax/CREB/CBP/p300/DNA quaternary complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, proteins belonging to another recently identified family of CREB cofactors, termed "transducers of regulated CREB activity" (TORCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have been suggested to enhance HTLV-1 transcription, alone or in combination with Tax, in a CREB-dependent manner <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. TORCs were originally found in the CREB -dependent, but pCREB(phosphor-CREB)-independent, activation of cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The recruitment of TORCs to the promoter does not appear to modulate CREB DNA binding activity, but rather enhances the interaction of CREB with the TAFII130 component of TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Among three members of the TORC-family protein, the activity of TORC2 is tightly regulated by phosphorylation at Ser 171, which promotes the export of the protein into the cytoplasm and its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To gain insights into the mechanism of this <italic>in vivo </italic>-specific transcriptional suppression, we established a mouse model in which mice were intraperitoneally administered syngeneic EL4 T -lymphoma cells transduced with a recombinant retrovirus expressing GFP-Tax fusion protein under the control of the HTLV-1 enhancer (EL4-Gax). Gax protein retains the properties of Tax as a transcriptional transactivator and also as an antigen, providing epitopes for CTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Gax </italic>expression in EL4-Gax cells is suppressed <italic>in vivo </italic>but is quickly up-regulated in <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture, thus modeling the activity of HTLV-1 -infected cells in asymptomatic carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The present study analyzed epigenetic modifications and factors in the integrated HTLV-1 promoter/enhancer in EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo </italic>as well as <italic>ex vivo</italic>. We found that reduced expression of TORC2, but not of CREB or its phosphorylated form (pCREB), was responsible for the suppression of viral gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Gax </italic>expression <italic>in vivo </italic>was suppressed at the level of transcription</title><p>EL4-Gax cell was established by transducing with an MLV-based retrovirus vector expressing the GFP-fused Tax (<italic>Gax</italic>), in which the U3 region of the 3' LTR was replaced by that of HTLV-1 to ensure the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of HTLV-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and the characteristics of Gax protein as a transactivator were shown to be retained as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The reduction of Gax protein is not simply due to a severe growth condition inducing cell death since the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is known to be a sensitive marker of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], was not observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, PARP).</p><p>The expression of <italic>Gax </italic>mRNA was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether the suppression of Tax expression was controlled at the level of transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The transcriptional suppression <italic>in vivo </italic>is specific for the Gax gene because no suppression was observed in the expression of cellular genes such as EF1-a, GAPDH, &#x003b2;-actin, 18S-ribosomal RNA and endogenous retrovirus.

Thus, Gax expression <italic>in vivo </italic>was suppressed transcriptionally.</p></sec><sec><title>CpG methylation is not associated with the suppression of the <italic>Gax </italic>gene</title><p>Because complete- or hyper- methylation of cytosine residues at the CpG sites in the promoter region of the HTLV-1 5'-LTR is associate with transcriptional suppression in infected cell lines, the level of CpG methylation in the LTR U3 region at 5' site of <italic>Gax</italic>-reporter genome was examined in EL4-Gax cells. There are 11 possible CpG methylation sites in the U3 region of HTLV-1, but only low levels of methylation were observed in four independent experiments. Although one case (experiment 1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed heavy methylation at a single CpG site in EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, little or no methylation was detected at this site in the other experiments. In the other three experiments, less methylation was observed in EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo </italic>(where <italic>Gax </italic>expression was suppressed) than in cells grown <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Thus, no CpG methylation specific and consistent with that in the <italic>in vivo </italic>cells was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results indicate that the suppression of <italic>Gax </italic>gene expression <italic>in vivo </italic>is not explained by CpG methylation in the enhancer sequence, suggesting the involvement of other mechanism(s). This is consistent with a previous analysis in which no or partial methylation was associated with silencing in the peripheral blood cells of HTLV-1 carriers, as well as in significant number of ATL cases, whereas transcriptional suppression of HTLV-1 in ATL cell lines and some ATL leukemic cells was explained by hypermethylation of the 5'-LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CpG methylation of the enhancer/promoter region of provirus DNA in EL4-Gax cells</bold>.

CRE-dependent transcription is generally explained by the recruitment of histone acetylating proteins, CBP/p300, to the enhancer region of genes through an interaction with CREB protein, which binds to the CRE sequence, and acetylation of histones, opening the chromatin and providing access to basic transcriptional factors including RNA polymerase. Thus, since the reduction of recruitment of either factor to the promoter region might result in the suppression of transcription, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to analyze the binding of these factors to the U3 region of the 5'-LTR.</p><p>Enhancer binding of CREB and pCREB was first examined in EL4-Gax cells either <italic>in vivo </italic>(b) or under <italic>in vitro </italic>(a) culture conditions.

CBP functions as a cofactor by being tethered to DNA through either pCREB or CREB, in association with Tax, to acetylate histone proteins.

ChIP assay was performed with antibody against GFP, which recognizes the Gax protein. Consistent with the protein expression, Gax was associated with the enhancer DNA in EL4-Gax cells grown <italic>in vitro </italic>(lane 15) but not in <italic>in vivo </italic>cells (lane 16), where the expression of Gax protein was decreased. Tax recruits CBP to the HTLV-1 enhancer by tethering with CREB at the CRE sequence; however, the enhancer binding of CBP remained unchanged in the absence of Tax (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 11, 12). In this respect, it is noteworthy that phosphorylation of CREB protein, which leads to a complex formation between CREB and CBP, is increased in EL4-Gax cells grown <italic>in vivo </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Thus, pCREB seems to be involved in the sustained enhancer binding of CBP in the absence of Tax.</p><p>Although the amount of pCREB was increased in EL4-Gax cells grown <italic>in vivo</italic>, no significant difference was observed in the amount of pCREB binding to the enhancer DNA in cells either <italic>in vivo </italic>or under <italic>in vitro </italic>culture conditions. Since pCREB has been demonstrated to preferentially bind to the enhancer sequence of HTLV-1 in a complex with Tax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], Tax might have selectively incorporated pCREB in the complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Modifications of histones H3 and H4</title><p>Activated transcription is associated with histone acetylation in the chromatin of the respective genes; thus, histone acetylation at the promoter region of the provirus was analyzed using a ChIP assay, with antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4. Unexpectedly, this analysis revealed that histones at the LTR of the HTLV-1 provirus were equally acetylated in EL4-Gax cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;14), either <italic>in vivo </italic>(b) and <italic>in vitro </italic>(a), whereas RNA expression from the HTLV-1 promoter in these cells differed substantially (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Methylation of histone H3 at the lysine residue was also analyzed, because this methylation is closely linked with transcriptional activation. However, no change was observed in the methylation of histone H3 in the promoter region of the provirus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 15&#x02013;16).

However, the expression of viral genes, including Tax, is strongly suppressed in the peripheral blood of patients infected with HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], mainly because the Tax protein harbors several strong epitopes for cytotoxic T -cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Such suppression is readily reversible, because gene expression of HTLV-1 in peripheral blood cells from infected people, with the exception of two-thirds of ATL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], quickly resumes when the infected cells are moved to <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions, without any additional stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This indicates that the transient expression of Tax is essential for the propagation of viral infection, and/or the infected cells are under strict surveillance by the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation is a host defense mechanism for inactivating transposable elements, such as retroviruses, to inhibit their transcription and their generation of new viruses. Thus, the transcriptional silencing of the Tax gene has been studied extensively in terms of DNA methylation of the 5'-LTR, which is the promoter of viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In ATL-derived cell lines, complete- or hypermethylation of CpG DNA in 5'-LTR is closely associated with the suppression of viral gene transcription, and partial methylation is not sufficient to silence transcription of the Tax gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast, the 5'-LTR of the provirus genome was found to be unmethylated or partially methylated in about 70% of ATL leukemic cells with intact provirus sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas Tax gene expression was mostly silenced <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, lack of DNA methylation in the 5'-LTR was more frequently observed in HTLV-1 carriers than in primary ATL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These data indicate that a mechanism other than DNA methylation is involved in the silencing of Tax gene transcription in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 -infected individuals <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mouse model system studied in this report models gene control in HTLV-1 -infected cells in ATL patients and carriers, where reversible silencing of Tax gene transcription is observed, without extensive DNA methylation of the 5'-LTR.</p><p>The transcription of HTLV-1 is controlled by CREB binding to the enhancer sequence, which consists of three 21-bp direct repeats containing CREs in the middle. The viral transactivator, Tax, interacts with both CREB and CBP/p300 in a manner independent of the phosphorylation of CREB and activates the HTLV-1 enhancer. In the current study, approximately equivalent binding of CREB and CBP on the enhancer DNA was observed in the <italic>Gax </italic>expressing EL4-Gax cells cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>or EL4-Gax cells grown <italic>in vivo</italic>, where <italic>Gax </italic>expression was substantially suppressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In addition, although histone acetylation, a downstream effect of CREB-CBP/p300 association, remained constant, recruitment of the basic transcription factor (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase II to the promoter was diminished in cells grown <italic>in vivo </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These observations suggest that activation machinery other than the CREB-CBP/p300 pathway might be involved in the transcriptional control of HTLV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereby constitutive association of CREB-CBP/p300 and acetylated histones keeps the promoter in an inducible condition. In this respect, it is noteworthy that reversible silencing was observed in an ATL case regardless of hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the 5'-LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>CREB-dependent promoters have been thought to respond to various intracellular and extracellular signals via stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 and the resulting recruitment of the co-activator paralogues, CBP and p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although a number of growth factors and hormones trigger CREB phosphorylation with comparable stoichiometry and kinetics, they are often ineffective in promoting transcription through the CREB binding site. Furthermore, knock-in mice with mutations in CBP/p300 that blocked the interaction with phosphor-CREB showed only modest changes in cAMP-dependent transcription. Thus, the involvement of additional CREB co-activators was postulated, and, subsequently, a new family of proteins has been identified as co-activators independent of CREB phosphorylation using high-throughput transformation assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The novel co-activators, TORC 1&#x02013;3, interact with the bZIP of CREB in a phospho-Ser133-independent manner through their N-terminal coiled-coil structure, leading to the activation of CREB -mediated transcription.</p><p>Accordingly, we examined the involvement of TORCs in the regulation of HTLV-1 transcription <italic>in vivo </italic>and found that expression of TORC1 and TORC2 in EL4-Gax cells coincided with the suppressed expression of <italic>Gax in vivo </italic>and its up-regulation <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Previous reports have demonstrated that the forced expression of human TORC proteins activates the transcription of the HTLV-1 LTR, whereas depletion of TORCs by siRNA-mediated knock-down impairs Tax-dependent and Tax-independent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We also observed the activation of a luciferase reporter gene under control of HTLV-1 LTR in association with the over-expression of TORC1, TORC2, or TORC3 of mouse origin (data not shown). It was recently reported that TORC3 repressed the transcription of HTLV-1 by interacting with Bcl3, which, in turn, recruits HDAC1 to deacetylate histones. However, such a mechanism is likely not involved in the current system because no significant change in the promoter association of acetylated histones H3 and H4 was observed in cells grown <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the expression of TORC3 appeared to increase slightly <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, depletion of TORC1 or TORC3 expression in EL4-Gax cells by siRNA did not affect the expression of <italic>Gax</italic>, whereas TORC2 knock-down resulted in a significant reduction in <italic>Gax </italic>expression, although expression of siRNA to any of the TORC genes reduced the amount of the respective TORC proteins in EL4-Gax cells to about the same extent. Consistently, the analysis of enhancer binding of TORC proteins by using a ChIP assay revealed that TORC2 is the major binding factor among the three TORC-family proteins in EL4-Gax cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). These results indicate that TORC2 is primarily responsible for the transcriptional control of HTLV-1 LTR in EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>TORC2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the protein, which induces the cytoplasmic translocation of TORC2 from the nucleus, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome. In fact, we demonstrated that the activity of AMPK, a family of Ser/Thr kinases, which phosphorylates TORC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], was activated in EL4-Gax cells <italic>in vivo </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In EL4-Gax cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, most TORC2 protein was localized in the nucleus where it would be involved in the transcription of the provirus. When the cells were grown in the peritoneal cavity of mice, the nuclear expression of TORC2 was markedly diminished, whereas its cytoplasmic expression remained relatively constant. This result is consistent with the Western blotting data, which showed that the amount of the unphosphorylated form of TORC2 protein was more significantly reduced <italic>in vivo </italic>than that of the phosphorylated form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that some signal(s) specific for <italic>in vivo </italic>growth induces the phosphorylation of TORC2 protein, leading to the cytoplasmic translocation and degradation of the protein. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the activity of AMPK, is modulated by various pathological stresses and physiological stimuli, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, heat shock, hypoxia, and ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, calcium influx after hormonal stimulation or antigen stimulation of lymphocytes induces calcineurin activity, which in turn dephosphorylates TORC2.

Recombinant retroviruses for shTORC1 and shTORC3 were generated by transfecting respective retroviral vector plasmids into BOSC23 cells, and recombinant lentivirus expressing shTORC2 was generated in HEK293T cells by the cotransfection of the lentiviral vector plasmid with expression vectors for Gag/Pol (pGag/Pol), Rev (pRev), and VSV-G protein (pVSV-G) using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. Viral supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection and added to EL4-Gax cells for infection in the presence of polybrene (8 &#x003bc;g/mL). Infected cells were selected with puromycin (4 &#x003bc;g/mL), and mixtures of 40&#x02013;200 clones of each virus were used for further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SJ designed and carried out most of the experiments.
