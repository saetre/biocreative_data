Mutations in either the <italic>TSC1 </italic>gene on chromosome 9q34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], or the <italic>TSC2 </italic>gene on chromosome 16p13.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] cause TSC. In most studies, 75 - 85% of individuals with TSC have been shown to carry a germ-line <italic>TSC1 </italic>or <italic>TSC2 </italic>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a further 5 - 10% carry <italic>TSC1 </italic>or <italic>TSC2 </italic>variants where it is not absolutely clear from the genetic data whether the change is disease-causing (a pathogenic variant), or not (a neutral variant). To determine whether these unclassified variants are disease-causing, the effect of the changes on protein function can be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>TSC1 </italic>and <italic>TSC2 </italic>gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, interact to form a protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TSC2 contains a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain and acts on the rheb GTPase to inhibit rheb-GTP-dependent stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The exact role of TSC1 in the TSC1-TSC2 complex is less clear, but it appears to be required for maintaining the stability, activity and correct intracellular localisation of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inactivation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex results in activation of mTOR and phosphorylation of the mTOR targets p70 S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The effects of amino acid changes to TSC1 or TSC2 on TSC1-TSC2 complex formation, on the activation of rheb GTPase activity by the complex, and on the phosphorylation status of S6K and S6 can be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Pathogenic missense changes towards the N-terminus of TSC2 prevent formation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, while missense changes towards the C-terminus do not prevent TSC1-TSC2 binding but disrupt the rhebGAP activity of TSC2 directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Pathogenic TSC1 missense changes are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, recent studies of TSC1 missense variants identified in bladder cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in patients with TSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have shown that TSC1 amino acid substitutions can be pathogenic, reducing steady state levels of TSC1 and leading to increased mTOR activity.</p><p>Here, we test 13 <italic>TSC1 </italic>variants identified during mutation screening of individuals with TSC. Our analysis confirms that pathogenic <italic>TSC1 </italic>missense mutations reduce steady state levels of TSC1, and result in increased mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we find that the intracellular localisation of pathogenic and neutral TSC1 variants is distinct. The pathogenic TSC1 amino acid substitutions are clustered within the conserved, hydrophobic N-terminal region of TSC1, indicating that this region plays an important role in TSC1 function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Comparative analysis of TSC1 amino acid substitutions</title><p><italic>TSC1 </italic>missense variants identified in individuals with TSC, or suspected of having TSC, and submitted to the LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>mutation database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] were chosen for analysis.

These scores give an indication of the differences between amino acid pairs based on amino acid composition, polarity and molecular volume, as well as substitution frequencies. Both matrices indicated that the amino acid substitutions listed in the LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>database in general become more conservative towards the C-terminal of TSC1. We also performed a SIFT analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] using a multiple sequence alignment of TSC1 derived from 14 different species (human, chimpanzee, maccaca, cow, dog, horse, mouse, rat, chicken, pufferfish, honey bee, fruitfly, mosquito and fission yeast). The SIFT algorithm combines information from both the chemical structure of the individual amino acids and the evolutionary conservation of the protein to predict for each amino acid residue which substitutions can be tolerated by the protein. The results of the SIFT analysis are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Overall, the N-terminal (amino acids 1 - 270) and C-terminal (amino acids 680 - 1164) regions of TSC1 did not tolerate amino acid substitutions while the central region (amino acids 270 - 680) was predicted to be more tolerant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Of the 13 substitutions selected for this study, 7 were predicted to be tolerated and therefore unlikely to be pathogenic (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Of these, 5 were located in the central, substitution-tolerant region of TSC1 (amino acids 270 - 680). Six substitutions were predicted not to be tolerated and therefore likely to be pathogenic. All of these changes were located in the substitution-intolerant N-terminal region (amino acids 1 - 270). Finally, we investigated the effect of the substitutions on the hydrophobicity of TSC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Three substitutions, p.E51D, p.Q550E and p.D658E, had no significant effect. These were all predicted by the SIFT algorithm to be tolerated changes. Of the remaining tolerated changes, p.S334L, p.E478G and p.A659V increased the hydrophobicity, while the p.I807T substitution had the opposite effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In the group of changes not tolerated by the SIFT analysis, the p.L50P, p.L61P, p.L93R and p.V133F substitutions decreased the hydrophobicity while the p.R190C and p.R190P substitutions increased the hydrophobicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Predicted effects of amino acid substitutions on TSC1</bold>.

Our findings are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The <italic>TSC1 </italic>c.149T&#x0003e;C (p.L50P), c.182T&#x0003e;C (p.L61P), c.278T&#x0003e;G (p.L93R), c.397G&#x0003e;T (p.V133F) and c.569G&#x0003e;C (p.R190P) changes resulted in reduced levels of TSC1, a reduction in the TSC1-TSC2-dependent inhibition of mTOR activity and a distinct intracellular expression pattern compared to wild-type TSC1. We conclude that these changes are pathogenic. According to the LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>mutation database the p.L61P and p.L93R substitutions are probably pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our functional analysis supports this conclusion. The p.L50P, p.V133F and p.R190P substitutions are classified as being of unknown pathogenicity in the database.

The LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>mutation database lists the c.153A&#x0003e;C (p.E51D), c.568C&#x0003e;T (p.R190C) and c.1001C&#x0003e;T (p.S334L) variants as probably not pathogenic, and our functional analysis indicates that they are neutral variants. Furthermore, mutation screening in additional individuals with TSC resulted in the identification of definite pathogenic <italic>TSC2 </italic>mutations in patients carrying the c.153A&#x0003e;C (p.E51D), c.568C&#x0003e;T (p.R190C) and c.1001C&#x0003e;T (p.S334L) substitutions, confirming the classification of these variants as non-pathogenic (data not shown). The LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>mutation database lists the c.1648C&#x0003e;G (p.Q550E) and c.2420T&#x0003e;C (p.I807T) variants as being of unknown pathogenicity. Our analysis indicates that these variants are not pathogenic, although we could not confirm experimentally that they do not affect <italic>TSC1 </italic>mRNA splicing.</p><p>The c.1433A&#x0003e;G (E478G) substitution is listed as being of unknown pathogenicity and did not affect TSC1 function in our assays. However, one of three splice site prediction programs identified a potential effect of this substitution on splicing. We did not have access to RNA from this particular individual so we compared the activity of the protein product of the predicted splice isoform to wild-type TSC1, the E478G variant and the L117P pathogenic variant. We did not observe any differences between the predicted TSC1 E478GinsGN variant and either wild-type TSC1 or the E478G [see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Therefore, we did not find any evidence that the c.1433A&#x0003e;G substitution was pathogenic.</p><p>All of the amino acid substitutions that affected TSC1 function in our assays were in the N-terminal region of TSC1 that was shown by our SIFT analysis to be relatively intolerant of amino acid changes (amino acids 1 - 270; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Two amino acid substitutions from this region, p.E51D and p.R190C, did not affect TSC1 function in our assays. Aspartate (E) and glutamate (D) are acidic amino acids. The BLOSUM 62 and Grantham matrices classify this substitution as conservative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and our SIFT analysis predicted that the p.E51D substitution should be tolerated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Therefore, in this case, the experimental data were in agreement with the <italic>in silico </italic>predictions. In contrast, the p.R190C substitution was non-conservative according to the BLOSUM 62 and Grantham matrices and was not tolerated according to our SIFT analysis. The predictions were therefore inaccurate for this particular amino acid substitution since the functional analysis did not reveal an effect on TSC1 function, and genetic analysis indicated that the substitution was not pathogenic. This result demonstrates that a conclusion with respect to pathogenicity based on <italic>in silico </italic>analysis only should be made with caution.</p><p>To provide clinicians and researchers with the maximum amount of information, gene variant databases should move towards incorporating both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in silico </italic>data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We will add the functional and <italic>in silico </italic>results on the variants described here to the LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>database as part of the individual entries. We will include the BLOSUM 62, Grantham and SIFT scores as well as the potential splice effects of the different variants. However, for all apparent missense variants, conclusions with regard to pathogenicity will continue to rely on clinical, family and functional data. As the above example shows, although <italic>in silico </italic>analysis is a valuable research tool, it is not yet reliable enough to inform clinical decisions.</p><p>All the pathogenic TSC1 amino acid substitutions identified to date map between residues 50 and 224 (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). One explanation for the apparent clustering of pathogenic amino acid substitutions to this region is that it is critical for TSC1 function. Alternatively, these substitutions may simply be less conservative than the neutral variants we tested. Although the pathogenic substitutions between amino acids 50 and 190 identified in this study were not conservative, there was no clear distinction between these changes and other neutral substitutions. For example, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the neutral p.R190C variant is a non-conservative, non-tolerated substitution that is predicted to have a large effect on TSC1 hydrophobicity, while the pathogenic p.R190P variant is a more conservative substitution and has a less dramatic effect on TSC1 hydrophobicity. Similarly, the p.V133F substitution is more conservative than the p.R190C substitution and has a relatively mild effect on TSC1 hydrophobicity, yet still has a dramatic effect on TSC1 function in our assays. In addition to the p.E51D and p.R190C substitutions, 6 other TSC1 amino acid substitutions did not affect TSC1 function in our assays. The neutral p.S334L and p.E478G substitutions are non-conservative changes located within the substitution-tolerant central region of TSC1 defined by the SIFT analysis (amino acids 270 - 680; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The neutral, non-conservative p.I807T substitution lies outside this central region, but was also predicted by the SIFT algorithm to be tolerated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The neutral p.Q550E, p.A659V and p.D658E substitutions are all conservative, tolerated changes. The results of the <italic>in silico </italic>and functional analyses are consistent with the N-terminal of TSC1 being a conserved, substitution-intolerant region that has an important role in maintaining TSC1 expression and activity in the cell.</p><p>The L50P, L61P, L93R, V133F and R190P variants were detected at lower levels compared to wild-type TSC1 and the E51D, R190C, S334L, Q550E, D658E, A659V and I807T variants. Inhibition of proteosome-mediated degradation resulted in increased levels of the L50P and L117P variants, indicating that the pathogenic TSC1 variants are normally rapidly degraded by the proteosome. Interestingly, increasing the levels of the TSC1 L50P and L117P variants by inhibiting proteosome activity resulted in an increase in mTOR activity, as estimated by the extent of S6K T389 phosphorylation. Therefore, increased expression of the L50P and L117P variants had a dominant negative effect on mTOR signalling. One possible explanation for this effect is that the mutant variants sequester TSC2 in inactive TSC1-TSC2 complexes, thereby reducing the capacity of the cells to inhibit mTOR activity. Therefore, MG-132 treatment may help distinguish more clearly between pathogenic and non-pathogenic TSC1 variants.</p><p>It is unlikely that this dominant negative effect is significant <italic>in vivo </italic>in TSC patients because, as our studies indicate, the L50P and L117P variants are rapidly degraded compared to wild-type TSC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, it could provide an explanation for the relative scarcity of <italic>TSC1 </italic>missense mutations. It is possible that other missense variants are stable and do have a dominant negative effect on TSC1-TSC2 function <italic>in vivo </italic>that is incompatible with embryonic survival.</p><p>Further study is required to explore in more detail how amino acids close to the N-terminal (residues 50 - 224) are important for TSC1 function. One possibility is that they are necessary for the proposed membrane localisation of TSC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Alternatively, they may mediate other inter- or intramolecular interactions. Our observation that pathogenic amino acid substitutions prevent the formation of large TSC1-containing aggregate structures suggests that amino acids 50 - 224 may help mediate TSC1 homodimerisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have analysed 13 <italic>TSC1 </italic>variants identified in TSC patients that cause missense changes to the TSC1 protein, and identified 5 pathogenic substitutions. Our data confirm that functional assays can be used to differentiate between neutral and pathogenic variants, facilitating the identification of pathogenic mutations in individuals with TSC and providing insight into how specific amino acid residues contribute to protein function.</p><p>Amino acids close to the N-terminal of TSC1 (amino acids 50 - 190) are essential for TSC1 function. Amino acid changes to this region prevent the formation of large TSC1 aggregates and promote proteosome-mediated degradation of the protein, thereby reducing steady state levels of TSC1 and resulting in increased signalling through mTOR. Rapid degradation of the mutant TSC1 isoforms <italic>in vivo </italic>most likely prevents the possible dominant negative effects of these variants on TSC1-TSC2-dependent inhibition of mTOR signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TSC: tuberous sclerosis complex; GAP: GTPase activating protein; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K: p70 S6 kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MM, MHW and MN performed the practical work; mutation information was provided by DK, JS, AvdO and DH; RE, SP and JdD are responsible for curation of the LOVD <italic>TSC1 </italic>mutation database.
