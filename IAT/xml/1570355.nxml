The biological activities of VEGF are mediated mainly through two tyrosine kinase receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(Flt-1) and fetal liver kinase-1/kinase-insert domain receptor (Flk-1/KDR), whose expressions are mainly restricted to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These receptors are membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinases that bind VEGF with high affinity. Flk-1 is now considered to be the main receptor involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, survival, and the dominant form in pulmonary vascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, Flt-1 has a decoy effect on VEGF signaling, possibly with variations related to the vascular bed type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Both Flt-1- and Flk-1-deficient mice die <italic>in utero </italic>between embryonic days (E) 8.5 and E 9.5 but have different phenotypes. Flt-1-deficient embryos showed an overgrowth of endothelial cells, disorganization of blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and normal vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that the Flt-1 tyrosine kinase is not necessary for vasculogenesis during development. On the other hand, Flk-1-deficient mice lack both mature endothelial and hematopoietic cells, indicating that Flk-1 is crucial for vascular development of both endothelial and hematopoietic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During later stages of embryonic development, Flk-1 is highly expressed on endothelial cells, but is down-regulated in most hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the adult, the expression level of Flk-1 is low, restricted to endothelial cells and transiently upregulated during angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>studies have shown that Flk-1 expression is temporally regulated by several growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and by shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For example, both basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;(TNF-&#x003b1;) have been shown to induce expression of the endogenous Flk-1 gene and increase Flk-1 upstream promoter activity in cultured endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been known that shear stress induces Flk-1 expression through the CT-rich Sp1 binding site within Flk-1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Incubation of cells with the multifunctional angiogenic cytokine transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) results in a rapid and marked decrease in Flk-1 expression levels and cell surface <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Because expression of Flk-1 is highly restricted to endothelial cells and tightly controlled during angiogenesis, further understanding of the potential factors that regulate the expression of Flk-1 in the lung and endothelium would provide general insights into the mechanisms of vascular development in health and diseases in the pulmonary circulation.</p><p>Hypoxia-induced mitogenic factor (HIMF) is a secreted protein from airway epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells and it is originally discovered in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Subsequent studies showed that HIMF is a lung-specific growth factor participating in lung cell proliferation and modulation of compensatory lung growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HIMF possesses an angiogenic function that promotes vascular tubule formation in a matrigel plug model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and is developmentally regulated and exhibits antiapoptotic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, our recent studies have indicated that HIMF modulates surfactant protein B and C expression in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have also established that HIMF promotes VEGF production in alveolar type II cells, indicating HIMF may play critical roles in angiogenesis in the pulmonary system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms of HIMF on Flk-1 expression in mouse lungs, and in cultured endothelial cells. The results showed that HIMF promotes expression of Flk-1 via activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Adult male C57Bl/6 mice (10&#x02013;12 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

The DNA constructs were verified by sequence analysis. The NF-&#x003ba;B <italic>firefly </italic>luciferase reporter vector, pNF&#x003ba;B-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), is designed to measure the binding of transcription factors to the &#x003ba; enhancer.

The reporter plasmid was transiently transfected into SVEC-HIMF, which resulted in higher Flk-1 promoter activities than those of its counterparts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). HIMF treatment of pGL-Flk-1(-258/+299)-transfected SVEC 4&#x02013;10 cells induced significant increases of luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It has been reported that Flk-1 mRNA stability is an important posttranscriptional parameter that modulates Flk-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible that HIMF treatment enhances Flk-1 mRNA stability. To test this possibility, we used Actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor that blocks transcription. However, Flk-1 mRNA degradation was still observed when treatment of SVEC 4&#x02013;10 cells with HIMF and Actinomycin D (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

It is unclear, though, whether there is interplay between PI-3K/Akt and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in endothelial cells, and whether such interplay is necessary for HIMF-induced Flk-1 production. We therefore first tested the activation of main components of PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway upon HIMF treatment by Western blot. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, HIMF strongly induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK, but not JNK MAPK in SVEC 4&#x02013;10 cells.

Five endothelial cell-specific tyrosine kinase receptors, each of which has a specific role in blood vessel formation, have been identified. These include Tie-1, Tie-2 (also known as Tek), Flt-1, Flt-4, and Flk-1/KDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. While the ligands for Tie-1 and Tie-2 have not yet been identified, Flk-1 and Flt-1 are receptors for VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], an endothelial cell-specific mitogen whose importance in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One of the important functions of Flk-1 is the stimulation of vascular endothelial cell survival, growth, and promotion of angiogenesis. In the lung, Flk-1 also plays central roles in alveolar formation. It is worthy to note that coordinated alveolar development and angiogenesis are critical for lung maturation as a gas exchange organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Inhibition of Flk-1 by specific inhibitor SU5416 resulted in decreased alveolarization in developing lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and severe hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], indicating the fundamental roles of Flk-1 in lung development and maintenance of homeostasis in the pulmonary circulation. Although VEGF receptors have been characterized extensively at the level of expression, high affinity VEGF binding, phosphorylation, and other signal transduction properties, very little is known about factors which regulate its expression in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. An understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the transcriptional regulation of the Flk-1/KDR gene might provide important information about the molecular basis of endothelial cell differentiation, vascular development, and further assist our understanding in pulmonary angiogenesis. In the present study, we found that HIMF enhances Flk-1 expression in mouse lung tissues and endothelial cell line by activation of the PI-3K/Akt-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. In addition, our recent studies indicated that VEGF expression in lung epithelial cells can be induced by HIMF via the same signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that additional transcription factors are involved in HIMF-mediated cell type-specific modulation of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1. Furthermore, HIMF, as it has dual function in upregulation of VEGF in epithelial cells and its receptor in endothelial cells, may serve as a coordinator in the control of pulmonary development and maturation, which certainly warrants further investigation.</p><p>Both mouse (Flk-1) and human (KDR) genes reveal a class II promoter structure, characterized by the absence of a TATA box and by the presence of several conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, including Sp1-, AP-2-, NF-&#x003ba;B-, and GATA-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The upstream NF-&#x003ba;B site has been demonstrated to be the important one in mediating basal expression of the Flk-1/KDR promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, an overlapping palindromic GATA sequence plays a role in mediating constitutive promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It has been previously shown that TNF-&#x003b1; activates NF-&#x003ba;B function to enhance human KDR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits Flk-1/KDR expression through a mechanism that involves reduced binding of GATA-2 to a palindromic GATA site in the 5'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These findings indicate that the binding of specific sets of transcription factors to the promoter region is necessary to modulate the expression of Flk-1 in response to different stimuli. In the current study, we found that HIMF protein upregulated Flk-1 expression by enhancing the Flk-1 promoter activity, rather than stabilizing Flk-1 mRNA posttranscriptionally. Moreover, the NF-&#x003ba;B activity was induced by HIMF administration or HIMF overexpression. Impairing NF-&#x003ba;B binding to the Flk-1 promoter via site-directed mutation or deletion abolishes HIMF-induced Flk-1 transcription, demonstrating a critical role of NF-&#x003ba;B in HIMF-mediated Flk-1 upregulation. In addition, we also found that deletion of binding sites for transcription factors E-box, Sp-1, and AP-2 partially attenuated HIMF-induced Flk-1 transcription, indicating that these transcription factors in the Flk-1 promoter also participate in HIMF-induced Flk-1 upregulation. The activation and interaction of these transcription factors and their correlation with NF-&#x003ba;B activity warrant our further study in the future.</p><p>The stimulating effects of HIMF on Flk-1 upregulation in SVEC 4&#x02013;10 cells can only maintain for 24 hours. The dramatic decrease of NF-&#x003ba;B activity at 48 hour time point might be a result of HIMF degradation because we only administered the HIMF protein at the beginning of the experiment. These effects parallel with the activation of IKK and increased PI-3K activities as we showed that blocking IKK or PI-3K abolished HIMF-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity and decreased Flk-1 mRNA production. The quick degradation or lost activity of HIMF further indicates that HIMF is a cytokine-like molecule and an early response gene to hypoxia, inflammation or other stress related stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is composed of heterodimers of DNA-binding subunits (p50 and p52) and subunits with transcriptional activity (RelA, RelB, or c-Rel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In unstimulated cells, binary complexes of these subunits are restricted to the cytoplasm by interaction with members of a family of inhibitory proteins, inhibitors of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;Bs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In response to extracellular stimuli, phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; on serines 32 and 36 and of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; on serines 19 and 23 facilitate their ubiquitination on neighboring lysine residues, thereby targeting these proteins for rapid degradation by the proteosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Dissociation from I&#x003ba;Bs unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-&#x003ba;B, permitting it to move into the nucleus, bind the promoters of target genes, and subsequently alter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although NF-&#x003ba;B can be activated by different stimuli, a high molecular weight I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex, termed IKK signalsome, serves as the key point that converges diverse upstream signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Activated IKK complexes phosphorylate I&#x003ba;B proteins, promoting their dissociation from NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study, we found that HIMF administration induced phosphorylation of IKK and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Moreover, transfection of the dominant-negative mutants of IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;, and an I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; super-repressor abolished HIMF-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation. These data support the notion that HIMF activates NF-&#x003ba;B through phosphorylation of IKK and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;.</p><p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) is a heterodimer of an 85-kDa (p85) adaptor subunit and a 100-kDa (p110) catalytic subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. PI-3K activation has been linked to a number of biological processes such as cell survival, membrane trafficking, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The serine-threonine protein kinase Akt is a downstream target of PI-3K-generated signals. A number of different growth factors have been shown to rapidly activate Akt via PI-3K signaling, such as platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, bFGF, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Akt may affect NF-&#x003ba;B through multiple mechanisms. It has been demonstrated previously that TNF-&#x003b1; activates Akt, which phosphorylates and activates IKK&#x003b1;, thus promoting NF-&#x003ba;B function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interleukin-1 can also increase the transactivation potential of the RelA subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B through a mechanism in which Akt has been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that HIMF induced Akt phosphorylation in SVEC 4&#x02013;10 cells. The time-course of Akt phosphorylation is compatible with that of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in HIMF stimulated cells. Pretreatment of cells with LY294002, a PI-3K specific inhibitor, attenuated HIMF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Further, transfection of &#x00394;p85 blocked HIMF-induced phosphorylation of the IKK and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and thus prevented upregulation of Flk-1. These results provided strong evidence of HIMF induced cell signaling in endothelial cells via PI-3K/Akt, which cross talks with NF-&#x003ba;B, in the mediation of Flk-1 upregulation.</p><p>In summary, the current studies indicated that HIMF enhances Flk-1 expression in mouse lung tissues and endothelial cells in a PI-3K/Akt-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway-dependent manner, which at least in part, elucidated the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the Flk-1/KDR gene and contributed to our better understanding of the functions of HIMF in pulmonary angiogenesis and maintenance of pulmonary vascular homeostasis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH RO1 grants HL075755 (D.
