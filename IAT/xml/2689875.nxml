This study investigated the effect of Robo4 on the formation of fibrovascular membranes (FVMs) from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and its roles in choroid&#x02013;retina endothelial (RF/6A) and human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>RT&#x02013;PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the levels of mRNA and the presence and distribution of Robo4 in FVMs. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology was used to knock down Robo4 expression and to study its effects on RF/6A and RPE cells in vitro. Cell proliferation, migration, spreading, cycling, and apoptosis were assessed with MTT assay, Boyden chamber assay, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry.

Many problems associated with pathological angiogenesis do not arise directly from the growth of new blood vessels but from abnormalities in the newly formed microvasculature, such as increased permeability. Current treatments attempt to abolish these new vessels and/or to prevent their formation. However, a more effective intervention may be to stabilize these abnormal vessels or cause them to mature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p><italic>Robo4</italic> is a member of the roundabout (<italic>Robo</italic>) family, which contains guidance receptors involved in neurogenesis, which mediate a repulsive signal signal that keeps navigating axons from crossing the midline inappropriately during the process of axonal guidance. The Robo family contains large transmembrane receptors, comprising <italic>Robo1, Robo2, Robo3</italic>, and <italic>Robo4. Robo4</italic> is also known as &#x0201c;magic roundabout&#x0201d; (<italic>MRB</italic>). All known Robo family members have a large extracellular domain composed of five immunoglobulin and three fibronectin motifs, except <italic>Robo4</italic>, the extracellular domain of which consists of only two immunoglobulins and two fibronectin motifs, and is quite different from the other <italic>Robos. Robo4</italic> was first identified as an endothelial-specific member of the roundabout family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and was later shown by Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] to be differentially expressed in activin-like kinase-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which exhibit impaired angiogenesis during development. In silico and in vitro expression analyses indicated that <italic>Robo4</italic> is highly endothelial specific and is strongly upregulated in the vessels of tumors in the brain, colon, and bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In zebrafish, the knockdown or overexpression of <italic>Robo4</italic> resulted in the temporal and spatial disruption of embryonic vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], whereas in Robo4-knockout mice, the patterning of the intersomitic and cephalic vessels was normal during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], indicating that <italic>Robo4</italic> may have different roles in different species. The expression patterns of <italic>Robo4</italic> differ across species. In zebrafish, <italic>Robo4</italic> is expressed in both neural tissues and the vascular system, whereas in mice, <italic>Robo4</italic> expression is confined to vessels. Murine embryonic <italic>Robo4</italic> expression shows a dynamic pattern within vessels, with expression starting in the larger axial vessels and intersomitic vessels in the earlier embryonic stages, but changing to intersomitic vessel and capillary expression in later stages. However, in the adult, <italic>Robo4</italic> is highly expressed in complex and well organized vascular networks, such as those in the lung, liver, and heart. The expression patterns of <italic>Robo4</italic> observed in embryonic and adult tissues suggest that it may be important in guiding and maintaining the highly reproducible vascular patterning (i.e., the formation of tubular structures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. More recently, defects have been identified in the vascular integrity of <italic>Robo4</italic>-knockout mice, which exacerbate the pathological conditions associated with vascular leakage, suggesting that <italic>Robo4</italic> provides a tonic signal that stabilizes the retinal blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Robo4 expression has been detected in endothelial cells but not in nonendothelial cell lines, such as fibroblasts and endometrial stoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>RF/6A, a choroid&#x02013;retinal endothelial cell line derived from a rhesus macaque fetus, is evolutionarily close to retinal cells derived from humans. It has been identified as of endothelial origin based on cellular morphology and immunodiffusion and is widely used in studies of retinal endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has important functions in both the normal eye and under pathological conditions. Recently, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, VEGFR2, have been shown to be highly expressed by the RPE and in the underlying mesenchyme, respectively, at the time of choriocapillary formation in both humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although there have been many studies of <italic>Robo4</italic> expression, the biologic function of <italic>Robo4</italic> in the retinal vascular disease is yet to be demonstrated.

There are several gene families with established roles in axon guidance that also control endothelial cell guidance and the angiogenic sprouting of blood vessels. Semaphorins, neuropilin, ephrins/ephs, notch, and delta, are well known as repulsive guidance cues in the nervous system. However, they were also demonstrated to regulate blood vessel branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Previous studies of Robo4 have been performed predominantly in zebrafish and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and until now, there has been no report of Robo4 expression in human eye tissue. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that <italic>Robo4</italic> mRNA is expressed in the FVMs of human eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The results of dual-color immunofluorecence analysis of the FVMs also showed positive Robo4 staining in the fibrous-like tissue and the neovascular endothelial cells. The Robo4 staining partially colocalized with GFAP, which suggests that Robo4 expression may not be confined to the vessels but also in neural tissues. These observations suggest that Robo4 plays a role in the formation of FVMs.</p><p>RNA interference mediated by siRNA is a powerful technology, allowing the silencing of mammalian genes with great specificity and potency. However, nonspecific effects at both the mRNA and protein levels are known to occur with siRNA methods and constitute one of the limitations of this technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. In our study, we observed a significant difference between the <italic>Robo4</italic>-specific siRNA-treated group and the control siRNA-treated group, but there were no differences between the NS siRNA-treated, HF-treated, and untreated controls in all assays. These results suggest that the application of siRNA was experimentally valid and that its transfection induced no cytotoxicity. In our study, <italic>Robo4</italic>-specific siRNA was an effective and specific inhibitor of the attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation of both RF/6A and RPE cells.</p><p>Tube formation is one of the main characteristics of retinal and choroid vascular endothelial cells. Tube formation on Matrigel was used to measure the physiologic effects of Robo4 on RF/6A cells. Robo4-knockdown RF/6A cells showed markedly reduced tubule formation and failed to develop vascular networks on Matrigel. Therefore, Robo4 might play a role in maintaining the tube-forming properties of RF/6A cells.</p><p>Cell migration is another principal indicator of the normal physiologic functions of endothelial and epithelial cells. RF/6A and RPE cells transfected with <italic>Robo4</italic> siRNA presented significantly reduced cell migration compared with that of control cells, whereas overexpressed Robo4 in endothelial cells blocked the migration of endothelial cells toward VEGF and fibroblast growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. This suggests that the overexpression of <italic>Robo4</italic> resulted in a similar phenotype as that induced by <italic>Robo4</italic> siRNA, implying that too little or too much Robo4 has the same detrimental effect on cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], and that appropriate <italic>Robo4</italic> expression may sustain the migration properties of cells.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether Robo4 affects the proliferation of RF/6A and RPE cells. No inhibition was apparent in the <italic>Robo4</italic>-siRNA-treated cells for 48 h. The effect on cell growth was observed in both RF/6A and RPE cells and is probably attributable to G<sub>1</sub>/S cell-cycle arrest. The role of Robo4 on the two cell lines was a little different at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase: <italic>Robo4</italic> siRNA reduced the numbers of RPE cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase but had no effect on the RF/6A cells. This difference between the two cell types may be attributable to species or cell-type differences: RF/6A is an endothelial cell line, and RPE is an epithelial cell line.</p><p>In this study, we exposed RF/6A and RPE cells to hypoxic conditions in vitro to mimic the hypoxia experienced by endothelial and epithelial cells in ischemic retinal and choroid diseases in vivo. We found that under normoxic conditions, there was no significant difference in cell apoptosis between the <italic>Robo4</italic>-siRNA-treated and NS groups, whereas under hypoxic conditions, more apoptotic cells were detected in the <italic>Robo4</italic>-siRNA-treated group than in the NS group. These results suggest that Robo4 does not affect cell apoptosis under normal conditions but increases cell tolerance of hypoxic conditions. This is consistent with a previous study in which a model of retinopathy of prematurity in Robo4AP/AP mice showed increased angiogenesis and vascular leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study indicates that Robo4 may play a role in the formation of FVMs. Silencing Robo4 expression in RF/6A and RPE cells inhibited their proliferation, migration, spreading, tube formation, and tolerance of hypoxia, and thus may be involved in retina vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This
