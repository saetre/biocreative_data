This process is accompanied by activation of hundreds of muscle-specific genes and repression of genes associated with cell proliferation or pluripotency. Mechanisms controlling myogenesis are precisely coordinated and regulated in time to allow the sequence of activation/inactivation of genes expression. Muscular differentiation is the result of the interplay between several processes such as transcriptional induction, transcriptional repression and mRNA stability. mRNA stability is now recognized as an essential mechanism of control of gene expression. For instance, we previously showed that the endoribonuclease L (RNase L) and its inhibitor (RLI) regulates MyoD mRNA stability and consequently muscle differentiation.</p><p>We now performed global gene expression analysis by SAGE to identify genes that were down-regulated upon activation of RNase L in C2C12 myogenic cells, a model of satellite cells. We found that RNase L regulates mRNA stability of factors implicated in the control of pluripotency and cell differentiation. Moreover, inappropriate RNase L expression in C2C12 cells led to inhibition of myogenesis and differentiation into adipocytes even when cells were grown in conditions permissive for muscle differentiation. Conversely, over-expression of RLI allowed muscle differentiation of myogenic C2C12 cells even in non permissive conditions.</p><p>These findings reveal the central role of RNase L and RLI in controlling gene expression and cell fate during myogenesis. Our data should provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that control muscle stem cell differentiation and into the mechanism of metaplasia observed in aging or muscular dystrophy where adipose infiltration of muscle occurs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult skeletal muscle has an exceptional capacity of regeneration. Indeed, it is capable of responding to physiological stimuli for routine maintenance or after a severe injury by complete repair of the tissue. This feature is due to the presence of satellite cells, a quiescent population of resident stem cells that are located beneath the basal lamina and which can generate large quantities of differentiated muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Montarras1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Zammit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several works have demonstrated that myogenic cells express some adipogenic markers and that, following specific stimulation, they can differentiate, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, into adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Teboul1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Asakura1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, myogenic cells can potentially differentiate both into myoblasts and adipocytes and in some conditions a change in differentiation program could take place.</p><p>Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that control the proliferation and the possible alternative differentiation pathways of myogenic cells is, therefore, central to understanding their function and also is important in view of the use of satellite cells for therapy. The particular anatomical localization of satellite cells allows a combination of signals from the muscle fiber itself, the circulatory system and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to govern their quiescence, activation and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Shefer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Interferon (IFN) is one of the cytokines present in the satellite cell environment.

We have previously shown that the IFN-induced 2-5A/endoribonuclease L (RNase L) and RNase L Inhibitor (RLI), its inhibitor, play a role in myoblast differentiation by regulating the stability of MyoD mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Bisbal1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

By comparing global gene expression in C2C12 cells over-expressing RNase L and in control cells using SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Velculescu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> we identified different transcripts that are down-regulated by RNase L. Many of these mRNAs encode key factors implicated in the control of pluripotency, commitment and differentiation of stem cells. Some of these factors, like Aebp1 or Chop-10/Ddit3, are implicated in the choice between alternative differentiation pathways. Moreover, we show that increasing RNase L expression in C2C12 myogenic cells at an inappropriate time, such as early during the multipotency phase, favors their adipogenic potential rather than their myogenic potential. Conversely, RNase L inhibition by increasing RLI expression leads to muscle differentiation even in non-permissive culture medium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>For conditional expression of human RNase L, the LacSwitch II inducible mammalian expression system (Stratagene) was used.

Stress fibers and focal adhesion play a central role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling during muscle differentiation. Membrane-cytoskeleton interaction regulates transmembrane currents and Ca2&#x0002b; influx and participates in signal transduction leading to the regulation of numerous cellular processes such as gene expression and cell differentiation and in particular cell fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Sbrana1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Formigli1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although RNase L has no great sequence specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Floyd1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, its activation influenced the stability of only a small numbers of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007563.s004">Table S1</xref>).

Modification in the kinetics of RNase L activation and inhibition leads to important perturbations in the choice of differentiation pathway (myogenesis versus adipogenesis) of C2C12 myogenic cells. Myogenesis is required not only for normal muscle development, but also for maintenance and repair of adult myofibers. Impairment in the process of muscle regeneration has been proposed as one of the important determinants of skeletal muscle wasting especially in aging and chronic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In these conditions, accumulation of adipose tissue is observed in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-TaylorJones1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Marden1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Adipose tissue development is associated with degenerative/regenerative or atrophic changes in skeletal muscle fibers and a common feature of these pathologies is a chronic inflammatory state of muscles. During chronic inflammation, several cytokines are produced continuously not only by immune cell infiltrates but also by muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-DeRossi1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Remels1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these different cytokines IFN is an important regulator of RNase L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Pandey1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007563-Khabar1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref>. If the role of IFN and inflammation has been widely studied and begins to be understood in human muscle regeneration, the role of enzymatic pathways regulated by IFN is still unknown. In particular, the role of RNase L has not yet been established in primary myoblasts. Our results show that the level of RNase L activity could modify muscle cell differentiation and engage them into adipocyte differentiation. On the other way, owing to their capacity to regenerate damaged muscle, satellite cells have been considered as candidates for cell based therapies to treat muscular dystrophies or other muscular diseases. Understanding the role of RNase L/RLI in the control of proliferation and induction of alternative differentiation pathways in satellite cells during inflammation is of medical importance and is central for the development of therapies based on their use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007563.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>C2-RNase L cells were treated with 5 mM IPTG for 6 h at day 0 and then: i) they were induced to differentiate in MDM (panels a); or ii) they were induced to differentiate in MDM and were treated again with 5 mM IPTG for 6 h at day 2 (panels b); or iii) they were induced to differentiate in MDM and were treated again with 5 mM IPTG for 6 h at day 2 and day 4 (panels c).
