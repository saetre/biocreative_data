The genes for the large subunit of the ribosomal RNA (LSUrRNA) as well as for subunit I of the cytochrome oxidase (coxI) carry two and three intronic sequences respectively. On the basis of their canonical nucleotide sequences they can be classified as group I introns. Phylogenetic comparisons of the coxI protein sequences allow us to conclude that the P.wickerhamii mtDNA is much closer related to higher plant mtDNAs than to those of the chlorophyte alga C.reinhardtii. The comparison of the intron sequences revealed several unusual features: (1) The P.wickerhamii introns are structurally related to mitochondrial introns from various ascomycetous fungi. (2) Phylogenetic analyses indicate a close relationship between fungal and algal intronic sequences. (3) The P. wickerhamii introns are located at positions within the structural genes which can be considered as preferred intron insertion sites in homologous mitochondrial genes from fungi or liverwort. In all cases, the sequences adjacent to the insertion sites are very well conserved over large evolutionary distances. Our finding of highly similar introns in fungi and algae is consistent with the idea that introns have already been present in the bacterial ancestors of present day mitochondria and evolved concomitantly with the organelles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0347.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="719"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0348.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="720"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0349.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="721"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0350.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="722"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0351.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="723"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0352.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="724"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0353.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="725"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0354.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="726"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
