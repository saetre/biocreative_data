This inhibition is mediated through the regulation of a DNA element present in each of these gene promoters, that we call the <underline>T</underline>hymine-rich <underline>I</underline>nsulin <underline>R</underline>esponse <underline>E</underline>lement (TIRE). The insulin signalling pathway that results in the inhibition of these gene promoters requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). However, the molecules that connect PI 3-kinase to these gene promoters are not yet fully defined. Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3) is inhibited following activation of PI 3-kinase. We have shown previously that inhibitors of GSK-3 reduce the activity of two TIRE-containing gene promoters (PEPCK and G6Pase), whose products are required for gluconeogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this report we demonstrate that in H4IIE-C3 cells, four distinct classes of GSK-3 inhibitor mimic the effect of insulin on a third TIRE-containing gene, IGFBP-1. We identify the TIRE as the minimum requirement for inhibition by these agents, and demonstrate that the target of GSK-3 is unlikely to be the postulated TIRE-binding protein FOXO-1. Importantly, overexpression of GSK-3 in cells reduces the insulin regulation of TIRE activity as well as endogenous IGFBP-1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results implicate GSK-3 as an intermediate in the pathway from the insulin receptor to the TIRE. Indeed, this is the first demonstration of an absolute requirement for GSK-3 inhibition in insulin regulation of gene transcription. These data support the potential use of GSK-3 inhibitors in the treatment of insulin resistant states such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, but suggest that it will be important to identify all TIRE-containing genes to assess potential side effects of these agents.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GSK-3</kwd><kwd>Insulin</kwd><kwd>IGFBP-1 gene transcription</kwd><kwd>TIRE</kwd><kwd>CHIR99021</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and II) have a broad range of biological activities that include the stimulation of mitogenesis and differentiation, and insulin-like effects on glucose uptake and lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These activities are modulated by a family of six binding proteins, termed the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs 1&#x02013;6) that bind IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). IGFBP-1 binds and inhibits the activity of IGF-I and IGF-II in plasma, by regulating their bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Administration of excess IGFBP-1, or overexpression of IGFBP-1 in transgenic mice, leads to glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Meanwhile, IGFBP-1 expression can be dynamically regulated by nutritional status, increasing during fasting, malnutrition and diabetes but decreasing upon re-feeding or insulin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Hepatic IGFBP-1 gene transcription is rapidly and completely inhibited by insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], however, the signalling pathway(s) that mediates this effect is less well defined. Insulin induces multiple intracellular signalling pathways in liver. Stimulation of the small G-protein Ras leads to activation of a protein kinase cascade consisting of Raf-1, MAP kinase kinase-1, p42/p44 MAP kinases and p90Rsk, while the activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase promotes the generation of 3-phosphoinositides that induce the activity of protein kinases such as 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PKB subsequently phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase -3 (GSK-3) at an N-terminal serine residue (Ser-21 on GSK-3&#x003b1; and Ser-9 on GSK-3&#x003b2;) rendering it inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This PKB-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 contributes to insulin activation of glycogen and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies using inhibitors of PI 3-kinase have demonstrated a requirement for this enzyme in insulin regulation of IGFBP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, overexpression of an active mutant of PKB mimics the effects of insulin on the IGFBP-1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This effect, at least in part, is mediated through the inhibition of a Thymine-rich Insulin Response Element (TIRE) that lies between residues -120 and -96 relative to the transcription start site of the human gene promoter. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-Phosphatase (G6Pase), rate-controlling enzymes of hepatic gluconeogenesis, possess a related regulatory element within their gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, members of the FOX(O) family of transcription factors (FKHR/FKHR-L1/AFX) have been linked to the regulation of the TIRE's found in these promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The expression of all of these genes, as well as the regulation of FOX(O), is inhibited by insulin through a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], suggesting that a common signalling pathway is utilised by insulin to regulate these related TIREs. However, insulin regulation of IGFBP-1 but not G6Pase or PEPCK gene expression is sensitive to an inhibitor of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, agents that strongly induce the MAPK pathway (e.g. phorbol esters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], reduce the sensitivity of the IGFBP-1, but not the G6Pase and PEPCK promoters to insulin. Therefore, aspects of the signalling networks used by insulin to repress each of these TIRE containing promoters appear distinct. Recently, we observed that GSK-3 activity was required for both PEPCK and G6Pase promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Selective inhibitors of GSK-3 reduce PEPCK and G6Pase gene transcription without requiring the activation of PKB. Indeed, the inhibition of GSK-3 may explain some of the effects of PKB overexpression on PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression. However, it was not clear why inhibition of GSK-3 should repress these promoters, whether inhibition of GSK-3 was actually required for insulin regulation of the genes, and whether the effect of GSK-3 inhibition was mediated through the TIRE.</p><p>In the present study, we have examined the role of GSK-3 in the regulation of a third TIRE-containing gene promoter, namely IGFBP-1. We demonstrate that four different classes of inhibitors of GSK-3 can mimic the action of insulin and reduce IGFBP-1 gene expression. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of GSK-3 reduces the activity of a heterologous promoter containing the IGFBP-1 TIRE, and propose that this mechanism underlies the repression of all three promoters by inhibitors of GSK-3. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time a requirement for inhibition of GSK-3 in the insulin regulation of the TIRE, and hence IGFBP-1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lithium ions reduce IGFBP-1 gene expression in H4IIE cells</title><p>Treatment of H4IIE cells with insulin completely inhibits both basal and glucocorticoid-induced IGFBP-1 gene expression.

Hence, the effects seen with these compounds on IGFBP-1 are likely to be due to the inhibition of GSK-3 rather than as a consequence of down/up-regulation of PKB, FOXO-1, MAPK or the mTOR pathway, which are known to effect IGFBP-1 gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>SB216763 and SB415286 reduce IGFBP-1 gene expression</italic>.

Meanwhile, adenoviral expression of GSK-3&#x003b2;-S9A also reduced the ability of insulin to repress IGFBP-1 mRNA in the H4IIE cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><italic>Overexpression of GSK-3&#x003b2; reduces insulin regulation of the IGFBP-1 TIRE</italic>.

A) Cells were incubated for 16 hours before transfection with 10 &#x003bc;g of BP-1 WT as described under the Methods section. After 24 hours at 37&#x000b0;C +/- insulin (10 nM) cells were lysed and either luciferase assays performed (upper panel) or GSK-3 levels determined by Western Blot (lower panel). Results in the upper panel are presented as % insulin repression of luciferase expression and are the means +/- S.E.M. of at least five experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Basal luciferase expression is 3-fold higher in WT and S9A-GSK-3 infected cells compared with control. The lower panels provide a representative analysis of expression of GSK-3 (in triplicate) in each treatment. There was a significant reduction in the effect of insulin on BP-1 WT when either GSK-3 WT (***p &#x0003c; 0.001, control vs WT) or GSK-3 S9A (***p &#x0003c; 0.001, control vs S9A) was overexpressed.

Therefore, we examined the effect of CHIR99021 on the ability of FOXO-1 to regulate TIRE activity. When FOXO-1 is co-expressed with BP-1 WT in H4IIE cells, the expression of luciferase is induced around 3-fold (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

The concentration of FOXO-1 used is less than maximal for induction of the BP-1 WT. This data suggests that FOXO-1 overexpression desensitises the TIRE to CHIR99021 and therefore that GSK-3 does not significantly regulate FOXO-1 activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><italic>CHIR99021 does not affect FOXO-1 transactivation potential</italic>.

This is reminiscent of the effect of lithium ions, SB216763 and SB415286 on two other insulin repressed gene promoters, PEPCK and G6Pase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Indeed, a heterologous promoter containing the IGFBP-1 TIRE (a related sequence is common to all three of these insulin-regulated gene promoters), is also inhibited by CHIR99021 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Similar promoter sequences are important for the insulin regulation of the tyrosine aminotransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], aspartate aminotransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], IRS-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and HMG CoA Synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] gene promoters. Our data would predict that all of these genes, and any other promoters containing a TIRE, are likely to be repressed by treatment of cells with inhibitors of GSK-3. This provides an apparent paradox since we and others have found that insulin does not regulate every TIRE-containing gene promoter by an identical mechanism. For example, insulin regulation of the IGFBP-1 (but not the PEPCK or G6Pase) gene promoter requires mTOR activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Meanwhile, FOXO-1 is a TIRE-binding protein that has been proposed to regulate these three genes. However, cells that stably overexpress FOXO-1 show increased G6Pase but not PEPCK expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and genetic manipulation of FOXO-1 has differential effects on these three gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These data demonstrate that distinct signalling mechanisms control the regulation of these three TIRE-containing genes. Therefore, each TIRE structure may require GSK-3 activity for function but distinct signalling networks link each gene promoter with the insulin receptor. The common requirement for GSK-3 activity suggests that a GSK-3 substrate is key for the initiation of gene transcription for each TIRE-containing promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of GSK-3 is required for full inhibition of the IGFBP-1 TIRE by insulin</title><p>Insulin induces PKB activity, promoting phosphorylation of Ser-21 of GSK-3&#x003b1; and Ser-9 of GSK-3&#x003b2;, thereby reducing total GSK-3 activity by between 20 and 80%, dependent on cell type. Therefore, expression of a mutant GSK-3&#x003b2; with Ser-9 replaced by alanine renders cellular GSK-3 activity insensitive to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, expression of this mutant significantly reduces the ability of insulin to repress BP-1 WT (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), or the endogenous gene promoter (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), demonstrating that insulin requires to inhibit GSK-3 for full repression of this gene promoter element. Similarly, four to five fold over expression of wild-type GSK-3&#x003b2; antagonises insulin repression of the BP-1 WT (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Although insulin will promote phosphorylation and inhibition (50&#x02013;60% in H4IIE cells) of this recombinant GSK-3 in cells, the overall activity remains higher than un-stimulated control cells. This suggests that insulin must reduce GSK-3 activity below a threshold in order to fully repress BP-1 WT. This is the first demonstration of an absolute requirement for GSK-3 inhibition in insulin regulation of gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>What is the molecular link between GSK-3 and the TIRE?</title><p>The GSK-3 inhibitors regulate IGFBP-1 gene expression in the absence of regulation of PKB, MAP kinase, FOXO-1 or mTOR ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), known regulators of the IGFBP-1 promoter. This suggests a more direct regulation of this element, possibly of a TIRE-interacting protein itself. There are numerous transcription factors that have been proposed to be substrates for GSK-3 <italic>in vitro </italic>and in some cases <italic>in vivo </italic>(for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). These include &#x003b2;-catenin, c-jun, CREB, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and c-myc. The phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], c-jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], GR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] by GSK-3 promotes their destruction or reduces their activity, while the phosphorylation of CREB (at Ser-129) is thought to increase CREB activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], although this has been subsequently questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Since inhibition of GSK-3 reduces TIRE activity, one presumes that GSK-3 mediated phosphorylation of a TIRE-binding protein would result in its activation (although possibly a permissive effect allowing activation by an additional mechanism), nuclear localisation or stabilisation. This would seem to rule out &#x003b2;-catenin, c-jun, GR and c-myc in the GSK-3-mediated regulation of the TIRE. Meanwhile CREB does not bind directly to a TIRE <italic>in vitro</italic>. The only known GSK-3 substrates that have been demonstrated to bind to or regulate the TIRE are members of the CAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. GSK-3 phosphorylates C/EBP&#x003b1; at Thr-222/Thr-226 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] while C/EBP&#x003b2; can regulate TIRE activity and is itself regulated by insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The reported regulation of C/EBP&#x003b2; by insulin is PI 3-kinase and PKB-dependent but is mediated through phosphorylation of the co-regulator protein p300/CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We are currently examining whether the GSK-3 inhibitors regulate C/EBP and p300 phosphorylation and/or activity. Meanwhile, Granner and colleagues have found that insulin treatment of H4IIE cells increases the cellular levels of LIP (an inhibitory form of C/EBP&#x003b2; that lacks the p300/CBP binding and activation domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. LIP subsequently replaces LAP (the activating form of C/EBP&#x003b2;) on the endogenous PEPCK promoter. This prevents the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and p300/CBP, eventually leading to the repression of PEPCK gene expression. However, the LIP/LAP interacting elements within the PEPCK promoter are distinct from the TIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Finally, our data suggests that the effect of GSK-3 inhibitors is independent of regulation of FOXO-1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), the best characterised TIRE-binding protein. Therefore, much more work will be required to identify the GSK-3 substrate that regulates this DNA element.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK-3 inhibitors as therapeutics</title><p>Agents that mimic the physiological processes that are regulated by insulin have the potential to be of therapeutic value for the treatment of insulin resistant states such as diabetes. Lithium chloride, SB216763, SB415286 and CHIR99021 inhibit GSK-3 and therefore mimic many of the actions of insulin. For instance, lithium chloride stimulates glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in adipocyte and muscle cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], while SB216763 and SB415286 stimulate glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, CHIR99021 potentiates insulin activation of glucose transport and utilisation in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and related compounds reduce muscle insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] in animal models of diabetes. We have found that GSK-3 inhibitors also mimic the ability of insulin to repress key metabolic genes such as PEPCK, G6Pase and IGFBP-1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Studies in animal models of diabetes suggest that these agents alleviate hyperglycaemia through both activation of glycogen synthesis and inhibition of hepatic glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, a vast number of biological processes are known to be regulated by GSK-3, thereby questioning their long term use as regulators of glucose homeostasis. Importantly, GSK-3 associates with and regulates proteins linked to the development of colonic cancer (APC, axin and &#x003b2;-catenin). Meanwhile, ablation of one of the two genes for GSK-3 (GSK-3&#x003b2;) in mice proved to be fatal due to increased hepatic sensitivity to TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Despite all of the potential problems that may be associated with GSK-3 inhibitors, deleterious effects of such compounds in animals remain to be formally reported. Currently, GSK-3 inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of numerous psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and even hair loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The work presented herein demonstrates for the first time that inhibition of GSK-3 is required for complete insulin regulation of IGFBP-1, while we have identified the DNA element by which GSK3 targets this gene promoter.
