Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;D), the most commonly used index of vitamin D status, is converted to the active hormone 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;<sub>2</sub>D), which, operating through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), inhibits in vitro cell proliferation, induces differentiation and apoptosis, and may protect against prostate cancer. Despite intriguing results from laboratory studies, previous epidemiological studies showed inconsistent associations of circulating levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and several VDR polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk. Few studies have explored the joint association of circulating vitamin D levels with VDR polymorphisms.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>During 18 y of follow-up of 14,916 men initially free of diagnosed cancer, we identified 1,066 men with incident prostate cancer (including 496 with aggressive disease, defined as stage C or D, Gleason 7&#x02013;10, metastatic, and fatal prostate cancer) and 1,618 cancer-free, age- and smoking-matched control participants in the Physicians' Health Study. We examined the associations of prediagnostic plasma levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, individually and jointly, with total and aggressive disease, and explored whether relations between vitamin D metabolites and prostate cancer were modified by the functional <italic>VDR</italic> FokI polymorphism, using conditional logistic regression. Among these US physicians, the median plasma 25(OH)D levels were 25 ng/ml in the blood samples collected during the winter or spring and 32 ng/ml in samples collected during the summer or fall. Nearly 13&#x00025; (summer/fall) to 36&#x00025; (winter/spring) of the control participants were deficient in 25(OH)D (&#x0003c;20 ng/ml) and 51&#x00025; (summer/fall) and 77&#x00025; (winter/spring) had insufficient plasma 25(OH)D levels (&#x0003c;32 ng/ml). Plasma levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D did not vary by season. Men whose levels for both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D were below (versus above) the median had a significantly increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio &#x0005b;OR&#x0005d; &#x0003d; 2.1, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 1.2&#x02013;3.4), although the interaction between the two vitamin D metabolites was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic><sub>interaction</sub> &#x0003d; 0.23). We observed a significant interaction between circulating 25(OH)D levels and the <italic>VDR</italic> FokI genotype (<italic>p</italic><sub>interaction</sub> &#x0003c; 0.05). Compared with those with plasma 25(OH)D levels above the median and with the FokI <italic>FF or Ff</italic> genotype, men who had low 25(OH)D levels and the less functional FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype had increased risks of total (OR &#x0003d; 1.9, 95&#x00025; CI 1.1&#x02013;3.3) and aggressive prostate cancer (OR &#x0003d; 2.5, 95&#x00025; CI 1.1&#x02013;5.8). Among men with plasma 25(OH)D levels above the median, the <italic>ff</italic> genotype was no longer associated with risk. Conversely, among men with the <italic>ff</italic> genotype, high plasma 25(OH)D level (above versus below the median) was related to significant 60&#x00025;&#x0223c;70&#x00025; lower risks of total and aggressive prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that a large proportion of the US men had suboptimal vitamin D status (especially during the winter/spring season), and both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may play an important role in preventing prostate cancer progression.

Patients whose disease is diagnosed when these cells are still relatively normal can survive for many years, but for patients with aggressive cancers&#x02014;ones containing fast-growing cells that can migrate around the body&#x02014;the outlook is poor. Factors that increase prostate cancer risk include increasing age, having a family history of prostate cancer, and being African American. Also, there are hints that some environmental or dietary factors affect prostate cancer risk. One of these factors is vitamin D, of which high levels are found in seafood and dairy products, but which can also be made naturally by the body&#x02014;more specifically, by sunlight-exposed skin. One reason researchers think vitamin D might protect against prostate cancer is that this cancer is more common in sun-starved northern countries (where people often have a vitamin D deficiency) than in sunny regions. Prostate cancer is also more common in African American men than in those of European descent (when exposed to the same amount of sunlight, individuals with darker skin make less vitamin D than those with lighter skin). Once in the human body, vitamin D is converted into the vitamin D metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;D) and then into the active hormone 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;<sub>2</sub>D). This binds to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and inhibits cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D on cells and the observation that related chemicals slow prostate cancer growth in rodents suggest that vitamin D protects against prostate cancer. But circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites in human male populations do not always reflect how many men develop prostate cancer. This lack of correlation may partly be because different forms of the VDR gene exist. One area of variation in the <italic>VDR</italic> gene is called the FokI polymorphism. Because everyone carries two copies of the <italic>VDR</italic> gene, individuals may have a FokI <italic>FF,</italic> FokI <italic>Ff,</italic> or FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype. The <italic>f</italic> variant (or allele) codes for a receptor that is less responsive to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D than the receptor encoded by the FokI <italic>F</italic> allele. So levels of vitamin D sufficient to prevent cancer in one person may be insufficient in someone with a different FokI genotype. In this study, the researchers have investigated how levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in combination with different <italic>VDR</italic> FokI alleles are influencing prostate cancer risk.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers identified 1,066 men who developed prostate cancer between enrollment into the US Physicians' Health Study in 1982 and 2000, and 1,618 cancer-free men of the same ages and smoking levels as &#x0201c;controls.&#x0201d; They measured vitamin D metabolite levels in many of the blood samples taken from these men in 1982 and determined their FokI genotype. Two-thirds of the men had insufficient blood levels of vitamin D metabolites in the winter/spring; almost one-third had a vitamin D deficiency. Men whose blood levels of both metabolites were below average were twice as likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer as those in whom both levels were above average. Compared with men with high blood levels of 25(OH)D and the FokI <italic>FF</italic> or <italic>Ff</italic> genotype, men with low 25(OH)D levels and the FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype were 2.5 times as likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer. However, men with the <italic>ff</italic> genotype were not at higher risk if they had sufficient 25(OH)D levels. Among men with the <italic>ff</italic> genotype, sufficient 25(OH)D levels might therefore protect against prostate cancer, especially against the clinically aggressive form.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings confirm that many US men have suboptimal levels of circulating vitamin D. This vitamin is essential for healthy bones, so irrespective of its effects on prostate cancer, vitamin D supplements might improve overall health. In addition, this large and lengthy study reveals an association between low levels of the two vitamin D metabolites and aggressive prostate cancer that is consistent with vitamin D helping to prevent the progression of prostate cancer. It also indicates that the <italic>VDR</italic> FokI genotype modifies the prostate cancer risk associated with different blood levels of vitamin D. Together, these results suggest that improving vitamin D status through increased exposure to sun and vitamin D supplements might reduce prostate cancer risk, particularly in men with the FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype. Because the study participants were mainly of European descent, the researchers caution that these results may not apply to other ethnic groups and note that further detailed studies are needed to understand fully how vitamin D affects prostate cancer risk across the population.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040103">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040103</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MedlinePlus encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000380.htm">prostate cancer</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002405.htm">vitamin D</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Information for patients and physicians is available from the US National Cancer Institute on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate">prostate cancer</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/prevention/index.html">cancer prevention</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prostatecancerfoundation.org/">Prostate Cancer Foundation</ext-link>'s information on prostate cancer discusses the effects of nutrition on the disease</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient information on prostate cancer is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=2657">Cancer Research UK</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Prostate">Cancerbackup</ext-link> also has patient information on prostate cancer</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Li H, Stampfer MJ, Hollis JBW, Mucci LA, Gaziano JM, et al.

Of these, limitations in funding permitted measuring baseline plasma vitamin D concentrations (25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;D and 1,25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;<sub>2</sub>D) for 492 patients with prostate cancer (diagnosed between 1982 and 1995) and 664 matched control participants. For VDR polymorphisms, 1,034 patients (and 1,566 control participants) had the FokI genotype data, and 1,010 patients (and 1,432 control participants) had the BsmI genotype data. We then had 461 to 471 patients and matched control participants to evaluate the potential interactions between plasma vitamin D metabolites and the VDR polymorphisms in relation to prostate cancer risk.</p><p>We compared allele and genotype frequencies between patients and control participants using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Because plasma vitamin D levels were not normally distributed, we selected nonparametric techniques for the comparisons of vitamin D metabolites between patients and control participants for batches one and two, separately. Since the results for all the following analyses were similar between batches, we combined data from the two batches and performed matched analyses. We examined the association of circulating levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in quartiles (with the highest quartile, defined by the distribution among controls, as the reference) and polymorphisms of FokI and BsmI (with the wild-type genotype as the reference) with risk of total prostate cancer. We then separately performed subgroup analyses for various subtypes of prostate cancer according to disease stage and grade at diagnosis, and whether those men developed metastases or died from prostate cancer by 2004. Because &#x0201c;high-grade&#x0201d; (Gleason score of 7&#x02013;10) and &#x0201c;high-stage&#x0201d; (stage C or D) are the strongest predictors of prostate cancer death, the associations (both direction and magnitude) of these subgroup analyses were similar to those of &#x0201c;metastatic/fatal&#x0201d; cancers, and the sample size for each cancer subtype was relatively small, we reported the results for aggressive prostate cancer, when these subgroups were combined, and for nonaggressive disease, those diagnosed with stage A or B and low-grade (Gleason score of 2&#x02013;6) prostate cancer. We further conducted stratified analyses by duration of follow-up, age at diagnosis (younger than 65 y or 65 y and older) or median age at baseline, and assessed age as a potential effect modifier. Because the levels of 25(OH)D (but not 1,25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;<sub>2</sub>D) were higher in samples collected during summer/fall and were lower in those collected during winter/spring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040103-t001">Table 1</xref>), presumably due to the difference in sun exposure, we used season- and batch-specific cutoff points for 25(OH)D and batch-specific cutoff points for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D based on levels of the control subjects. We then examined the joint associations of 25(OH)D with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D with the dichotomized variables (i.e., below or above median levels). Furthermore, we explored the interactions between these vitamin D metabolites and VDR polymorphisms in modifying prostate cancer risk. For VDR polymorphisms, we compared men who carried the homozygous variant genotype with the rest (the wild-type and the heterozygous genotypes combined) as the reference group. To examine whether any associations between vitamin D status and risk of prostate cancer were due to an effect of latent disease on plasma vitamin D status, we repeated all these analyses by excluding the patients diagnosed in the first 2 y of follow-up after the blood collection or the patients with baseline PSA levels 4 ng/ml or higher. Given that the PHS was a randomized trial, we also tested whether the associations of vitamin D, VDR polymorphisms with prostate cancer were modified by the &#x003b2;-carotene and the aspirin treatments.</p><p>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. Besides controlling for age, smoking, and follow-up period via the matched analysis, we adjusted for exercise (sufficient to induce sweating &#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;4, or &#x02265;5 times per week) and race (European descent, yes or no). Because only 6&#x00025; of the men in this study were not of European descent, we also repeated all the analyses excluding these individuals. We presented models without adjusting for dairy food (calcium) intake because adjustment for this factor did not change the results. For men (15 patients and 10 control participants) with missing information for exercise, we assigned them into the median category (i.e., 1&#x02013;4 times/wk) and retained them in the analyses; including or excluding these men provided similar results. Tests for trend for the vitamin D metabolites were conducted by use of median levels of quartiles. To test for interactions, we analyzed models with and without the cross-product term with the two main exposures as continuous variables and conducted the likelihood ratio test.

Another related factor may be the apparent differences in vitamin D status in various populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040103-t501">Table 5</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The overall vitamin D status of the participants was fairly low in the three studies showing significant inverse association with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; or 25(OH)D levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The median levels of 25(OH)D for men of these studies were around or below 20 ng/ml so that at least half of the study participants were vitamin D deficient. In contrast, among the studies that did not find a direct association between circulating vitamin D metabolites and prostate cancer risk (including ours), the median levels of 25(OH)D (all seasons combined) were 29 ng/ml or higher, and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was approximately 20&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

In our study, men with low levels of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, which may be a true indication of vitamin D deficiency, were at significantly increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer. Although with few men of non-European descent in this cohort, the data suggested stronger inverse associations between plasma vitamin D levels and risk of prostate cancer among them (versus men of European descent), probably because these men had poorer 25(OH)D status related to their darker skin color.</p><p>A significant association of plasma 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels and risk of aggressive prostate cancer was apparent only among older men or men with insufficient 25(OH)D status, suggesting a role of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase activity in prostate cancer development and progression. Levels of the active hormone 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D could be influenced by 25(OH)D status as well as 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase activity. With low 25(OH)D status, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels could be maintained by increased 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase activity, possibly explaining why we observed no correlation between the two metabolites in blood samples collected in winter/spring. Reduced enzyme activity of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase due to aging &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; or other factors, especially under low 25(OH)D status, could predispose a man to a higher risk of prostate cancer as observed in our study. This notion is indirectly supported by two studies that recently showed profoundly reduced 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase activity in prostate cancer cell lines compared with cells from normal tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that these cells may have reduced or lost the ability to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D locally &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Because circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D level is relatively stable, an alternative explanation is that low 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, in concert with low 25D, may act as a better marker of low vitamin D status.</p><p>Neither the FokI nor the BsmI polymorphism was directly associated with prostate cancer in our study, which is consistent with previous observations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we found an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with the less functional FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype only in the presence of low 25(OH)D status. Most previous studies, summarized by Berndt et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, were small and studied primarily localized disease. However, two studies reported an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with the FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype was found in the presence of high sun exposure (thus, presumably higher 25&#x0005b;OH&#x0005d;D status) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040103-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. More studies are needed to resolve these apparently contradictory findings.</p><p>The strengths of this study include a prospective design with up to 18 y of follow-up and careful collection and storage of blood specimens and thorough ascertainment of events. Our large sample size, especially for patients with clinical aggressive prostate cancer, allowed us to assess the associations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, individually and jointly, with total and aggressive disease, as well as their potential interactions with the VDR polymorphisms. One limitation is that vitamin D levels were assessed in plasma collected at one time point and measured in two batches. However, the reproducibility of these assays was good as indicated by the low mean intra-pair coefficients of variation (both were &#x0003c;10&#x00025;). Furthermore, the mean levels and their distribution were similar to those reported using fresh samples, and the overall- and batch specific-correlations between 25(OH)D with age and seasons of the year were as expected, supporting the internal validity of these assays. To ensure the comparability between patients and control participants and to reduce the nondifferential measurement errors due to batch-to-batch variation, patients and control participants were assayed together and analyzed in matched pairs, and we used batch-specific cutoff points to define the categories and utilized conditional logistic regression models for all the analyses. Nevertheless, if any such nondifferential measurement error exists, we expect that the strength of the association could be diluted toward the null. Other limitations included the lack of information on family history of prostate cancer and PSA screening practice, as well as PSA levels at diagnosis for these men. Findings in this cohort of physicians of predominantly European descent may not be easily generalized to other ethnic groups. Studies of other ethnic groups are necessary to better understand the role of vitamin D on prostate cancer.</p><p>In summary, the inverse association of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D alone or together with 25(OH)D with aggressive prostate cancer provide further evidence that both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may play an important role in preventing prostate cancer progression, especially among older men. The FokI polymorphism may interact with 25(OH)D and modify prostate cancer risk. Men with the FokI <italic>ff</italic> genotype (14&#x00025; in the European-descent population of this cohort) are more susceptible to this disease in the presence of low 25(OH)D status. Vitamin D insufficiency is a common problem, and improving vitamin D status through moderate sun exposure and vitamin D supplements, in particular, is essential for optimal health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040103-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of the Abstract into Chinese by Haojie Li</title><p>(24 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040103.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the crucial contributions of the entire staff of the PHS.
