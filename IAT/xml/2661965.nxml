The molecular basis by which NF-&#x003ba;B activates endogenous promoters is largely unknown, but it seems likely that it should include the means to tailor transcriptional output to match the wide functional range of its target genes. To dissect NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;driven transcription at native promoters, we disrupted the interaction between NF-&#x003ba;B p65 and the Mediator complex. We found that expression of many endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B target genes depends on direct contact between p65 and Mediator, and that this occurs through the Trap-80 subunit and the TA1 and TA2 regions of p65. Unexpectedly, however, a subset of p65-dependent genes are transcribed normally even when the interaction of p65 with Mediator is abolished. Moreover, a mutant form of p65 lacking all transcription activation domains previously identified in vitro can still activate such promoters in vivo. We found that without p65, native NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters cannot be bound by secondary transcription factors. Artificial recruitment of a secondary transcription factor was able to restore transcription of an otherwise NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent target gene in the absence of p65, showing that the control of promoter occupancy constitutes a second, independent mode of transcriptional activation by p65. This mode enables a subset of promoters to utilize a wide choice of transcription factors, with the potential to regulate their expression accordingly, whilst remaining dependent for their activation on NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Transcriptional activation by the NF-&#x003ba;B family of transcription factors is crucial for the expression of multiple genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation.

In the case of the NF-&#x003ba;B family of transcription factors, this is a challenging task, since the tremendous functional diversity of its target genes makes it difficult to imagine a single activation mechanism able to satisfy the needs of all of them.</p><p>Transcription factors belonging to the NF-&#x003ba;B family are found in metazoan organisms ranging from insects to mammals, and are essential in regulating the activation of hundreds of genes in response to various extracellular stimuli and developmental cues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. In most vertebrate cell types, NF-&#x003ba;B exists as a combination of five related proteins: p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52. They share a structurally conserved Rel homology region at their amino terminus, which is responsible for dimerization, interaction with inhibitory I&#x003ba;B proteins, nuclear entry, and binding to their specific DNA target sequences (known as &#x003ba;B sites). In unstimulated cells, dimers of NF-&#x003ba;B are held in the cytoplasm through the binding of inhibitory proteins (I&#x003ba;Bs or p100), but upon stimulation they are released to enter the nucleus. There they are capable of binding with high affinity to their target sequences, found both in gene promoters and in enhancer regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to our detailed understanding of the signalling events that control the level of NF-&#x003ba;B present in the nucleus, little is known about the mechanisms of transcriptional activation by the various dimer species whilst bound to endogenous target genes. It is particularly unclear whether promoter binding by a given NF-&#x003ba;B dimer always triggers the same fixed response, leading to an identical transcriptional output at all genes, or, as seems more reasonable, different genes should somehow be able to fine tune their transcription levels after binding and activation by NF-&#x003ba;B. However, the transcriptional activation domain of p65 has been extensively studied in vitro and on artificial reporter plasmids, and the data from these systems provide a foundation on which one can try to build an understanding of its function on natural promoters.</p><p>During the last two decades, experiments using reconstituted cell-free systems have succeeded in defining the minimal apparatus needed to drive activated transcription. An essential set of general transcription factors (GTFs) is sufficient to direct the binding of, and initiation of basal transcription by pol-II at the core regions of most promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. In order to respond to transcriptional activators such as NF-&#x003ba;B, though, additional elements are required, foremost amongst which is the Mediator complex. This is a large, multi-subunit complex, which was independently identified by several laboratories through its ability to bind to various transcriptional activation domains (including that of p65), or by its necessity as a co-factor for transcriptional activation in vitro by other transcription factors (reviewed by Malik and Roeder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;). Using highly purified components in vitro, the combination of pol-II, GTFs, and the Mediator complex is sufficient to drive transcriptional activation by NF-&#x003ba;B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, depletion of Mediator from total nuclear extracts using antibodies abolishes all in vitro transcription by pol-II, including the response to activators such as p65 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The capacity of p65 to activate transcription has also been the subject of numerous studies using synthetic reporter plasmids in transfected cell lines. In this context, the carboxy terminus of p65 (like those of c-Rel and RelB) is able to drive transcription in isolation when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, leading to its definition as a transcriptional activation domain (TAD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;). Since the Mediator complex has been shown to interact with the TAD of p65 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, a straightforward model would be that direct binding to Mediator constitutes the initial, essential step in p65-driven transcription; however, to our knowledge this has never been tested in vivo at native promoters. Part of the reason for this may be that the Mediator complex is essential for viability, and thus it is not readily amenable to loss-of-function-based experiments in intact cells. In order to test the requirement for this interaction at native NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters, we sought to disrupt the contact between p65 and Mediator by eliminating a single Mediator subunit in vivo.</p><p>We found that contact with Mediator is indeed essential for p65 to drive the expression of many NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. Unexpectedly, though, many others were still expressed normally even when this contact was disrupted. Further experiments revealed that p65 has a second, independent mode of transcriptional activation, which acts by regulating promoter occupancy by secondary transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Removal of Trap-80 Disrupts the Interaction of p65 with Mediator</title><p>We wanted to identify a subunit of the Mediator complex that directly contacts p65, and whose removal would abolish the interaction of p65 with the remaining complex. As a cue, we noted that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-&#x003ba;B homologue Dif has been shown to interact with Med17 (amongst other Mediator subunits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;). Although the TAD of p65 shows no obvious sequence homology with that of Dif, we speculated that it might nonetheless contact the corresponding mammalian Mediator subunit, Trap-80. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to detect an interaction between the amino-terminus of Trap-80 and the far carboxy-terminus of p65 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Since none of the known components of the Mediator complex are well conserved between yeast and mammals at the primary amino acid sequence level &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, this strongly suggests that the interaction of p65 with Trap-80 is direct; however, at this point we could not exclude that it may be bridged or stabilized by interaction with some endogenous yeast protein(s).</p><p>An over-expressed, tagged form of Trap-80 could be co-immunoprecipitated with p65 from nuclear extracts of transfected HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B), confirming that the two proteins can associate into a complex together. To establish whether they occupy adjacent positions within the complex, we used the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. We co-expressed fusion proteins of p65 joined, via a short peptide linker, to an amino-terminal fragment of the fluorescent protein Venus, and of Trap-80 similarly joined to a complementary fragment from the Venus carboxy-terminus. Neither of these fragments is itself fluorescent, but if brought sufficiently close by an interaction between their respective fusion partners, they form a bimolecular fluorescent entity (the maximum permissible distance separating the tethered ends is limited by the peptide linkers (16 amino acids, or around 60 &#x000c5; each), and has been empirically estimated at around 100 &#x000c5; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;&#x02014;roughly comparable to the diameter of the Rel homology region of p65 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;). Fusions of Venus fragments to the carboxy-terminus of p65, or to the amino-terminus of Trap-80 were nonfluorescent when expressed alone, but, in close agreement with the yeast two-hybrid experiments, cells co-expressing both together were fluorescent, indicating that the two proteins are juxtaposed in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C).</p><p>Together, these data suggested that Trap-80 forms part of the contact surface of the Mediator complex through which it interacts with p65. Although this interaction may include regions of contact with other Mediator subunits, we considered that Trap-80 was a good candidate as a subunit whose removal might destabilize binding by p65. Therefore, we attempted to disrupt the p65-Mediator interaction by generating cell lines in which Trap-80 expression was stably knocked-down by RNA interference. At the outset, this seemed a risky approach, since in other systems Trap-80 has been shown to be essential for cell viability. Yeast with a null mutation of the homologous <italic>Srb4</italic> gene are nonviable, and in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele, most mRNA synthesis ceases at the restrictive temperature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, microarray analysis indicated that the expression levels of &#x0003e;96&#x00025; of transcripts were changed by less than 1.5-fold in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g002">Figure 2</xref>B later).</p><fig id="pbio-1000073-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Removal of Trap-80 Disrupts the Interaction of p65 with Mediator</title><p>(A) Knock-down of Trap-80 mRNA by RNA interference.

Thus, in 3T3 fibroblasts, p65-dependent genes can be subdivided, depending on whether they require the interaction of p65 with the Mediator complex for their expression (Trap-80&#x02013;dependent; exemplified by <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic>), or instead can be expressed even when this interaction is disrupted (Trap-80&#x02013;independent; exemplified by <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic>).</p><p>To examine the generality of this grouping, we performed a microarray analysis of the levels of 29,000 transcripts in wild-type and Trap-80 knock-down cells, before and after stimulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activity using TNF-&#x003b1;. Genes induced by TNF-&#x003b1; are dominated by known NF-&#x003ba;B targets, and their promoters are significantly enriched for NF-&#x003ba;B binding motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-st002">S2</xref>).

Indeed, association of pol-II with the promoters of <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic> was completely prevented in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, it was strongly recruited to the <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter both with and without Trap-80. Pol-II was also recruited to the <italic>Nfkbia</italic> promoter in the absence of Trap-80, but at a reduced level, mirroring the lower level of p65 binding noted earlier.</p><p>We also examined the recruitment of the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) to promoters, in the presence and absence of Trap-80. TFIIB is an essential component of the pre-initiation complex, shown in vitro to be required for the recruitment of pol-II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with this, TFIIB appeared at the <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoters concomitantly with pol-II in wild-type fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), although at later time points the relative levels of promoter-associated TFIIB declined. In Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells, the recruitment of TFIIB to the <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter was unimpaired (and even slightly augmented; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). However, TFIIB levels at the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> promoter were severely reduced, foretelling the failure of this promoter to recruit pol-II.</p><p>Since Trap-80 seemed not to be required for the recruitment of pol-II or TFIIB to Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters, we wondered whether a Mediator complex containing Trap-80 associates with these promoters at all. To check this, we used antibodies against Trap-80 to examine its presence at promoters by ChIP. As expected, we detected Trap-80 at the promoters for the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). We also found Trap-80, though, at the <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic> promoters, despite the fact that these genes can still be expressed normally in cells where Trap-80 levels have been knocked-down. This suggests that a Mediator complex which ordinarily contains Trap-80 is involved in transcriptional activation at all of these promoters, but that the Trap-80 subunit is functionally essential only at some of them. However, one caveat to this interpretation is that the apparent difference in Trap-80 dependency between the two classes of promoters might be only quantitative, and the seemingly Trap-80&#x02013;independent <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic> promoters might actually manage to bind to the low level of residual Trap-80 remaining in the knock-down cells. To deal with this concern, we also checked for the presence of Trap-80 at these promoters in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells. Trap-80 was undetectable at any promoters in Trap-80 knock-down cells, including those of <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic>&#x02014;confirming that it is truly dispensable for the expression of these genes.</p><p>In Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells, the Mediator complex is &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; when using antibodies against Trap-80. We therefore used antibodies against another component, Med-26, to assess the involvement of the Mediator complex when Trap-80 is missing. After stimulation of Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells we could still find roughly normal levels of Med-26 at the <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter, confirming that its transcription involves the Trap-80&#x02013;independent participation of Mediator, and also serving as a control that in these cells the Mediator complex is not drastically disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). In these cells, however, Med-26 was undetectable at the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> promoter. This supports the notion that the inability of p65 to interact with the Mediator complex in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells underlies their failure to transcribe Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes.</p><p>Interestingly, we noticed that Trap-80 was present on promoters at above-background levels in resting wild-type cells, preceding the stimulus-induced promoter-binding by NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>D; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This was particularly apparent at the promoters for <italic>Nfkbia</italic> and <italic>Ip-10</italic>, and in parallel experiments in which HA-Trap-80 was stably over-expressed by around 10&#x02013;100&#x000d7;, we could also detect HA-Trap-80 at the <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic> promoters before stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). In contrast, we detected Med-26 at the <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoters only after transcription was induced by stimulating wild-type cells with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). The Med-26 subunit is associated with an active subcomplex of Mediator that is able to bind pol-II, and which accounts for its transcriptional cofactor activity in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results indicate that while some Mediator seems to be preloaded on promoters in vivo, as has recently been described in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, contact with p65 is required for the establishment of an active, Med-26-containing complex at target promoters upon stimulation.</p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that one mechanism of transcriptional activation by p65 depends on its direct interaction with Mediator, and that this is essential for expression of a subset of its target genes in vivo. Without Trap-80, p65 binding to the promoters of these genes is not prevented, but once bound it is unable to interact with the Mediator complex, and thereby drive the recruitment of pol-II and the initiation of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Artificial Contact with Mediator Can Bypass the Requirement for Trap-80</title><p>Three predictions arise from this model: first, the binding sites for p65 should be situated close to the transcriptional start sites of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent promoters. We analysed the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced genes revealed by the microarray, and could identify conserved (between mouse and human) NF-&#x003ba;B binding motifs with high confidence in 85&#x00025; of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent promoters. At &#x0003e;92&#x00025; of these, the promoter-proximal site lies within 800 bp of the transcriptional start site (see later), consistent with a direct role for p65 in interacting with Mediator to recruit pol-II.</p><p>Second, one should be able to bypass the need for Trap-80 by artificially recruiting an alternative transcriptional activation domain capable of interacting with a different Mediator subunit, to Trap-80&#x02013;dependent promoters (schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To attempt this, we chose to use the well-studied transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein. Transcriptional activation by the VP16 TAD depends on its direct interaction with the Med25 subunit of the Mediator complex, which can occur through either of two subregions (H1 and H2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;). Also, the only proteins it can pull-down from total nuclear extracts are Mediator components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, implying that additional, unwanted interactions with other nuclear constituents are weak or nonexistent. To effect recruitment to NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters, we used the Rel homology region of p65 (p65 DBD, encompassing both its DNA-binding domain and also the region required for regulation by I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;). When over-expressed in wild-type cells, the p65 DBD is able to out-compete full-length p65 for binding to &#x003ba;B sites in promoters, and acts as a dominant-negative allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). We generated retroviruses encoding fusion proteins between the p65 DBD and the H1 region of the VP16 TAD, since the H2 region has been shown to make nonessential contacts with Trap-80 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. After stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1;, Trap-80&#x02013;deficient fibroblasts transduced with a control virus encoding full-length p65 still showed severely impaired <italic>Ip-10</italic> expression compared to wild-type fibroblasts (although the over-expression of p65 did slightly increase <italic>Ip-10</italic> levels above those seen in untransduced cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Expression of the p65 DBD fused to the H1 region of VP16, however, fully restored <italic>Ip-10</italic> expression in the absence of Trap-80, to levels that even exceeded those seen in wild-type fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, when contact between p65 and Mediator is prevented by the absence of Trap-80, artificial contact with a different Mediator subunit is sufficient to rescue expression of a Trap-80&#x02013;dependent NF-&#x003ba;B target gene.</p><fig id="pbio-1000073-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Artificial Contact with Mediator Rescues Expression of Trap-80&#x02013;Dependent Genes</title><p>The experimental rationale is depicted schematically on the left.</p><p>On the right, Trap-80 knock-down fibroblasts were transduced with a retrovirus driving expression of full-length p65 (blue triangles), or of a fusion of the p65 DBD with the H1 region of VP16 (p65DBD-VP16-H1; red triangles), and expression of <italic>Ip-10</italic> mRNA was compared to wild-type (wt) and untransduced Trap-80 knock-down cells. The result is representative of five experiments.

Two transcriptional activation regions have previously been identified within the carboxy-terminus of p65 (TA1 and TA2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;). We generated mutant forms of p65 in which either or both of these regions were deleted, and assayed their in vivo interaction with Trap-80 using BiFC. As a negative control we used the p65 DBD, which lacks the entire carboxy-terminus. All mutants were expressed at comparable levels, as detected by western blotting (unpublished data), and interacted to similar extents with full length p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, deletion of either TA1 or TA2 alone each diminished the interaction with Trap-80, and deletion of both together (p65&#x00394;TA1&#x00026;2) completely reduced it to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). We next tested the ability of each mutant to rescue NF-&#x003ba;B target gene expression in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;stimulated p65-knockout fibroblasts. Transduction with viruses encoding full-length p65, or p65 with deletions of either TA1 or TA2 alone, restored transcription of both the <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Mip-2</italic> genes to levels that equalled or even exceeded those in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). Notably though, the p65 mutant lacking both TA1 and TA2 was completely unable to drive transcription of the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> gene, but it could still activate expression of the Trap-80&#x02013;independent <italic>Mip-2</italic> gene to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Thus, p65 can activate transcription of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent genes using separable regions within its carboxy-terminus. These findings can be explained by an inability of the p65&#x00394;TA1&#x00026;2 mutant to interact with Mediator. However, since it could also be argued that deletion of a substantial domain from p65 may have other, additional consequences for the protein's function, we sought to identify more subtle mutations in which interaction with Trap-80 was still disrupted. We used the p65 mutant lacking TA2 as a template, since this protein drives transcription of <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Mip-2</italic> normally, but depends on TA1 for its interaction with Trap-80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg010">S10</xref>). By initially substituting blocks of seven amino acids within TA1 (e.g., TA1 mut528&#x02013;534 and TA1 mut535&#x02013;541), and subsequently by mutating adjacent pairs of amino acids, we were able to identify a p65 mutant in which only two amino acid changes result in the abolition of the interaction with Trap-80 (TA1 DF539AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).

To try to uncover features that might explain their different requirements for activation by p65, we compared the promoters of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced genes identified by our microarray analysis. We could identify conserved &#x003ba;B motifs in a similar fraction of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced genes (85&#x00025; versus 92&#x00025;, respectively), and the consensus sequence did not obviously differ between the two (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). However, for a substantial fraction of Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters, the most proximal predicted &#x003ba;B site was &#x0003e;1 kb from the transcriptional start site (29&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). This is significantly different from the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes, and suggests p65 may not be directly involved in assembly of the pre-initiation complex at these promoters. With this in mind, we investigated whether the two classes of promoters could be distinguished by the presence or absence of binding motifs for other transcription factors. Although we were unable to find any clear-cut motifs that could unambiguously discriminate between Trap-80&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent promoters, there were clear differences in the &#x0201c;signatures&#x0201d; of transcription factor binding sites associated with the two promoter classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg012">Figure S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-st002">Table S2</xref>).

On the other hand, Trap-80&#x02013;dependent promoters were themselves strongly enriched for the presence of a TATA-box, and for binding sites for the Ap-1 and HSF families of transcription factors.

We performed ChIP using antibodies against c-Jun and Jun-D (which form part of Ap-1), ATF-3, and Sp1. All of these transcription factors were recruited to both the Trap-80&#x02013;independent <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic> promoters, and the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> promoter, upon stimulation of fibroblasts with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Remarkably, in every case, binding to these promoters was totally abolished in p65-knockout fibroblasts. This effect was specific for NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent genes, since Sp1 remained bound to the promoters of control, housekeeping genes in both wild-type and p65-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg013">Figure S13</xref> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;).

As we had observed in fibroblasts, though, binding to both promoters was prevented in p65-knockout DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>An Artificially Recruited Secondary Transcription Factor Drives Transcription in the Absence of p65</title><p>The above results indicate that one mechanism by which p65 could drive transcriptional activation at Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters would be by controlling the recruitment of secondary transcription factors whose activities do not require Trap-80 (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g007">Figure 7</xref>). If this explanation is correct, we should be able to rescue expression of Trap-80&#x02013;independent genes in p65-knockout fibroblasts by bringing one of the relevant transcription factors to their promoters. We decided to attempt this using the transcriptional activation domain from Sp1. Sp1 is recruited in a p65-dependent fashion to NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The binding site for Sp1 is frequently found in Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters (GC-box; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg012">Figure S12</xref>), and it has been implicated in the expression of several NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;regulated genes (e.g., <italic>Mcp-1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;). Moreover, while the Sp1 TAD requires Mediator for its activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, it does not directly interact with the Mediator complex, so we reasoned that it was unlikely to show a particular dependency on the Trap-80 subunit.</p><fig id="pbio-1000073-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>An Artificially Recruited Secondary Transcription Factor Drives Transcription in the Absence of p65</title><p>On the left is a cartoon illustrating our model for the events occurring at Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters. In wild-type cells, initial p65 binding brings about an undefined change to target promoters, which allows the binding of various secondary transcription factors. Once bound, these can drive the recruitment of pol-II, and so enable transcription. In p65-knockout cells, secondary transcription factors cannot bind and no transcription takes place. If binding of a secondary transcription factor is artificially restored (in this case Sp1), transcription is rescued at promoters that can recruit the relevant co-factors (in this case TAF<sub>II</sub>250).</p><p>On the right, p65-knockout cells were transduced with a retrovirus expressing a fusion of the p65 DBD with the Sp1 TAD (red triangles, p65DBD-Sp1), and expression of <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Ip-10</italic> mRNA was compared to untransduced wild-type and p65-knockout fibroblasts. The result is representative of three experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000073.g007"/></fig><p>Using a similar strategy to that used earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g004">Figure 4</xref>), we generated retroviruses encoding a fusion protein between the p65 DBD and the Sp1 TAD, and used these to infect p65-knockout fibroblasts. Expression of the Trap-80&#x02013;independent <italic>Mip-2</italic> gene was completely restored to wild-type levels in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This demonstrates that recruitment of Sp1, an event that is normally controlled by p65, is sufficient to drive transcription even in an experimental setting in which p65 itself is absent. Therefore, the ability of p65 to control the binding of secondary transcription factors such as Sp1 to target gene promoters constitutes a second, indirect, mode of transcriptional activation, independent from its direct interaction with Mediator via Trap-80.</p><p>Although Sp1 binding sites are enriched at the promoters of Trap-80&#x02013;independent genes, there also exist instances at those of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes (e.g., <italic>Ip-10</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In such cases, binding of Sp1 to the promoter (along with other transcription factors) is not sufficient to drive transcription in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells. In line with this, artificial recruitment of the Sp1 TAD to the Trap-80&#x02013;dependent <italic>Ip-10</italic> promoter failed to restore its expression in p65-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg015">S15</xref>). A difference between the Trap-80&#x02013;independent and Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes, then, corresponds to the ability of secondary transcription factors (exemplified here by Sp1) to drive their transcription following p65-dependent recruitment.</p><p>This raises the question of why promoter-bound Sp1 cannot drive transcription of Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes, such as <italic>Ip-10</italic>. Transcriptional activation by Sp1 in vitro depends on its direct interaction, through TAF<sub>II</sub>110, with a TFIID complex containing TAF<sub>II</sub>250 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However, not all transcriptionally active genes in human cells are found in association with TAF<sub>II</sub>250, nor in yeast cells with its homologue TAF<sub>II</sub>145 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore examined TAF<sub>II</sub>250 occupancy at the <italic>Ip-10</italic> and <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoters. We found that TAF<sub>II</sub>250 is recruited to the endogenous <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter upon stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1;, but no such recruitment was seen at the promoter for <italic>Ip-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg016">Figure S16</xref>). Thus, the differential responsiveness of these two promoters to bound Sp1 can be explained by their respective abilities to recruit a TFIID complex containing TAF<sub>II</sub>250; this, in turn, accounts for the ability of p65 to activate transcription of <italic>Mip-2</italic>, but not <italic>Ip-10</italic>, in the absence of Trap-80. Differential TAF usage by promoters may represent a widely used additional level of control over the activity of bound transcription factors. It has been shown in both yeast and mammals that promoters differ in their requirement for a TFIID complex containing TAF<sub>II</sub>250/145 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the correlation is not absolute, one predictive factor for TAF-independence is the presence of a TATA-box, and it is worth noting that this motif is enriched in Trap-80&#x02013;dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg012">Figure S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-st002">Table S2</xref>). However, just as there does not appear to be any single transcription factor binding motif that unequivocally separates the two classes of promoter, the association of Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters with TAF<sub>II</sub>250 presence is not perfect, and there exist some Trap-80&#x02013;dependent genes whose human counterparts are bound by TAF<sub>II</sub>250 (e.g., <italic>Adm</italic> and <italic>Cebpb</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;), and some Trap-80&#x02013;independent promoters which contain a TATA-box (e.g., <italic>Ccl7</italic>). Thus, while Sp1 serves as a successful example in the case of the <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter, we certainly do not suggest that <italic>all</italic> Trap-80&#x02013;independent transcription is mediated by the same secondary transcription factor.</p><p>Rather, our data indicate that each NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent promoter contains a combination of sites for the binding of various transcription factors, any of which could drive transcription if present and active in that promoter context. Importantly, though, in fibroblasts and DCs this binding is subject to overall upstream control by p65, and it is likely that this reflects a general mechanism used by NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent promoters in other cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>When the studies described here were initiated, numerous in vitro data were known about transcription by NF-&#x003ba;B, but the actual mechanism of transcription downstream of p65 binding to endogenous genes in vivo was unclear. Since the Mediator complex was known to play an important role in most, if not all, transcription by pol-II, we set out to disrupt its interaction with p65, as a means to dissect p65-driven transcription. We found that expression of some NF-&#x003ba;B target genes depends on direct contact between p65 and Mediator, which occurs through the Trap-80 subunit and the TA1 and TA2 regions of p65. This contact is needed for the establishment of an active, Med-26&#x02013;containing Mediator complex at promoters, recruitment of TFIIB and pol-II, and thereby the initiation of transcription. While this result is not surprising, it does provide important confirmation that events hitherto only described in minimalist in vitro experiments are necessary, and sufficient, for the expression of some genes in their natural context in vivo.</p><p>The finding that 3T3 fibroblasts remain viable even after depletion of Trap-80 to &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of normal levels is remarkable, considering that its yeast homologue Srb4 is required for most, if not all, transcription by pol-II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Srb4 is essential for the integrity of the yeast Mediator complex, which, without it, dissociates at the boundary between the structurally conserved head and middle modules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In mammalian cells, like in yeast, the Mediator complex is critical for pol-II&#x02013;driven transcription: its addition is required for the in vitro activity of various transcriptional activators &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, and its depletion from mammalian nuclear extracts abolishes all transcription by pol-II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, the survival of fibroblasts after Trap-80 has been knocked-down implies that some Mediator activity must still remain. One possibility is that the amount of cellular Mediator is not normally limiting for the expression of essential genes, and that the residual 5&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; level of Trap-80 in knock-down cells suffices for these. However, we find that the expression of &#x0003e;96&#x00025; of transcripts changes by less than 1.5-fold in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This finding argues that, instead, Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells contain Trap-80&#x02013;less, but otherwise functional, Mediator complexes. Proteomic analyses have so far identified Trap-80 to be part of a common core of subunits, shared by all Mediator species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. It seems likely, then, that Trap-80 does not play the same essential structural role as yeast Srb4, and that Mediator complexes that normally incorporate Trap-80 are still able to at least partially assemble when this subunit is missing. This interpretation is supported by our finding that the Mediator complex, revealed by the Med-26 subunit, is recruited to the <italic>Mip-2</italic> promoter even in Trap-80&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p><p>We have shown that the interaction of p65 with Mediator through Trap-80 is sufficient to drive transcription. However, the discovery that a subset of p65-dependent genes are transcribed normally even when the interaction of p65 with Mediator is abolished was completely unanticipated. Moreover, a mutant form of p65 that not only cannot interact with Trap-80, but that also lacks both previously identified transcriptional activation domains, can still activate the Trap-80&#x02013;independent <italic>Mip-2</italic> gene in vivo (p65&#x00394;TA1&#x00026;2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). This finding prompted us to examine more closely the events that occur at promoters upon engagement of NF-&#x003ba;B. Remarkably, we found that without the binding of p65, NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters cannot be bound by many other transcription factors. Thus, it appears that a p65-containing NF-&#x003ba;B dimer binds to target promoters as a lone, &#x0201c;pioneer&#x0201d; transcription factor, and controls their subsequent co-occupancy by secondary transcription factors (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>One model for this, which we do not favour, could be that secondary transcription factors bind to promoters via direct, co-operative interactions with p65. Such a scenario has been previously shown in the context of particular promoters containing juxtaposed binding sites (e.g., HIV1-LTR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Ifnb1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;), but this arrangement is not a general feature of NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters. Moreover, it seems unlikely that pairwise interactions with p65 could account for the binding of multiple transcription factors to each of many different promoters (and at non-NF-&#x003ba;B target promoters, co-operative binding with p65 is clearly not required; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000073-sg013">Figure S13</xref>).</p><p>A more plausible possibility is that p65 controls promoter accessibility by inducing local alterations to chromatin. In macrophages, NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;driven activation is accompanied by nucleosome remodeling at target gene promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we could detect no differences in promoter accessibility to micrococcal nuclease digestion after stimulation of wild-type and p65-knockout fibroblasts (unpublished data). Alternatively, p65 binding may bring about changes to histone modifications, several of which have been described to be associated with the expression of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes in different systems (e.g., lysine acetylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, serine phosphorylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;). Further experiments are required to determine whether these could account for the control over secondary transcription-factor binding.</p><p>In p65-knockout cells, artificial recruitment of a secondary transcription factor is sufficient to restore gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that regardless of the mechanism, the regulation of promoter occupancy constitutes a second, independent mode of transcriptional activation by p65.</p><p>What, though, could be the benefit of having a second mode of transcriptional activation? After all, in real, nonexperimentally manipulated cells, an intact Mediator complex containing Trap-80 is always present. We can envisage two situations in which the ability of p65 to control recruitment of secondary transcription factors to a promoter could be important. First, if the only means by which p65 could activate transcription was through its direct binding to Mediator, then the transcriptional output at every NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02212;dependent promoter should be the same, and upon its release from promoters, transcription would necessarily halt. There are numerous mechanisms that control the longevity of promoter-bound p65, including nuclear export by resynthesized I&#x003ba;B molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, and replacement by other NF-&#x003ba;B dimer species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000073-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Considering the tremendous diversity of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes, though, it seems inconceivable that the optimal biological window and level of expression for all of them can be identical (and experimentally this is not the case; compare, for example, expression of <italic>Mip-2</italic> and <italic>Il-6</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). By endowing p65 with the ability to license promoters for the binding of secondary transcription factors, there is a means to customize expression levels, and prolong transcription after the departure of p65. From the point of view of a promoter, this would be an attractive solution, since NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependence can be retained at the same time as tailoring the expression pattern by selecting binding sites for appropriate secondary transcription factors.</p><p>Second, &#x003ba;B sites are not always located in promoters close to the transcriptional start sites, and in some cases can be several kilobases away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000073-g006">Figure 6</xref>A; examples include <italic>Mcp-1</italic> and <italic>JunB</italic>). At such a distance, looping of the intervening DNA would be required to bring bound p65 into the proximity of core promoter elements, and this may not allow a sufficiently stable interaction with Mediator to enable nucleation of the pre-initiation complex. However, the local presence of p65 is nevertheless adequate to regulate the recruitment of secondary transcription factors. In turn, these newly arrived transcription factors can stably bind to the promoter, and themselves interact with components of the pre-initiation complex to drive transcription. In this model, the Trap-80&#x02013;independent mode of activation by p65 is critical to permit it to operate at enhancers.</p><p>A corollary of activation by p65 in this way is that the activity of a given target promoter, although entirely NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent, will depend on the availability of suitable secondary transcription factors. Since this is determined by both cell-type and stimulus, this mode of activation is likely to be essential to allow genes controlled by NF-&#x003ba;B to attain an appropriate pattern of expression in different biological contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids.</title><p>For expression in yeast, fragments from the N- or C termini of p65 (NT: amino acids &#x0005b;aa&#x0005d; 1&#x02013;305; CT1: aa 306&#x02013;549, CT2: 431&#x02013;549) were cloned into pAct2.

Yeast cells were sequentially transformed with plasmids encoding the Gal4 activation domain fused to either the amino terminus of p65 (p65 NT) or two nested carboxy terminal fragments (p65CT1/CT2), followed by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to either full length, or amino- or carboxy-terminal Trap-80 (Trap-80 NT and Trap-80 CT). The blue colour of colony lifts when Trap-80 is combined with p65 CT2, or when Trap-80 NT is combined with p65 CT1 or CT2 is indicative of an in vivo interaction between the two hybrid proteins. The failure of p65 CT1 to drive Lac<italic>Z</italic> expression when co-transformed with full-length Trap-80 is probably due to its weak expression: western blotting of yeast cell extracts using antibodies specific for the carboxy-terminus of p65 revealed only very low amounts of the shorter p65 fragment (CT2), and undetectable levels of the longer fragment (CT1, not shown). Yeast co-transformants containing all combinations of full-length Trap-80 or Trap-80 NT, combined with p65 CT1 or CT2, grew on medium lacking histidine (not shown).</p><p>(B) Co-immunoprecipitation of p65 and Trap-80. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for p65 and a haemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged allele of Trap-80, and nuclear extracts were prepared after stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1; to induce nuclear entry of NF-&#x003ba;B. p65 was detected by western blotting after immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody, or without antibody (left panel). In the reciprocal experiment, tagged Trap-80 was detected with anti-HA after immunoprecipitation using anti-p65 (right panel). The level of p65 in total nuclear extract is shown as &#x0201c;input&#x0201d;; HA-Trap-80 was not easily detectable in nuclear extracts before immunoprecipitation.</p><p>(C) BiFC mediated by in vivo interaction between p65 and Trap-80. HEK-293 cells were transfected with vectors expressing Venus fragment 2 fused to the N terminus of Trap-80 (V2-Trap-80; i, iii, iv), Trap-80&#x02013;V2 (v), or p65-V2 (vi), either alone or together with p65-V1 (i, ii, vi), p65DBD-V1 (iv), or V1-p65 (v). Fluorescence from either p65-V1 or V2-Trap-80 was undetectable when transfected alone (ii, iii). (iv) and (v) are controls for the specificity of the interaction based on the yeast two-hybrid results (above), wherein the interacting carboxy-terminus of p65 is deleted (iv), or the two proteins are fused at the noninteracting termini (v). The residual &#x02248;30&#x00025; fluorescence seen in these cases is similar to the level seen in cells co-expressing V1 and V2 fused to control, noninteracting proteins. The strong self-association of p65 into homodimers serves as a positive control (vi). The fluorescence intensity of transfected cells is expressed as a percentage of the level in cells co-expressing p65-V1 and V2-Trap-80 (i). Error bars indicate standard errors of independent transfections.
