RAD51 functions with RAD52 and other proteins to effect strand exchange during HR, forming heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) that is resolved by mismatch repair to yield a gene conversion tract. In mammalian cells RAD51 and RAD52 overexpression increase the frequency of spontaneous HR, and one study indicated that overexpression of mouse RAD51 enhances DSB-induced HR in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We tested the effects of transient and stable overexpression of human RAD51 and&#x0002f;or human RAD52 on DSB-induced HR in CHO cells and in human cells. DSBs were targeted to chromosomal recombination substrates with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I nuclease. In all cases, excess RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 reduced DSB-induced HR, contrasting with prior studies. These distinct results may reflect differences in recombination substrate structures or different levels of overexpression. Excess RAD51&#x0002f;RAD52 did not increase conversion tract lengths, nor were product spectra otherwise altered, indicating that excess HR proteins can have dominant negative effects on HR initiation, but do not affect later steps such as hDNA formation, mismatch repair or the resolution of intermediates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially lethal lesions that are efficiently repaired in eukaryotes by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). A specific type of HR is gene conversion, a conservative process that can occur with or without an associated crossover. DSBs stimulate gene conversion, involving the non-reciprocal transfer of information from an unbroken donor locus to a broken recipient locus. Studies with multiply marked alleles have shown that conversion typically involves the transfer of a continuous block of information, creating continuous conversion tracts. In yeast, conversion tracts reflect the formation of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) by strand transfer (including strand invasion and branch migration) and subsequent mismatch repair processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c2">2</xref>). Gene conversion in yeast requires Rad51 and Rad52, and involves several other members of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c3">3</xref>). A non-conservative type of HR called single-strand annealing (SSA) can occur between direct repeats, leading to deletion of one repeat and sequences between repeats. Deletions can also occur by crossing over between direct repeats and by unequal sister chromatid exchange. In yeast, SSA requires Rad52 but not Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c5">5</xref>).</p><p> Homologs of the yeast HR proteins are also involved in mammalian HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c8">8</xref>). RAD51 and other members of the RAD51 family (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, DMC1, XRCC2 and XRCC3) are homologs of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c9">9</xref>). Similar to RecA, RAD51 is a DNA-dependent ATPase that can effect strand transfer <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c7">7</xref>). Human RAD52 binds to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c10">10</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays indicate that RAD52 promotes strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c11">11</xref>) and enhances RAD51 strand exchange activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c12">12</xref>). Other proteins known or suspected to influence HR directly or indirectly include RAD54, RAD54B, XRCC2, XRCC3, BRCA1, BRCA2, replication protein A, ATM, UBL1, UBC9, XRCC9&#x0002f;FANCG and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c13">13</xref>). Many of these proteins interact directly or indirectly with RAD51, RAD52 or each other, suggesting that HR is mediated by one or more multi-subunit complexes.</p><p> The <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of RAD51 have been difficult to investigate because vertebrate <italic>RAD51</italic> gene knockouts are non-viable at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c16">16</xref>). Alternative strategies to study <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> roles of RAD51 include conditional knockouts and gene overexpression. Unlike yeast, mouse RAD52 knockouts show a minimal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c8">8</xref>). Thus, overexpression is also a reasonable strategy for investigating <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of mammalian RAD52. In mammalian cells, the dominant DSB repair pathway is thought to be NHEJ, consistent with the idea that one or more HR proteins are rate limiting. This idea is supported by several studies showing that spontaneous HR and&#x0002f;or resistance to ionizing radiation is enhanced by overexpression of HR proteins, including human <italic>RAD52</italic> in monkey cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c17">17</xref>), Chinese hamster <italic>RAD51</italic> in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c19">19</xref>) and yeast <italic>RAD52</italic> in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c20">20</xref>). These results argue for strong conservation of RAD51 and RAD52 function in evolution, and this is borne out by the highly conserved amino acid sequences of these proteins, particularly among mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c22">22</xref>). Only two previous reports describe the effects of HR protein overexpression on DSB-induced HR. Yanez and Porter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c23">23</xref>) showed that overexpression of human RAD51 enhanced HR-dependent gene targeting in human cells several-fold. Lambert and Lopez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c24">24</xref>) targeted DSBs to a chromosomal direct repeat recombination substrate in hamster cells by using I-<italic>Sce</italic>I nuclease and found that overexpression of mouse RAD51 enhanced DSB-induced gene conversion 5-fold, but saw no effect on the frequency of deletion events. In contrast, overexpression of yeast Rad51 in hamster cells reduced gene conversion 40-fold. Thus, overexpression of RAD51 from a closely related species had positive effects on DSB-induced HR in mammalian cells, whereas overexpression of the more evolutionarily distant yeast Rad51 had dominant negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c24">24</xref>).</p><p> Several studies have correlated changes in RAD51 levels with cancer and other cellular phenotypes; however, little is known about the effects of altered RAD52 levels. Increased RAD51 was reported in sporadic ductal breast cancer and levels correlated with histological grading of the tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c25">25</xref>). In contrast, 30&#x00025; of breast carcinomas displayed decreased levels of RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c26">26</xref>). Two reports linked RAD51 polymorphisms with increased breast cancer risk in persons with mutations in BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c28">28</xref>), but it is not yet known whether these polymorphisms influence RAD51 expression or mRNA&#x0002f;protein stability. RAD51 levels were higher in immortalized human fibroblasts compared to normal diploid fibroblasts and increased RAD51 correlated with increased resistance to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c29">29</xref>). Radiation resistance of carcinoma cell lines correlated with increased RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c31">31</xref>) and reducing RAD51 by antisense and ribozyme approaches decreased radiation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c33">33</xref>).</p><p> In the present study we examined the effects of human RAD51 and&#x0002f;or human RAD52 overexpression on DSB-induced HR in CHO and human cells. In contrast to the results described above, we found that DSB-induced HR was reduced by overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52, perhaps reflecting an imbalance in the stoichiometry of the HR protein complex(es). These disparate results may reflect differences in overexpression levels or recombination substrates. In an attempt to restore stoichiometric balance, we co-overexpressed human RAD51 and human RAD52, but this led to further reductions in DSB-induced HR. In light of the role of RAD51 in strand transfer and the potential for RAD52 enhancement of this activity, we were also interested in determining whether overexpression of one or both of these proteins would increase conversion tract lengths, but found no evidence for such an effect. These results indicate that overexpression of RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 inhibits an early step in DSB-induced HR but does not affect the later steps, involving hDNA formation, mismatch repair or resolution of recombination intermediates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNAs</title><p>Plasmid pOPUR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c34">34</xref>) is a mammalian expression vector carrying the RSV LTR promoter and triplicated <italic>lac</italic> operators from pOPI3CAT (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the puromycin resistance gene (<italic>pac</italic>) from pPUR (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Human <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> cDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c22">22</xref>) were inserted downstream of the RSV LTR promoter, creating plasmids pOPUR&#x0002f;RAD51 and pOPUR&#x0002f;RAD52. RAD52 mRNA is unstable due to the presence of mRNA degradation signals in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c21">21</xref>). RAD52 mRNA stability was enhanced by deletion of these signals in pOPUR&#x0002f;RAD52; this change does not affect the RAD52 amino acid sequence, but does improve detection of RAD52 by western blot. When integrated into chromosomal DNA, these plasmids provide constitutive expression of RAD51 or RAD52 in the absence of the LacI repressor. pOPUR&#x0002f;RAD51 and pOPUR&#x0002f;RAD52 were also used to transiently express RAD51 and RAD52 in CHO cells with <italic>neo</italic> direct repeats; derivatives of these plasmids lacking the <italic>pac</italic> gene (called pO&#x0002f;RAD51 and pO&#x0002f;RAD52) were used to transiently express RAD51 and RAD52 in human cells carrying a <italic>pac</italic> inverted repeat recombination substrate (see&#x000a0;below). pOPI3 is a derivative of pOPI3CAT that lacks CAT and was used as &#x02018;empty&#x02019; control vector in some experiments. Plasmid pCMV(3&#x000d7;NLS)I-<italic>Sce</italic>I (kindly provided by Greg Donoho, Lexicon Genetics, The Woodlands, TX) contains the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I nuclease coding sequence fused at its 5&#x02032;-end to a triplicated nuclear localization signal, driven by the CMV promoter, and terminated by the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and northern and western analyses</title><p>CHO and human cells were grown in &#x003b1;MEM with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, 100 U&#x0002f;ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>. CHO strain 33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>) carries a single integrated copy of a <italic>neo</italic> direct repeat recombination substrate with a central SV40 promoter-driven <italic>E.coli</italic><italic>gpt</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f1">1</xref>A). Human cell line HT1080-1885 is a derivative of the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line with a single integrated copy of a <italic>pac </italic>inverted repeat recombination substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f1">1</xref>B). Derivatives of strain 33 carrying integrated copies of pOPUR-RAD51 or pOPUR-RAD52 were constructed by electroporating limiting amounts of either vector into strain 33 and selecting for transfectants resistant to 3.5 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml puromycin. <italic>RAD51</italic> and&#x0002f;or <italic>RAD52</italic> overexpression was monitored by northern and&#x0002f;or western blot analysis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c36">36</xref>). Rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 antibodies (Oncogene Science, Boston, MA) were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c34">34</xref>). Full-length RAD52 protein was expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> by using a His tag and injected into mouse for antibody production. We did not observe non-specific reactivity with pre-immune serum collected before RAD52 injection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Homologous recombination assays</title><p>DSB-induced HR frequencies were measured in CHO cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). Briefly, 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into 3.5 cm (diameter) wells, incubated for 24 h and lipofected with 2 &#x000b5;g pCMV(3&#x000d7;NLS)I-<italic>Sce</italic>I to induce DSBs. To measure spontaneous HR, we transfected cells with 2 &#x000b5;g negative control vector pCMV(I-<italic>Sce</italic>I<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c37">37</xref>) or pSV2gpt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c38">38</xref>). In transient RAD51&#x0002f;RAD52 overexpression experiments, 1 &#x000b5;g each of the RAD51 and RAD52 expression vectors were included with 1 &#x000b5;g pCMV(3&#x000d7;NLS)I-<italic>Sce</italic>I or negative control vector. The total amount of transfected DNA was held constant at 3 &#x000b5;g since cell survival can be influenced by the amount of DNA present during lipofection (unpublished results); this was accomplished by adjusting the amount of negative control vector. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded to each of four 10 cm dishes. After an additional 24 h, G418 was added (final concentration 250 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml, 100&#x00025; active) and cells were incubated for 12&#x02013;14 days before colonies were stained and scored. Cell viability was measured by seeding appropriate dilutions of cell suspensions into non-selective medium, incubating for 7&#x02013;10 days and scoring colony formation. DSB-induced HR frequencies were measured in HT1080-1885 cells using the same procedure, except that recombinants were selected with 0.8 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml puromycin. To measure spontaneous HR in HT1080-1885, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded to a 10 cm (diameter) dish, incubated for 24 h and lipofected with either 8 &#x000b5;g control vector (pOPI3) or 4 &#x000b5;g each pO&#x0002f;RAD51 and&#x0002f;or pO&#x0002f;RAD52, with the total amount held constant at 8 &#x000b5;g by adjusting the amount of negative control vector. Puromycin (0.8 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml) was added 48 h post-lipofection and recombinants and cell viability were scored as above. HR frequencies were calculated as the ratio of G418-resistant (G418<sup>r</sup>) or puromycin-resistant (Pur<sup>r</sup>) colonies to the total number of viable cells plated in selective medium. Gross structures of recombination products were analyzed by Southern hybridization as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). Gene conversion tracts in the <italic>neo</italic> recombination substrate were measured by restriction mapping of a 1.5 kb PCR fragment amplified with a MMTV promoter-specific primer (5&#x02032;-CCTTCACTTTCCAGAGGGTC) and a <italic>neo</italic>-specific primer (5&#x02032;-GCGAAGAACTCCAGCATGAG). All statistical analysis was performed using <italic>t</italic>-tests unless specified otherwise.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>We used CHO and human cell lines carrying chromosomal recombination substrates to test the effects of RAD51 and RAD52 overexpression on DSB-induced HR. CHO strain 33 cells carry direct <italic>neo</italic> repeats and human HT1080-1885 cells carry inverted <italic>pac</italic> repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f1">1</xref>). MMTV<italic>neo</italic> is inactivated by an I<italic>-Sce</italic>I recognition sequence inserted into the natural <italic>Ban</italic>II site and the second <italic>neo</italic> is inactive because it lacks a promoter. The second <italic>neo</italic> has 12 phenotypically silent single base mutations at &#x0223c;100 bp intervals that create RFLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). The silent RFLPs allow high resolution analysis of conversion tracts, including length, directionality and continuity. In HT1080-1885, one copy of <italic>pac</italic> is driven by the mouse PGK promoter, but is inactive because an I-<italic>Sce</italic>I recognition site was inserted into an 80 bp deletion in the coding sequence. The second copy of <italic>pac</italic> has a wild-type coding sequence but is inactive because it lacks a promoter. With either recombination substrate, transfection with an I<italic>-Sce</italic>I endonuclease expression vector leads to cleavage of the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I site, greatly enhancing HR and yielding selectable G418<sup>r</sup> or Pur<sup>r</sup> recombinants. There are several possible outcomes of HR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f1">1</xref>). HR can result in gene conversion without an associated crossover, which conserves the gross structure of the recombination substrates, but replaces the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I sites with wild-type information from the silent (donor) alleles. In the <italic>neo</italic> direct repeat, HR with an associated crossover leads to deletion of one repeat and the central sequences; deletions can also arise by unequal sister chromatid exchange or SSA. Based on evidence from yeast, all of these events are likely to require RAD52, and all but SSA are likely to require RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c39">39</xref>). In the inverted repeat, HR with an associated crossover leads to inversion of sequences between the two <italic>pac</italic> genes; such inversions may also arise by sister chromatid conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c41">41</xref>). Other more complex HR events are also possible; however, gene conversions without associated crossovers are the dominant DSB-induced product in both CHO strain 33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>) and in HT1080-1885 cells (data not shown). Selecting for G418<sup>r</sup> or Pur<sup>r</sup> products detects HR but not NHEJ.</p><p> Both transient and stable overexpression strategies were used to test the effects of excess RAD51 and RAD52 on DSB-induced HR. Transient overexpression was examined in CHO and human cells by co-transfecting RAD51 and RAD52 expression vectors with the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I expression vector. Due to incompatibilities with the various selectable markers, stable overexpression of RAD51 and RAD52 was attempted only in CHO cells. For each recombination substrate and RAD51&#x0002f;RAD52 overexpression condition, we measured DSB-induced HR frequencies and product spectra. Spontaneous HR can be measured by omitting the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression vector. The spontaneous HR frequency in CHO strain 33 is very low (near the limit of detection of 10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup>); this low level most likely reflects inhibition by the multiple markers in <italic>neo12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). Thus, strain 33 and its derivatives are not suitable for analyzing spontaneous HR and we limited our analysis with these cells to DSB-induced HR. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c19">19</xref>), spontaneous HR in HT1080-1885 was enhanced by &#x0003e;2-fold by overexpression of RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb1">1</xref>). Spontaneous HR was not significantly different when both RAD51 and RAD52 were overexpressed compared to values when only one of these proteins was overexpressed (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.32).</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of human RAD51 or RAD52 reduces DSB-induced HR in CHO cells</title><p>Our original strategy was to introduce the LacI repression system into CHO strain 33 and then stably transfect this derivative with pOPUR-RAD51 or pOPUR-RAD52 so that transgene expression could be regulated with IPTG. With this strategy it would be possible to compare DSB-induced HR in a single cell line with or without overexpression, although we found that most cell lines showed significant basal expression of RAD51 or RAD52, and upon addition of IPTG we observed little or no increase in RAD51 or RAD52 mRNA levels. However, preliminary experiments indicated that DSB-induced HR was &#x0223c;2-fold lower in these cell lines than in strain 33, and that DSB-induced HR was similar in strain 33 and the intermediate cell line expressing just LacI (data not shown).</p><p> The difficulties with the inducible expression system prompted us to switch to a constitutive overexpression strategy involving comparisons between CHO strain 33 and derivatives produced by stably integrating pOPUR-RAD51 or pOPUR-RAD52 into strain 33. Although these transgenes carry the <italic>lac</italic> operator, they are constitutively expressed in the absence of the LacI repressor. Northern (not shown) and western analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f2">2</xref>A and B) confirmed the constitutive overexpression of <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic>. We induced HR by transient transfection of the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I expression vector and observed &#x0003e;2-fold lower HR frequencies in cells overexpressing either RAD51 or RAD52 compared to parallel determinations with strain 33 (both <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.0001; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f3">3</xref>A).</p><p> Because several steps are required to construct constitutive overexpression cell lines (transfection, drug selection and population expansion), it was possible that the reduced HR described above was independent of excess RAD51 or RAD52, but instead reflected unwanted changes during cell line construction, such as altered transfection efficiency. To rule out this possibility, we performed transient overexpression assays in CHO strain 33. CHO strain 33 cells were co-transfected with the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression vector and pOPUR-RAD51 or pOPUR-RAD52. Western analysis confirmed transient overexpression of RAD51 and RAD52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f2">2</xref>C). Similar to the results above, transient overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52 significantly reduced DSB-induced HR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f3">3</xref>B; both <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Although we did not measure nuclear levels of RAD51 and RAD52, the observed effects on HR likely reflect increased nuclear protein levels since HR occurs in the nucleus.</p><p> The transient overexpression strategy provides a simple means to test the effects of simultaneous overexpression of RAD51 and RAD52 on DSB-induced HR. We hypothesized that the reduction in DSB-induced HR with excess RAD51 or RAD52 might result from an imbalance in the stoichiometry of HR proteins. Since RAD51 and RAD52 interact with each other, we reasoned that overexpression of both proteins might restore the balance and restore HR to wild-type levels. However, the opposite result was obtained: HR levels were significantly lower when both RAD51 and RAD52 were overexpressed compared to levels seen when the individual proteins were overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f3">3</xref>B; both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Together, these results indicate that overexpression of wild-type human RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 in CHO cells has dominant negative effects on DSB-induced HR.</p><p> We were interested in whether transcription would influence DSB-induced HR in the presence of excess RAD51 or RAD52. Transcription enhances spontaneous HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c36">36</xref>), but it has no effect on the frequency of DSB-induced HR or gene conversion tract lengths in CHO strain 33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). Since one copy of <italic>neo</italic> in CHO strain 33 is driven by the MMTV promoter, transcription can be adjusted from low to high levels by adding dexamethasone to the growth medium. RAD51 and RAD52 overexpression had similar dominant negative effects on DSB-induced HR in the presence and absence of dexamethasone (data not shown), hence, the remainder of the present study was performed without added dexamethasone.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52 has little effect on HR product spectra</title><p>RAD51 is thought to play a central role in strand transfer during HR, and RAD52 is thought to augment RAD51 function. We were interested in whether overexpression of these proteins would increase hDNA formation, reflected in increased conversion tract lengths. Because of the potential connection between gene conversion tract lengths and crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c42">42</xref>), we were also interested in whether RAD51 and RAD52 overexpression would alter the relative proportion of non-deletion (gene conversion without associated crossover) and deletion events. Product spectra were generated from strain 33 with or without overexpression of RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb2">2</xref>); these spectra were also compared to a prior strain 33 spectrum obtained without overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>). The new and old control spectra were similar in that most or all products resulted from gene conversion without an associated crossover and average tract lengths were &#x0223c;290 bp (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb2">2</xref>). The three product spectra with RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 overexpression were similar to each other and to the control spectra: in each case, all products resulted from gene conversion without an associated crossover and average tract lengths were not significantly different from control values, from each other or from that obtained when both RAD51 and RAD52 were overexpressed (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.3). These spectra were also similar in that most tracts were bidirectional (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb2">2</xref>), although there was a reduction in bidirectional tracts with excess RAD51 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.014, Fisher exact test), possibly reflecting a reduction in the number of conversions involving two-ended strand invasions. These results indicate that excess RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 affects only early steps in recombination; once an event is initiated, excess HR proteins do not appear to affect later steps such as hDNA formation, mismatch repair or the resolution of intermediates.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of human RAD51 and RAD52 reduces DSB-induced HR in human cells</title><p>Because RAD51 and RAD52 are each highly conserved in human and hamster, it was unlikely that the dominant negative effects of human RAD51 and RAD52 overexpression in CHO cells reflected a cross-species effect. To rule out this possibility, we transiently overexpressed human RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 in human HT1080-1885 cells and measured the frequency of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced HR between inverted <italic>pac</italic> repeats. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f5">5</xref>, overexpression of human RAD51 or RAD52 significantly reduced DSB-induced HR in human cells (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Similar to the results in CHO cells, co-overexpression of RAD51 and RAD52 significantly reduced HR below that seen with overexpression of either protein alone (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type human RAD51 and&#x0002f;or wild-type human RAD52 has dominant negative effects on DSB-induced HR in CHO and human cells. Similarly, overexpression of yeast Rad54 in yeast has dominant negative effects on cell survival and resistance to genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c43">43</xref>). We recently showed that overexpression of yeast Rad51 in yeast reduces DSB-induced HR and increases DSB-dependent cell killing (K.Spitz, J.Clikeman, S.Palmer and J.Nickoloff, unpublished results). It is a formal possibility that excess RAD51 or RAD52 reduces DSB induction by I-<italic>Sce</italic>I. However, we found no correlation between HR and DSB levels in yeast. This is a difficult issue to resolve since DSB levels reflect both DSB induction and repair, both of which may be affected by excess RAD proteins. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that excess RAD proteins reduce DSB induction, this is highly unlikely since there is no reason to suspect that RAD proteins directly interact with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I nuclease or that excess RAD proteins block access of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I to target sites in the genome.</p><p> In contrast to the negative effects of excess RAD proteins on DSB-induced HR, prior studies demonstrated that excess RAD51 or RAD52 enhances spontaneous HR in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c19">19</xref>). This difference does not reflect strain or recombination substrate differences as we show that excess RAD51 and&#x0002f;or RAD52 reduces DSB-induced HR and enhances spontaneous HR in the same cell line (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f5">5</xref>). It is not known how spontaneous recombination is initiated, but it may depend on replication, occurring when a replication fork encounters unrepaired or incompletely repaired DNA damage. For example, DSBs may arise when a replication fork encounters a single-strand break in the template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c44">44</xref>) or lesions that block replication forks may be bypassed by a recombinational mechanism that is independent of DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c45">45</xref>). The increased levels of RAD51 and RAD52 during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c47">47</xref>) and the fact that RAD51 is essential for cell division in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c16">16</xref>) indicate that recombination plays an important role in replication. In contrast, DSB-induced HR may be partly or completely replication independent. Thus, the distinct effects of HR protein overexpression on spontaneous and DSB-induced HR may reflect differences in the roles of these proteins during replication and DSB repair. For example, excess HR proteins may stimulate spontaneous recombination by enhancing strand exchange between sister chromatids independently of blocked replication forks. Excess HR proteins may reduce DSB-induced HR by directly inhibiting one or more steps during HR or by causing a shift in the types of products produced, as outlined below.</p><p> RAD51 and RAD52 interact with each other and with several other proteins and may form transient complexes that function at different stages of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c48">48</xref>). Overexpression of one member of a complex can lead to imbalanced stoichiometry that compromises the function of the complex. This can occur through depletion of interacting partners, a mechanism proposed to account for the dominant negative effects of human MSH3 and yeast Mlh1 overexpression on mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c50">50</xref>). A similar model was advanced to account for the dominant negative effects of high concentrations of yeast Rad51 and Rad52 on <italic>in vitro</italic> strand exchange. Thus, strand exchange increases in proportion to the concentration of these proteins to a point, but is inhibited by higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c52">52</xref>). Since RAD51 and RAD52 both have DNA-binding activity, an alternative explanation for the dominant negative effects observed in the present study is that the individual proteins might compete with active complexes for DNA ends. In this view, an individual HR protein present in excess binds to a DNA end but is unable on its own to facilitate the repair event, blocking access of active complexes to the DNA end and reducing HR. A variation on this idea derives from findings that <italic>in vitro</italic> strand exchange is strongly affected by the order of addition of HR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c53">53</xref>), suggesting that efficient HR requires an optimal temporal association among DSBs, RAD51 and RAD52. The dominant negative effects we observed with HR protein overexpression may reflect disruption of temporal requirements. We showed that co-overexpression of human RAD51 and RAD52 failed to restore HR to wild-type levels, but instead reduced HR even further. This result might be interpreted in two ways: (i) the two proteins in excess are unable to sequester each other and restore stoichiometric balance of HR complexes or (ii) co-overexpression further disrupts the temporal requirements for HR, an idea supported by the finding that mixing human RAD51 and RAD52 prior to addition to DNA prevents <italic>in vitro</italic> strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c7">7</xref>).</p><p> Each of the models above is based on the idea that excess RAD51 and RAD52 inhibits one or more steps in the HR reaction and, at least in the case of excess RAD51, this idea is supported by the observed reduction in bidirectional tracts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke582tb2">2</xref>). We also observed a reduction in bidirectional tracts of DSB-induced products in yeast overexpressing yeast <italic>RAD51</italic> (K. Spitz, J. Clikeman, S. Palmer and J. Nickoloff, unpublished results). In this view, excess RAD51 may reduce the efficiency of strand invasion and thereby reduce the probability of two-ended invasions. Alternatively, excess HR proteins might instead stimulate specific types of HR events leading to a shift in the product spectrum. For example, if excess RAD51 and RAD52 shifted events from unequal to equal sister chromatid exchange, the number of detectable (unequal) events would decrease. Current data do not distinguish between these different classes of models.</p><p> Gene conversion tracts reflect both hDNA formation and mismatch repair of hDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c55">55</xref>). hDNA may form by Rad51-mediated strand exchange as well as by branch migration of Holliday junctions. We found that increasing RAD51 and RAD52 had little or no effect on gene conversion tract lengths. It is possible that increasing RAD51 and RAD52 does not increase tract lengths because these proteins have limited strand transfer activity outside of the normal HR complex(es).</p><p> Published reports suggest that HR contributes significantly to radiation resistance. RAD51 levels were higher in immortalized human fibroblasts compared to normal diploid fibroblasts and increased RAD51 correlated with increased resistance to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c29">29</xref>). Radiation resistance of carcinoma cell lines correlated with increased RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c31">31</xref>) and reducing RAD51 decreased radiation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c33">33</xref>). In the present study we did not observe significant cell killing upon DSB induction with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, nor was cell killing enhanced by overexpression of RAD51 and RAD52 (data not shown). However, our assays are probably not sensitive enough to detect RAD51&#x0002f;RAD52 effects on cell killing since only a fraction of cells are transfected by the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression vector, and these cells each suffer at most a single DSB. As mentioned above, DSB-dependent cell killing is enhanced in yeast overexpressing yeast Rad51.</p><p> The dominant negative effects of RAD51 overexpression on DSB-induced HR that we observed contrast with the results of Lambert and Lopez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c24">24</xref>), who found that overexpression of mouse RAD51 enhanced DSB-induced HR in CHO cells. There are a number of similarities and differences in the experimental designs of these studies. In both cases, DSB-induced HR was examined at <italic>neo</italic> direct repeats in CHO cells, with a transcriptionally active <italic>neo</italic> inactivated by an I-<italic>Sce</italic>I site and a second <italic>neo</italic> lacking a promoter. Under normal conditions, transient expression of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I greatly enhances HR in both recombination substrates. One subtle difference is that mouse RAD51 was overexpressed in the prior study and we used human RAD51, but this is unlikely to account for the distinct results given that RAD51 amino acid sequences are highly conserved among mammals. In addition, the reduction in HR in CHO cells is unlikely to be due to cross-species effects since we found that HR was similarly reduced when human RAD51 was overexpressed in human cells. Unlike the prior study, our <italic>neo</italic> repeats had multiple markers, but this too is unlikely to account for the distinct results since we also observed dominant negative effects with the unmarked <italic>pac</italic> substrate.</p><p> There are two other differences in the two study designs that are more likely to influence the outcome: repeat lengths and the level of RAD51 expression. In the prior study, the <italic>neo</italic> repeats were 0.7 kb in length, compared to 1.4 kb in our study, and repeat length appears to strongly affect product spectra. With the 0.7 kb repeats, &#x0223c;33&#x00025; of products resulted from gene conversion without an associated crossover and the remainder resulted in deletions (via conversion with crossover, SSA or unequal sister chromatid exchange). In contrast, nearly all DSB-induced HR in the 1.4 kb repeats is by conversion without an associated crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c35">35</xref>; this study). Thus, the proportion of deletion events is inversely correlated with repeat length; a similar correlation is apparent in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c57">57</xref>). Overexpression of mouse RAD51 stimulated only the minor (conversion) pathway; there was no effect on deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c24">24</xref>). In contrast, we observed dominant negative effects on conversions (and no shift in product spectra) upon overexpression of human RAD51. It is possible that excess RAD51 stimulated conversion in the 0.7 kb repeats because the conversion pathway is less efficient with short repeats and is therefore more easily facilitated by extra RAD51. With longer repeats, conversion is the dominant outcome and additional RAD51 does not facilitate this pathway but instead is inhibitory. Note that this model is inconsistent with the idea that excess HR protein disrupts the temporal requirements of HR since temporal disruptions would be expected to affect HR independently of repeat length. The other significant difference between the two studies is the level of RAD51 overexpression. In the prior study only modest overexpression was achieved (visual inspection of western blots suggests a 2- to 4-fold increase over endogenous levels), whereas we estimate increases at 4- to &#x0003e;10-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke582f2">2</xref>A and C). The different results of the two studies could be explained if DSB-induced HR is enhanced by a small increase in RAD51 but inhibited by a large increase, as seen with <italic>in vitro</italic> strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c52">52</xref>). A definitive answer to this question will require cell lines with recombination substrates having variable length repeats (targeted to a single chromosomal locus to avoid position effects) and cell lines that allow controlled RAD51 expression; these experiments are in progress.</p><p> Most gene targeting involves interactions between a linear exogenous vector sharing sequence homology to the target locus. Because HR in mammalian cells is relatively inefficient and NHEJ is relatively efficient, this mode of gene targeting is inefficient, and there has been some success in enhancing gene targeting by overexpressing <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA and human RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c58">58</xref>). An alternative way to enhance gene targeting is by creating DSBs in the target locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke582c59">59</xref>), but our results suggest that overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52 is unlikely to enhance this mode of gene targeting.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke582f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structures of recombination substrates and products.
