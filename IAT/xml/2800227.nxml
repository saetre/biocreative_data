However, it is not known whether CBC has a role in alternative splicing. Using an RT&#x02013;PCR alternative splicing panel, we analysed 435 alternative splicing events in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genes, encoding mainly transcription factors, splicing factors and stress-related proteins. Splicing profiles were determined in wild type plants, the <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> single mutants and the <italic>cbp20/80</italic> double mutant. The alternative splicing events included alternative 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice site selection, exon skipping and intron retention. Significant changes in the ratios of alternative splicing isoforms were found in 101 genes. Of these, 41% were common to all three CBC mutants and 15% were observed only in the double mutant. The <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> and <italic>cbp20/80</italic> mutants had many more changes in alternative splicing in common than did <italic>cbp</italic>20 and <italic>cbp</italic>20/80 suggesting that CBP80 plays a more significant role in alternative splicing than CBP20, probably being a platform for interactions with other splicing factors. Cap-binding proteins and the CBC are therefore directly involved in alternative splicing of some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes and in most cases influenced alternative splicing of the first intron, particularly at the 5&#x02032; splice site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alternative splicing is a widespread process that generates more than one spliced mRNA isoform from the same gene and expands both transcriptome and proteome diversity. Alternative events include alternative 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice site selection, intron retention, exon skipping and mutually exclusive exon splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Current estimates from both experimental and bioinformatic analyses are that 30&#x02013;35% of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and rice genes undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), while in human up to 95% of multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The number of alternatively spliced plant genes is still likely to be an underestimate because of the relatively low EST coverage and depth of sequencing for many plant transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In addition, many alternative splicing events occur only in specific cells and tissues, at specific stages of development and/or under certain physiological conditions and are therefore under-represented in EST databases. In plants, intron retention is the most frequent alternative event (45&#x02013;56% of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> alternative splicing events) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). Alternative 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; splice site selection accounts for &#x0223c;22 and 10% of events, respectively, and &#x0223c;4% have both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; alternatively spliced sites. Only 8% of alternative splicing events in plants involve exon skipping (inclusion/exclusion of an exon) in contrast to animals where exon skipping is the most common form of alternative splicing (58% of genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The two major consequences of alternative splicing are to increase protein diversity by the inclusion or exclusion of peptide sequences or protein domains or to modulate gene expression through the production of mRNA isoforms which are degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). More than 75% of alternative splicing events are within the coding sequence of the gene and can generate proteins with new structures and biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, in both plants and animals, a significant number of AS events in the coding regions have a premature termination codon and are the potential targets of NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In plants, &#x0223c;21% of all alternative splicing events take place within the 5&#x02032; UTR (15%) or 3&#x02032; UTR (6%) which can affect transport and stability of mRNAs, create new initiation codons or polyadenylation sites, generate upstream open reading frames or shift the reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Regulation of alternative splicing in plants has been reported for many genes and evolutionary conserved regulation of alternative splicing of plant SR proteins which themselves are splicing regulators points to important roles of alternative splicing in plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). For example, the circadian clock RNA-binding protein, AtGRP7, autoregulates its transcript levels by binding its pre-mRNA to cause alternative splicing and generate an isoform that is turned over by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The rice <italic>Waxy</italic> gene encodes a granule-bound starch synthase for which alternative splicing is temperature sensitive, potentially contributing to poor grain quality when seed maturation occurs at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Alternative splicing of the first intron of the isoaspartyl methyltransferase 2 gene creates different protein variants found in different subcellular compartments where they are involved in protein repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Some transcripts can be alternatively spliced in plants in response to wounding or virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Alternative splicing can also be regulated in a temperature-dependent manner, such as the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> SR1 splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), or in a tissue-dependent manner, for example, tobacco <italic>RGP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and spinach and tobacco chloroplast ascorbate peroxidase transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>The eukaryotic nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) consists of two subunits (CBP20 and CBP80) that, as a complex, bind to the cap structure of RNA polymerase II transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The cap and the CBC have multiple functions in mRNA biogenesis including splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">26&#x02013;31</xref>), 3&#x02032;-end formation by stabilizing the interaction of the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36 B37">34&#x02013;37</xref>) and protection of the transcripts from nuclease degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39">38&#x02013;39</xref>). Constitutive and alternative splicing is mediated by the spliceosome which is assembled on an intron in a stepwise process. An early event in spliceosome assembly is the interaction of U1snRNP with the 5&#x02032; splice site of the intron. In mammals and yeast, the CBC at the 5&#x02032;-end of the pre-mRNA transcript promotes the initial interaction between U1snRNP and the 5&#x02032; splice site of the first intron in the transcript, and enhances the formation of spliced mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">26&#x02013;31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43 B44">40&#x02013;44</xref>). CBP proteins remain bound to the mRNA during the pioneer round of translation playing an essential role in mRNA quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Moreover, in mammalian cells, CBP80 recruits the NMD factor Upf1 and promotes the interaction of Upf1 with the NMD factor Upf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>The plant CBC also consists of two subunits: AtCBP20 and AtCBP80. AtCBP20 has a calculated molecular mass of 29.9 kDa and exhibits 68% identity and 82% similarity to its human orthologue and 53% identity and 77% similarity to the yeast protein. The larger CBP80 subunit is 96.5 kDa and exhibits lower identity (28 and 22%) and similarity (50 and 42%) to its human and yeast orthologues, respectively. AtCBP20 contains a canonical RNA binding domain (RBD) and AtCBP80 contains a protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;nucleic acid interaction domain, MIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Additionally, in contrast to human and yeast, AtCBP20 has a long C-terminal extension with two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs) and is actively transported to the nucleus, while AtCBP80 can reach the nucleus only in a complex with AtCBP20. This feature distinguishes the mechanism of CBP transport in plants and animals where the nuclear import of human CBC requires a bipartite NLS on CBP80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Moreover, neither CBP20 nor CBP80 is involved in NMD in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>Both plant CBC proteins are encoded by single-copy genes on Arabidopsis chromosomes V and II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and T-DNA insertion mutants which disrupt either the <italic>AtCBP20</italic> or <italic>AtCBP80(ABH1)</italic> genes show identical phenotypes: slow growth and serrated leaf margins. Both mutants are abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitive and can tolerate water deficiency much better than wild type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52 B53">50&#x02013;53</xref>). The mutants also affect flowering time and the processing and splicing of mRNA of factors involved in the regulation of flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). The increase in the occurrence of unspliced introns demonstrates a further effect of the CBC on pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Finally, the plant CBC has recently been shown to mediate the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Both <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> mutants have reduced miRNA levels and increased pri-miRNA levels. CBP20 and CBP80 are suggested to bind to capped pri-miRNA transcripts and play role in their processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The CBC interaction with the miRNA processing machinery appears to involve SERRATE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and is likely to facilitate the loading of the miRNA processing machinery onto pri-miRNA, in analogy with its role in recruiting the splicing commitment complex onto pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The role of CBP80 in miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway may also be conserved in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Finally, both proteins also participate in ta-siRNA biogenesis through regulating the biogenesis of miR173 and miR390 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>The CBC is important in pre-mRNA splicing and other aspects of RNA processing in plants. To date, there is no evidence that the nuclear cap-binding complex is involved in alternative splicing and whether the plant CBC exerts an effect on splicing by a similar mechanism to animals&#x02014;promoting spliceosome assembly on the first intron&#x02014;is unknown. In this article, we have addressed the influence of the nuclear cap-binding complex on alternative splicing of 252 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene transcripts showing alternative splicing, using the T-DNA insertion knock-out mutants: the single <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> mutants and the double <italic>cbp20/80</italic> mutant. In the cases that showed significant changes in AS, the mutants preferentially affect alternative splicing of the first intron and particularly at the 5&#x02032; splice site. Similar changes in the alternative splicing profiles of many gene transcripts were observed in all three <italic>cbp</italic> mutants suggesting that the CBC is directly involved in alternative splicing of these pre-mRNAs. Interestingly, our results revealed that AtCBP80 plays a more significant role in alternative splicing than AtCBP20.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (wild-type Columbia and <italic>cbp</italic> mutant) seeds were placed in a bell-jar and sterilised using hydrochloric acid fumes generated from a solution containing 100 ml ACE bleach (5.25% v/v, Procter and Gamble) and 3 ml concentrated HCl. Sterilised seeds were sown in soil treated with Amistar fungicide (Syngenta), and were kept at 4&#x000b0;C for 72 h in the dark.

Reverse transcription by M-MLV RT (<italic>RNase H</italic>-) (Promega) was performed using oligo d(T)<sup>18</sup> oligonucleotide as a primer. First, 5 &#x000b5;g of extracted RNA and 1 &#x000b5;l oligo d(T)<sup>18</sup> (10 mM) were mixed in a total volume of 26 &#x000b5;l, incubated for 5 min at 65&#x000b0;C to melt secondary structures within the template, and cooled immediately for 10 min on ice.

The double mutant has a similar phenotype to the single mutants: slow growth and serrated leaf margins, ABA hypersensitivity and greater resistance to water deficiency than wild type plants. PCR products were separated on an ABI3730 automated DNA sequencer and analysed by <italic>GeneMapper</italic> or <italic>PeakScanner</italic> software (Applied Biosystems). The ratio of the peak areas of the alternatively spliced isoforms for each gene in the wild type plant was compared to the ratio of the peak areas of products in the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants. Means and standard errors were calculated for three separate experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative splicing is affected in <italic>cbp</italic> mutants</title><p>Of the 435 genes tested, 99 genes did not show RT&#x02013;PCR products. This is most likely to be due to very low level of expression of these particular genes in the plant tissue analysed (35-days-old leaves). For 84 cases only one splicing isoform was observed. This suggested that the alternative splicing events did not occur in the tissue and developmental stage analysed or represented extremely rare events even though supported by EST/cDNA sequences. As neither of the above groups provide alternative splicing information in the tissue analysed, these events were not included in further analysis.</p><p>Of the 252 remaining different AS events 101 showed significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.10) changes in the ratio of alternatively spliced isoforms of over 3% between wild type plants and the <italic>cbp20</italic>, <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> or <italic>cbp20/80</italic> mutants. Of these events, 41 were common to all three mutants, nine were found in both the <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> and <italic>cbp20/80</italic> mutants, four were common to <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp20/80</italic>, five were common to <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic>, 15 were found only in the double mutant, and 6 and 21 only in the single <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Different types of alternative splicing events were affected in the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The majority of the alternative splicing events involved two alternative products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and four events involved three alternative products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the majority of AS events showing significant changes in alternative splicing profiles (41 events&#x02014;41%) were found in all three <italic>cbp</italic> mutants. For example, in At5g43270, both single mutants showed a similar significant change in AS but the largest change was seen in the double mutant where the ratio of the two alternatively spliced isoforms changed from 76%:24% to 51%:49% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In At1g31500, the degree of change was similar in all three mutants changing from 61%:39% to &#x0223c;70%:30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In At5g02470, there were different degrees of significant changes in all three mutants but again the biggest change in the ratio of AS1:AS2 was in the double mutant (from 53:47 to 80:20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Knocking out the CBC could potentially have a general affect on mRNA stability leading to the observed changes in alternative splicing. We therefore analysed by microarray analysis the expression levels of genes in the <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80</italic> mutants compared to wild-type. Across all genes, &#x0003e;97% showed no differences in expression and in the genes containing the 101 significantly different alternative splicing events, only one had a reduced expression level and two had increased expression (data not shown). Thus, the CBC directly influences the selection of alternative splice sites and the extent and pattern of changes varied among the AS events and the different mutants. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Distribution of alternative splicing events with significant changes in alternative splicing profiles in the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp869f1"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Distribution of different alternative splicing events with significantly changed alternative splicing profile among the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="5" align="center" rowspan="1">Alternative splicing event<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene number</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alt 3&#x02032; splice site</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alt 5&#x02032; splice site</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon skipping</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alternative position</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intron retention</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">All <italic>cbp</italic> mutants</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp80</italic> plus <italic>cbp20/80</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp20/80</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp80</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp20</italic> plus <italic>cbp80</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp20</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>cbp20</italic> plus <italic>cbp20/80</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">101</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Significant changes in alternative splicing isoform (two products) abundance in nuclear cap-binding complex mutants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp869i1.jpg"/></td></tr></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p>The relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms is presented as a ratio of the two products for wild type, for the single mutants <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80</italic>, and the double mutant <italic>cbp20cbp80</italic> (<italic>cbp20/80</italic>).

To examine whether <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear cap-binding proteins also affected the first intron of transcripts, we compared the position of the introns affected by alternative splicing in the total number of events (252), the events which showed a significant change at least one of the mutants (101) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and those events which showed a significant change in alternative splicing in all three mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Among the 252 events showing alternative splicing on the RT&#x02013;PCR panel, 107 events (42%) involved the first intron in the gene transcript, 102 (40%) involved an internal intron and 43 (17%) involved the last intron in the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the group of 101 AS events with a significantly different alternative splicing profile in at least one mutant 50% are alternatively spliced in the first intron, whereas 33 and 18% are alternatively spliced in the internal intron and the last intron of transcripts, respectively. Interestingly, of the 41 events which showed significant changes in alternative splicing in all three mutants, the first intron was alternatively spliced in 23 of the events (56%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Only 19.5% involved internal introns and 24% involved the last intron. Thus, the percentage of alternatively spliced first and internal introns differs significantly between the total number of AS events analysed and those with significant changes in the three <italic>cbp</italic> mutants. The percentage of AS events involving the last intron increased in the AS events which were significantly different in all three mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that for those genes where mutation of the CBC affected alternative splicing, the CBC is preferentially involved in alternative splicing of the first intron. In most cases (93%), the alternative first introns are located within the 5&#x02032;UTRs or span the 5&#x02032;UTR and coding sequence of the genes studied. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Percentage distribution of the position of alternative splicing events.

These groups consisted of 107 of the 252 total AS events, 50 of the 101 AS events changed in at least one <italic>cbp</italic> mutant and 23 of the 41 AS events with significant changes in all three mutants. Of the 107 first intron events, 36 (34%) involved alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection. Similarly, of the 50 AS events changed in at least one <italic>cbp</italic> mutant, 16 (32%) involved 5&#x02032; splice site selection. Finally, of the 23 first intron events with significant AS changes in all three <italic>cbp</italic> mutants, 11 (48%) involved alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus, both the total number of alternative splicing events which are changed in all three mutants and those which affect the first intron are enriched in alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection. This change in distribution suggests that CBC proteins are preferentially, but not exclusively, involved in the regulation of alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection in the first intron.</p><p>As the CBC preferentially affects alternative 5&#x02032; splice selection in the first intron of transcripts, we examined whether the CBC also influenced the selection of the alternative 5&#x02032; splice site. If the CBC promoted usage of the 5&#x02032; splice site nearest to it, these events would be expected to predominantly use the 5&#x02032; splice site proximal to the cap. A total of 16 AS events involved alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites in the first intron and showed significant changes in all three mutants (11 events) or in one mutant (five events) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Of these, seven preferentially used the 5&#x02032; splice site closest to the cap in wild type plants, seven used the cap-distal site and two used both sites equally. This suggests that there is no preference for selection of either cap-proximal or cap-distal sites in first intron. The splicing behaviour of these events in the absence of the CBC followed two basic and subtly different patterns. In the first case, in the wild type, the CBC preferentially promoted selection of either the cap-proximal or the cap-distal site to generate more of the major alternative splicing isoform. In the knock-out mutants, the use of these sites were reduced increasing the amount of the minor isoform. Thus, although both sites were used, the CBC preferentially used one or other of the 5&#x02032; splice sites. Six of the 16 events followed this pattern (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>&#x02014;labelled as &#x02018;Major&#x02019;). In the second case, one splice site was used preferentially in the wild-type as above, but in the mutants, use of this splice site increased showing that the CBC actively promoted usage of the alternative splice site which generates the minor splice isoform. This occurred in eight of the remaining cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>&#x02014;labelled &#x02018;Minor&#x02019;). In two events studied, it was impossible to point out the major splicing isoform since both alternative variants occur in equal amounts in wild type plants. However, the ratio between both splicing isoforms changed significantly in the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants; in one case use of the proximal 5&#x02032;ss increased, and in another, use of the proximal 5&#x02032;ss decreased. Our results show that there is no preference for the CBC to promote usage of the 5&#x02032; splice site closest to it, and the CBC, therefore can promote selection of one or other or both (or more) alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites to increase the levels of alternative isoforms. <table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Use of alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites in first introns with significant changes in nuclear cap-binding complex mutants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp869i3.jpg"/></td></tr></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF3"><p>The relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms is presented as a ratio of the two products for wild type, for the single mutants <italic>cbp20</italic> and <italic>cbp80</italic>, and for the double mutant <italic>cbp20cbp80</italic> (<italic>cbp20/80</italic>).

To address this, we looked at the six intron retention events where there was a significant change in splicing in at least one <italic>cbp</italic> mutant. Of these, two events involved retention of the first intron (At1g01060 and At4g23260) and two of the second intron (At5g25610 and At2g47890). Although significant in only the <italic>cbp80</italic> or the double mutant, all four showed a decrease in splicing of the intron. The other two intron retention events affected the fifth and sixth introns (At3g13224 and At1g69250) and splicing efficiency increased in the mutants affected. Although only a small number of intron retention events showed significant changes, those involving introns near the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA were less efficiently spliced in at least one mutant suggesting that the CBC may influence the efficiency of removal of such introns.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The nuclear CBC in animal systems promotes an efficient interaction between the U1snRNP and the first intron of a pre-mRNA transcript, thereby enhancing spliceosome assembly and the formation of spliced mRNAs. Using knock-out mutants of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cap-binding proteins and an alternative splicing RT&#x02013;PCR panel, we have examined the influence of the CBC on alternative splicing of multiple different pre-mRNAs. The CBC significantly affected (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.10) the alternative splicing of 101 events from the 252 analysed and the events involved introns at different positions in the various transcripts. However, the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants preferentially affected splicing within the first intron in over half of the AS events which had significant changes in the mutants. In addition, this effect was preferentially exerted at the 5&#x02032; splice site consistent with the model for animal systems that the CBC promotes 5&#x02032; splice site selection of the first intron. Clearly many internal or last introns also showed an influence of the CBC on splicing/alternative splicing. Indeed, when considering events affected in all three mutants, the proportion of last introns affected increased as well as the proportion of first introns. The effect of the CBC on introns other than those towards the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA may be the result of indirect regulation of other splicing factors affecting the splicing of these (and also some first introns) or may reflect three-dimensional interactions in the pre-mRNA. For example, interactions between the cap and polyadenylation proteins to circularize mRNAs increase translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and have been suggested to be involved in NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). In addition, plant genes and particularly introns are much smaller than those in animal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) potentially permitting a range of interactions between the CBC and other regions of the transcript.</p><p>An effect of the CBC on alternative splicing has not been shown previously. Consideration of the model of the CBC promoting the interaction between the U1snRNP and 5&#x02032; splice site of the first intron predicts that, when alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites are available, the CBC would promote splicing by recruiting of U1snRNP to one or other of these sites and potentially to the 5&#x02032; splice site nearest to the cap. Our analysis of alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection in first introns with significant changes in AS in the <italic>cbp</italic> mutants showed firstly that there was no preference for use of the cap-proximal alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites, and secondly, that the CBC either showed a preference for one or other site or actively promoted use of a minor site. Thus, the CBC affected usage of both major and minor alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites. This suggests that while the CBC preferentially affects alternative 5&#x02032; splice site selection in the first intron, it can promote usage of both alternative splice sites and thereby influence the levels of alternative isoforms. The choice of site and degree of use are therefore most likely to reflect the strength of the splice sites, possibly the distance of the sites from the cap, and the presence of splicing enhancer or silencer sequences and interactions of other splicing factors. This is the first demonstration that the CBC can affect alternative splicing and is again consistent with the model of the CBC mediating interactions between the U1 snRNP and 5&#x02032; splice site of the first intron.</p><p>Comparison of the effects of the two single mutants and the double mutant showed that on the basis of the number of alternatively spliced events analysed here, more AS events were affected by mutation of <italic>AtCBP80(ABH1)</italic> than <italic>AtCBP20</italic>. This suggests that the larger subunit of the plant nuclear CBC plays a more significant role in this complex during splicing/alternative splicing regulation. Given that in plants, CBP20 contains the NLSs and that nuclear import of CBP80 is thought to depend on CBP20, we expected that mutation of CBP20 would be more severe in its effects on splicing. However, although in the single mutants, no AtCBP20 or AtCBP80 is detected, the protein levels of the remaining AtCBP80 and AtCBP20 respectively vary. Interestingly, in the <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> mutant, not only is the CBP80 protein absent but also the level of AtCBP20 protein is much reduced suggesting that in the absence of AtCBP80, the AtCBP20 subunit is unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Thus, the <italic>cbp80</italic> mutant is very similar to the double mutant in terms of the levels of CBP20 and CBP80 proteins and the splicing phenotypes of these mutants. In contrast, in the <italic>cbp20</italic> mutant which affected fewer of the alternative splicing events, AtCBP20 was absent but the AtCBP80 protein was present only at slightly reduced level to wild-type. This suggests that in the absence of AtCBP20, the larger subunit may still be able to interact in the splicing process albeit less efficiently. In yeast, CBP20-deficient (<italic>cbp20-&#x00394;</italic>) mutants accumulated amounts of yCBP80 similar to those observed in the wild type strain, whereas the <italic>cbp80-&#x00394;</italic> strain accumulated four-fold less yCBP20 than the wild type, suggesting that yCBP20 is unstable in the absence of yCBP80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). This observation suggests that protein interaction with CBP80 may modulate the stability of its partners. Assuming that AtCBP80 can interact with other splicing factors, it may still recruit factors to particular pre-mRNAs and thereby exert a stronger influence on splicing than AtCBP20. It was previously shown that the level of the CBC in the nucleus is precisely regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and the composition of the protein bound to the cap changed dynamically during a growth cycle in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Finally, that the single and double mutants are viable [similar to yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>)], and that many splicing events are unaffected in the mutants in this analysis, suggests the splicing of some introns is more dependent on the CBC than others. This may reflect the strength of intron splicing signals and of splicing enhancer sequences which can recruit splicing factors without the CBC.</p><p>Some splicing alterations were unique to the <italic>cbp20</italic> and the <italic>cbp80(abh1)</italic> mutants which may reflect variation in the degree of dependence of intron splicing on the cap or proteins associated with the CBPs or varying ability of other proteins to compensate in the absence of one or other of the CBPs. Similarly, some AS changes were observed in the double mutant only. It is also possible that loss of one or other or both CBPs affects the splicing/alternative splicing of transcripts of genes encoding specific factors required for splicing of certain genes thereby indirectly affecting splicing of these genes. The fact that alternative splicing of transcription and splicing factors may be regulated by the CBC complex can explain, at least partially, the growth, developmental and physiological phenotypes of the mutants. In conclusion, in addition to constitutive splicing, the CBC is involved in alternative splicing in plants. In both cases, the CBC preferentially influences the first intron, particularly at its 5&#x02032; splice site during alternative splicing in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp869/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [PBZ-MNiSW-2/3/2006/5.2 to Z.S.K, PBZ 01-003-00-07 to A.J. and 312/N-COST/2008/0 to A.J. and Z.S.K.]; the Scottish Government&#x02014;Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate (RERAD) [WP114]; and the EU FP6 Programme Network of Excellence on Alternative Splicing (EURASNET) [LSHG-CT-2005-518238 to A.J. and J.W.S.B.].
