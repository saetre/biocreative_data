It was recently shown that successive cisternae in the Golgi stack are interconnected by membrane tubules that form during the arrival of transport carriers from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we examine the mechanisms of generation and the function of these tubules. In principle, tubule formation might depend on several protein- and/or lipid-based mechanisms. Among the latter, we have studied the phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>)-mediated generation of wedge-shaped lysolipids, with the resulting local positive membrane curvature. We show that the arrival of cargo at the Golgi complex induces the recruitment of Group IVA Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent, cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;) onto the Golgi complex itself, and that this cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is required for the formation of the traffic-dependent intercisternal tubules and for intra-Golgi transport. In contrast, silencing of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; has no inhibitory effects on peri-Golgi vesicles. These findings identify cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; as the first component of the machinery that is responsible for the formation of intercisternal tubular continuities and support a role for these continuities in transport through the Golgi complex.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>After their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cargo proteins move to the Golgi complex.

Among these, the cisternal progression model has recently gained broad consensus, although the nature of the intermediates involved in this mechanism (vesicles or intercisternal tubules) remains unclear. In addition, more recently, a new model has been proposed by which cargo molecules mix rapidly throughout the stack (compatible with cargo diffusion via intercisternal continuities) and then partition into specialized export domains before leaving the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Patterson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus far, intra-Golgi transport models, the last, diffusion via tubular continuities, has received the least attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Clermont1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and even the very existence of intercisternal tubules has long remained an issue of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rabouille1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The main reasons for this uncertainty have probably been the technical difficulties of detecting the convoluted structures of the intercisternal tubules by traditional electron microscopy (EM) and the traffic-related dynamics of these tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, although intercisternal tubules have still not been completely characterized (for instance, quantitative data on their frequency remain scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-ViveroSalmeron1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>), they can be considered as potential players in intra-Golgi trafficking.

The activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is required for the formation of intercisternal connections in the Golgi. In addition, we show that treatments that inhibit cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; and suppress intercisternal tubule formation also block intra-Golgi trafficking of several cargo proteins.

We thus sought to identify the Golgi-associated PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform that might serve as the molecular target of these inhibitors and might be involved in the regulation of Golgi-associated tubular structures. The superfamily of PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes consists of 15 groups comprising secretory and cytosolic enzymes, with the latter divided into Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitive (cPLA<sub>2</sub>s, or Group IV PLA<sub>2</sub>s) and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-insensitive (Group VI, VII, and VIII PLA<sub>2</sub>s) isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schaloske1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Among those that are Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitive, one of the Group IV isoforms, cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, that is normally cytosolic has been reported to associate preferentially with the Golgi complex upon moderate increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Shirai1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first generated a procollagen-I (PC-I) traffic pulse in human fibroblasts (HFs) using the 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C transport synchronization protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonfanti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. During the 40&#x000b0;C block, PC-I was diffusely distributed in the ER and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; was mostly cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After releasing the block, PC-I reached the Golgi complex, where its levels continued to increase for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). At the same time, remarkably, cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; was partially recruited to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; increase on the Golgi complex lasted for at least 30 min. Similar experiments were carried out using the same 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C transport synchronization protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> in other cell types (HeLa and MDCK cells) with the temperature sensitive mutant of the vesicular somatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) as cargo, a well-characterized trafficking marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. VSVG can be expressed by either transfecting or infecting cells with vesicular somatitis virus (VSV). In both cases, the generation of a traffic pulse induced the recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>), as seen with PC-I. We further examined the distribution of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in the Golgi by immuno-EM. We fixed VSV-infected cells expressing cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP both during the 40&#x000b0;C block and after releasing the block, and labelled the cells with an anti-GFP antibody (ab). Most of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP was dispersed in the cytosol during the 40&#x000b0;C traffic block, with very few gold particles on the ER and the Golgi complex. In contrast, the cells fixed 30 min after releasing the block (i.e., during a traffic wave) showed significant amounts of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP at the rims of the Golgi cisternae and on rim-associated tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1H&#x02013;1J</xref>). Some cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP labelling was still seen in the cytosol and at low levels in the ER, but not on other intracellular membranes.

After fixing, the cells were double labelled with antibodies against PC-I and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; and examined under the confocal microscope. (A) When PC-I was trapped in the ER after the 40&#x000b0;C block, cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; enrichment was not detected in the Golgi area. (B) Arrival of PC-I at the Golgi complex after release of the temperature block induced cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; binding to the Golgi complex.

(F, G) HeLa cells were infected with VSV and kept at 40&#x000b0;C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER. The cells were then fixed (F) or shifted to 32&#x000b0;C for 30 min to allow VSVG to exit from the ER (G), and prepared for confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence labelling shows a diffuse pattern of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; when VSVG is blocked in the ER (F). In contrast, cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; undergoes recruitment to the Golgi membranes as soon as VSVG arrives at the Golgi complex from the ER (G). (H) HeLa cells were transfected with cDNA encoding full length cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; fused with GFP (cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP), infected with VSVG, and subjected to the 40&#x000b0;C block. The cells were then fixed 30 min after the 40&#x000b0;C block release, to allow VSVG to reach the Golgi complex, and processed for immuno-gold EM with an anti-GFP ab, to reveal cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP localization. After activation of VSVG transport, a cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP signal was detected at the rims of the Golgi cisternae and flanking tubular structures (arrows).

Images extracted from the time-lapse sequence show that C2-GFP moves from the cytosol (K) to the Golgi membranes (L) when VSVG appears within the Golgi area. (M) HeLa cells were transfected and incubated as above (K, L), and then observed under the confocal microscope and fixed during VSVG release when detectable amounts of C2-GFP started to appear in the perinuclear area.

In particular, in liver hepatoma HepG2 cells, which are professional secretor cells that release up to 20 different soluble serum proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Knowles1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, the Golgi showed relatively high PLA<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, collectively, these data indicate that both &#x0201c;pulsed&#x0201d; and steady-state trafficking through the Golgi complex induces the association of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; with the Golgi membranes.</p><p>What is the mechanism of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; recruitment to the Golgi complex? The binding of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to membranes has been shown to be due both to the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding C2 domain and to the catalytic domain of this protein. The C2 domain is required for initiating membrane association, in a process that depends exclusively on the intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (&#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub>) and has thus been proposed to function as a calcium sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, while the catalytic domain prolongs this membrane binding of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; even after the &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> has returned to lower levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We monitored the in vivo dynamics of the calcium-sensor C2 domain of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; fused with GFP (C2-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>) during the 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C traffic pulse. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1K</xref> shows that C2-GFP had a diffuse cytosolic pattern when most of the cargo protein (VSVG-YFP) was arrested in the ER. However, as soon as VSVG started to concentrate within the Golgi complex after the release of the traffic block (after 150&#x02013;250 s), a significant portion of C2-GFP moved from the cytosol to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1L and 1M</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s007">Video S1</xref>), and then gradually returned to the cytosol. Under the same conditions, the full-length cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; protein shifted to the Golgi complex and remained there for over 30 min (see above). This behaviour of C2-GFP and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-GFP suggests that the trafficking induces a transient increase in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub>, which in turn initiates cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; recruitment to the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, an interaction that would then be prolonged by the catalytic portion of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;. While this increase remains to be further defined and clarified, it could be related to the high lumenal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations in the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pinton1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and the localization in the Golgi area of the signalling machinery that is involved in the release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pinton1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Wilson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the specific recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to the Golgi complex can be explained by a local traffic-induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from the Golgi complex and probably, additionally, by an intrinsic affinity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; for the Golgi (possibly due to its affinity for lipids and proteins that are enriched in Golgi membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Nakatani1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pettus1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>).

HeLa cells were first exposed to siRNAs directed against cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;. This resulted in a decrease in cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; levels, as evaluated by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; activity assays under basal and elevated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In these cells, growth was partially inhibited (50&#x00025;&#x02013;70&#x00025;) in the last 24 h of exposure to the siRNAs; however, cell viability did not appear to be affected. In these cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-silenced cells, the Golgi ribbon was disassembled into numerous fragments that remained perinuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, asterisks, 2F), as has been previously described upon application of PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore examined whether the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; would cause similar effects during more &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; non-synchronized trafficking. To this end, we infected cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-silenced cells with VSV and kept them at 32&#x000b0;C, to allow VSVG to continuously exit the ER. As was seen during the 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C synchronized pulse, VSVG reached the Golgi complex but did not traverse it (see below), indicating that the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in intra-Golgi trafficking is not limited to conditions of cargo overload.</p><p>The transport of other cargo proteins was also examined using cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; silencing. Ablation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in HFs resulted in a strong delay of PC-I transport at the level of the Golgi complex (unpublished data). The use of cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase inhibitors had no effects on trafficking, and AA addition did not reverse the transport block in cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-siRNAs-treated cells, again in parallel with the above effects on Golgi tubules. Thus, the induction of a cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; deficit and the attendant disassembly of intercisternal connections appear to be associated with the inhibition of intra-Golgi trafficking of different classes of cargo proteins.</p><p>A further question is which type of connection is required for trafficking. Our data indicate that the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; disrupts the &#x0201c;vertical&#x0201d; (<italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic>) and &#x0201c;longitudinal&#x0201d; (inter-stack) tubular connections equally (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g003">3</xref>). Thus, although it may appear logical to assume that the vertical connections are those relevant for transport, a role for the longitudinal connections cannot be formally excluded by the above data. To resolve this issue, we used a Golgi system that contains vertical, but lacks horizontal, connections, and tested whether transport through such a system is sensitive to the ablation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;. A Golgi complex with only vertical connections can be generated by nocodazol (NZ) treatment, which results in the fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon into isolated (non-horizontally connected) stacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Any transport-relevant role of longitudinal connections can be excluded in this system. Control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-deficient cells were subjected to 3 h of 30 &#x000b5;M NZ treatment and processed for EM tomography. As expected, vertical connections were revealed in stacks of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s010">Video S4</xref>), while in silenced cells, these connections were almost absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s011">Video S5</xref>). To test the efficiency of transport under these conditions, the cells were infected with VSVG and exposed to NZ during the 40&#x000b0;C block, and then shifted to 32&#x000b0;C to activate transport. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6C</xref> shows that in control cells, VSVG moved to the plasma membrane first through GM130-positive and then through TGN46-positive compartments of the Golgi stacks, as has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the disruption of vertical intercisternal bridges by cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; silencing inhibited the progression of cargo across NZ-induced isolated stacks, which are devoid of horizontal connections. This provides evidence that it is the intercisternal connections of the vertical type that are required for intra-Golgi transport (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000194-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000194.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>RNAi of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; affects intercisternal connections and transport within NZ-induced Golgi ministacks.</title><p>(A, B) Control (A) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-silenced (B) HeLa cells were treated with 30 &#x000b5;M NZ for 3 h, then fixed and prepared for EM tomography.

Therefore, these collective results indicate that the catalytic activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, rather than the ability of this enzyme to translocate to Golgi membranes, is required to support transport across the Golgi complex.</p><p>Finally, we sought to directly monitor the increase in cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; activation that based on the above data should occur during cargo trafficking through the Golgi complex. First, we used a classical PLA<sub>2</sub> activity assay based on the release of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-AA from AA-prelabelled cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. A potential problem here is that during cargo trafficking, only a fraction of the total cellular cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is bound to the Golgi complex (which represents, in turn, less than 5&#x00025; of the cellular membranes). Thus, the increase in AA release over basal values might be very small. To overcome these problems, we used two approaches.</p><p>For the first, in addition to HeLa cells, we used a cell line that has been previously characterized in our laboratory to be an efficient AA releaser (PCCL3 cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mariggio1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Both cell types were loaded with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-AA, infected with VSV, and subjected to a 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C transport synchronization protocol. When they were shifted from 40&#x000b0;C to the permissive temperature of 32&#x000b0;C, the VSVG expressing PCCL3 cells showed a modest but statistically significant increase in AA release over that seen in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). This increase coincided in time with VSVG transit through the Golgi complex. HeLa cells showed a trend in the same direction, which, however, was not statistically significant. To overcome this difficulty with HeLa cells, we used here a second approach based on the fluorogenic phosphatidylcholine analogue (bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC) as a sensor of local changes in PLA<sub>2</sub> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Farber1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

After loading the bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC, HeLa cells at steady-state showed a diffuse (ER-like) fluorescent signal in the cell periphery (indicating ongoing PLA<sub>2</sub> activity), and a clearer signal in the perinuclear (Golgi) area (as assessed by confocal microscopy, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). In control experiments, the application of the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which strongly stimulates cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, markedly increased this signal both at the cell periphery and in the perinuclear region, while the cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; inhibitor pyrrolidine reduced overall BODIPY fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7J&#x02013;7L</xref>), indicating that the probe functions as expected under our conditions. Then, the cells were exposed to the 40&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C VSVG synchronized traffic pulse. During the 40&#x000b0;C block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7M</xref>) the cells did not show any significant concentrating of fluorescence signal in the Golgi area (consistent with the lack of transport through the Golgi and of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; recruitment).

To address this apparent discrepancy, we compared the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; RNAi and of pyrrophenone with those reported for ONO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>First, we examined the effects of silencing cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on several transport steps.

Also, transport from the ER to the Golgi was not affected by cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; silencing, as shown above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

These effects mimic those due to cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; inhibition; however, in addition to these, ONO had effects that were not seen in cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-silenced cells, including the suppression of tubular structures in transferrin-containing early endosomes (not shown).

This suggests that the latter cells had developed an adaptive mechanism to compensate for the loss of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (and, incidentally, confirms the specificity of pyrrophenone). We considered the possibility that this mechanism might be based on other PLA<sub>2</sub>s. To verify this, we used siRNAs to screen for the roles of all of the cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> proteins from Groups IV, VI, VII, and VIII of the PLA<sub>2</sub> superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schaloske1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> in VSVG transport in these cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The efficiency of siRNA delivery was checked with fluorescent siGLO. Among these siRNAs, only those silencing the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent Group VIIIA (GVIIIA)-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibited VSVG transport, resulting in accumulation of cargo within the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8L and 8P</xref>). Strikingly, this PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform has been detected by others at the Golgi membranes and appears to be important for maintenance of the tubular elements of the Golgi complex (W. Brown, personal communication). We also characterized the effects of the GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> ablation in IMLFs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and saw clear similarities with the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; silencing in &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; cells. The Golgi remained perinuclear, but the ribbon underwent fragmentation (i.e., it exhibited numerous breaks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8P</xref>), presumably due to the loss of the tubular elements connecting cisternae. VSVG reached the Golgi complex normally, but to a large extent remained trapped in the Golgi complex, where it showed substantial overlap with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8P</xref>) (i.e., it remained in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi) and showed a marked delay of protein progression across the stack.

The main finding in this study is that in the Golgi complex, a specific PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform, namely Group IV cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, is required for the formation of the intercisternal tubules that appear to be involved in intra-Golgi trafficking.</p><p>The simplest explanation for the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in Golgi tubulation is that this enzyme can induce the rapid accumulation of wedge-like lysolipids at the cisternal rims, resulting in a local increase in spontaneous positive membrane curvature, and hence in tubulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In addition to curvature, the generation of an intercisternal tubular continuity presumably requires the assembly of the fusion machinery at the tip of the budding tubule, for its connecting with a neighbouring cisterna. This, in turn, is likely to involve the formation of an ARF/COPI coat to recruit these fusion proteins into this bud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Cosson1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schindler1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a simple model that fits our observations is that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-generated lysolipids help to create and stabilize the curvature of the necks of COPI buds. This might prevent the fission of such buds into vesicles, allowing these buds to dock and fuse with the next cisternae, creating an intercisternal continuity. It is also possible that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-generated lysolipids favour the elongation of buds into tubules, as suggested by the observation that overexpression of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; induces tubulation of the stack structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, for these events to occur, diffusion of the lysolipids away from their site of synthesis should be limited by a diffusion barrier at the Golgi rims (perhaps similar to the molecular fences described at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ritchie1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>). This fence-like role could involve the COPI coat that resides at the rims of the cisternae. Future studies will elucidate these further components of the tubulation machinery. As noted, the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; and the attendant abrogation of the tubules are associated with the arrest of transit through the Golgi complex, indicating that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-dependent intra-Golgi tubules are involved in trafficking. Interestingly, a similar association between intra-Golgi tubules and traffic has been reported for the effects of dicumarol. This drug is an activator of the fission-inducing protein CtBP1/BARS, and it suppresses horizontal Golgi tubules (and thus, presumably, also the vertical intercisternal tubules, which, however, were not directly examined) and inhibits intra-Golgi trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov3">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.

The simplest hypothesis is that Golgi tubules allow the intercisternal diffusion of molecules crucial for trafficking. Both vertical and longitudinal tubular elements are cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-dependent. The former are much less abundant; however, since traffic requires movement along the <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> (i.e., vertical) axis, they must be functionally crucial (as also supported by investigations in NZ-treated cells). Moreover, while relatively infrequent and difficult to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-ViveroSalmeron1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, vertical tubules have the potential to be a very efficient means of intra-Golgi transit due to the great speed of diffusion over short distances (microns in the Golgi complex). Thus, very few vertical tubules per stack can be sufficient to achieve rapid diffusion between the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments of the Golgi complex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This may be the case even when the connections are fewer than those required for complete intra-stack connectivity. For instance, in the Golgi ribbon, where stacks are connected to each other by horizontal membrane bridges, gaps in one stack might be compensated for by connections in neighbouring stacks (in this sense, also horizontal tubules may contribute to <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> diffusion; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Connections might be transient; here, again, very few connections need to be present in a stack at any given time to support intra-Golgi diffusion if they rapidly open and close between cisternae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Given the above, the question arises as to the role of intercisternal diffusion in intra-Golgi trafficking of cargo proteins that cross the Golgi by cisternal maturation/progression, such as PC-I and VSVG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The simplest hypothesis is that these tubules allow retrograde movement of Golgi membranes and resident proteins (e.g., enzymes), which is required for maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. According to this scheme (also discussed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>), during cisternal progression, the Golgi enzymes diffuse through the intercisternal continuities and explore the Golgi space, where they partition according to their physico-chemical properties into those cisternae that have their most favourable composition. This partitioning is driven by a physico-chemical gradient that is maintained across the stack at all times, possibly by the input of compositionally different intermediate compartment membrane into the <italic>cis</italic> cisternae and of endosomal membrane into the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. Thus, the arrival of intermediate compartment membranes at the <italic>cis</italic> pole (accompanied by consumption at the <italic>trans</italic>) promotes both enzyme backflow and cisternal progression (above), resulting in the synchronization of these two events and the maintenance of Golgi polarity. Clearly, this model requires more work to fully test it experimentally, but at this stage, it provides a logical explanation of the observations. At the same time, it should be noted that while our data point to a crucial role for tubules, complementary transport mechanisms cannot be excluded. For instance, if Golgi tubules indeed arise from the stabilization of COPI vesicles, as proposed above, it is possible that trafficking might switch between vesicular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Malsam1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Tu1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref> and connection-mediated modes, with one or the other mechanism prevailing, depending on the cell type and the functional state.</p><p>How &#x0201c;general&#x0201d; is the requirement for cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-dependent tubules in trafficking? Our findings show that the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, is very specific for intra-Golgi tubular structures and trafficking. However, other (non-Golgi) tubulation-dependent transport steps have been reported to be blocked by PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors. For instance, ONO (a rather nonspecific inhibitor of many PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms) has been shown by us and others to also suppress non-Golgi tubules and to block non-Golgi transport steps that appear to be dependent on tubular intermediates, including endosome-to-plasma-membrane recycling of transferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> and retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo4">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus possible that these transport steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo4">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> are regulated by other PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms that are located in the different organelles. For instance, cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2; and cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b5; have been reported to be located to the early <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh2">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref> and late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ohto1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref> endocytic compartments, respectively, and may be involved in the regulation of specific steps of endocytosis that are carried out via tubular carriers and that require PLA<sub>2</sub> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. If this is the case, then the PLA<sub>2</sub> family in general (through different PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms), rather than cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; itself, could underlie a membrane-bending mechanism based on the induction of spontaneous membrane curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> that is involved in tubulation and trafficking at the different levels of cellular membranes in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. A further observation that is most probably related to these considerations is that mice knocked out for cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; have reduced fertility, but do not show any other major phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonventre1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Nagase1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, and that secretory transport and Golgi morphology in IMLFs obtained from KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh3">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref> are normal. This appears to be because cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in KO cells is functionally replaced by GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8</xref>). GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> also partially localizes at the Golgi complex, where it appears to control tubulation processes (W. Brown, personal communication). Whether the mechanisms of action of this enzyme in trafficking are similar to those of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is unclear at this time. At the mechanistic level, the properties of GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> are not well defined in vivo. Although GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> has been shown to have specificity in vitro towards PAF-like lipids, its endogenous substrates remain unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Arai1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the precise metabolic reactions by which GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> supports tubulation remain to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, the activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; appears to be an important mechanism for the formation of Golgi tubules in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. For other tubulation events (in other organelles or cell types), as noted, this role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; might be taken on by other PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms or even other phospholipases (yeast). Nevertheless, the identification of cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; as a player in Golgi tubulation is a key finding, in that it reveals that generation of lysolipids is an important event in the formation of cellular tubules, and it should open the way towards the unravelling of further components of the tubulation machinery. It is now important to elucidate the mode of action of the intercisternal tubular connections and to define their underlying molecular machinery as well as the relationships of these tubules with other key players in intra-Golgi trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mellman2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Short1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Ab sources: Ab against TGN46 from S.

(G&#x02013;J) HFs were kept at 40&#x000b0;C for 3 h in ascorbate-free medium to accumulate PC-I in the ER (G, H), and treated without and with 5 &#x000b5;M ONO for the last 15 min of the temperature block (I, J). The cells were then incubated without (I) and with (J) 5 &#x000b5;M ONO at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min in medium with ascorbic acid (to allow PC-I folding and exit from the ER), fixed and double labelled with anti-PC-I and anti-giantin antibodies. While in the control cells PC-I was efficiently exported towards the plasma membrane within transport carriers (I, arrows), ONO treatment induced accumulation of PC-I in the Golgi area (J). (K, L) HFs infected with VSV were metabolically labelled with &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;-methionine and then chased at 32&#x000b0;C in the absence and presence of 5 &#x000b5;M ONO. At the indicated times, the cells were solubilized and digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), which cleaves sugar chains built on the proteins early in the secretory pathway (i.e., before their processing by medial Golgi enzyme mannosidase-II, which convert sugars into endo-H resistant forms). The cell lysates were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels scanned (K). The percentages of the Endo-H resistant form of VSVG with respect to the total amounts of VSVG were quantified (L) using a FUJIFILM imager. The data indicate that VSVG processing to its Endo-H resistant form (which occurs in the medial Golgi) was reduced when PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was inhibited. (M&#x02013;O) HFs were infected with VSV, and kept at 40&#x000b0;C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER. The cells were then incubated in the presence of 5 &#x000b5;M ONO at 32&#x000b0;C for 45 min to allow VSVG exit from the ER. Then the cells were fixed immediately (M) or incubated for an additional 15 min (N) or 45 min (O) in fresh ONO-free medium to allow the recovery of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. Immunofluorescent labelling of these ONO-treated cells (M) reveals accumulation of VSVG within isolated Golgi stacks labelled with an anti-giantin ab. Shortly after ONO wash-out (N), partial reconnection of the Golgi stacks into a ribbon (N, arrow) coincided with the reactivation of transport and the appearance of VSVG at the cell surface (N, arrowheads); cells still with disconnected Golgi stacks (N, asterisk) did not show VSVG at the plasma membrane. Complete recovery of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity resulted in the reassembly of the Golgi stacks into a highly connected structure and the exit of the cargo to the plasma membrane (O).

Lack of vertical connections between some cisternae within one stack can be compensated for by the presence of these connections (outlined in red; 1, 2, 3) in neighbouring stacks. These three vertical connections are sufficient to provide membrane continuum between the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments across all three of the stacks. (B) This scheme illustrates that only a very few transient connections need to be present in a stack at any given time to support intra-Golgi transport. At Time Point 1, only a single vertical connection (outlined by solid line) is present within the stack and would provide exchange of material between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> cisternae. This connection disappears (outlined by dashed line) at Time Point 2; however, the generation of new connections (outlined by solid line) would allow further transport between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cisternae.
