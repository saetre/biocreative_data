Moreover, the induction of COX-2 by PANC-1 CM was prevented by U0126, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor suggesting that activation of ERK 1/2 is needed for stimulation of COX-2. Finally, NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reduced the growth of PSCs by PANC-1 CM, indicating that activation of COX-2 is required for cancer stimulated PSC proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results suggest that COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of PSC proliferation in response to pancreatic cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Vitamin A-containing cells were first reported in 1982 by Watari et al. in vitamin A loaded mice using fluorescence and electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This cell type was subsequently identified by electron microscopy in normal rat and human pancreatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These cells were identified as pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) by Apte et al and Bachem et al in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the normal pancreas, stellate cells are quiescent and can be identified by the presence of vitamin A-containing lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. In response to pancreatic injury or inflammation, PSCs are transformed ("activated") from quiescent phenotypes into highly proliferative myofibroblast-like cells which express the cytoskeletal protein &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA), and produce type I collagen and other extracellular matrix components. Many of the morphological and metabolic changes associated with the activation of PSCs in animal models of fibrosis also occur when these cells are cultured on plastic in serum-containing medium.</p><p>Activated PSCs have also been implicated in the deposition of extracellular matrix components in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In patients with pancreatic cancer, an intense, interstitial, fibrillar staining for PSCs is evident in the peritumoral fibrous regions. Procollagen I staining colocalized with &#x003b1;-SMA to these fibroblast-shaped cells suggests that they are responsible for the deposition of matrix components and the desmoplastic reaction that surrounds the pancreatic tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are key rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of a variety of compounds including PGs, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. Two isozymes are found in mammalian tissues, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in a wide variety of tissues, where it is involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2, which is not expressed in resting cells, is the inducible form of the enzyme responsible for PG production at sites of inflammation. Growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and other inflammatory mediators can induce COX-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. COX-2 expression and activity is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer, but absent in normal pancreatic acinar and duct cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some scattered cells in normal pancreatic tissues express COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The current study revealed that COX-2 is expressed in primary cultured PSC. Furthermore, conditioned media from pancreatic cancer stimulates PSC proliferation and COX-2 expression.

Little is known regarding the relationship between PSCs and pancreatic cancer, or the role of COX-2.</p><p>The present study revealed that PSCs express COX-2 constitutively and when activated. The two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, differ in many respects. COX-1 is a housekeeping gene that is expressed in most tissue, while COX-2 is not detected in most normal tissues. In the pancreas, islet cells display a strong expression of COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; however, some scattered basal cells in normal pancreas express COX-2 as well, though less than seen in islet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which are similar to PSCs, COX-2 expression is virtually undetectable by Western blot analysis in protein extracts obtained from freshly isolated HSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, serum-deprived unstimulated HSC express low levels of the COX-2 protein and expression is dramatically enhanced in response to IL-1&#x003b1;, TNF &#x003b1; or endothelin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study suggests that COX-2 expression is independent of the activation status in isolated PSCs. While there is no marked expression of COX-2 in desmoplastic areas of pancreatic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it is possible that the enzyme is up-regulated early in the activation of stellate cells <italic>in vivo </italic>but increased expression may not be required for maintenance of stellate function once activated.</p><p>Stimulation of PSC by PANC-1 CM increased the expression of COX-2. Oncogenes, growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapy and tumor promoters stimulate COX-2 transcription via protein kinase C and RAS-mediated signaling. Stimulation of either protein kinase C or RAS-mediated signaling enhances mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, which in turn, activates transcription of COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have previously reported that PANC-1 CM enhances ERK 1/2 activation and growth of PSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We speculate that a growth factor is responsible for these effects, however, our attempts to identify the candidate using receptor antagonists and immunoneutralization have not been successful. Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 prevented the PANC-1 CM-stimulated increase in PSC COX-2 protein production. In previous studies U0126 alone had no effect on ERK1/2 or COX-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This suggests that the MAP kinase pathway plays a role in cancer-induced stimulation of COX-2 in PSCs. The reported biological consequences of COX-2 up-regulation include growth stimulation inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], increased metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and promotion of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Increased expression of COX-2 in PSCs by PANC-1 CM may contribute to tumor progression.</p><p>Finally, the proliferation of PSCs was inhibited by treatment with NS398, a COX-2 inhibitor. In pancreatic carcinomas, COX-2 is overexpressed and NS398 inhibits tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This COX-2 inhibitor alone has no effect on expression of COX-2 or ERK1/2 and shows no toxicity at the concentration used in the present studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated a role for the COX-2 enzyme and PGE2 in the regulation of epithelial cell growth and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These properties will need to be studied further in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and stellate cells. NS-398 has been previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation of colorectal carcinoma by inducing apoptosis in a COX-2-independent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. More studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of inhibition by NS398.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The COX-2 protein is up-regulated in pancreatic stellate cells by pancreatic cancer-conditioned media. The induction of COX-2 by pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). The COX-2 induction by pancreatic cancer cells is involved in mediating PSC proliferation. Therefore, COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer and inhibition of this enzyme may prevent or reduce this response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), albumin, and pronase were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO).

Bands from individual western blots were quantified densitometrically and the mean &#x000b1; SEM for each time point or concentration calculated for presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were repeated at least twice. Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with the Prism software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SY, MU, CP and WD participated in the PSC isolation and western blot experiments, cell culture experiments and drafted the manuscript.
