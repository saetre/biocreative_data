The sphingolipid-responsive Pkh kinases are candidates for mediating parts of this regulation, as they affect a diverse set of plasma membrane functions, such as cortical actin patch organization, efficient endocytosis, and eisosome assembly. Eisosomes are large protein complexes underlying the plasma membrane and help to sort a group of membrane proteins into distinct domains. In this study, we identify Nce102 in a genome-wide screen for genes involved in eisosome organization and Pkh kinase signaling. Nce102 accumulates in membrane domains at eisosomes where Pkh kinases also localize. The relative abundance of Nce102 in these domains compared with the rest of the plasma membrane is dynamically regulated by sphingolipids. Furthermore, Nce102 inhibits Pkh kinase signaling and is required for plasma membrane organization. Therefore, Nce102 might act as a sensor of sphingolipids that regulates plasma membrane function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plasma membrane is highly dynamic and crucial for communication of cells with their environment. It transduces numerous extracellular signals and transports molecules in and out of the cell. To accommodate these diverse tasks, it is highly organized, and plasma membrane processes are tightly coordinated, both spatially and temporally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Jacobson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simons and Vaz, 2004</xref>). How the abundance of most lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane is regulated is largely unknown.</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the plasma membrane is laterally organized into spatial domains that have different protein and lipid composition. One type of domain harbors several integral membrane proteins, such as the arginine transporter Can1 and members of the Sur7 family of proteins and was accordingly termed membrane compartment occupied by Can1 (MCC). MCCs were suggested to contain a distinct lipid composition enriched in ergosterol, as visualized by staining with filipin, a fluorescent marker binding this lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malinska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Yeast mother cells possess 25&#x02013;45 MCCs that can be visualized as discrete foci in the plasma membrane. MCCs are mutually exclusive with a second domain, marked by the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1, termed membrane compartment occupied by Pma1 (MCP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malinska et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2004</xref>). The organization of the plasma membrane in distinct spatial domains is at least in part mediated by large protein complexes termed eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). Eisosomes lie underneath each MCC forming a punctate, distributed pattern in the cell cortex. When the gene encoding the major eisosome component Pil1 is deleted, MCCs and all remaining eisosome proteins investigated so far coalesce into one or a few punctae per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to concentrating at such eisosome remnants, a significant fraction of MCC transmembrane proteins, such as Sur7, localizes uniformly in the plasma membrane. Similarly, the ergosterol marker filipin looses its normal punctate eisosome localization in <italic>&#x00394;pil1</italic> cells, distributes more evenly over the plasma membrane surface, and enriches at eisosome remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>One possible function of MCCs and eisosomes is to regulate protein and lipid abundance by sorting them into distinct, spatially separated pools where they are stabilized or from which they can be endocytosed selectively. Consistent with this notion, disruption of MCCs leads to increased turnover of some proteins normally localized there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>). The precise molecular function of eisosomes is still unclear, but it was suggested that they regulate sites of endocytosis based on their colocalization with endocytic intermediates visualized by the lipophilic dye FM4-64 and a hexose transporter GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). A clue of how eisosomes might be regulated is provided by the discovery that Pkh kinases localize at eisosomes and that Pil1 and Lsp1 are Pkh kinase substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Pkh kinases regulate physiology and plasma membrane functions such as actin patch organization, endocytosis, and eisosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inagaki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friant et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">deHart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daquinag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2008</xref>). These responses are mediated by their targets, including Ypk1 and Ypk2 (homologues of the mammalian serum glucocorticoid kinase), Sch9 (homologue of human AKT kinase), Pkc1 (atypical protein kinase C), and myosin-I. In addition, Pkh kinase phosphorylation of Pil1 regulates the assembly state of eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Pkh kinases are regulated by sphingoid long chain bases such as phytosphingosine (PHS) and dihydrosphingosine, which are precursors in sphingolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is not known how Pkh kinases sense and respond to long chain bases. Pkh kinases and several other kinases of the signaling module are regulated by levels of long chain bases in vitro, but whether this is relevant in vivo and whether it is the only way to control Pkh kinase activity is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we visually screened for genes that affect eisosome organization either directly or through altering Pkh kinase activity. We identified the transmembrane protein Nce102 as part of the sphingolipid&#x02013;Pkh signaling network. Our functional experiments suggest that Nce102 might act as a sphingolipid sensor that modulates Pkh kinase activity to regulate plasma membrane organization and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nce102 is required for normal eisosome organization</title><p>To identify genes required for eisosome assembly and organization, we screened by fluorescence microscopy a systematic gene deletion collection into which we introduced GFP-labeled Pil1 fusion protein (Pil1-GFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811081/DC1">Fig. S1 a</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tong et al., 2001</xref>).

In agreement with a recent study that identified Nce102 as an MCC component, we found Nce102-GFP localizing in the plasma membrane and accumulating in foci reminiscent of MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>).

Nce102 foci completely overlapped with Sur7-marked MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>) with significant levels of Nce102-GFP also diffusely localized in the remainder of the plasma membrane. As MCCs are membrane domains located over eisosomes, we additionally investigated Nce102-GFP localization in respect to eisosomes marked by Lsp1-mars and found that Nce102-GFP foci and eisosomes colocalize perfectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>). Because Nce102 is a multipass transmembrane domain protein, it is most likely located in the MCC and partially in the remainder of the membrane.</p><p>One hallmark of proteins localizing to eisosomes or MCCs is that they collapse to one or a few eisosome remnants in &#x00394;<italic>pil1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>).

In fact, the <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> phenotype on Pil1-GFP localization closely resembles the phenotype of <italic>pil1(4D)</italic> mutant cells, bearing a phosphomimicking mutant of Pil1-GFP in which four residues that are phosphorylated in the wild-type protein are mutated to aspartate (S45D, S59D, S230D, and T233D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811081/DC1">Fig. S4 c</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we tested genetically whether Nce102 acts on eisosomes by altering Pil1 phosphorylation that could then indirectly modulate eisosome assembly. If <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> effect is mediated by phosphorylation, we expect that a pil1(4A)-GFP mutant in which four residues that are required for the effect of Pkh kinases on eisosome assembly are changed to alanine (S45A, S59A, S230A, and T233A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>) blocks the effect of <italic>NCE102</italic> deletion. However, if Nce102's effect on eisosomes is independent of Pil1 phosphorylation state, we expect to see similar effects of <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> on wild-type Pil1 and pil1(4A). Indeed, pil1(4A)-GFP localization was indistinguishable between <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> and wild-type cells, showing slightly more eisosome pil1(4A) assembly at the plasma membrane compared with wild-type Pil1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>).

From this approach, we identified many unphosphorylated peptides and, for example, the phosphorylated peptide harboring T233 of Pil1 from both wild-type and <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells. Importantly, the phosphopeptide was more than threefold more abundant coming from the heavy lysine-labeled <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> samples compared with the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>; and Fig. S2, e and f). The total amount of Pil1 was equal in both experiments because unphosphorylated peptides were present in a 1:1 ratio (Fig. S2 f). Together, these data demonstrate that Pil1 was present in a roughly equimolar ratio in both pull-down eluates but that phosphorylation at T233 was more than threefold increased in <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells. Therefore, the results of the two biochemical approaches converge, demonstrating that Pil1 phosphorylation is increased in <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells.</p><p>Because Pil1 phosphorylation is inhibited by sphingoid bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>), we tested whether <italic>NCE102</italic> deletion results in a similar effect on Pil1 phosphorylation as sphingolipid depletion. To this end, we measured the relative abundance of the Pil1 T233 phosphopeptide in cells where synthesis of sphingolipids was blocked for 1 h by myriocin, a drug targeting the serine palmitoyl transferase that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid synthesis, compared with wild-type cells. In this experiment, we detected a twofold increase of Pil1 phosphorylation at T233 after myriocin treatment compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref> and Fig. S2 g). This shows that the block of sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin and <italic>NCE102</italic> deletion has a similar effect on Pil1 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Nce102 acts on Pil1 via Pkh kinases</title><p>Several studies show that Pil1 phosphorylation is mediated by Pkh kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether the effect of Nce102 on Pil1 phosphorylation occurs through the Pkh kinase pathway.

To test this, we expressed Nce102-mars from the inducible Gal promoter in cells that have Pil1-GFP&#x02013;marked eisosomes.

To distinguish these possibilities, we added myriocin after a preincubation with the translation-blocking drug cycloheximide. During persistent translation block, Nce102 localized normally to MCCs and the remainder of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 c</xref>). Moreover, it still relocalized from MCCs after myriocin treatment, indicating that this phenomenon is not dependent on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 c</xref>). Similarly, when PHS was added to cells in which translation was blocked, Nce102 relocalization occurred normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 c</xref>).</p><p>To test whether this effect is specific to the availability of sphingoid bases or a more general response to sphingolipid levels, we added aureobasidin to cells for 1 h. This drug inhibits complex sphingolipid synthesis from ceramide downstream of the formation of sphingoid bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagiec et al., 1997</xref>). We observed the same Nce102-GFP redistribution in the plasma membrane after aureobasidin or myriocin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 a</xref> and Fig. S4). Consistent with the downstream block of sphingolipid synthesis by aureobasidin, addition of exogenous sphingoid bases did not result in reformation of the punctate Nce102 pattern (Fig. S4).</p><p>Together, these data suggest an equilibrium of two pools of Nce102-GFP localizing to MCCs at eisosomes or to spaces in between that is shifted by levels of sphingolipids. Consistent with this notion, addition of PHS to untreated cells shifted more Nce102-GFP into punctate structures, rendering them more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, a and b</xref>).</p><p>In the yeast plasma membrane, many proteins are sensitive to extraction by detergents to a different level, and Nce102 was previously described operationally as an abundant component of detergent-resistant membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagnat et al., 2000</xref>). To test whether Nce102 distribution between MCCs and the remainder of the plasma membrane observed by microscopy is reflected in its partitioning between different membrane environments, we analyzed its solubility in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4&#x000b0;C. Proteins partitioning into sphingolipid/ergosterol-rich domains show lower solubility in this buffer compared with proteins embedded in mostly phospholipid bilayers. This difference can be tested in a velocity sedimentation gradient. Nce102 from untreated cells was present in most fractions of the gradient, indicating that it is localized both to detergent-resistant and other membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 d</xref>). When treated with myriocin, Nce102 partitioning changed toward the bottom of the gradient, indicating higher solubility. After short treatment of these cells with PHS, Nce102 redistributed to more detergent-insoluble membrane fractions at the top of the gradient. Pma1, a marker for MCP membranes, did not significantly alter its migration in the gradient after either myriocin or PHS treatment.</p><p>Together, these results show that relative levels of Nce102 in different plasma membrane domains are regulated by sphingolipids and that this redistribution is highly sensitive to changes in membrane composition because it can be observed after small perturbations that do not change Pma1 behavior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Nce102 sphingolipid-mediated redistribution is the mechanism by which Nce102 regulates Pil1 phosphorylation. In this model, Nce102 is recruited to MCCs at eisosomes under conditions of sufficient sphingolipids to repress Pkh kinase activity toward Pil1 and released from there when sphingolipid levels drop, for example, after inhibition of their synthesis by myriocin or aureobasidin. To test this, we determined the localization of Nce102-mars relative to Pkh kinases. Pkh2-GFP localizes in few very dim spots that colocalize with eisosomes and Nce102 foci (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811081/DC1">Fig. S5, a and b</ext-link>). Importantly, when we blocked sphingolipid synthesis with myriocin, Nce102-mars relocalized from these foci, leaving Pkh2-GFP behind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, c and d</xref>).</p><p>If Nce102 acts as a plasma membrane sphingolipid sensor, then its partitioning should be upstream and independent of the assembly state of eisosomes. Alternatively, Nce102 redistribution could be a consequence of eisosome disassembly after inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis. To test this directly, we used <italic>pil1(4A)</italic> mutant cells in which Pil1 cannot be sufficiently phosphorylated. Eisosomes are therefore resistant to activation of Pkh kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, when cells that express pil1(4A)-<italic>GFP</italic> as their sole copy of Pil1 are incubated with myriocin, eisosomes remain stable because Pil1(4A) does not get sufficiently phosphorylated to disassemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 e</xref>). To determine whether Nce102-GFP redistribution is caused by disassembly of eisosomes, we investigated the localization of Nce102-GFP in <italic>pil1(4A)</italic> cells. We found it to distribute normally in both MCCs and the remainder of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 f</xref>). When we added myriocin to these cells, eisosomes remained assembled as a result of the <italic>pil1(4A)</italic> mutation, yet Nce102-GFP relocalized to become diffusely distributed throughout the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 f</xref>). To test whether this is a general property of MCC proteins, we performed similar experiments with cells expressing Sur7-mars. When we treated these cells with myriocin, the intensity of Sur7 signal in MCC decreased as Pil1 disassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 g</xref>; not depicted), but this could be completely blocked by expressing Pil1(4A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 h</xref>). Thus, Nce102-GFP has a distinct behavior from other MCC components and redistributes in the plasma membrane dependent on sphingolipids but independently of the eisosome assembly state.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report a comprehensive screen for genes involved in Pil1-GFP localization. Recently, a similar screen using an MCC reporter identified 27 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>). Compared with that screen, we found roughly three times more genes affecting Pil1 localization (<italic>n</italic> = 88). It remains to be seen whether this difference is caused by different thresholding during the screen or biological differences between MCCs versus eisosomes. Because Pil1 and MCC components colocalize and <italic>PIL1</italic> is required for normal MCC formation, it is surprising that there is little overlap between the two screens: only <italic>NCE102</italic>, <italic>SUR4</italic>, <italic>MNN10</italic>, and few biological processes were found in both. Examples include retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (<italic>VPS52</italic> and <italic>VPS54</italic> in the MCC screen; <italic>VPS51</italic> and <italic>VPS53</italic> in the Pil1 screen). Therefore, these genes and processes likely have a global effect on plasma membrane organization affecting MCCs and eisosomes. Genes that were identified only in one screen likely perform more specific functions; future experiments will, for example, show whether <italic>YMR086W</italic>, <italic>YMR031C</italic>, or genes encoding the NatC complex are important for eisosomes but not MCCs.</p><p>Besides genes globally affecting the plasma membrane, we expected to find genes impacting eisosome organization directly as well as genes that alter sphingolipid signaling, resulting in altered Pil1 phosphorylation and assembly. In the later class, we identified Nce102. Besides it, also <italic>SUR4</italic>,<italic> ISC1</italic>, and <italic>SAC1</italic> are likely to act on eisosomes through sphingolipid signaling. Deletion of <italic>SUR4</italic>, required for fatty acid elongation during sphingolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paul et al., 2006</xref>), or deletion of <italic>ISC1</italic>, the homologue of mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawai et al., 2000</xref>), results in accumulation of complex sphingolipids. In our screen, both <italic>&#x00394;isc1</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;sur4</italic> cells showed hyperassembled Pil1-GFP, which is the opposite effect of depleting complex sphingolipids by inhibiting their synthesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811081/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>). In addition, it was recently reported that &#x00394;<italic>sac1</italic> cells have elevated sphingoid bases and reduced levels of complex sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brice et al., 2009</xref>), and we found them to have fewer eisosomes and increased cytoplasmic Pil1-GFP signal (Table S2). We expect that other genes indentified will also turn out to play a role in sphingolipid biology.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the function of Nce102, a multispanning plasma membrane protein required for normal eisosomes, MCC formation, and plasma membrane organization. Initially, Nce102 was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleves et al. (1996)</xref> as required for nonclassical export of mammalian galectin from yeast. The mechanism of Nce102 function in this pathway was not investigated. Because the assay used requires solubilization of cell-associated galectin using high pH, it is possible that the basis of the effect could be altered protein extractability from <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells because of their altered plasma membrane.</p><p>Our experiments revealed that Nce102 has fascinating properties, suggesting that it might act as part of a sphingolipid sensor. Most remarkable, its localization is dynamic and responsive to changes in sphingolipid levels: Nce102 partitions between two domains in the plasma membrane, MCCs overlying eisosomes and the rest of the plasma membrane. We show that the distribution between these two domains is controlled by sphingolipid availability. Nce102 localization to MCCs brings it into close contact with the underlying eisosomes and Pkh kinases (Fig. S5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>). Nce102 negatively regulates the activity of these kinases, and, in the presence of sphingolipids, blocks their downstream functions. Conversely, if sphingolipid synthesis is blocked, Nce102 redistributes away from Pkh kinases (Fig. S5), alleviating their inhibition. Therefore, we propose a model that Nce102 acts as part of a sphingolipid-sensing mechanism and that its distribution in the plasma membrane regulates Pkh kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). In the simplest hypothesis, Nce102 could simply accomplish repression of the kinases by regulated juxtaposition to them, which is a common scheme in kinase signaling. Based on filipin staining, MCCs were suggested as sites of increased ergosterol concentration in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>), and because sterols preferentially interact with sphingolipids, it is likely that sphingolipids are also concentrated there, forming detergent-resistant, liquid-ordered membrane domains or lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malinska et al., 2003</xref>) where Nce102 was found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagnat et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Nce102 also reacts to ergosterol levels in the plasma membrane. However, we did not observe an effect of nonessential <italic>erg</italic> mutants or block of sterol synthesis on eisosomes or Nce102 localization (unpublished data). Consistent with our model, Nce102 localizes to eisosome remnants that also show increased filipin staining, likely reflecting increased concentration of ergosterol and possibly sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, filipin might preferentially report on free sterols not in complex with sphingolipids, and staining of MCCs could actually indicate a lower concentration of sphingolipids in this compartment. This view is supported by a recent observation that filipin staining increases if sphingolipid synthesis is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2008</xref>). A further alternative is that Nce102 could directly bind sphingolipids, changing its affinities to other proteins that help localize it to MCCs and/or switching its activity as a Pkh kinase inhibitor on and off. In either model, Nce102 leaves the MCC when sphingolipid levels there are low, releasing its inhibition of Pkh kinases that now phosphorylate Pil1 and other targets. This is consistent with our observation that Nce102 detergent solubility changes after inhibition of sphingoid base synthesis, indicating that it partitions between different membrane environments. Most likely, this change corresponds to the relocalization of Nce102 from MCCs to the remainder of the membrane observed by microscopy. The interpretation of this result, however, remains vague, as most proteins in the yeast plasma membrane differ only in the degree of their resistance to Triton X-100 detergent extraction. For example, the MCP marker Pma1 was also previously used as a marker for detergent-resistant lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagnat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malinska et al., 2003</xref>). The difference in Triton X-100 solubility between Nce102 and Pma1 after myriocin treatment might therefore indicate that these proteins differently partition into such lipid rafts or that the MCP is actually more complex and contains subdomains not easily resolved by light microscopy. Consistent with the later notion, TORC2 (Tor kinase complex 2) is localized at a distinct plasma membrane domain separate from MCC and MCP and is also partially detergent resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berchtold and Walther, 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for Nce102 function in sphingolipid sensing.</bold> Nce102 (green) senses sphingolipid levels in the plasma membrane by distributing between the thick sphingolipid-rich MCC (blue) and the rest of the plasma membrane (gray) depending on sphingolipid levels.

It is possible that sphingolipids control the activity of Pkh kinases at many levels. Sphingoid bases could, for example, directly regulate Pkh kinases as in vitro experiments suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), and complex sphingolipids could affect signaling via Nce102. However, the in vivo effect of direct inhibition of Pkh kinase activity toward Pil1 by sphingoid bases is probably minor compared with the Nce102 pathway, as exogenously added PHS was not able to counteract the <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> hyperphosphorylation effect on eisosomes.</p><p>Our model of regulation of Pkh kinases by complex sphingolipids via the transmembrane protein Nce102 would also bridge the topological barrier between the cytoplasmic Pkh kinases and complex sphingolipids mainly concentrated in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Downstream of sphingolipid sensing, the Nce102&#x02013;Pkh pathway regulates phosphorylation of Pil1 that, when increased, always correlated with eisosome disassembly, e.g., in <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells. This effect could be blocked by mutating phosphorylated Pil1 residues to alanines that we previously found were required and sufficient for the effect of Pkh kinases on eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>). This is different from findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al. (2008)</xref>, who reported that a mutant form of Pil1 harboring five phosphosites mutated to alanine (S6A, S59A, T233A, S273A, and S299A) cannot assemble properly and argued that phosphorylation of Pil1 is important for assembly of eisosomes rather than disassembly. In this study, even a mutant that lacks these five sites and even two additional sites (S6A, S45A, S59A, S230A, T233A, S273A, and S299A) still assembles into eisosomes correctly (unpublished data). The reason for this difference is unclear but might indicate that additional pathways to the Nce102&#x02013;Pkh kinase module regulate Pil1 phosphorylation in a complex fashion.</p><p>Besides phosphorylation of Pil1, Pkh kinases modify many plasma membrane functions. Therefore, as expected, <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells show altered organization of the plasma membrane, as observed for MCCs, MCPs, and the endocytic foci marked by the lipophilic dye FM4-64. Recently, it was also shown that <italic>&#x00394;nce102</italic> cells have accelerated endocytosis rates of some membrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>). Pkh kinases also participate in processes as diverse as cortical actin patch organization, cell integrity signaling, endocytosis, and eisosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inagaki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">deHart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roelants et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2008</xref>). Regulation of these diverse processes may help control the composition of the plasma membrane according to need, perhaps constituting part of a negative feedback loop that targets genes involved in sphingolipid synthesis. Indeed, expression of such genes, e.g., <italic>LCB2</italic>, <italic>FEN1</italic>, and <italic>SUR4</italic>, is strongly negatively correlated to the expression of <italic>NCE102</italic> when the latter is regulated in response to various physiological conditions, e.g., during diauxic shift, nitrogen depletion, or heat shock (correlations for <italic>NCE102/SUR4</italic> are: diauxic shift, &#x02212;0.94; nitrogen starvation, &#x02212;0.66; and heat shock, &#x02212;0.85; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811081/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>, b&#x02013;d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, after prolonged incubation with PHS, we observed Nce102-GFP signal at the vacuole (unpublished data), perhaps reflecting an adaptation to recalibrate the set level of Pkh signaling after long times with high sphingolipids levels.</p><p>An important role of Nce102 in regulation of sphingolipids is also supported by the ability of its deletion to suppress the growth defect of a mutation in the serine palmitoyl transferase subunit <italic>TSC3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>; unpublished data) or the growth inhibition caused by myriocin (Fig. S3 a), both of which reduce the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis.</p><p>Salient features of the sphingolipid&#x02013;Nce102&#x02013;Pkh kinase signaling network are likely conserved between yeast and other eukaryotes. Nce102 shares homology with the synaptogyrin/cellugyrin protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belfort et al., 2005</xref>), but the molecular roles of these proteins are not understood. In contrast, mammalian PDK1 kinases (the homologues of yeast Pkh kinases) are well characterized, and the general architecture of downstream signaling is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casamayor et al., 1999</xref>). In either system, full activation of AGC kinases, such as AKT, Sch9, serum glucocorticoid kinase, or Ypk1/2, requires phosphorylation both by PDK1 (in mammalian cells) or Pkh kinases (in yeast) and in addition by the conserved kinase complex TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Powers, 2007</xref>). For yeast, TORC2 signaling has been implicated in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beeler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tabuchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronova et al., 2008</xref>). This effect of TORC2 is mediated by the Pkh kinase target Ypk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronova et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the Slm proteins were identified as targets of both the TORC2 and Pkh kinase signaling pathways and to regulate a late step in the synthesis of complex sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tabuchi et al., 2006</xref>). It is therefore likely that the TORC2 and Pkh1/2 pathways collaborate to regulate sphingolipid metabolism in yeast. Given the similarity of the signaling pathway components and its architecture in higher eukaryotes, their output may also be evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Visual screen</title><p>To generate a library of deletion mutants each expressing Pil1-GFP, we performed a modification of the synthetic genetic array screen as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tong et al., 2001</xref>).

Cells were transferred to glass-bottom 96-well plates coated with concanavalin A and imaged with a 40&#x000d7; high NA objective in an ImageXPress Micro (MDS Analytical Technologies). At least six different images were taken for each deletion strain.</p><p>The images were visually inspected using the software by the microscope manufacturer and classified using three categories: increased cytosolic Pil1-GFP fluorescence, altered number or eisosomes, and altered pattern of eisosomes. Strains that showed a phenotype in this first round of screening were regrown and imaged by using a confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.).</p><p>Two optical mid-section and two top-section images were taken for each strain, showing 15&#x02013;40 cells per image. Images were visually analyzed, and several parameters of the Pil1-GFP signal on the surface of cells were quantitated using an image interpretation script developed in MATLAB that we named EISURAN (both the source code and an executable MATLAB file can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/rg/walther/news/index.html">http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/rg/walther/news/index.html</ext-link>). In short, EISURAN first subtracts background from the images and then finds the edge of a cell by image dilation. To facilitate the quantitation of signal from assembled Pil1, the script thresholds the image using Otsu's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsu, 1979</xref>). From the resulting binary image, EISURAN calculates the number of positive pixels per cell, a measure for the area covered by eisosomes (percentage of cell surface covered by eisosomes). It then calculates the mean size of the connected clusters (mean pixel number per eisosome cluster on cell surface). To eliminate small background clusters, a minimum of 20 pixels are used for the lower cut off. In some conditions, very large values result caused by connection of eisosomes into very large clusters, which are sometimes string formed. To determine how much Pil1 is in individual eisosomes, EISURAN determines the mean intensity of each cluster by applying the binary image as a mask on the original image, integrating the intensity in each cluster, and averaging this intensity over all clusters in an image (mean integrated intensity per eisosome cluster on cell surface). Quantitation of eisosome number was based on the mean number of eisosomes counted by two independent observers in optical mid sections of mother cells (eisosome number; mean for the wild type = 11.5 &#x000b1; 1.55).</p><p>The cytoplasmic signal was quantitated as the mean intensity of a 50 &#x000d7; 50&#x02013;pixel area in the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic Pil1-GFP signal) visible in a confocal mid section of the cell using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
