Glycan array analysis revealed that the carbohydrate-recognition domain in the extracellular domain of the receptor binds glycans with terminal &#x003b1;-linked mannose or fucose residues. Prolectin expressed in fibroblasts is found at the cell surface, but unlike many glycan-binding receptors it does not mediate endocytosis of a neoglycoprotein ligand. However, compared with other known glycan-binding receptors, the receptor contains an unusually large intracellular domain that consists of multiple sequence motifs, including phosphorylated tyrosine residues, that allow it to interact with signaling molecules such as Grb2. Immunohistochemistry has been used to demonstrate that prolectin is expressed on a specialized population of proliferating B cells in germinal centers. Thus, this novel receptor has the potential to function in carbohydrate-mediated communication between cells in the germinal center.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">GM062116</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS200">Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id rid="CS200">075565</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Membrane-bound mammalian glycan-binding receptors, often referred to as lectins, are believed to play multiple distinct roles in the immune system, decoding information in complex oligosaccharide structures on cell surfaces and soluble glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A host of glycan-binding receptors on dendritic cells and macrophages function in pathogen recognition, often resulting in uptake of microbes through endocytic mechanisms. Examples include the mannose receptor, DC-SIGN,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> langerin, and the macrophage galactose receptor. Glycan-binding receptors can also recognize glycans found on the surfaces of mammalian cells. Some of these receptors, such as the selectins, mediate adhesion between leukocytes and endothelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A small number of receptors, notably members of the siglec family, bind mammalian-type glycans and have been shown to have potential signaling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). While multiple glycan-binding receptors have been described on cells of the myeloid lineage, the complement of such receptors on lymphocytes is much more restricted. The best characterized examples are the T-cell adhesion molecule L-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and the B-cell receptor CD22, also designated siglec-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Genomic screening for potential glycan-binding receptors has usually been undertaken by initially searching for the presence of one of the several types of structural domains that are known to support sugar-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Knowledge of the structures of multiple families of modular carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) has facilitated identification of proteins with potential sugar-binding activity and can lead to predictions of what types of ligands might be bound. Although the human genome has been extensively screened with profile-recognition algorithms that identify common sequence motifs associated with CRDs, refinements to the genome sequence and improvements in gene-recognition algorithms occasionally result in detection of novel proteins that contain putative CRDs.</p><p>We describe a previously undetected glycan-binding receptor identified by re-screening of the human genome and provide characterization of its molecular and cellular properties. Based on its expression in a specialized population of proliferating B cells in germinal centers, we propose that it be designated prolectin.

The length of the introns near the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends of the gene, combined with the unusual splice site, are probably responsible for the fact that the prolectin cDNA was not correctly identified by any of the gene prediction algorithms.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Prolectin gene structure and protein organization.</bold><italic>A</italic>, scale diagram of the prolectin gene.

Binding of oligosaccharides to C-type CRDs usually involves docking of a monosaccharide into the primary binding site at a conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with enhanced affinity for the oligosaccharide resulting from secondary contacts between other sugars in the oligosaccharide and residues nearby on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A phenylalanine residue in DC-SIGN that makes key contacts with portions of high mannose oligosaccharides and a valine residue that contributes to the specificity of DC-SIGN for Lewis<sup>x</sup> and Lewis<sup>a</sup> structures are not conserved in prolectin, suggesting that the secondary binding sites in the two receptors must be different. This conclusion is consistent with the observed differences in selectivity for different ligands within broadly similar classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Prolectin Is Expressed at the Cell Surface</title><p>The properties of prolectin were examined by stable expression of a full-length cDNA in Rat-6 fibroblasts, cells that display no detectable surface glycan-binding receptors but which have been shown to support activity of multiple exogenous receptors containing C-type CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

Based on the previously characterized pattern of disulfide bonds within C-type CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), a single free cysteine residue would be present in the CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Interchain disulfide bonding of this cysteine could lead to dimer formation, but the larger size of the oligomers observed would require formation of additional interchain disulfide bonds involving one of the cysteine residues in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Dimerization of dimers brought about in this way would lead to tetramer formation, which would be consistent with the observed size of the disulfide-linked oligomer observed on gels.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of prolectin in fibroblasts.</bold><italic>A</italic>, immunofluorescence of transfectants and control cells with anti-prolectin antibodies followed by Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibodies.

In the oligomeric protein, these sequences would form large clusters of potential binding sites for adapter molecules that could link the receptor to intracellular signaling pathways.

The results revealed a very restricted pattern of staining, with the major site of expression being germinal centers in various tissues, including lymph nodes, tonsils, stomach, intestine, appendix, and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Antibodies selective for follicular dendritic cells or tingible body macrophages found in the light zone of the germinal centers do not co-localize with prolectin. Thus, unlike other C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN and the mannose receptor, prolectin is not found on dendritic cells or macrophages. In contrast, Ki67 antigen found in nuclei of dividing B cells shows extensive overlap with the prolectin staining, suggesting a novel localization of this receptor in B cells.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical localization of prolectin.</bold> Germinal centers from multiple tissues were probed with polyclonal antibodies to prolectin, control rabbit IgG, or monoclonal antibodies specific for dividing cell nuclear antigen Ki67, dendritic cell marker CD21, and macrophage marker CD68.

In germinal centers from multiple tissues, essentially all prolectin-expressing cells are also Ki67-positive. Based on their location and reaction with the anti-Ki67 antibody, the clustered, doubly stained cells in the dark zone appear to be centroblasts. Prolectin expression thus defines a sub-population of dividing B cells of the dark zone. In the surrounding mantle zone, the occasional Ki67-positive cells have a similar morphology to the prolectin-positive cells in the dark zone and all of these cells co-express prolectin.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of prolectin and Ki67 antigen distribution.</bold> Germinal centers were stained with antibody to prolectin and counterstained with Alexa 488 secondary antibody (<italic>green</italic>).

Importantly, the fact that prolectin does not display endocytic activity is consistent with its expression in B cells rather than macrophages or dendritic cells. This pattern of expression and lack of endocytic activity makes it unlikely that prolectin functions as a primary recognition receptor in the innate immune response, a role that is commonly ascribed to DC-SIGN, langerin, the mannose receptor, and other receptors that contain C-type CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Similarly, in contrast to the selectin cell adhesion molecules, prolectin bears multiple signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic domain, so that it can interact directly with signaling pathways within lymphocytes, although it may also have a role in cell adhesion. Thus, prolectin does not readily fall into any of the previously described categories of C-type lectins, and it does not have any obvious paralogs in mammalian genomes.</p><p>Despite these differences, the glycan array results suggest that that there is likely to be overlap in potential ligands for prolectin and DC-SIGN, because both receptors display a dual specificity for mannose- and fucose-terminated glycans. Common types of ligands would include surface glycans on other cells bearing Lewis<sup>a</sup>, Lewis<sup>x</sup>, and Lewis<sup>y</sup> epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It has been proposed that these structures are presented to DC-SIGN on intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) on T cells, leading to adhesion between the T cells and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). By analogy, one function of prolectin may be to participate in interaction of the B cells on which it is expressed with T cells or other cells in the germinal center. However, the potential ability of prolectin to initiate signaling in response to a glycan ligand indicates that it probably has additional roles in communication between B cells and other cells in germinal centers.</p><p>The pattern of expression of prolectin within the germinal centers may provide some additional clues about its potential functions. Following somatic mutation of antibody genes in centroblasts of the dark zone, centrocytes are known to migrate to the light zone where selection of cells with enhanced affinity for antigen occurs and cells with dysfunctional immunoglobulin genes undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The disposition of clusters containing many of the prolectin-positive cells near the edge of the dark zone, and the presence of individual cells in the adjacent regions of the mantle zone suggests that cells expressing prolectin might be in transit into or out of the germinal center and that the receptor may play a role in migration of cells between these compartments during antibody affinity maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_27_18537__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.012807_jbc.M109.012807-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Grant 075565 from the Wellcome Trust (to M.
