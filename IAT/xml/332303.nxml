However, constructing a cDNA library containing a full set of genes expressed throughout the life time of an organism, without redundancy, is a major challenge for modern biology. Towards this goal, I have tried to make a library of mouse fibroblastoid Ltk- cells with nearly equal representations of cDNA clones. Double-stranded cDNAs (ds-cDNAs) are synthesized from mRNA using an oligo(dT)-Notl primer. After shearing to 200-400 bp, a synthetic linker-primer, which has one blunt and one sticky end and an internal EcoRl site, is ligated to the cDNAs. The cDNAs are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the ligated linker-primer sequence. After denaturation and reassociation of the ds-cDNAs, and isolation of single-stranded cDNAs (ss-cDNAs) by hydroxylapatite chromatography, the ss-cDNAs are again amplified by PCR. The cDNAs are digested with EcoRl and Notl, and inserted into a plasmid vector. Colony hybridization with eight probes of different abundance showed a reduction in 'abundance variation' from at least 20,000-fold in the original library to 40-fold in the library constructed after three cycles of equalization. This indicates the usefulness of the current procedure for making equalized cDNA libraries.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0106-a" xlink:role="5709"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5705"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5706"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5707"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5708"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5709"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5710"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00203-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5711"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
