Dephosphorylation of cTnI is under regulatory control. Thus, muscarinic and adenosine A<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonists antagonize &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation via activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).

Our data showed that LPS significantly increased cTnI phosphorylation at Ser23/24 in cardiomyocytes and reduced contraction amplitude without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients.

Co-treatment with CPA and H89 completely reversed the contractile dysfunction.

Despite prompt treatment with antibiotics and supportive care, the mortality of septic patients is still high, with the number of deaths from sepsis equalling the number of deaths from myocardial infarction in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C1">1</xref></sup> Myocardial dysfunction is a common complication in patients with severe sepsis and results in a significantly increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C2">2</xref></sup> Such dysfunction is characterized by depressed ejection fraction and stroke work and increased end-diastolic volumes. Since the reduction in contractility is independent of alterations in cardiac load or heart rate, it largely represents an intrinsic depression of contractile function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C3">3</xref></sup></p><p>Previous data from our laboratory have demonstrated that 16&#x02013;18 h after LPS injection, endotoxemic rat hearts show increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation at Ser23/24, residues that mediate protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent reduction of myofilament calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C4">4</xref></sup> No reduction in the calcium transient was observed, suggesting that a reduction in myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity largely underlies the contractile dysfunction. More recent studies have confirmed the functional importance of increased cTnI phosphorylation in endotoxemia by demonstrating that mice with cardiac-specific replacement of cTnI with slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI), which lacks the PKA phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal, are significantly protected against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C5">5</xref></sup> Moreover, this protection was also observed in Triton-skinned cardiomyocytes. No degradation of cTnI or TnT in LPS-treated animals was observed nor were differences in the phosphorylation of other myofilament proteins between the groups detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C5">5</xref></sup> Such sustained increase in cTnI phosphorylation could result from either sustained kinase activation or inhibition of dephosphorylation pathways. Although the pathways regulating cTnI phosphorylation at the PKA sites are relatively well understood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C6">6</xref></sup> the mechanism(s) regulating the dephosphorylation pathways remain unclear. A major dephosphorylating enzyme is protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a multimeric serine/threonine phosphatase which dephosphorylates both cTnI and phospholamban.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref></sup> PP2A predominately exists <italic>in vivo</italic> as a heterodimer of the catalytic subunit C constitutively bound to the scaffolding subunit A. These can then further complex with one of several regulatory B subunits. The B subunits contain all the targeting information that directs the heterotrimer to distinct intracellular locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C9">9</xref></sup> A number of agonists and compounds have been reported to activate PP2A including the adenosine A<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C11">11</xref></sup> &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C12">12</xref></sup> cAMP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C13">13</xref></sup> PAK 1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C14">14</xref></sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C15">15</xref></sup> CPA has been shown by a number of authors to induce the translocation of the C subunit of PP2A from the cytosol to the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C10">10</xref></sup> and decrease phosphorylation of a number of protein targets including cTnI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref></sup> Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in the regulation of PP2A underlie the sustained phosphorylation of cTnI in myocytes from endotoxemic hearts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Animal models</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and the investigation conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23 revised 1996).

This is in line with the hypothesis that impaired PP2A activity and localization underlies the contractile dysfunction.</p><p>As discussed above, the B subunits are thought to regulate the site of action of PP2A. Hence, the decrease in expression of the B56&#x003b1; subunit in the septic hearts, which is markedly clear in the particulate fraction, may provide one mechanism for the increased cTnI phosphorylation observed in these hearts. This decrease in protein expression was paralleled by a decrease in mRNA expression by &#x0223c;50% and again mirrors the results in Alzheimers disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C36">36</xref></sup> Similarly, Glaser <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C30">30</xref></sup> in an established model of sustained JNK activation, reported a 70% decrease in expression of B56&#x003b1; in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C30">30</xref></sup> A variety of other stress-related stimuli, such as p38 MAPK activation, phorbol esters, and LPS, also decreased B56&#x003b1; expression in this isolated myocyte preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C30">30</xref></sup></p><p>Although several authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C37">37</xref></sup> have demonstrated that CPA can induce translocation of PP2A-C to the membrane fraction, the mechanisms that regulate this process are far from clear. As discussed above, &#x003b1;-carboxyl methyl esterification of the C subunit has been reported to regulate PP2A by modulating holoenzyme assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C29">29</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased methylation would correlate with a decreased association with the B subunit, decreased activity, and possibly changes in localization. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes the demethylated form of PP2A-C, we demonstrated a significant increase (&#x0223c;35-fold) in the demethylated form of PP2A-C in the particulate fraction of septic hearts (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F6">6</xref>A</italic>). Given that the overall expression of PP2A-C is significantly decreased, this represents a large decrease in the amount of the methylated form. However, we could not demonstrate a reduction in demethylated PP2A-C following CPA treatment in either control or septic hearts. This is in contrast to the results of Liu and Hofmann<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C7">7</xref></sup> who demonstrated a decrease in the level of demethylated PP2A-C following a 5 min of incubation with CPA. Methylation of PP2A-C is catalysed by a specific Leu carboxyl methyltransferase PPMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C29">29</xref></sup> Hence, we examined the protein expression of PPMT in the cytosolic and particulate fractions of control and septic hearts. In line with the increase in demethylated PP2A-C (reflecting a decreased methylation), the amount of PPMT was significantly decreased in septic hearts (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F6">6</xref>B</italic>). Thus, the increased cTnI phosphorylation observed in septic hearts could reflect a decreased PP2A-C methylation as a result of a significant decrease in the methyltransferase that methylates this subunit. The consequence of this would be a decreased association of the B subunit with the A/C heterodimer, an association required for targeting and activation of the holoenzyme. Furthermore, the decreased expression of B56&#x003b1; at both protein and mRNA level may reflect a failure to associate with the catalytic subunit since only the heterotrimeric forms of PP2A appear to be stable in intact cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C9">9</xref></sup> Additional support for a role for PP2A in the modulation of contractile function via dephosphorylation of cTnI is provided by the demonstration that septic hearts have significantly lower PP2A activity compared with control cells. Furthermore, treatment with CPA not only improved contractile function (<italic>Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F1">1</xref></italic> and <italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F2">2</xref></italic>) and reduced cTnI phosphorylation (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F3">3</xref>B</italic>) but also increased PP2A activity (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F6">6</xref>C</italic>). Also, incubation of control cells with okadaic acid, at a concentration that specifically inhibits PP2A, mimicked the effects of sepsis in terms of both decreased contractile function and increased cTnI phosphorylation (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F7">7</xref></italic>).</p><p>Treatment of septic cardiomyocytes with the PKA inhibitor H89 improved contractile function to a similar extent to CPA treatment (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CVP037F2">2</xref></italic>), while the combination of CPA and H89 further improved contractile function to baseline levels. Both of these treatments were independent of changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, suggesting that the improvement in contractile function reflected a restoration in myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of H89 requires further investigation. While it is likely that H89 is acting by directly inhibiting PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cTnI, it is also possible that the mechanism involves dephosphorylation and uncoupling of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor from G<sub>i</sub>. Hence, Daaka <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C38">38</xref></sup> demonstrated that stimulation of MAPK via G<sub>i</sub> requires phosphorylation of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-receptor by PKA and that H89 inhibited isoprenaline-mediated activation of MAPK. Similarly, Faucher <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C39">39</xref></sup> recently demonstrated that PKA activation was a prerequisite for the negative inotropic effect induced by the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist salbutamol in guinea-pig papillary muscles. As such, H89 significantly reduced the negative inotropic effect induced by salbutamol. Furthermore, okadaic acid (at a dose that would inhibit both PP1 and PP2A) significantly increased the sensitivity of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor to salbutamol suggesting phosphatases modulate the response. Lastly, in adult myocytes isolated from rats injected with LPS, the decrease in cell shortening and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients could be reversed by the G<sub>i</sub> inhibitor, pertussis toxin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP037C40">40</xref></sup> again suggesting that G<sub>i</sub> protein signalling plays a role in the negative inotropic effect of LPS. In the light of these studies, the results of the current study suggest that in septic cardiomyocytes, the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor is phosphorylated thereby switching the signalling to G<sub>i</sub>. Importantly, use of a specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (Rp-8-Br-cGMPs; 10 &#x000b5;M) had no effect on either SS or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in control or septic cardiomyocytes (data not shown). This excludes a non-specific effect of H89 on PKG. However, such a mechanism would require that G<sub>i</sub> signalling from the A<sub>1</sub>-receptor activates different signalling pathways to &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-mediated G<sub>i</sub> signalling if the beneficial effects of CPA and H89 are to be reconciled. Further studies will be required to explore this protective effect.</p><p>In conclusion, the studies presented here strongly support the hypothesis that the increased cTnI phosphorylation and reduced contractility apparent in cardiomyocytes from LPS-treated mice results, at least in part, from an inhibition of PP2A activity. This reduction in PP2A activity may reflect a decrease in PPMT expression resulting in decreased PP2A-C methylation, an inability to assemble the holoenzyme and thus increased cTnI phosphorylation. The inability to form the holoenzyme may underlie the reduction in expression of the B56&#x003b1; and C subunits in septic hearts.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> none declared.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by a <grant-sponsor>British Heart Foundation (BHF) Project</grant-sponsor><grant-num>Grant (PG/03/107)</grant-num> and <grant-sponsor>BHF award</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>CH/99001</grant-num>).
