To ensure continuous neuronal communication, new vesicles are efficiently recycled at the synapse. Although vesicles may be internalized by various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He and Wu, 2007</xref>), the majority of synaptic vesicles appear to recycle through a pathway involving clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearse, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verstreken et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in synaptic vesicle recycling, the molecular mechanisms by which vesicles form during this process remain under intense investigation.</p><p>In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, several proteins and lipids cooperate to bend the membrane and pinch of new vesicles. High resolution microscopic analyses indicate that clathrin heavy chain (chc) lines these invaginating membranes, suggesting an important role for the protein in vesicle retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heuser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>). The function of chc in synaptic vesicle retrieval has been largely inferred from in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirchhausen, 2000</xref>). Indeed, chc can polymerize in pentagonal and hexagonal structures of various curvature, even in the absence of membranes or adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ungewickell and Branton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pearse and Robinson, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, chc has been shown to interact with a cohort of proteins implicated in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung and Haucke, 2007</xref>). Although some interactions may be weak, chc polymers have been proposed to serve as scaffolding interaction hubs, regulating the concerted binding of endocytic proteins or even providing driving force during vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinrichsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite the abundance of in vitro studies, the mechanisms of membrane recycling in the absence of chc in neurons are much less clear. RNAi-mediated knockdown of chc in hippocampal neurons results in defective synaptic vesicle recycling, as gauged by altered fluorescence dynamics of the vesicle-associated synaptopHluorin. This probe is a pH-sensitive GFP reporting the balance between vesicle fusion and vesicle reacidification after endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>). Unlike controls, stimulated neurons with reduced chc levels do not quench the synaptopHluorin GFP signal efficiently, suggesting that chc is involved in recycling at a step before acidification of newly internalized membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). However, how chc aids in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and why vesicle recycling is stalled in neurons with reduced chc levels remains unresolved.</p><p>Chc can combine with clathrin light chain (clc) to form stable triskelia that can polymerize at the membrane. Although the role of clc in cellular function has been analyzed in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moskowitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newpher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>), chc and clc are not constitutively bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Girard et al., 2005</xref>) and specific partners for each of the proteins have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legendre-Guillemin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2006</xref>). Aside from a role for clc in vesicle recycling, recent studies in yeast and mammalian cell lines indicate a role for clc in stimulation of actin assembly and localization of various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newpher et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, despite the notion that chc and clc can bind, some of their functions may be divergent.</p><p>In this paper, using genetic analyses, we study endocytosis in the absence of chc and investigate the synaptic function of chc, the major component of the synaptic vesicle coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirchhausen, 2000</xref>). Although <italic>chc</italic> mutants in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> point to a role for the protein in cellular viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Payne et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemmon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruscetti et al., 1994</xref>), loss of chc in multicellular organisms such as fruit flies leads to early lethality, precluding a detailed analysis of synaptic function in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazinet et al., 1993</xref>). We have therefore used pharmacology and acute fluorescein-assisted light inactivation (FALI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>) of chc expressed under endogenous control, circumventing early lethality and developmental defects associated with <italic>chc</italic>-null mutants. Surprisingly, loss of chc function does not block synaptic membrane uptake but allows massive internalization of membranes as gauged by live dye uptake and EM. However, this membrane cannot participate in a new round of release. As a consequence, although loss of chc function does not affect neurotransmission during low frequency stimulation, mutants fail to maintain neurotransmitter release during intense activity. Collectively, our data indicate that chc is critical for synaptic recycling and that in the absence of chc, a form of bulk membrane retrieval mediates synaptic membrane uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Synaptic membrane is internalized in chc mutants</title><p>To evaluate the function of chc in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in multicellular organisms, we used <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> chc mutants (<italic>chc<sup>1</sup> and chc<sup>4</sup></italic>). The synapses of these mutants have not yet been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazinet et al., 1993</xref>). Although <italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic>-null mutants die as embryos, <italic>chc<sup>4</sup></italic> homozygous or <italic>chc<sup>1</sup>/chc<sup>4</sup></italic> trans-heterozygous hypomorphic mutants survive until the pupal stage. The lethal phase of <italic>chc</italic> hypomorphic mutant animals allows us to assess endocytosis at the third instar neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model synapse. To measure synaptic vesicle formation in hypomorphic <italic>chc</italic> mutants, we induced exo- and endocytosis by stimulating controls and mutants for 10 min with 90 mM KCl in the presence of FM 1-43, a dye which, upon nerve stimulation, becomes internalized in newly formed vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betz and Bewick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verstreken et al., 2008</xref>). If chc is required as a scaffolding surface during vesicle formation, we expect loss of chc function to yield less membrane uptake. Conversely, if chc polymers are permissive for synaptic vesicle formation and, in the absence of chc function, another form of membrane recycling takes over, FM 1-43 dye uptake is not expected to be blocked. Interestingly, controls and hypomorphic <italic>chc</italic> mutants stimulated in the presence of FM 1-43 both internalize dye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;D</xref>). Also, shorter stimulation periods (1 min) show a similar amount of dye internalized in controls and mutants, indicating that decreased <italic>chc</italic> function does not reduce membrane uptake. However, although in control boutons internalized FM 1-43 distributes in a typical doughnut-like shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswami et al., 1994</xref>), in <italic>chc<sup>4</sup></italic> and <italic>chc<sup>1</sup>/chc<sup>4</sup></italic> animals FM 1-43 additionally often concentrates in subsynaptic structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). This defect in FM 1-43 labeling in <italic>chc</italic> mutants is not because of major morphological defects, such as a reduction in bouton size or addition of satellite boutons at the NMJ, as determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804162/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804162/DC1</ext-link>). Hence, our data indicate that membrane uptake during stimulation is not blocked in hypomorphic <italic>chc</italic> mutants.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Synaptic membrane internalization in chc hypomorphic mutants.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) FM 1-43 labeling of endocytosed membrane at the NMJ of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> third instar larvae.

Nevertheless, an analysis of chc-null mutants or severe hypomorphic mutants is required to scrutinize the full effect of chc on endocytosis. Because lingering maternal component in embryonic lethal <italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants and the small size of embryonic NMJs complicates such analyses, we used the strong neuronal GAL 4 driver <italic>nsybGal4</italic> (gift from B. Dickson, Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria) to express high levels of <italic>chc</italic> RNAi in the larval nervous system in an attempt to create third instar larvae with reduced chc levels at the synapse. However, Western blotting only revealed a marginal decrease of chc levels, precluding analysis of chc function using this tool (unpublished data).</p><p>To acutely inactivate the chc protein in synaptic boutons, we resorted to FALI (4&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-bis(1,3,2-dithioarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein [FlAsH]&#x02013;FALI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tour et al., 2003</xref>), a technique previously used to specifically and acutely inactivate synaptotagmin I (sytI) and clc at the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of tagged proteins in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> can be achieved with the UAS&#x02013;GAL4 system, resulting in high cellular levels of the target protein. However, to avoid using overexpression of a tagged chc protein, we cloned the full-length <italic>chc</italic> gene, including its endogenous promoter, by recombineering mediated gap repair into <italic>P</italic>(<italic>acman</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Venken et al., 2006</xref>). To engineer a FLAG-Tetracysteine tag (4C) either 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; of the <italic>chc</italic> ORF, we used an additional recombineering step involving positive selection followed by Cre-mediated cassette removal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, b&#x02013;d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venken et al., 2008</xref>). When present in the fly genome, this <italic>4C-chc</italic> construct is expressed as gauged by Western blotting using anti-Flag antibodies. Furthermore, addition of the membrane-permeable FlAsH reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 1998</xref>), which tightly binds the 4C tag in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>), shows fluorescence concentrated at third instar NMJ boutons and lower levels in the muscle, which is in line with the endogenous localization of chc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup></italic> flies that express N-terminally tagged chc (<italic>4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>), but not the C-terminally tagged chc, are fully viable and do not demonstrate behavioral defects. In addition, the morphology of their third instar larval NMJs is indistinguishable from controls, postsynaptic receptors are clustered normally, and neurotransmitter release in response to low and high frequency nerve stimulation, whether <italic>4C-chc</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is bound to FlAsH or not, is similar to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;G</xref>; and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804162/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804162/DC1</ext-link>).

Likewise, <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup>; 4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> animals either treated with FlAsH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 M</xref>) or illuminated for 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 N</xref>) show normal uptake and distribution of the dye. However, when, before FM 1-43 labeling, <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup>; 4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> animals are treated with FlAsH and are illuminated to photoinactivate chc (FlAsH-FALI), we still observe massive dye uptake that appears to distribute in subboutonic membranous structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 O</xref>). Quantification of dye labeling intensity in synapses with photoinactivated chc compared with each of the control conditions does not show a statistically significant difference, indicating similar amounts of membrane uptake (analysis of variance [ANOVA]: P &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 4 per condition). In addition, when we use different stimulation paradigms (e.g., 2 or 3 min of 90 mM KCl or 10 min of 10-Hz nerve stimulation), we observe FM 1-43 dye uptake into abnormal membranous structures upon FlAsH-FALI of chc, indicating that the observed membrane internalization is not a function of a specific stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2005</xref>). These phenotypes are also not an artifact of FlAsH-FALI, as photoinactivation of 4C-SytI shows less FM 1-43 dye uptake and no membranous structures similar to those observed in the chc loss-of-function synapses when subjected to the same labeling and stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marek and Davis, 2002</xref>). Hence, FlAsH-FALI of chc specifically inactivates chc function, and the data indicate that loss of chc does not block membrane internalization at the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NMJ.</p></sec><sec><title>Chlorpromazine treatment phenocopies photoinactivation of chc</title><p>To corroborate these results, we used chlorpromazine, a widely used membrane-permeable compound which inhibits chc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanerva et al., 2007</xref>). Dissected larvae were incubated for 30 min in 50 &#x003bc;M chlorpromazine (in Schneider's medium) and were then stimulated using 90 mM KCl in the presence of FM 1-43.

In fact, quantitative analysis of FM 1-43 uptake in <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup>; 4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> synapses that underwent FlAsH-FALI of chc or control synapses treated with chlorpromazine do not show a statistical difference in membrane uptake (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>) and size of the membranous structures internalized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These data indicate that both photoinactivation of chc and chlorpromazine are effective at inhibiting chc function and further substantiate the idea that loss of chc function does not block membrane internalization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Both chemical inhibition and photoinactivation of chc protein show aberrant membrane inclusions that are quantitatively similar.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) FM 1-43 dye uptake (10 min of 90 mM KCl) in synaptic boutons after chlorpromazine treatment on <italic>w</italic> control (A) and <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup>; 4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> (B) animals, as well as on chlorpromazine-treated <italic>w chc<sup>1</sup>; 4C-chc<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> where chc was also inactivated using FlAsH-FALI (C).

However, most of these studies did not probe into the function of chc during vesicle formation, nor did they address the role of chc during synaptic vesicle endocytosis. In this work, we inactivated chc using three independent approaches, <italic>chc</italic> hypomorphic mutants, pharmacological inhibition of chc, and FlAsH-FALI of natively expressed chc, and studied the effects on synaptic vesicle recycling.</p><p>Our work expands on our understanding of chc function in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in two ways. First, our data indicate the critical role of chc in synaptic recycling. Synapses that lack chc function show a progressive decline in synaptic transmission during intense activity and membrane that is internalized during neuronal stimulation cannot be released in a second round of stimulation. Ultrastructural data indicates that small vesicles fail to be formed in synapses lacking functional chc, indicating a role for chc to resolve synaptic membrane into functional vesicles. Second, our data also suggest that in the absence of chc, another form of membrane internalization, not observed in controls, takes over. Indeed, we find that loss of chc function does not block membrane uptake as gauged by fluorescent FM 1-43 dye uptake. In addition, ultrastructural studies show massive membrane folds and cisternae in synapses that underwent FlAsH-FALI of chc. Collectively, our data suggest a role for chc in maintaining synaptic membrane integrity during stimulation, preventing massive bulk membrane retrieval. Interestingly, reminiscent of the large vacuoles and cisternae, we observe loss-of-function synapses in <italic>chc</italic>. Similar structures can also be seen in strongly stimulated synapses of different organisms or in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> temperature-sensitive <italic>shi</italic> mutants that are shifted back to low temperature after endocytic blockade at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koenig and Ikeda, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marxen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Lange et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Teng et al., 2007</xref>). We surmise that under such conditions, vesicle fusion rate exceeds endocytic capacity and clathrin demand may be higher than supply, resulting in bulk membrane uptake. Our work not only highlights the central role of chc in vesicle recycling and in the creation of small-diameter fusion-competent vesicles but also suggests that in the absence of chc function, a form of bulk endocytosis mediates the retrieval of synaptic membrane.</p><p>The observation that bulk retrieval takes over in the absence of chc function is consistent with loss-of-function studies of clc and &#x003b1;-adaptin, two other components of the endocytic coat. In nonneuronal TRVb cells, cross-linking most of the clc proteins did not inhibit membrane uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moskowitz et al., 2003</xref>), and recent data on inactivation of clc in neurons indicates internalization of membranous structures upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in embryonic lethal &#x003b1;-adaptin mutants, where chc polymers fail to be efficiently linked to the synaptic membrane, a dramatic depletion in vesicle number and large membrane invaginations can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997</xref>). Thus, the data suggest that in the absence of functional clathrin coats, membrane internalizes by bulk retrieval; however, the formation of small synaptic vesicles from these endocytic structures appears inhibited during a time period (&#x0003e;15 min; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) that would normally be sufficiently long to repopulate the entire vesicle pool at wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koenig and Ikeda, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2005</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to note that stimulated dynamin 1 knockout neurons also show large endocytic membranes, which is consistent with the presence of bulk retrieval in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, we observed bulk membrane retrieval in other endocytic mutants linked to dynamin function (<italic>synj</italic>) or controlling dynamin function (<italic>dap160</italic>, <italic>eps15</italic>, and <italic>shi</italic>) upon inactivation of chc. The bulk uptake in these double mutant animals is reminiscent of that observed in mouse dynamin 1 knockouts and that in fly clathrin mutant synapses and suggests an intriguing possibility where clathrin may coordinate with dynamin to form synaptic vesicles. In the absence of this function, bulk endocytosis appears to then mediate membrane retrieval.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of recycling</title><p>Although it is well established that synaptic vesicles recycle by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, recovery by alternative routes, including direct closure of the fusion pore, remains controversial. At the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NMJ, <italic>endophilin</italic> (<italic>endo</italic>) knockouts dramatically impair clathrin-mediated endocytosis; however, some neurotransmission endures during intense stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verstreken et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickman et al., 2005</xref>). These data are consistent with either the presence of an alternative mode of vesicle recycling or with the persistence of low levels of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in <italic>endo</italic> mutants.

Thus, these data suggest that <italic>endo</italic> mutants block most clathrin-mediated recycling and indicate that an Endo- and Synj-independent recycling mechanism can maintain the neurotransmitter release observed in these mutants.</p><p>Our work on chc, as well as recent data on clc, now allows us to further scrutinize the mechanisms of vesicle recycling at the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>). FlAsH-FALI of 4C-clc leads to a complete block in synaptic transmission during high frequency stimulation, indicating that this condition blocks all vesicle recycling. However, our data indicates that photoinactivation of endogenously expressed 4C-chc only blocks transmission in 50% of the recordings, suggesting that some synapses may retain low levels of clathrin-independent recycling and that clc and chc may have partially divergent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newpher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that in our studies some functional chc remains at the synapse after FlAsH-FALI, we used very similar inactivation conditions to those that lead to complete inactivation of clc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, FlAsH-FALI of chc and chemical inhibition of chc, or both together, does not show a quantitative difference in membrane uptake during stimulation, indicating that our protocols lead to severe, if not complete, inhibition of chc function. In addition, we did not overexpress 4C-chc but expressed it under native control in <italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic>-null mutants, ideally controlling protein levels and avoiding overexpression artifacts. Finally, EM of stimulated synapses where chc was acutely inactivated consistently show persistent active zone-associated synaptic vesicles. Some of these vesicles are similar in size to those observed in controls, and these vesicles are well positioned to participate in alternative recycling mechanisms. Hence, we believe that although our data clearly support a critical role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the recycling of synaptic vesicles in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, this work does not exclude the possibility that alternative synaptic vesicle recycling routes operate at the larval NMJ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly genetics and molecular biology</title><p>All fly stocks were kept on standard maize meal and molasses medium at room temperature.
