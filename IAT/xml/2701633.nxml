HIC affects the Wnt pathway, the JNK/SAPK pathway and the activity of positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb). Studies exploring HIC function in mammalian cells used ectopically expressed HIC due to undetected endogenous HIC protein. HIC mRNA contains exceptionally long 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) compared to the average length of mRNA UTRs. Here we show that HIC protein is subject to strict repression at multiple levels. The HIC mRNA UTRs reduce the expression of HIC or of a reporter protein: The HIC 3&#x02032;-UTR decreases both HIC and reporter mRNA levels, whereas upstream open reading frames located in the 5&#x02032;-UTR repress the translation of HIC or of the reporter protein. In addition, ectopically expressed HIC protein is degraded by the proteasome, with a half-life of approximately 1 h, suggesting that upon activation, HIC expression in cells may be transient. The strict regulation of HIC expression at the levels of mRNA stability, translation efficiency and protein stability suggests that expression of the HIC protein and its involvement in the various pathways is required only under specific cellular conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The C-terminal region of HIC contains an 81 amino acid domain, which shares 77&#x00025; identity and 81&#x00025; similarity with the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the protein I-mfa.

The marker that showed the most frequent loss of heterozygosity is adjacent to HIC, hence, HIC has been proposed to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Although several studies have demonstrated that HIC is involved in a number of important signalling pathways and cellular processes, the exact role of HIC and the mechanism by which it affects the different pathways is still obscure. To date, studies exploring the role of HIC have been performed on over-expressed protein. No report of endogenous HIC protein has been published.</p><p>The mRNA encoding HIC contains a 590 nt 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR), a 741 nt coding sequence, and a 3276 nt 3&#x02032;-UTR. Such UTRs are extremely long compared to the average length of UTRs of cellular mRNAs.

Long UTRs are usually involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs.</p><p>Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression provides a key mechanism by which cells can rapidly change gene expression patterns in response to a variety of extracellular signals and disparate biological processes. mRNA-binding proteins interact with unique sequences in mRNAs to coordinately regulate their localization, translation and/or degradation. A common feature of many rapidly degraded mRNAs is the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs. The sequence of this <italic>cis</italic>-element is variable, but frequently contains one or more<named-content content-type="gene">AUUUA</named-content> pentameric motifs within or near a U-rich region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Wilson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Interactions between AREs and their specific binding proteins have diverse effects on target mRNAs. 5&#x02032;-UTRs like 3&#x02032;-UTRs, are deeply involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through specific mRNA motifs and RNA binding proteins. An increasing number of reports describe regulation of translation of specific mRNAs in response to specific stimuli. These mRNAs often contain a 5&#x02032;-UTR considerably longer than the average cellular 5&#x02032;-UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Kozak1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Kozak2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, may contain AUG codons upstream of the initiation codon for the main open reading frame, and have complex secondary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-vanderVelden1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that the expression of the HIC protein is subject to strict repression, reducing its expression to undetectable levels.

Quantification of the intensities of the bands showed similar amounts of mRNA encoding FFL in cells transfected with constructs coding for the FFL gene, the FFL gene fused to the first 237 nucleotides of HIC 3&#x02032;-UTR or the FFL gene fused to HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR. In contrast, mRNA encoding FFL was barely detected in cells transfected with the FFL fused to the full length HIC mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Since all mRNAs were transcribed from the same CMV promoter, these results suggest that the low level of the 3&#x02032;-UTR-expressing mRNA is caused by decreased mRNA stability. Both the 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-UTRs of HIC reduced FFL activity in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The fact that the HIC 3&#x02032;-UTR but not the HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR reduced FFL mRNA levels implies that the UTRs inhibit HIC protein expression by two different mechanisms. The HIC 3&#x02032;-UTR causes a decrease in the mRNA level, most likely due to decreased mRNA stability, while the 5&#x02032;-UTR inhibits mRNA translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The 5&#x02032;-UTR Represses HIC Translation in a Mechanism Involving Upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs)</title><p>To determine whether the UTRs affect HIC expression in a manner similar to their effect on reporter FFL expression, we prepared a set of expression constructs encoding different parts of the HIC gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Consistent with the reporter gene assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g002">Figure 2</xref>), these findings indicate that translation of HIC mRNA is repressed by the 5&#x02032;-UTR of HIC and that 200 nt at the 3&#x02032; end of the HIC mRNA 5&#x02032;-UTR (in HIC-1.7 kb) are sufficient for translation inhibition of HIC <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>We next examined the effects of the UTRs on HIC protein levels in cells. HEK-293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding the various HIC constructs (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To increase the sensitivity of HIC protein detection, cells were metabolically labeled using L-&#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;-methionine and L-&#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;-cysteine for 11 h.

Furthermore, no endogenous HIC was immunoprecipitated. This data is consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiment, confirming that the translation of HIC is repressed by the HIC mRNA 5&#x02032;-UTR in transfected cells.</p><p>Although differing in their translation efficiency, mRNAs that included the HIC-5&#x02032;-UTR as well as mRNAs that did not include the 5&#x02032;-UTR were detected in the polysomal fraction in a polysomal profile analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, the HIC mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm and not sequestered in the nucleus. Since the HIC protein is not translated in the cells, ribosomes may also be attached to the non-coding parts of HIC mRNA.</p><p>The sequence of the HIC mRNA 5&#x02032;-UTR includes three short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of 13, 8 and 25 amino acid lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Short uORFs in the 5&#x02032;-UTR affect translation efficiency of many eukaryotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Holcik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Mihailovich1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether the potential uORFs in HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR are involved in inhibition of its translation, we mutated the initiation codons (AUGs) of the uORFs, rendering them non-functional for initiation of translation in a set of constructs encoding the HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR fused to a FFL reporter gene. The 5&#x02032;UTR was cloned into an NcoI site in which the ATG start codon is included, thus all the nucleotides upstream to the ATG belong to the HIC sequence. In each construct, a single upstream AUG (uAUG) initiation codon or combinations of two or three uAUGs were mutated to AUC codons. Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with the various constructs and an RL expressing plasmid as a control for transfection efficiency. Dual luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. Fusion of the HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR upstream to FFL decreased its activity more than 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A mutation in the initiation codon of uORF1 or uORF2 alone did not affect the activity of FFL. However, a mutation that abolished the initiation codon of uORF3 increased FFL activity 1.8-fold. Although neither uORF1 nor uORF2 elimination significantly affected the translation of the reporter gene when each was mutated separately, both mutations had an effect when mutated along with another uORF (uORF1 in combination with uORF3 or uORF2&#x0002b;3 and uORF2 in combination with uORF3 or uORF1&#x0002b;3). FFL activity was further increased (2.4-fold) by mutations in the initiation codons of both uORF2 and uORF3 suggesting an additive effect of the two mutations. Moreover, mutations in all three uORFs, increased FFL activity to a higher extant than the mutations in uORF1 and uORF3 only. Therefore, uORF2 may have a positive role in the inhibition of HIC translation. Surprisingly, mutations in the initiation codons for both uORF1 and uORF3 abolished the increase in FFL activity induced by mutation of uORF3 alone, suggesting that intact uORF1 leads to enhanced translation. Similarly, mutations in all three uORFs increased FFL activity to a lower extent than the mutations in uORF2 and uORF3 only. Therefore, uORF1 may have a positive role in the regulation of HIC translation. We conclude that translation of HIC is repressed by the 5&#x02032;-UTR through uORF3 and uORF2. In contrast, uORF1 may have a positive role in translation of HIC mRNA.</p><fig id="pone-0006152-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006152.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Mutations in the uORFs diminish the inhibitory effect of HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR on FFL activity.</title><p>A.

Changes in transcription rate as well as variations in mRNA decay rate, translation efficiency and protein stability play pivotal roles in regulation of protein expression.</p><p>HIC mRNA is expressed in several cell lines and tissues, but to date, no expression of endogenous HIC protein has been detected. Previous studies exploring the function of HIC in mammalian cells used ectopically expressed HIC. We have shown here that the expression of HIC is subject to complex regulation. The inability to detect HIC protein in these cells may be attributed to a large degree to repression of its expression. This includes repression at the levels of mRNA stability and of translation, mediated by HIC mRNA 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-UTRs. In addition, any HIC protein that is translated is rapidly degraded by the proteosome. We have demonstrated that the HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR represses HIC translation, whereas the HIC 3&#x02032;-UTR decreases its mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g003">3</xref>).</p><p>uORFs have been found to repress the translation of a number of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Holcik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Mihailovich1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that the third uORF plays the most significant role in the inhibition of translation by the HIC mRNA 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and that only when the initiation codon of this uORF was mutated, the effects of mutations in uORF1 and uORF2 could be detected. The second uORF was found to contribute to the inhibition of translation. In contrast, a mutation that abolished the first uORF decreased the effect of mutations in the following uORFs.</p><p>The finding that the first uORF has an opposite effect on translation efficiency implies that it may facilitate the reinitiation of translation in the downstream ORFs. A similar observation was reported for the translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), which is regulated by two uORFs with opposing roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Lu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Vattem1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

The efficiency of reinitiation improves as the spacing between two ORFs is lengthened <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Child1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Kozak3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The distance between the termination codon of the third HIC uORF and the initiation codon of the HIC ORF is less than 40 nt. It is therefore likely that ribosomes initiating translation at the third uORF are precluded from translating HIC. The distances between the other ORFs are longer: 214 nt between uORF1 and uORF2 and 60 nt between uORF2 and uORF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that their inhibitory influence on translation of the main downstream ORF is minor.</p><p>A mutation in uORF1 or uORF2 alone did not affect the activity of FFL. This could be explained by the strong inhibitory effect of uORF3. Mutations in uORF1 or uORF2 may probably affect the translation efficiency of the following uORF, but not the translation of the main ORF. Translation of the main ORF would still be limited by uORF3, which is very proximate to the main ORF.</p><p>Although mutations in the initiation codons of HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR enhanced translation of FFL, no combination of the mutations in the UORF was able to completely restore the activity of FFL. Thus, while the uORFs certainly have translational regulatory function, other factors found in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of HIC may also repress HIC translation. Another uAUG followed by a stop codon at position 127 of the 5&#x02032;-UTR may also contribute to the inhibition of HIC translation.</p><p>In mammals, the optimal consensus sequence for initiation is <named-content content-type="gene">GCC<underline>A</underline>/<underline>G</underline>CC<bold>AUG</bold><underline>G</underline></named-content>, with a purine at position &#x02212;3 and a G at position &#x0002b;4 (underlined) being the most important nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Kozak4">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since both the control FFL and the FFL fused to the 3&#x02032;-UTR were expressed from a CMV promoter, we attribute the change in mRNA levels to altered mRNA stability.

Consistent with our results, Young et al. expressed HIC from a construct that contained HIC-ORF only or from a construct that contained the HIC-ORF and the 3&#x02032;-UTR (both lacking the HIC 5&#x02032;-UTR), and detected a much lower HIC protein level when the HIC construct included the 3&#x02032;-UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Young2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The half-life of an mRNA depends on sequences within the transcript itself, usually located in the 3&#x02032; UTR, and on RNA binding factors that interact with those sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Wilusz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Garneau1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the presence of <named-content content-type="gene">AUUUA</named-content> motifs in an AU-rich region does not guarantee the function of this motif in mRNA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Chen3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, it would be interesting to determine whether the numerous <named-content content-type="gene">AUUUA</named-content> repeats confer instability to HIC mRNA. However, HIC mRNA instability does not seem to be the major regulator of HIC repression. Endogenous HIC mRNA is expressed in various cell lines and tissues, but HIC protein is not detected in any of them. Therefore, expression of HIC protein expression is probably controlled primarily at the levels of translation and protein stability.</p><p>The level of ectopically expressed HIC protein was greatly increased by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating that HIC is degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The half-life of HIC is approximately 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006152-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Under conditions that stimulate translation, induction of endogenous HIC expression may still be transient due to the relatively short half-life of HIC. Thus, HIC expression is also regulated post-translationally. Under normal cellular conditions HIC is hardly translated and degradation by the proteasome may only act as a &#x0201c;backup&#x0201d; mechanism to prevent its expression. Nevertheless, under other yet unknown conditions in which HIC is translated, the regulation of HIC degradation may be more crucial and significant to the protein level.</p><p>HIC protein has been shown to interact with the cyclinT1 subunit of P-TEFb and with HIV-I Tat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Young1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and inhibit Tat and p-TEFb dependent transcription from the HIV promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Young1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Young et. al. sought to resolve this discrepancy and found that the 3&#x02032; end of HIC mRNA binds p-TEFb and activates it by displacing 7SK, an inhibitory small nuclear RNA (snRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Young2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HIC plays opposing roles in the regulation of P-TEFb: ectopically expressed HIC protein represses transcription from the HIV-I promoter while HIC mRNA elevates HIV-I promoter dependent translation. Activation of p-TEFb by HIC mRNA is presumably also required for general cellular transcription in the cell. We have evidence for a role for HIC in the stress response (submitted for publication), suggesting that HIC protein may be translated when the cell is subjected to certain forms of stress and/or as a protective mechanism against viral infection. Although the last 314 nt are sufficient for HIC mRNA to activate P-TEFb, an mRNA of 4607 nt is transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Young2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibition of HIC translation during normal cell growth, by the long 5&#x02032;UTR may also be required in order to keep HIC mRNA available and functional as an RNA molecule. At times of stress, reduced activation of HIC mRNA may be coordinated with induction of translation of the HIC protein.</p><p>We have shown here that the expression of ectopically expressed HIC protein is strongly repressed at the levels of mRNA stability, translation and protein stability. We suggest that endogenous HIC is down-regulated through similar mechanisms under normal cellular conditions. The tight suppression of HIC protein at multiple levels of gene expression may be withdrawn under certain, yet unidentified, cellular conditions. Further understanding of the complex regulation of HIC expression will contribute to the understanding of the cellular roles of HIC and the cellular pathways in which it is involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Plasmids were prepared as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006152-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0006152-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006152.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Plasmids.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0006152-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0006152.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plasmid</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIC-1.7 kb</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nucleotides 390&#x02013;2093 of HIC were isolated from a human cDNA library constructed in vector pEBS7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006152-Peterson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, which was a kind gift from Prof. Legarski (The University of Texas, Huston, Texas, USA).
