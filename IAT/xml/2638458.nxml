Increased levels of leptin have been shown to correlate with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a known risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Some studies have reported that leptin stimulates the proliferation of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and others have suggested that leptin levels may be associated with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as cancer at other sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Leptin binds to the human leptin receptor, a cytokine receptor that promotes gene transcription via activating signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The function of leptin is mediated through the leptin receptor, and both leptin and its receptor are involved in the homeostatic control of appetite, weight, metabolism and reproductive functions in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A number of polymorphisms have been reported in the human <italic>LEPR </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The <italic>LEPR </italic>polymorphism Q223R is one of the most common and is thought to be associated with an impaired signaling capacity of the leptin receptor; this polymorphism has been associated with higher mean circulating levels of leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We have previously conducted a meta-analysis (n = 18 studies) to examine the frequencies of <italic>LEPR </italic>polymorphisms in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. From this analysis of the literature, it became apparent that only one study included subjects of African ancestry; however, this study sample was predominantly Caucasian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although research has been conducted on circulating leptin levels among healthy populations of women including women of African descent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], few studies have evaluated mean circulating leptin levels according to the <italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] among healthy populations of women. Furthermore, no previous study has evaluated leptin levels by the <italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R polymorphism among African-Caribbean women.</p><p>In this study, we have determined the frequency of leptin receptor polymorphism (<italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R) in healthy populations from various ethnic groups (African, African-American, African-Caribbean, Caucasian, Asian/and other ethnic groups). We have also compared the <italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R polymorphism with plasma leptin levels in healthy African-Caribbean and Caucasian women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study population consists of 1,418 healthy subjects (883 Caucasians, 279 Africans, 36 African-Americans, 194 African-Caribbean, 26 Asian/other ethnic groups). Caucasian subjects were recruited as part of a study on hormonal determinants of mammographic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] as well as a study of hormones, bone density and genetic markers of susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; African-American and African subjects were part of a study on ethnic differences in polymorphisms of genes involved in tobacco metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; African-Caribbean subjects were recruited as part of a study on cervical and oral HPV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Ethnicity for all subjects was self-reported. Nineteen of the 26 Asian subjects were recruited from the Caribbean but self-reported their ethnicity as East Indian.</p><p>Women had no history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as determined from questionnaire data. There were 6 African-Caribbean women and one Asian who reported ever HRT users and for 36 African-Caribbean and two Asian women HRT use was not reported. Menopausal status was determined by using a self reported questionnaire on whether their menses has stopped and/or date at the last menstrual cycle. If the date of last menstruation was prior to six months from recruitment, women were considered post-menopausal. One subject who reported that her menses stopped 3 months before recruitment was included in the post-menopausal group. Twenty-nine 29 African-Caribbean women responses were missing therefore were unable to define their menopausal status.</p></sec><sec><title>Leptin levels</title><p>Nonfasting plasma leptin levels were determined for a subpopulation of women (N = 574) using a commercially available leptin ELISA kit (Biosource International, Camarilli, CA, USA). Batches were performed using 96 well plates which included ~38 samples, 8 leptin standards and quality controls. Forty blinded duplicates were included as a means of assessing the reliability of the assay. Each sample was run in duplicate within the same plate and a coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated. All CV's greater than 15% were repeated. The average of the two leptin measurements was used for this analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R genotyping</title><p>DNA was extracted from blood samples and the allelic frequency of <italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R was evaluated for all subjects by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the extracted DNA, followed by <italic>MspI </italic>restriction enzyme digestion. The PCR primers and cycling conditions used have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Briefly, amplification of the 80bp <italic>LEPR </italic>PCR product was visualized following PCR amplification and agarose gel electrophoreses. The amplified product was then subjected to <italic>MspI </italic>restriction enzyme digestion at 37&#x000b0;C overnight. Samples from subjects with the wild-type gene yielded an 80bp DNA band after <italic>MspI </italic>digestion. A heterozygous subject sample was indicated by 80 bp, 58 bp and 22 bp PCR products while a homozygous variant was indicated by 8 bp and 22 bp PCR products only. Twenty samples were randomly chosen and repeated in blind fashion to assess the reproducibility of the method.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version SE 10.0) software (StataCorp. LP, College Station, TX). Pearson's and the likelihood-ratio chi-squared test were used to assess Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Leptin levels were square root transformed in order to obtain a normal distribution for parametric tests. The independent effect of body mass index, age, menopausal status and <italic>LEPR </italic>genotype on leptin levels by ethnic group was assessed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R polymorphism distribution</title><p>The <italic>LEPR </italic>Q223R genotype frequency based on ethnicity is summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

African-Caribbean and African-American subjects had higher frequencies of the AA homozygous variant compared to Caucasian and African subjects. Since ethnicity was self-reported, it is difficult to evaluate the degree and type of admixture present in the populations of African descent (African-American and African-Caribbean). The analysis of the available African populations present in our study indicates that there is a great variability in the <italic>LEPR </italic>homozygous variant frequency in Africa, with Nigerian subjects having a higher frequency (21%) than subjects from Mali (12%). It is possible that the geographic areas from which the African populations were taken during the slave trades could influence the variations in the <italic>LEPR </italic>gene frequency in populations of African descent. For example, historical data seem to indicate that a higher proportion of slaves were taken to the US and Caribbean from Nigeria rather than Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Among post-menopausal women, we observed significant differences in the mean plasma leptin levels between Caucasians (42.4 ng/ml) and subjects of African Ancestry (African-Americans: 61.1 ng/ml, African-Caribbeans: 51.7 ng/ml). These observed differences may be partly due to differences in overall body mass index in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In our study, average BMI in African-American post-menopausal women was statistically significantly higher than BMI in Caucasians (data not shown). The role of BMI in determining the differences in leptin levels between Caucasian women and African-Caribbean women since BMI data was not available. However, for the comparison between African-American and Caucasian women, we were able to adjust the analysis for both age and BMI, and still observed a significant difference in leptin levels between the two ethnic groups, which could be due to other environmental factors such as diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], or by differences in genetic factors regulating leptin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In regards to this study, we were able to look at the influence of one main genetic polymorphism, <italic>LEPR</italic>, on circulating leptin levels. For all three ethnic groups, leptin levels were higher with the presence of the <italic>LEPR </italic>polymorphism, although the difference was not statistically significant. This seems to indicate that the functional significance of the polymorphism is similar across the three ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The strength of the present study is the availability of both genetic information and leptin levels in healthy populations of both African origin and African descent; the main limitations are: the modest number of African-American and Asian subjects, the lack of pre-menopausal women for some ethnic groups. A larger study on healthy subjects, with complete epidemiological information, and with genetic data on admixture is warranted. Simultaneous testing of multiple genetic polymorphisms in addition to the one currently studied is also desirable.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CD, CR, ET, FM, MO and SG contributed the samples and corresponding data sets that were included in this analysis.
