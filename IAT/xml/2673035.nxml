Prior experimental data suggest a wide variety of lipid species can bind to CD1 molecules, but little is known about the characteristics of cellular ligands that are selected for presentation. Here we have molecularly characterized lipids bound to the human CD1d isoform. Ligands were eluted from secreted CD1d molecules and separated by normal phase HPLC, then characterized by mass spectroscopy. A total of 177 lipid species were molecularly identified, comprising glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. The glycerophospholipids included common diacylglycerol species, reduced forms known as plasmalogens, lyso-phospholipids (monoacyl species), and cardiolipins (tetraacyl species). The sphingolipids included sphingomyelins and glycosylated forms, such as the ganglioside GM3. These results demonstrate that human CD1d molecules bind a surprising diversity of lipid structures within the secretory pathway, including compounds that have been reported to play roles in cancer, autoimmune diseases, lipid signaling, and cell death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD1 molecules are a family of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin associated glycoproteins that present lipids and glycolipids at the cell surface for recognition by T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Brigl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. There are five CD1 isoforms (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e). Of these, the CD1d isoform has attracted particular attention because it is the restricting element for a subpopulation of T cells, called Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, that has potent immuno-modulatory properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Bendelac1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to recognizing certain microbial lipids, NKT cells have been found to respond specifically to CD1d-mediated presentation of endogenous cellular lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Bendelac1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the self lipids recognized by human NKT cells remain poorly characterized. Similarly, the molecular principles that govern the selection of lipids that are presented by CD1d molecules for immunological surveillance are not well understood.</p><p>Crystal structures of murine CD1d have been solved with a variety of bound ligands, including glycosylated sphingolipids (GSLs), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and a mannosylated form of phosphatidylinositol (PI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zajonc1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zajonc4">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Human CD1d molecules have been crystallized bound to the glycosylated sphingolipid &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;-GalCer) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Koch1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These analyses have revealed that CD1d molecules have an overall structure resembling MHC class I, but that their ligand binding groove is deeper and more hydrophobic. Lipid ligands bind to CD1d with their hydrophobic carbon chains largely buried within the binding groove, and their polar head groups accessible at the molecular surface. The crystal structures indicate there is some hydrogen bonding between the CD1d molecule and features of the polar head groups of bound ligands, however, it is not clear how much selection is exerted by the CD1d molecule on the chemical nature of the ligand's head group. Nevertheless, it is clear from the crystallographic data that a wide variety of polar head group structures can be accommodated.</p><p>In contrast, hydrocarbon chains of bound lipids usually fit snugly within the hydrophobic binding site. The CD1d ligand binding site contains two major pockets, named A&#x02032; and C&#x02032; for human CD1d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Koch1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> or A&#x02032; and F&#x02032; for murine CD1d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zajonc1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, with the A&#x02032; pocket able to accommodate somewhat longer hydrocarbon chains (approximately 26 carbons) than the C&#x02032;/F&#x02032; pocket (approximately 18 carbons). The crystallographic data suggest that hydrocarbon chains containing multiple double bonds bind preferentially in the A&#x02032; pocket where they can adopt a curved conformation, whereas the C&#x02032;/F&#x02032; pocket provides a more linear configuration. However, biochemical analyses indicate that CD1d molecules can bind a diverse array of ligands that include substantial variation in radyl group structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Im1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The stability of lipid binding to CD1d molecules has been related to the length of the hydrocarbon chains and the manner in which they fill the binding groove, with longer chains that fit well into the A&#x02032; and C&#x02032; pockets of human CD1d providing for increased half-lives of association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-McCarthy1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, it is important to note that antigenic lipids in which one of the hydrocarbon chains is severely truncated can still bind to CD1d molecules in a sufficiently stable manner to stimulate NKT cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Goff1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have identified glycosylated phosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and unmodified PI as major mammalian cellular ligands of murine CD1d molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-DeSilva1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Joyce1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cellular ligands bound to human CD1d molecules included PI molecules with a variety of acyl chain structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Park1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, while individual murine and human NKT cells have been identified that specifically recognize phospholipids such as PI and PE as antigens presented by CD1d, NKT cells that recognize these abundant phospholipids appear to be rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Gumperz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Agea1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, most murine NKT cells recognize a particular tri-glycosylated sphingolipid called isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3), which may be a much less abundant component of the pool of lipids presented by CD1d molecules since it is produced in lysosomes by degradation of a mature form that contains four sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zhou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not clear whether iGb3 is also a self antigen for human NKT cells since humans lack the enzyme required to synthesize this compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Christiansen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, however it seems likely that the self antigens that stimulate human NKT cells may also be minor components of the pool of cellular ligands presented by human CD1d molecules. Thus, a high-resolution analysis of the ligands bound to human CD1d is critical for identifying compounds of interest that may regulate human NKT cell responses. Additionally, such an analysis would provide information about the structural characteristics of lipid species that are naturally selected for binding by CD1d. This information will be key for designing new compounds that can be used therapeutically to modulate immune responses by stimulating NKT cells, since such pharmacological lipid antigens will need to be able to compete effectively with endogenous lipids for binding to CD1d molecules on antigen presenting cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Secreted human CD1d molecules (sCD1d) were generated by truncating the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and were expressed in the HLA class I deficient human lymphoblastoid cell line 721.221 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Prilliman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Two major categories of lipids were present: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005325-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Within the glycerophospholipid category, three types of radyl group configurations were identified: diradyl species (i.e. containing two carbon chains) were predominant, but monoradyl lyso-phospholipids and tetraradyl cardiolipins were also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005325-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

In contrast, structural characteristics of the radyl groups of lipids are thought to play a major role in lipid binding to CD1 molecules. Previous crystallographic studies have suggested that in order to fit into the A&#x02032; and C&#x02032; pockets of CD1d molecules the carbon chains of diacylated lipids should not be longer than C26 and C18, respectively. To gain insight into the characteristics of lipids selected for binding to human CD1d, we analyzed the length and numbers of double bonds of carbon chains from diacylated ligand species. A total of 149 species were included in the analysis. <italic>Sn</italic>-1 chains ranged from 12&#x02013;22 carbons and contained from 0&#x02013;7 double bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005325-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Our data is quite consistent with this prediction, since out of 179 species that were molecularly characterized, only four had two chains longer than 18 carbons (i.e. C20&#x02236;3/C20&#x02236;3 PA, C20&#x02236;4/C20&#x02236;3 PA, C20&#x02236;3/C20&#x02236;3 PI, and C20&#x02236;3/C20&#x02236;4 PI), and in these cases the chains were only 20 carbons long and all contained 3 or more double bonds.

We were not able to definitively determine the identities of the sugars found in these GSLs or the chemistry of their linkages. Also undetermined was whether glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) were present in the ligand pool.

It is worth noting that much of the material within the human CD1d ligand pool that we were not able to identify appeared to be of relatively high molecular weight, and therefore it is possible that more glycosylated ligands are present, and that these may include GPIs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Like MHC class I molecules, CD1d molecules are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then follow the secretory route through the Golgi and out to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Gumperz2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, similar to MHC class II molecules, CD1d molecules are re-internalized from the cell surface and traffic through the endosomal vesicular system before exiting again to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Gumperz2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, CD1d molecules may acquire ligands in the secretory pathway, or within the endosomal system, or while they are on the cell surface. Since the secreted CD1d molecules that we have analyzed here traffic through the secretory pathway but not through the endosomal vesicular system, the pool of ligands bound to these CD1d molecules may not encompass all of those presented by wild type cell surface CD1d molecules. However, we have found that in contrast to the murine system, endosomal trafficking of human CD1d molecules is not required to stimulate autoreactive responses from human NKT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Chen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, antigens that can activate human NKT cells are likely to be present among the cellular CD1d ligands identified in this analysis. Consistent with this, we show in a companion manuscript (see Fox et al., submitted concurrently) that many human NKT cells recognize LPC, a lipid that we show here was present in the CD1d ligand pool.</p><p>It is a concern that non-physiological lipids derived from the culture medium used to grow the human lymphoblastoid cells may load into the secreted CD1d molecules and thus become part of the ligand pool analyzed here. To address this point, we performed an extraction of a sample of the fetal bovine serum (FBS) that is diluted into a nutrient solution to make up the culture medium, and analyzed the lipids by HPLC and MS. The HPLC profile of the FBS lipids showed some peaks that overlapped with those from the CD1d ligand pool (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005325.s001">Figure S1</xref>), however MS analysis of fractions containing these peaks did not show any species in common (data not shown). This supports the conclusion that the ligands identified here were derived from the human lymphoblastoid cells used to produce the secreted CD1d molecules.</p><p>By characterizing a large number of molecular species within the CD1d ligand pool, our analysis provides new insights into the structural characteristics of ligands that are selected for binding to human CD1d. One area of interest concerns how the structural features of lipids influence their positioning within the binding site. Crystal structures of sphingolipids bound to murine or human CD1d molecules consistently show that the fatty acyl chain binds in the A&#x02032; pocket and the sphingosine chain is bound in the C&#x02032;/F&#x02032; pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zajonc1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Koch1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This lipid orientation appears not to be determined by the relative lengths of the two chains, since lipids containing very short fatty acyl chains are positioned in the same orientation as those in which it is longer. However, comparison of the two crystal structures of CD1d molecules containing bound phospholipids suggests that these ligands can bind in either of two orientations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Giabbai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zajonc4">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In one case (murine CD1d with bound PC) the <italic>sn</italic>-1 chain, which is 12 carbons long, is bound in the F&#x02032; pocket and the <italic>sn</italic>-2 chain, which is 24 carbons long, is bound in the A&#x02032; pocket. In the other case (murine CD1d with mannosylated PI) the orientation of the lipid is flipped: the 16 carbon <italic>sn</italic>-1 chain binds in the A&#x02032; pocket, and the <italic>sn</italic>-2 chain, also 16 carbons long, binds in the F&#x02032; pocket. Assuming that the total hydrocarbon chain length that can fit into the C&#x02032;/F&#x02032; pocket is about 18 carbons, our data is consistent with the possibility that phospholipids can bind in either orientation, since lengths greater than 18 carbons were observed for both the <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-2 chains, suggesting that either one can be placed in the larger A&#x02032; pocket. Moreover, longer <italic>sn</italic>-1 or <italic>sn</italic>-2 chains were almost always paired with chains of 18 carbons or less, which is consistent with a requirement for the other chain to fit in the C&#x02032; pocket. Considering that the orientation of the lipid within the CD1d binding site is likely to affect the positioning of the head group, these data suggest the surprising possibility that a single type of phospholipid might present two different epitopes for TCR recognition depending on the orientation of binding within the CD1d groove.</p><p>Another area of interest is the range and diversity of ligand species presented for immune surveillance by CD1d molecules. Our data indicate that human CD1d molecules bind several unexpected types of lipids within the secretory pathway, and these observations have a number of interesting implications. For example, we found that plasmalogen ethers, particularly of PE, accounted for a considerable fraction of the total diacylglycerol phospholipid species. Plasmalogens have been found to play an important role in maintaining proper cellular membrane functioning and in preventing oxidative damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Brites1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Gorgas1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of their ether structure plasmalogens are more acid labile than other glycerophospholipids, and therefore they may be more likely to undergo cleavage within CD1d molecules if transported to acidic endosomal compartments. This might cause them to be more easily removed and replaced by other lipids, or might create new antigenic epitopes if lyso-phospholipid cleavage products remain bound to CD1d.</p><p>The finding that cardiolipins were present within the CD1d ligand pool was surprising for two reasons. First, it is not clear how such tetraradyl species would bind to a single CD1d molecule, as the crystallographic data suggest there is only room for two hydrocarbon chains within the binding groove. We speculate that cardiolipins may bind concurrently to two CD1d molecules and thus ligate them together, though further analysis will be required to determine this. The second surprising aspect of this observation is that cardiolipins are confined almost entirely to the inner membrane of the mitochondria where they are synthesized from diacylated precursor phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Houtkooper1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore their presence in the CD1d ligand pool suggests that they are transported from mitochondria to a location that permits loading into CD1d molecules, such as the ER. Notably, the finding that CD1d molecules may access lipids from mitochondria is consistent with a previous survey of peptide ligands eluted from the MHC class I molecule HLA-B&#x0002a;1801, in which we found that a number of endogenously loaded peptides were derived from proteins localized to the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Hickman1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, much like their classical HLA relatives, CD1d molecules survey ligands that originate in diverse intracellular compartments.</p><p>It is also significant that we identified a number of lyso-phospholipids within the CD1d ligand pool. Lyso-phospholipids, particularly LPC, are key signaling molecules generated by enzymatic cleavage of PC by phospholipase A2 molecules, and thus presentation of these molecules by CD1d may serve as an indicator of cellular signaling responses. However, given that the length and structure of the hydrocarbon chains of lipids have been shown to be critical for their stable binding to CD1d molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-McCarthy1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and lyso-phospholipids only have a single carbon chain, it is perhaps surprising that that lyso-phospholipids are able to compete effectively with diacylated species for binding to CD1d. Further studies will be required to determine the relative binding affinity of lyso-phospholipids for CD1d, and whether there are specific mechanisms that contribute to the intracellular loading of these lipids.</p><p>We also found several glycosylated lipids in the ligand pool, including the terminally sialated species GM3. Since maturation of glycans and terminal sialation occur within the Golgi compartments, this finding suggests either that CD1d molecules can load lipid antigens in the Golgi, or that glycans of CD1d-bound ligands can be modified in the Golgi. Interestingly, two of the glycosylated lipids we identified are tri-hexosylated sphingolipids that bear resemblance to iGb3, a compound identified as a major self antigen for murine NKT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zhou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified the major tri-hexosylated species in the ligand pool as GM3, a compound that does not appear to be highly antigenic for NKT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Park2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, but the exact identity of the other species remains undetermined. One of the key antigenic features of iGb3 is that the terminal sugar, a galactose, is linked to the next sugar in an &#x003b1;-anomeric configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Zhou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Humans and other great apes appear during evolution to have lost the glycosyl transferase enzymes required for biosynthesizing this type of glycan on proteins, and it has recently been demonstrated that we also lack a functional iGb3 synthase gene required to synthesize this glycolipid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Christiansen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, despite its possible structural similarity to iGb3, it seems unlikely that the unidentified tri-hexosylated GSL contains the antigenic feature of a terminal galactose residue in an &#x003b1;-linkage.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that natural cellular ligands of human CD1d molecules include a remarkable variety of lipids. In addition to roles in normal cellular functioning, lipids found in the CD1d ligand pool have been specifically associated with immune recognition in disease. Several, including CL, PE, PI, and gangliosides, are targets of autoantibodies in human autoimmune diseases, and cell surface gangliosides on neoplastic cells can also be targeted by specific antibodies. Thus, an important area for future investigation is to understand how the CD1d-mediated presentation of cellular lipids relates to the immunological targeting of these lipids during disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of secreted human CD1d molecules</title><p>To produce secreted CD1d (sCD1d), the cDNA of human CD1d (Genbank accession number NM_001766) was modified by deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and a 30 base-pair tail encoding the 10 amino acid sequence SVVSTDDDLA corresponding to the rat very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) was added to facilitate purification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005325-Hickman2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. sCD1d-VLDLr was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and then sequenced to ensure fidelity.
