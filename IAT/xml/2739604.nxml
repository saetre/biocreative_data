Although the photochemistry of plant CRYs has been studied in some detail, the photochemical behavior of animal cryptochromes remains poorly defined in part because it has been difficult to purify animal CRYs with their flavin cofactors. Here we describe the purification of type 4 CRYs of zebrafish and chicken as recombinant proteins with full flavin complement and compare the spectroscopic properties of type 4 and type 1 CRYs. In addition, we analyzed photoinduced proteolytic degradation of both types of CRYs in vivo in heterologous systems. We find that even though both types of CRYs contain stoichiometric flavin, type 1 CRY is proteolytically degraded by a light-initiated reaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2, zebrafish Z3, and human HEK293T cell lines, but zebrafish CRY4 (type 4) is not. In vivo degradation of type 1 CRYs does not require continuous illumination, and a single light flash of 1 ms duration leads to degradation of about 80% of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY in 60 min. Finally, we demonstrate that in contrast to animal type 2 CRYs and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRY1 neither insect type 1 nor type 4 CRYs have autokinase activities.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi901043s</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-01043s</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value>40.75</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fs1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by NIH Grant GM 31082.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Cryptochromes are photolyase-like flavoproteins that are known or suspected to function as sensory photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Despite extensive work on the photochemical and photobiological properties of animal CRYs,<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> at present, only <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome (DmCRY) and some insect CRYs closely related to DmCRY have been shown to function as photosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). In an effort to identify other CRYs that have photosensory functions and establish a universal reaction mechanism for all CRYs, we have been isolating and characterizing CRYs from diverse sources.<fn id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; MTHF, methenyltetrahydrofolate; CRY, cryptochrome; Phr, photolyase.</p></fn></p><p>Phylogenetic analyses have divided the cryptochrome/photolyase family into several classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) including the CPD (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer) photolyases and the single-stranded DNA-specific photolyases, which use light energy to repair CPDs in DNA, plant CRYs, which regulate growth and development in response to light, and the animal CRYs. Animal CRYs, of which there are several types, are related to the (6-4) photolyases, which use light energy to repair (6-4) photoproducts in DNA. Type 1 CRYs, which include DmCRY, are degraded in vivo in response to exposure to light, and are thought to regulate the circadian clock as a result of their effects on protein stability. Type 2 CRYs are essential components of the circadian clock, in which they function independently of light as repressors of transcription. Type 2 CRYs have failed to show definitive evidence for a photoreceptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Type 4 CRYs have not been critically examined. However, based on evolutionary considerations as well as expression patterns, it has been proposed that type 4 CRYs function as potential circadian photoreceptors in zebrafish and in the chicken pineal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Indeed, photoentrainment of peripheral organs of zebrafish and of the circadian rhythm of the zebrafish embryonic cell line Z3 by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and in chicken the presence of a vitamin A-independent pineal photosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) and constriction of the embryonic chick pupil by light, independent of opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), have been considered as evidence for cryptochrome-mediated circadian photoreception. Hence, we decided to purify zebrafish and chicken type 4 CRYs and examine their putative photoreceptor activity using type 1 CRYs, which are known to function as photoreceptors, as reference proteins. In this paper, we describe the purification of type 4 CRYs of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (ZfCRY4) and of chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) (GgCRY4) with stoichiometric amounts of the FAD cofactor. In addition, we compare the spectroscopic, photophysical, and photobiological properties of DmCRY and ZfCRY4 as representatives of animal type 1 and type 4 cryptochromes. We find that the two types of CRYs exhibit distinct excited-state dynamic and photobiological properties. Strikingly, we find that while a light flash of 1 ms duration is sufficient to cause nearly complete proteolysis of DmCRY and that DmCRY is subject to light-induced proteolysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mammalian cell lines, ZfCRY4 does not undergo light-induced proteolysis by flash or continuous illumination in either orthologous or heterologous hosts. These results suggest that animal type 1 CRYs which are known to function as photoreceptors and type 4 CRYs which are thought to be photoreceptors have potentially different photosignaling mechanisms.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Plasmids and Baculoviruses</title><p>Plasmids and viral constructs used in this study are listed in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

However, these efforts to purify vertebrate CRYs were aimed at obtaining type 2 CRYs which function as transcriptional repressors in addition to any potential photoreceptive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) and apparently do not require the FAD cofactor for their repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Hence in this study, in an effort to test for a photoreceptor function of vertebrate CRYs, we concentrated on two type 4 CRYs from zebrafish (ZfCRY4) and chicken (GgCRY4) because some photobiological data suggest that these vertebrate CRYs might function as non-opsin photosensory pigments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY (DmCRY) was used as a positive control. We used the baculovirus/insect cell vector/host system for expression, and the proteins were isolated to high levels of purity by affinity chromatography. The three proteins were analyzed by SDS&#x02212;PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The absorption spectra of the purified proteins show that they contain flavin in the two-electron-oxidized FAD<sub>ox</sub> state (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). As reported previously, exposure of type 1 CRYs to blue light causes photoreduction of the flavin to the FAD<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> anion radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), which most likely represents the in vivo dark (ground) state of the cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In contrast, exposure of type 4 CRYs leads to the formation of two-electron-reduced FADH<sub>2</sub> (or FADH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) without a detectable intermediate of an FAD<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> anion radical. Interestingly, incubation of DmCRY (type 1) at 4 &#x000b0;C under aerobic conditions and in the dark for 1 h results in complete reoxidation of the cofactor to the FAD<sub>ox</sub> form without a detectable neutral radical intermediate. In contrast, incubation of reduced type 4 CRYs under the same condition generates a rather stable FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> blue neutral radical (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), in a manner similar to that of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRY1 and of photolyases from a variety of sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). While the functional significance of the differential behaviors of type 1 and type 4 CRYs is unclear at present, for the first time a vertebrate cryptochrome with full complement of FAD has now become available for photophysical, photochemical, and biochemical analyses. Because of the nearly identical steady-state spectroscopic properties of ZfCRY4 and GgCRY4 we conducted the rest of our CRY4 studies with ZfCRY4 for convenience and because of the availability of a light-sensitive zebrafish cell line, in which ZfCRY4 is thought to function as a photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and could be used in our experiments.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Spectroscopic properties of type 1 and type 4 animal cryptochromes.

First, the emission spectra of ZfCRY4 with different excitation wavelengths are all the same (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) as was observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> photolyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) because as expected from Kasha&#x02019;s law fluorescence emission at all excitation wavelengths is from the lowest excited state. This contrasts with type 1 CRYs whose emission spectra of FAD<sup>&#x02212;</sup>* are excitation wavelength-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Second, the lifetime of the fluorescence transient of ZfCRY4 stands between that of photolyase and those of type 1 CRYs. <italic>E. coli</italic> photolyase flavin adopts a rather planar structure and has a single-exponential decay with a lifetime of 1.3 ns that enables the enzyme to maximize its electron-transfer reaction. In contrast, insect type 1 CRYs have multiple deactivation time scales from a few picoseconds up to a few nanoseconds, which is another manifestation of excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission maxima. The flavin moiety of FAD is believed to be flexible in insect type 1 CRYs and experiences a butterfly bending motion to give rise to multiple deactivation pathways and hence multiple lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In the case of AgCRY1-C413N, the transient is best fitted with a three exponential with the two predominant ones in the picosecond range: 5 ps (47%), 105 ps (28%), and 2.3 ns (25%) (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The fluorescence transient signal for ZfCRY4, like AgCRY1, is best fitted with multiple decays but with one important difference in that by far the most predominant species has a photolyase-like lifetime: 6 ps (17%), 118 ps (15%), and 1.85 ns (68%). Thus, it appears that the excited-state dynamics of ZfCRY4 has similarities to both photolyase and insect type 1 CRYs, and probably it represents another type of photoreceptor behavior with its own excited-state photophysics.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Photoinduced Proteolysis</title><p>Exposure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to light causes degradation of DmCRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The finding that light-induced proteolytic degradation of DmCRY could be achieved in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) provided a simple experimental system to study DmCRY, other type 1 CRYs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), and potentially other animal CRYs such as type 4 CRYs that may function as photoreceptors. Hence, we wished to use this system to determine if type 4 CRYs also undergo photoinitiated and proteasome-mediated proteolytic degradation similar to that of DmCRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>) and all other type 1 CRYs tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). In Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, we present the results of such an experiment. The S2 cells were transfected with vectors expressing DmCRY or ZfCRY4 as well as &#x003b2;-galactosidase as an internal control. Transfected cells were exposed to increasing doses of 366 nm light and then were lysed, and photoinduced proteolysis was quantified by immunoblotting (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). DmCRY is degraded by 366 nm in a dose-dependent manner, in agreement with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). In contrast, no degradation of ZfCRY4 is detected within the dose range used (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). A recent report concluded that nearly 20 <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins including redox mediators (thioredoxin, glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase, and a cytochrome p450), phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases, and several subunits of proteasome are involved in light-induced proteolysis of DmCRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). However, another study concluded that the Jetlag E3 ligase is responsible for light-induced ubiquitylation and ultimate proteolysis of DmCRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Hence, it was possible that the lack of photoinduced proteolysis of ZfCRY4 was due to species specificity of the enzymes necessary for modification/proteolysis of type 4 cryptochromes. Also, it was conceivable that ZfCRY4 did not acquire its putative second chromophore in S2 cells, which would decrease its efficiency of photodegradation. Therefore, we tested ZfCRY4 as well as DmCRY for photoinduced proteolysis in the zebrafish Z3 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). We find that the zebrafish CRY4 is not degraded by light even in this orthologous cell line (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). In contrast, DmCRY is degraded by light in Z3 cells almost as efficiently as in the S2 cell line, indicating that the light-activated cryptochrome modification/proteolysis apparatus is present in organisms even in the absence of any indication that such a reaction occurs with those organisms&#x02019; intrinsic cryptochromes. Finally, we find that even a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T) is capable of photoinduced proteolysis of DmCRY. As in Z3 cells, ZfCRY4 is not degraded in this vertebrate cell line (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). We conclude that vertebrates possess the enzymatic mechanisms for photoinduced proteolysis of cryptochromes, but that if type 4 CRYs function as photoreceptors, photoinduced proteolysis is not a feature of their photocycle, and that type 4 CRYs operate by a mechanism dissimilar to that of type 1 CRYs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Photoinduced proteolysis of CRYs in homologous and heterologous systems.

This &#x0201c;flash photolysis&#x0201d; technique has been used extensively to characterize the photochemical reaction carried out by photolyase. We wished to employ this method to gain some insight into the photochemical reaction carried out by type 1 CRYs and possibly detect photoinduced proteolysis with a type 4 CRY that was not degraded with the lower fluence rate light employed in our continuous illumination experiments.</p><p>In fact, in a study aimed at determining some basic parameters of light-induced DmCRY degradation it was reported that photoinduced proteolytic degradation of DmCRY requires continuous illumination because under the experimental conditions used in that study cryptochrome degradation stopped when light was turned off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). At face value, this finding suggests that CRY only in a short-lived photochemically excited state is a target for posttranslational modification that leads to eventual proteolysis. To test this model, we subjected S2 cells expressing recombinant DmCRY to a single camera flash of &#x0223c;1 ms duration and then incubated them in the dark at room temperature for various periods of time, and the level of CRY proteolysis was assessed by immunoblotting as a function of time after the flash. Unexpectedly, a single camera flash followed by incubation in the dark results in nearly 80% DmCRY degradation in 1 h (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As is apparent from this figure, following the light flash the majority of DmCRY is degraded in the dark with a first-order rate constant of <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = 5.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 20 min). A second population of DmCRY consisting of about 20% of the total is resistant to proteolysis because under the experimental conditions used DmCRY continues to be synthesized after the flash as observed under conditions of continuous illuminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Importantly, these results unambiguously show that continuous illumination is not necessary for light-initiated DmCRY degradation. Furthermore, this finding suggests that light exposure creates a CRY metastable state (we prefer this term to &#x0201c;excited state&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;transition state&#x0201d; as these terms have precise meanings in photophysics and kinetics, respectively) that lasts long enough to enable protein kinases and E3 ligases to act on CRY to make it a target for the proteasome. In any event, these results place certain limitations on the possible sequence of events that occur from absorption of a photon to posttranslational modification and ultimate proteolysis of type 1 CRYs.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effect of a single flash of light proteolysis of a type 1 and a type 4 CRY.

Hence, we carried out the same camera flash experiments on ZfCRY4. There was no degradation of this type 4 CRY even under this excitation condition (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We conclude that photoinduced proteolysis is not a part of the photosignaling or of the downregulation of the photosignal initiated by type 4 CRYs, if indeed these CRYs function as photosensory photoreceptors.</p><p>Finally, even though there is no evidence that mammalian cryptochromes are degraded by light in their natural hosts, it was recently reported that human CRY1 (a type 2 CRY) expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was degraded upon exposure of the flies to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>).

We chose to use the RGC5 rat ganglion cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) for several reasons.

Also, RGC5 cells are more likely to have a CRY photosignaling machinery including proteolysis because of its origin from a photosensory tissue. We find that RrCRY1 does not undergo photoinduced proteolysis in RGC5. In contrast, DmCRY, as was observed in all other insect, zebrafish, and human cell lines tested, is subject to photoinduced proteolysis in RGC5 cells as well (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We conclude that neither type 2 nor type 4 CRYs are subject to light-activated proteolysis in any cryptochrome/host cell system tested even under the relatively high blue light dose used in our study.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Light-induced proteolysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY but not of rat CRY1 in the RGC5 rat ganglion cell line.

Several facts salient to the photosensory properties of cryptochrome have emerged from this study.</p><p>First, in both orthotopic and heterotopic hosts DmCRY (a type 1 CRY) is subject to photoinitiated proteolysis, indicating that the molecular machinery of photoinduced CRY proteolysis, which encompasses specific phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis by the proteasome, is conserved in all animals tested including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, rat, and human. Cell lines from some of these organisms (insect, zebrafish) are known to be photoresponsive; others (rat, human) are not photoresponsive. Hence, the lack of photoinitiated proteolysis of type 4 CRYs in any of these cell lines provides reasonable evidence that these cryptochromes are not subject to light-induced proteolysis under physiological conditions.</p><p>Second, DmCRY is degraded in the dark nearly completely in 60 min following exposure to a camera flash of &#x0223c;1 ms duration and of 1 W cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> fluence rate. Using the known extinction coefficient of the cryptochrome, the number of photons absorbed by CRY within this period can be calculated from the formula:<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bi-2009-01043s_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>where <italic>n</italic> = photons absorbed by CRY per second, &#x003b5; = molar extinction coefficient of CRY (&#x0223c;10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>),and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>h</italic>&#x003c5;</sub> = photons cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (fluence rate).</p><p>At a fluence rate of 1 W cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of 400&#x02212;600 nm photons delivered by the camera flash, it is estimated that about 10<sup>6</sup> photons are absorbed by a CRY molecule per second or 10<sup>3</sup> photons absorbed per millisecond. Because the average lifetime of the excited state of a type 1 CRY is about 0.5 ns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), the probability of a biphotonic reaction (absorption of a photon by a molecule in a photochemically excited state) for type 1 is negligible (0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> = 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Therefore, any model proposed to explain the action mechanism of type 1 CRYs must take into account the fact that the photophysical/photochemical reaction necessary to initiate the proteolysis of type 1 CRYs must be completed within &#x0003c;1 ns. This time is far too short for a diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction to take place even when the reactants are at millimolar concentrations. These considerations lead to the conclusion that the primary photochemical reaction of CRY is either intramolecular (conformational change or redox reaction) or intermolecular (energy or electron transfer) between cryptochrome and a highly abundant substrate that has high enough affinity for CRY such that at any given moment at least 80% of CRY must be in complex with its substrate. Considering the unlikelihood of having a reactant at high concentration to saturate the grossly overproduced CRY in transfected S2 cells, we conclude that the primary photochemical reaction in type 1 CRYs is most likely intramolecular.</p><p>Third, the type 4 CRYs are, so far, the only vertebrate CRYs purified with a stoichiometric amount of flavin and as such provide a unique opportunity to analyze vertebrate CRY photochemistry in vitro. From a photophysical standpoint, we find that type 4 CRYs exhibit characteristics more similar to photolyase than type 1 CRYs in that the excited state is dominated by a long-lived singlet with a lifetime of about 1 ns. Along these lines, while the FAD<sub>ox</sub> form of type 1 CRYs is photoreduced to FAD<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>, the type 4 CRYs are photoreduced to FADH<sub>2</sub> (or FADH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Furthermore, when the FADH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> form of type 4 CRY is incubated under aerobic conditions, it is first oxidized to the rather stable FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> blue neutral radical before conversion to the two-electron-oxidized FAD<sub>ox</sub> form.</p><p>Lastly, type 4 CRYs do not undergo photoinduced proteolysis during their photocycle in vivo. In this regard type 4 CRYs are similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRY1 which contains FAD<sub>ox</sub> after purification, is photoreduced to FADH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and is reoxidized under aerobic conditions to FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> first, before full oxidation to the FAD<sub>ox</sub> form. Importantly, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRY1, like type 4 CRYs, does not undergo photoinduced proteolysis during its photosensory photocycle.</p><p>In Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, we compare some of the plant and animal CRYs that have been characterized to date with respect to their photosensory and transcriptional repressor functions, light-induced proteolytic degradation, and autokinase activity. Some generalizations can be made from this table. First, photoinduced proteolysis is not a general property of photosensory CRYs as AtCRY2 and DmCRY undergo light-induced proteolysis, but AtCRY1 whose photosensory activity is well characterized does not. Second, CRYs whose transcriptional repressor activities are well established such as HsCRY1 and HsCRY2 and type 2 insect CRYs have kinase activities, but some of the primarily photosensory CRYs such as AtCRY1 do while AtCRY2 does not. Third, it appears that the FAD cofactor is not needed for the kinase function because type 2 CRYs, which function as transcriptional inhibitors when expressed in Sf21 or S2 cells, do not bind measurable amounts of FAD but function as potent inhibitors of Clock:BMal1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Finally, type 4 CRYs are unique among all of the animal CRYs characterized so far because they neither repress Clock:BMal1 nor undergo photoinduced proteolysis. The full complement of FAD in the type 4 CRYs we have analyzed and the unique expression patterns of these CRYs in zebrafish and chicken tissues that are photosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) are strong circumstantial evidence for a circadian photoreceptor function of these cryptochromes. It is expected that further work on these CRYs will contribute significantly to the development of a unified model for the cryptochrome photocycle.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of Animal Cryptochromes Along with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CRYs for Photosensory Function, Presence of Stoichiometric FAD in Purified Recombinant Proteins, Inhibition of Clock:BMal1 Transactivation, Light-Induced Proteolysis, and Autokinase Activity</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr valign="bottom"><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">property</th><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">AtCRY1<xref rid="t2fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">AtCRY2<xref rid="t2fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">type 1 (DmCRY)</th><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">type 2 (DpCRY2)</th><th style="border:none;" align="center" valign="bottom">type 4 (ZfCRY4)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">photosensory function</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">?</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">?</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">stoichiometric flavin when purified from Sf21 cells</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">flavin radical by photoreduction</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">FADH<sup>0</sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">FADH<sup>0</sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">FAD<sup>0</sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">NA<xref rid="tbl2-fn1" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">FADH<sup>0</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">light-induced proteolysis</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">inhibition of Clock:BMal1 transactivation</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02213;<xref rid="t2fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">autokinase activity</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">+</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t2fn1"><label>a</label><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cryptochromes, AtCRY1 and AtCRY2, are phylogenetically closer to the type 2 animal cryptochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="t2fn2"><label>b</label><p>It appears that DmCRY functions as a repressor of Clock:Cycle (BMal1) in peripheral organs but not in the brain of <italic>Drosophila</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="tbl2-fn1"><label>c</label><p>NA: not applicable since appreciable amounts of flavin are not bound to purified DpCRY2.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank N.
