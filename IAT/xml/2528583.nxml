How this growth factor pathway promotes these two opposite cellular responses is not well understood. We investigate whether local IGF binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) promotes the myogenic action of IGF-II. IGFBP-5 is induced before the elevation of IGF-II expression during myogenesis. Knockdown of IGFBP-5 impairs myogenesis and suppresses IGF-II gene expression. IGF-II up-regulates its own gene expression via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Adding IGF-II or constitutively activating Akt rescues the IGFBP-5 knockdown-caused defects. However, an IGF analogue that binds to the IGF-IR but not IGFBP has only a limited effect. When added with low concentrations of IGF-II, IGFBP-5 restores IGF-II expression and myogenic differentiation, whereas an IGF binding&#x02013;deficient IGFBP-5 mutant has no effect. These findings suggest that IGFBP-5 promotes muscle cell differentiation by binding to and switching on the IGF-II auto-regulation loop.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>H.

This process is regulated by a variety of hormones and growth factors. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), including IGF-I and IGF-II, play critical roles in skeletal muscle differentiation and growth, as well as adult muscle regeneration and hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musaro et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2004</xref>). Mice deficient in IGF ligand or IGF-I receptor exhibit muscle hypoplasia and die shortly after birth due to impaired muscle mass to inflate their lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Powell-Braxton et al., 1993</xref>). Transgenic mice with overexpression of IGF-I in muscle have larger muscle fibers and enhanced muscle strength during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton-Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaspar et al., 2003</xref>). In cultured muscle cells, IGF-II levels increase dramatically during myogenesis. IGF-II antisense oligonucleotides can abolish differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florini et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1993</xref>), and IGF-II overexpression accelerates myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Although most growth factors stimulate myoblast proliferation and inhibit myogenic differentiation, IGFs are unique in that they not only stimulate myoblast proliferation but also promote myogenic differentiation, two mutually exclusive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Florini et al., 1996</xref>). These actions are mediated through the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, and activation of the IGF-IR initiates downstream signaling cascades including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Earlier studies have shown that there is a temporal separation between these two responses to IGFs: IGF treatment causes a proliferative response in the first 24&#x02013;36 h, and this is followed by subsequent increase in myogenic differentiation. The increase in differentiation is not secondary to increased cell number after IGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Florini et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenthal and Cheng (1995)</xref> have reported a biphasic effect of IGF-I on pRb, a regulator of cell cycle progression that is present in the hyperphosphorylated state during cell proliferation and hypophosphorylated state during differentiation. They found that IGF treatment resulted in persistent Rb hyperphosphorylation for over 24 h before hypophosphorylation became the dominant form. Several laboratories have shown that activation of PI3K, Akt, and FoxO promotes myogenic differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaliman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coolican et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rommel et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawlor and Rotwein, 2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawlor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and Rotwein, 2007</xref>). Rotwein and colleagues have reported that in cultured muscle cells, secreted IGF-II stimulates the IGF-IR, PI3K, and Akt to induce the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and Myogenin, and through this mechanism, maintains myoblast viability during early myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawlor and Rotwein, 2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawlor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and Rotwein, 2007</xref>). Despite these advances in various intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying IGF actions in myogenesis, it remains puzzling how the activation of the same IGF-IR by the same ligand (IGF-II) can elicit opposite biological responses.</p><p>We now understand that most, if not all IGFs in the extracellular environment are bound to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs are a family of secreted proteins that specifically bind IGFs with affinities that are equal to or greater than those of the IGF-IR. Six distinct IGFBPs, designated as IGFBP-1 to -6, have been isolated and characterized in humans and a variety of other vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemmons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth and Baxter, 2002</xref>). IGFBP-5, the most conserved IGFBP, is the major protein secreted by skeletal muscles. IGFBP-5 is expressed in the myotomal compartments during early development in rodent and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wood et al., 2005</xref>) and its expression is induced during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">James et al., 1993</xref>). In cultured myoblasts, IGFBP-5 expression levels increased dramatically during myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotwein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayol et al., 2000</xref>). These findings suggest that IGFBP-5 may play a role in modulating the actions of IGF-II on muscle differentiation. The precise role(s) of IGFBP-5 in myogenesis, however, remains under debate. Knockout of the IGFBP-5 in mice had a minimal effect on muscle size and whole body size, but IGFBP-3, -4, and -5 triple knockout mice showed smaller body size and reduced quadriceps muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ning et al., 2006</xref>), indicating the potential compensatory effects from other IGFBPs in the single knockout mice. When overexpressed in vivo in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salih et al., 2004</xref>) and in vitro in cultured murine muscle cells under the control of a constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2007</xref>), IGFBP-5 inhibits muscle differentiation. When exogenous IGFBP-5 was added to cultured rat myoblasts together with IGF-I at an appropriate ratio, it stimulated IGF-I&#x02013;induced differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewton et al., 1998</xref>). Although these gain-of-function studies, either adding large amounts of purified IGFBP-5 to or stably and constitutively overexpressing of IGFBP-5 in cultured myoblasts, are useful in demonstrating the biological capabilities of IGFBP-5, they do not necessarily provide insight into the physiological function(s) of the endogenous protein. Furthermore, interpretation of these data are not always straightforward because the IGFBP-5 expression is dramatically induced during myogenesis.</p><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the physiological role(s) of endogenous IGFBP-5 in regulating IGF-II actions in skeletal muscle differentiation. Our results suggest the induction of IGFBP-5 precedes that of IGF-II in cultured C2C12 myoblast cells and in primary skeletal muscle cells. Knockdown of IGFBP-5 impairs myogenic differentiation and reduces the expression of Myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MHC). Interestingly, knockdown of IGFBP-5 suppresses IGF-II expression and reduces IGF-IR&#x02013;mediated signaling activity. Further mechanistic analyses suggest that IGFBP-5 promotes muscle cell differentiation by binding to IGF-II and enhances the IGF-II autocrine regulatory loop.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Induction of IGFBP-5 precedes the induction of IGF-II during myogenesis</title><p>C2C12 myoblasts undergo terminal differentiation after switching to horse serum containing differentiation medium (DM).

Western blot analysis verified the successful expression of the Myc-tagged Myogenin. Knockdown of IGFBP-5 suppressed the endogenous Myogenin and modestly decreased the levels of the transgene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, cells cotransfected with Myogenin and pSUPER-BP5 were indistinguishable from those transfected with pSUPER-BP5 alone, i.e., they did not form myotubes and had minimal MHC expression when grown in DM. To confirm that the myogenin transgene is functional in this particular experimental setting, the transcriptional activity of Myc-Myogenin was examined. Myogenin forms heterodimers with other ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and binds to the cis-control elements termed E-boxes often found in the promoters of muscle-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabourin and Rudnicki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckingham, 2001</xref>). 4RTK is a reporter construct that contains the firefly luciferase gene driven by a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked with four copies of the E-box derived from the mouse muscle creatine kinase promoter. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, when cotransfected with 4RTK, the Myc-Myogenin caused a sixfold increase in luciferase activity. Furthermore, when transfected to C2C12 cells, Myogenin significantly increased differentiation at 24 and 36 h after the induction of differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), suggesting that overexpression of Myogenin is capable of promoting differentiation. Together, these data indicate that while knockdown of IGFBP-5 reduces myogenin gene expression, myogenin alone is insufficient to promote myogenic differentiation in the absence of IGFBP-5.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Forced expression of Myogenin does not rescue the myogenic defects in IGFBP-5&#x02013;deficient cells.</bold> (A) Western immunoblot analysis of C2C12 cells transfected with pSUPER &#x0002b; pCS2, pSUPER-BP5 &#x0002b; pCS2, pSUPER &#x0002b; Myc-tagged Myogenin, or pSUPER-BP5 &#x0002b; Myc-tagged Myogenin 4 d after they were induced to differentiate.

This action of exogenous IGF-II is likely mediated by the IGF-IR and Akt signaling pathway because knockdown of IGFBP-5 reduced phospho-Akt levels and IGF-II increased phospho-Akt levels in differentiating cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Exogenous IGFs or expression of a constitutively active Akt &#x0201c;rescues&#x0201d; the myogenic defects caused by IGFBP-5 knockdown.</bold> (A) Effects of IGFs.

We wondered whether IGFBP-5 could exert a direct effect on IGF-II transcription in the nucleus. To test this idea, immunocytochemical experiments were performed to determine whether endogenous IGFBP-5 is present in the nucleus in differentiating C2C12 cells. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that endogenous IGFBP-5 signal was detected in the Golgi apparatus, in the shape of a crescent moon outside of the nucleus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A, a&#x02013;d</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that IGFBP-5 is secreted from these cells. To show that the IGFBP-5 antibody could detect nuclear IGFBP-5 if present, we generated a plasmid that expresses a nonsecreted form of IGFBP-5 (with the signal peptide deleted) with an EGFP tag at its N terminus, and introduced it into cells by transient transfection. The nonsecreted EGFP-mIGFBP-5 was clearly localized in the nucleus as indicated by the overlap of GFP signal and IGFBP-5 immunoreactivity with DAPI signal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A, e&#x02013;h</xref>). These results indicate endogenous IGFBP-5 is not localized in the nucleus in myoblasts.

IGFBP-5 has been shown to be located on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix in fibroblasts and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemmons, 2001</xref>). Because IGF-II stimulates its own gene expression through a positive auto-regulatory loop, we hypothesized that cell surface&#x02013;associated IGFBP-5 up-regulates IGF-II gene expression and promotes myogenesis by binding to IGF-II and enhances its interaction with the IGF-IR, thereafter amplifying IGF signaling activity during myogenesis. To test this hypothesis, immunocytochemical staining was performed. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>, IGFBP-5 signal was clearly observed on the surface of cells that were fixed in a buffer containing no detergent and therefore with the integrity of the plasma membrane intact (panel a). When the plasma membrane was permealized, however, no such signal was observed, even though intracellular IGFBP-5 was clearly visible (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A, panel b</xref>). We further demonstrated that intact IGFBP-5 is present on the surface of differentiating myoblasts and is capable of IGF binding by treating C2C12 cells with a high salt buffer to release its cell surface&#x02013;bound IGFBP-5. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>, no cell surface&#x02013;associated IGFBP-5 was found in myoblasts before the induction of differentiation.

Des(1-6)IGF-II binds to the IGF-IR but does not bind to IGFBPs. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>, compared with IGF-II, Des(1-6)IGF-II was significantly less potent in stimulating differentiation. Because IGFBP-5 is the predominant IGFBP secreted by these cells, the reduced activity of Des(1-6)IGF-II is consistent with the notion that endogenous IGFBP-5 binds to IGF-II and promotes IGF-II actions. To test this further and to determine whether the potentiation effect of IGFBP-5 is indeed due to its binding to IGF-II, IGF-II and IGFBP-5 were added individually or in combination to cells transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-BP5. pSUPER-BP5&#x02013;transfected cells did not form myotubes and had significantly reduced MHC levels (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref>, 24 h after the initiation of differentiation, the expression of IGFBP-5 mRNA showed a 2.9-fold increase over the 12 h control (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Thereafter, the IGFBP-5 mRNA levels returned to the basal levels. In comparison, the IGF-II mRNA level remained unchanged at this early stage of differentiation. The IGF-II mRNA levels increased significantly at 36 h (4.6-fold over 12 h, P &#x0003c; 0.05) and remained significantly high at 48 h (3.6-fold, P &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, the overall patterns of IGF-II and IGFBP-5 induction and their temporal relationship are similar in these primary cells, although the magnitude of inductions is lower. To examine the role of IGFBP-5, primary skeletal muscle cells were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-BP5. When switched to DM, the vector transfected myoblasts formed morphologically distinctive multinucleated myotubes and expressed MHC (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>).

This, in turn, results in an accelerated increase in the IGF-IR-PI3K-Akt signaling activity, leading to increases in Myogenin expression, and promoting myogenic differentiation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820979f10"></graphic></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have explored the role(s) of endogenous IGFBP-5 in modulating the action of autocrine IGF-II in promoting myogenic differentiation. We show that knockdown of IGFBP-5 impairs myogenic differentiation. Addition of IGF-II &#x0201c;rescues&#x0201d; IGFBP-5 knockdown-induced myogenic defects, while Des(1-6)IGF-II, an IGF-II analogue with greatly reduced binding affinity for IGFBP, is significantly less effective. These data strongly argue that the endogenously secreted IGFBP-5 is a differentiation-promoting factor in skeletal muscle cells. This conclusion makes physiological sense in light of the highly induced IGFBP-5 expression before an appreciable increase in IGF-II production during early myogenesis. It is also in agreement with several previous studies. It has been reported that NFB4 cells, a mutant muscle cell line derived from C2C12 cells that are deficient in IGFBP-5 and IGF-II, do not undergo differentiation under the conditions in which C2C12 cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarbassov et al., 1995</xref>). When added in an appropriate ratio to IGF-I, IGFBP-5 stimulates IGF-induced myoblast differentiation in rat muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewton et al., 1998</xref>). Recent loss-of-function studies in other cell types also suggest that IGFBP-5 promote bone, neuronal and epithelial cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiepe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lochrie et al., 2006</xref>). More importantly, the IGFBP-5 and IGF-II genes exhibit similar expression patterns in primary skeletal muscle cells and knockdown of IGFBP-5 inhibits myogenic differentiation in primary cells. These findings suggest that IGFBP-5 promotes muscle cell differentiation and this finding is of physiological relevance.</p><p>Our finding, however, contradicts the view that IGFBP-5 is a negative factor of myogenesis. Several previous studies in C2 myoblasts have shown that stably overexpressing IGFBP-5 under a constitutive promoter impairs myogenic differentiation, presumably by binding to and sequestering IGF-II from its binding to the IGF-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2007</xref>). The different findings on the precise role IGFBP-5 in myogenesis could be due to different experimental approaches used. In the present study, we explored the role of endogenous IGFBP-5 through a loss-of-function approach followed by &#x0201c;rescuing&#x0201d; using proteins, whereas previous studies primarily relied on overexpression approaches. The different results may also be due to different cell lines used. Previous studies were conducted experiments with C2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2007</xref>). Instead, we used the C2C12 cell line, which is subcloned from the parent C2 cell line by selection for the ability to differentiate rapidly and produce extensive contracting myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silberstein et al., 1986</xref>). Moreover, we obtained similar results in primary skeletal muscle cells, strongly supporting the physiological relevance of our findings.</p><p>IGFBP-5, Myogenin, and IGF-II are all induced during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotwein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayol et al., 2000</xref>). The expression of IGFBP-5 correlates well with the expression of Myogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergstrom and Tapscott, 2001</xref>). Myogenin, IGF-II, and IGFBP-5 were undetectable in the mutant NFB4 cells, which cannot go through differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarbassov et al., 1995</xref>). In cultured muscle cells, endogenously secreted IGF-II stimulates the IGF-IR, PI3K, and Akt to induce the expression of Myogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). The functional relationship between IGFBP-5, Myogenin, and IGF-II is not well understood. In this study, we found that IGFBP-5 knockdown caused marked reduction in both Myogenin and IGF-II expression, but had little effect on MyoD expression. Forced expression of functional Myogenin, however, failed to rescue the differentiation defects caused by IGFBP-5 knockdown, although it increased the differentiation index in the wild-type cells. It is noted that IGFBP-5 siRNA not only markedly decreased endogenous Myogenin expression levels but also caused a modest reduction in the expression levels of the Myogenin transgene. Importantly, forced expression of Myogenin did not cause significant changes in either IGF-II or IGFBP-5 mRNA levels. This suggests that while IGF-II and IGFBP-5 regulates Myogenin expression, Myogenin itself is not sufficient to induce myogenic differentiation in the absence of IGFBP-5 and/or IGF-II. Other factors must also be involved in the effect of IGFBP-5 on myogenesis. Future studies are needed to identify these factors.</p><p>One of the intriguing findings made in this study is that IGFBP-5 knockdown suppresses IGF-II expression. IGFBP-5 knockdown had little effect on the IGF-I and IGF-IR mRNA levels. Knockdown of IGFBP-5 did not affect the levels of other IGFBPs synthesized by C2C12 either. The specificity of this siRNA construct has been verified using a siRNA resistant form of IGFBP-5 in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yin et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the suppressed IGF-II expression was reversed by adding IGFBP-5 together with low concentrations of IGF-II or by a high concentration of IGF-II. Expression of myrAkt also restores IGF-II expression levels. We also ruled out nonspecific interferon responses using another pSUPER construct expressing siRNA with a sequence unrelated to IGFBP-5. Our data showed that myrAkt overexpression significantly increased IGF-II gene expression 12 h after differentiation was induced. It is possible that Akt also regulates IGF-II gene expression during the early phase of myogenesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erbay et al. (2003)</xref> showed that mTOR signaling, which is downstream of Akt, is important for IGF-II induction during early phase of myogenic differentiation (3 h after differentiation was induced). However, further studies are needed to further clarify this issue.</p><p>IGFBP-5 is not only secreted but can also enter the nucleus in certain cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth and Baxter, 2002</xref>). We have recently reported that IGFBP-5 contains a functional transactivation domain in its conserved N-domain and this activity is IGF-binding independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, full-length IGFBP-5 has transcriptional repressing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that IGFBP-5 knockdown suppresses IGF-II mRNA expression in differentiating muscle cells raised the possibility that IGFBP-5 may exert direct an effect on IGF-II gene transcription in the nucleus. Two approaches were taken to address this intriguing hypothesis. First, immunocytochemical staining experiments showed that endogenous IGFBP-5 protein was detected in the Golgi apparatus and on the cell surface but not in the nuclei in myoblasts. Second, expression of the IGFBP-5 transactivation domain did not cause any significant change in IGF-II mRNA expression levels. These results argue against a direct action of IGFBP-5 on the IGF-II gene transcription in this cell type.</p><p>It is of interest to find that IGF-II up-regulates its own gene expression in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. Although previous studies have indicated that nutrients influence IGF-II gene expression in C2C12 cells through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erbay et al., 2003</xref>), to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that IGF-II stimulates its own gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, forced expression of a constitutive Akt strongly increases IGF-II expression in these cells, suggesting that IGF-II auto-regulates itself through activating the IGF-IR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in C2C12 cells. This and other findings led us to propose a new model, depicted in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 D</xref>, on how IGFBP-5 acts to promote myogenic differentiation. According to this model, the induction of IGFBP-5 in early stages of myogenic differentiation plays a crucial role in promoting the myogenic action of autocrine IGF-II. IGFBP-5 acts by binding to IGF-II and promoting its interaction with IGF-IR. This interaction may contribute to reaching a certain threshold that turns on the IGF-II positive auto-regulatory loop, thereby resulting in increased IGF-II gene expression. The increase in IGF-II production, in turn, results in an accelerated elevation in the IGF-IR-PI3K-Akt signaling activity, leading to increases in Myogenin, MHC expression, and myotube formation. This model is supported by several lines of evidence. First, IGFBP-5 is induced in early stages of myogenesis, before the elevation of IGF-II expression, in the C2C12 myoblast model and in primary cells. Second, knockdown of IGFBP-5 impairs myogenic differentiation. Third, knockdown of IGFBP-5 suppresses IGF-II gene expression and addition of exogenous IGF-II &#x0201c;rescues&#x0201d; IGFBP-5 knockdown-induced myogenic defects. Furthermore, we show that IGF-II up-regulates its own gene expression via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Addition of native IGFBP-5 but not a ligand binding IGFBP-5 mutant, together with a low concentration of IGF-II, restores IGF-II expression and myogenic differentiation.</p><p>Although it is known that IGFBP-5 has IGF-independent actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemmons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth and Baxter, 2002</xref>), the myogenic promotion action of IGFBP-5 is clearly IGF-dependent because: (1) immunocytochemistry revealed that endogenous IGFBP-5 is not localized to the nuclei of C2C12 cells; (2) adding high concentrations of exogenous IGF-I or IGF-II reversed IGFBP-5 knockdown caused myogenic defects; (3) Des(1-6)IGF-II has lower activity in regulating differentiation; and (4) adding native IGFBP-5, but not the LBD mutant IGFBP-5, rescued the myogenic defects in the presence of low concentrations of IGF-II. It has been shown that IGFBP-5 is not only present in the extracellular fluids, but is also localized on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemmons, 2001</xref>). In this study, we have provided two lines of independent evidence indicating that abundant amounts of intact IGFBP-5 is indeed located on the surface of differentiating myoblasts and is capable of IGF binding. It is possible that cell-surface associated IGFBP-5 provides a means of attracting IGF-II to the close proximity of the IGF-IR receptor, thereby enhancing IGF-II signaling activity and initiating the IGF-II positive auto-regulation loop.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which the induction of IGFBP-5 promotes the myogenic action of autocrine IGF-II. We provide evidence suggesting that IGFBP-5 is located on the cell surface and binds to autocrine IGF-II and potentiates its interaction with IGF-IR, leading to the enhanced activation of the IGF-IR-PI3K-Akt signaling activity and a further increase in IGF-II gene expression. An accelerated activation of this auto-regulatory loop stimulates muscle cell differentiation after reaching a certain threshold. We have extended these findings to primary cultures, suggesting that this mechanism is of physiological relevance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials and animals</title><p>Monoclonal MHC antibody (MF20) was purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA).
