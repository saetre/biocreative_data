In the pancreas, the <italic>atonal</italic>-related bHLH gene Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) controls endocrine cell fate specification in uncommitted progenitor cells. Therefore, it is likely that Neurog3-regulated factors will have important functions during pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation.

We have investigated the role of Math6 in endocrine differentiation by over-expressing this factor in pancreatic duct cells. Math6 possesses intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity and, in contrast to Neurog3 it does not induce the endocrine differentiation program; however, it can modulate some of the pro-endocrine functions of Neurog3 in this system. In addition, we show that Math6 is broadly expressed in mouse embryonic tissues and its expression is induced by tissue-specific bHLH genes other than Neurog3. Furthermore, inactivation of the <italic>Math6</italic> gene in the mouse results in early embryonic lethality demonstrating an essential role of this factor in organismal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate that Math6 is a novel component of the pancreatic transcriptional network during embryonic development and suggest a potential role for Math6 as a modulator of the differentiation program initiated by the pro-endocrine factor Neurog3.

Developmental transitions require rapid changes in gene expression as the progenitors progress through intermediate precursor states to differentiated cell types. In spite of the existence of lineage-specific differentiation programs, a few conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these transitions. One strategy that has evolved for this role is the activation of cascades of tissue-specific basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which govern cell fate determination and differentiation in many tissues. A common theme in these programs is the transient expression of specific bHLH factors such as the neurogenins in brain and pancreas or myf5 in skeletal muscle that promote differentiation but whose expression is then repressed during differentiation to mature cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Guillemot1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Jensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Schwitzgebel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Sommer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Tajbakhsh1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Zammit1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

The epithelial cells within these buds expand and differentiate to generate the three major pancreatic lineages: endocrine islets of Langerhans, exocrine acini and pancreatic ducts. The endocrine cells that comprise the islets produce insulin (&#x003b2;), glucagon (&#x003b1;), somatostatin (&#x003b4;), pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and ghrelin (&#x003b5;). These endocrine cells are derived from progenitor cells that transiently express the basic helix-loop-helix factor Neurogenin3 (Neurog3).

In this study, we demonstrate that another <italic>atonal</italic>-related bHLH protein, Math6, is transiently expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> within endocrine precursors. Math6 is positively regulated by Neurog3 and it can modulate the expression and proendocrine functions of Neurog3 in cell culture <italic>in vitro</italic>. In light of these data, we propose that this gene is a novel component of the Neurog3-dependent transcriptional cascade and it may play a role in endocrine cell genesis during pancreatic development.</p><p>The identification of the <italic>Math6</italic> gene as a target of Neurog3 in mouse duct cells prompted us to investigate the role of this little studied factor in islet cell differentiation. Using mice that carry the GFP reporter gene in one of the two <italic>Math6</italic> alleles, we found that Math6 appears in the pancreas around E12.5, and by E15.5, when Neurog3 expression peaks, nearly 50&#x00025; of Neurog3&#x0002b; cells co-express Math6. As development proceeds, pancreatic expression of both Math6 and Neurog3 decays and co-localization of these bHLH factors with islet hormones is not observed. The striking parallels in the expression patterns of Math6 and Neurog3 suggest tight regulatory interactions between them.</p><p>Despite the fact that Neurog3 induces <italic>Math6</italic>, it is clear from our studies that Math6 expression in the pancreas is not restricted to the endocrine compartment. Interestingly, in the E15.5 embryonic pancreas, Math6 is also found in peripheral epithelial cells known to express exocrine cell products at this developmental stage, suggesting that Math6 may participate in both endocrine and exocrine differentiation. In this vein, our observation that the pro-exocrine bHLH factor Ptf1a can induce Math6 expression <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002430-g008">Figure 8</xref>) supports the notion that this bHLH factor may lie upstream of Math6 in the exocrine cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Rose1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, and suggests a general paradigm in which Math6 is induced broadly by class II bHLH factors that initiate differentiation in different cell lineages.</p><p>Generation of <italic>Math6</italic> null mice has demonstrated that, in addition to its probable roles in organ and tissue differentiation, Math6 is involved in early embryogenesis. However, due to early lethality of <italic>Math6</italic> null embryos, conditional gene knockout approaches will be necessary to address its roles in organogenesis. In an analogous manner, the Drosophila homologue of Math6, <italic>net</italic>, functions in at least two developmental stages in the fly. First, <italic>net</italic> is expressed in the ventral region of the blastoderm-stage embryo that is fated to become mesoderm in a pattern that overlaps the bHLH factor <italic>twist</italic>, suggesting that it may be playing a roles in mesoderm specification and myogenic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Ledent1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Moore1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to its proposed roles during development, expression of Math6 in adult tissue is suggestive of additional functions of this factor in maintenance of differentiated phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Wasserman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Ross1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results indicate that some Math6 expression remains in the adult organ. Identity of the cells responsible for this low level Math6 expression remains to be determined.</p><p>As a complementary strategy to mouse genetic models, we undertook an <italic>in vitro</italic> gain-of-function approach using mPAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002430-g004">Figures 4</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002430-g005">5</xref>) and demonstrated that Math6 alone cannot promote an endocrine gene expression program. It can, however, modulate the Neurog3-stimulated induction of some key genes. Ectopic Math6 expression decreased the Neurog3 stimulated induction of the <italic>somatostatin and NeuroD1</italic> genes. In contrast, other Neurog3-regulated genes such as <italic>Pax4</italic> or <italic>Nkx2-2</italic> were not affected by changes in Math6 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that Math6 displays a degree of target specificity and may not globally modulate Neurog3 activity, although its ability to extinguish Neurog3 expression may eventually terminate all Neurog3 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Even though the precise mechanism underlying the functional interaction between Math6 and Neurog3 has not been addressed in the present paper, the physical association we observed between these two factors raises the possibility that Math6 is recruited to at least some Neurog3 target loci. Like other atonal homologues, Math6 contains a 12 amino acid-basic region that is known to be essential for Atonal-specific binding to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Inoue1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. A future challenge will be to identify Math6 gene targets as well as to investigate the recruitment of Math6 to Neurog3 target promoters.</p><p>During pancreas development, the regulation of Neurog3 expression can be tightly controlled by a number of mechanisms. Autoregulation of the Neurog3 gene has been described as an important mechanism by which Neurog3 can efficiently control its own expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Gasa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Smith1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This ability may not be exclusive to Neurog3, as autoregulatory loops have also been described for the proneural bHLH genes achaete, scute and atonal during <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-zurLage1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, NeuroD genes during neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Farah1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and myoD during myogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Thayer1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, our results reveal that changes in Math6 mRNA levels affect the ability of Neurog3 to activate its own gene; as overexpression of Math6 leads to an almost complete blockade of this positive autoregulatory loop, while it does not affect <italic>Neurog3</italic> gene activation by other regulators such as Mash1 (L.Sanchez, R.Gasa unpublished observations). Thus, it appears that levels of Math6 expression are tightly linked to the capacity for Neurog3 autoregulation in mPAC cells. Based on these findings, we speculate that high expression of Math6 may be involved in repression of the <italic>Neurog3</italic> gene: increased Math6 expression (concomitant with increases in Neurog3) may contribute to Neurog3 gene silencing. Furthermore, the coincidence of Math6 and Neurog3 expression in the pancreas further supports this idea. Using reporter gene strategies, it has been demonstrated that Neurog3 represses its own promoter both directly by displacing an activator, and indirectly by inducing a repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Smith1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Math6 with its intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002430-g006">Figure 6</xref>) appears to fulfil the role of a Neurog3-induced repressor of Neurog3 expression. However, despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, future studies will further explore the mechanistic basis of the regulation of Neurog3 expression by Math6 to establish whether Math6 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> regulator of Neurog3 <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>Lastly, this study provides the basis for further studies to investigate the role of Math6 in other bHLH-dependent differentiation processes. Here we have demonstrated that the induction of the Math6 gene is not specific to Neurog3. However, other pancreatic, neuronal and even myogenic bHLH factors also increase <italic>Math6</italic> mRNA levels upon their forced expression in duct cells. Furthermore, induction of Math6 by pancreatic and neuronal bHLH proteins is not a duct-cell specific phenomenon, as similar effects were observed in P19 cells. Likewise, the <italic>math6</italic> gene has been recently identified as a potential target of Neurog3 in embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Serafimidis1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and it has been predicted to be a neurogenin/neuroD direct transcriptional target during neurogenesis using computational genomic-wide prediction analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Seo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our observations of a widespread expression of Math6 in the embryo together with the fact that bHLH proteins participate in multiple cell specification and differentiation events, it is tempting to speculate that activation of Math6 could represent a common downstream event elicited by multiple class B bHLH factors and thereby, be relevant to their functions in different developing tissues. In many respects, molecular regulation of endocrine differentiation parallels that of neurogenesis and even myogenesis, with a cascade of bHLH factors regulating cell fate determination, cell cycle withdrawal and induction of cell subtype-specific gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Guillemot2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Halevy1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Liu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Berkes1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, common mechanisms like the recruitment of chromatin remodelling complexes to their target loci are used by both proneural and promyogenic bHLH factors to activate their target genes and induce differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-delaSerna1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002430-Seo2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.
