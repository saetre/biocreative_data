This compact &#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1; structure is stabilized by two cysteine residues and two histidine residues that coordinate a divalent zinc ion and by three additional conserved residues that contribute hydrophobic interactions. While the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> class of zinc fingers can bind both RNA and DNA, most zinc finger-containing proteins are known for their roles in regulating transcription. Three amino acids in each zinc finger, located at positions &#x02013;1, &#x0002b;3 and &#x0002b;6 relative to the &#x003b1;-helical region, are oriented so that their side chains make the principal specific contacts with the edges of three DNA nucleotides exposed in the major groove; successive fingers in an array may make specific contacts with successive DNA triplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c3">3</xref>). An additional residue at position &#x0002b;2 sometimes makes auxiliary contacts with the DNA minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c6">6</xref>). The &#x003b1;-helix is oriented in the major groove such that the protein&#x02013;DNA contacts are &#x02018;anti-parallel&#x02019;, i.e. the N&#x02192;C polarity of the peptide backbone is aligned with the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; polarity of the DNA strand whose bases face the major groove. Many zinc finger proteins contain tandem arrays of the motif, which can number up to several dozen. Thus both amino acid sequence diversity within C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers and the combinatorial possibilities arising from tandem arrays explain the versatility and ubiquity of zinc fingers in nucleic acid recognition.</p><p>Among the genes encoding C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers is the family defined by the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><italic>ovo</italic> locus &#x0005b;also known as the <italic>shavenbaby</italic> (<italic>svb</italic>)&#x02013;<italic>ovo</italic> gene region&#x0005d;. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster ovo</italic> is a complex locus that uses at least three transcription start sites, alternative RNA processing and alternative polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c9">9</xref>). The two 5&#x02032;-ends used in germline cells are regulated by the germline X:A ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c10">10</xref>) and are responsible for the <italic>ovo</italic> genetic function: transcripts originating from these promoters are translated to form two polypeptides, denoted OVO-B and OVO-A. The former is 1028 amino acids long and the latter differs from it by an N-terminal extension of 372 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c11">11</xref>). Flies carrying distinct <italic>ovo</italic> mutations show female-specific germline defects that include cell death, aberrant cell proliferation, partial transformation of sex identity and abnormal egg chamber differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c16">16</xref>). The third promoter, as yet incompletely characterized, is apparently responsible for the <italic>svb</italic> genetic function and is apparently regulated by the <italic>wingless</italic> and EGF receptor signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c17">17</xref>). Animals mutated for <italic>svb</italic> exhibit epidermal differentiation defects that, under most conditions, are organism lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c18">18</xref>). Complementation between some <italic>svb</italic> mutations and some <italic>ovo</italic> mutations is complete, although a sizable class of mutations exists that inactivate both functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c13">13</xref>). This genetic complexity is due to the extensive overlap of exons utilized in the germline <italic>ovo</italic> mRNAs and in the somatic epidermal <italic>svb</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c19">19</xref>). All known <italic>svb</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ovo</italic> gene region mRNAs code for proteins that have identical 268 amino acid long C-terminal sequences that contain four C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f1">1</xref>, the canonical features of this motif are present in all four <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO zinc fingers, most notably in the first three copies, which are in close order tandem array and separated from the final copy by a 10 amino acid long &#x02018;linker&#x02019; homologous to nuclear localization signals. When the four <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO zinc fingers are compared to zinc finger proteins whose three-dimensional structures are known, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> array can be described as possessing DNA-contacting amino acid quartets LRLR-DFDR-QCSS-EEVL.</p><p>A variety of methods have identified other members of the <italic>ovo</italic> subclass of zinc fingers. These include one gene in the genome of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c21">21</xref>), at least two non-allelic genes in the mouse <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c23">23</xref>) and potentially three non-allelic genes in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c24">24</xref>; human genome project data available at http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;ncbi.nlm. nih.gov ). RNA expression patterns and mutagenesis experiments suggest that the mouse <italic>ovo</italic> genes have a conserved function in epidermal differentiation, while the germline functions are male specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c23">23</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f1">1</xref> includes a BLAST alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c26">26</xref>) of these protein sequences. Fingers 2 and 3 of the domain are almost identical among the sequences, finger 1 is somewhat less conserved and finger 4 least conserved. The predicted DNA-recognizing side chains are invariant in fingers 2 and 3, nearly so in finger 1 and most variable in finger 4.</p><p>Several studies indicate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO zinc finger domain is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c28">28</xref>; S.Lee and M.D.Garfinkel, submitted) and that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c8">8</xref>) and the mouse <italic>movo</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c23">23</xref>) are nuclear localized <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both the <italic>ovo</italic> germline promoter and the <italic>ovarian tumor</italic> promoter, when fused to <italic>Escherichia coli lacZ</italic>, demonstrate <italic>ovo</italic>-dependent expression in genetically transformed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c28">28</xref>), showing that <italic>ovo</italic> plays an important role in regulating gene activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the patterns of sequence conservation and divergence raise important questions concerning the nature of the OVO protein&#x02013;DNA interaction. For example, do all four zinc finger motifs contribute to DNA recognition, in which case a DNA target sequence of 12&#x02013;13 bp is predicted, or do only the three evolutionarily near invariant zinc fingers contribute to DNA recognition, in which case a smaller, 9&#x02013;10 bp, consensus site is predicted? Here we report on the isolation of synthetic DNA oligomers based only on their ability to bind a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO zinc finger array and on three independent statistical analyses of their sequences. All the analyses reveal a DNA target motif nine bases long, nearly identical to the target motif identified in the promoters of five <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c28">28</xref>; S.Lee and M.D.Garfinkel, submitted), including those known to be regulated by the <italic>ovo</italic> function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c28">28</xref>), suggesting that only three of the four OVO zinc fingers are engaged in specific DNA contacts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General recombinant DNA methods</title><p>Standard methods of plasmid preparation, agarose gel electrophoresis, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, restriction mapping, ligation, etc. were performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein overexpression and purification</title><p>A near full-length <italic>ovo</italic> cDNA isolated by Garfinkel <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c9">9</xref>) was used as template for PCR amplification, from which a 562 bp cDNA fragment coding for 179 amino acids from the C-terminus of the common portion of the <italic>svb</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ovo</italic> open reading frames, which includes all four zinc finger motifs, was directionally cloned in pUC18.

This fusion protein binds with sequence specificity and high affinity to DNA fragments in the germline promoters of several <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, including <italic>ovo</italic>, that are known or suspected of being <italic>in vivo</italic> targets of transcriptional control by the <italic>ovo</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c27">27</xref>; S.Lee and M.D.Garfinkel, submitted).</p></sec><sec><title>Strategy of selection</title><p>We wanted to extend the initial characterization of DNA binding specificity by identifying synthetic oligomers based strictly on this property. Accordingly, we adopted an <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical selection strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c39">39</xref>) composed of successive iterations of a three-stage process: (i) binding of a DNA oligomer population to the MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein; (ii)&#x000a0;purification of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes by their affinity for amylose; and (iii) primer-directed PCR amplification of the bound DNA oligomers. In the first iteration, the first stage involves a very highly degenerate synthetic oligomer population. In each subsequent iteration, the amplified material from the preceding third stage is used as input for binding in stage one. With each iteration, the complexity of the DNA oligomer population decreases as it becomes increasingly enriched for the subset of oligomers that have sufficiently high affinity for the MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein to be retained on amylose resin. Finally, single inserts are purified by cloning in a plasmid vector and checked by gel mobility shift assay and DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of clones containing single oligomer inserts recognized by MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein</title><p>After five rounds of binding, affinity purification and amplification, we generated pUC18 plasmid subclones. Our ligation conditions permitted the recovery of clones containing more than one insert; to avoid confusion from clones containing concatamers of binding and non-binding sequences, we tested individual recombinant clones with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Sal</italic>I in both single and double digests. Out of 238 <italic>lac</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> colonies we found 103 clones that possessed single inserts, of which 21 clones were judged by gel mobility shift assay to contain OVO-binding sites; the remainder may have passed the selection due to non-specific binding to amylose resin. An example of our gel mobility shift assay is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f3">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence analysis</title><p>The 21 single insert clones that exhibited MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein binding were sequenced (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb1">1</xref>). Consistent with their origins in a pool of synthetic oligomers of form 5&#x02032;-TCT-AGA(N<sub>32</sub>)GAATTC-3&#x02032;, 17 clones had precisely 32 nt between the flanking <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites. The remaining four clones had 28, 30, 33 and 37 nt each, presumably due to errors in either chemical synthesis of the initial oligomer population or in <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase-mediated amplification. Their sequences are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb1">1</xref>; all the inserts possess at least one 5&#x02032;-AAC-3&#x02032; triplet (clone 106 has two 5&#x02032;-AAC-3&#x02032; triplets and clone 26 has three 5&#x02032;-AAC-3&#x02032; triplets), which suggested potential alignments among all the cloned inserts. Further visual inspection revealed that, in addition to the precise identity of the 5&#x02032;-AAC-3&#x02032; triplet, the clone inserts could be aligned so that the position 2 nt downstream of the triplet also yielded an identity for guanine and that the position 2 nt upstream of the triplet yielded a strong preference (14&#x0002f;21) for another guanine residue.</p><p>The statistical significance of this &#x02018;core&#x02019; seven base long 5&#x02032;-GN-AACNG-3&#x02032; alignment and a measure of the length of the consensus sequence were ascertained in three ways. First, we used the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test to measure the statistical significance of deviations from randomness for a total of 23 positions along the aligned oligomers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>). We excluded from the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> calculations any nucleotide that originated in the non-random restriction site linker portion of the synthetic oligomers. Six contiguous nucleotides, positions 8&#x02013;13 in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>, scored as having highly significant deviations from randomness; these residues include all the identities that were observed by human inspection. Position 14 does not deviate from random. Position 15 scored as highly significant. Positions 4 and 16 scored as somewhat significant. Overall, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test identified a &#x02018;window&#x02019; of nine contiguous nucleotides that contains seven highly significant nucleotides and one somewhat significant nucleotide.</p><p>Our second, totally independent, sequence alignment algorithm was the Gibbs motif sampling method described by Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c37">37</xref>). The Gibbs procedure uses iterative sampling to generate local multiple alignments based on &#x02018;informational content&#x02019; intrinsic to the sequences analyzed. One important application of this algorithm is to determine the length of a sequence motif by plotting &#x02018;information per parameter&#x02019; (IPP), a quantitative measure of the contribution made by each residue position versus window size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c37">37</xref>). In the present case, window sizes 5&#x02013;18 nt in length were used. Windows up to 8 nt gave nearly identical, very high IPP scores (data not shown). A slight reduction in IPP was noted with 9 and 10 nt windows and a steep fall-off in IPP occurs with windows &#x02265;11 nt in length. IPP frequency histograms were also obtained for each window size. For windows up to 10 nt in length, the IPP values obtained were very narrowly distributed around the peak value. IPP peaks became broader as window size increased above 10 nt, indicating that suboptimal alignments became increasingly prevalent (data not shown). The Gibbs sampling procedure yielded a consensus alignment identical to that derived by human inspection and presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb1">1</xref>. The motif identified corresponds to positions 8&#x02013;16, inclusive, of Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>.</p><p>The third independent method of alignment and motif length determination was the wconsensus algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c38">38</xref>). The same alignment as obtained by eye and by Gibbs motif sampling was obtained, which again corresponds to the nine base wide window given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>, positions 8&#x02013;16 inclusive. The <italic>P</italic> value of this nine base window was 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;45</sup>. These calculations independently support the conclusion of the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>: the MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein recognizes nine contiguous DNA bases.</p><p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref>, the consensus DNA target site recognized by <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO protein, based on the most frequent nucleotides observed in each position, is 5&#x02032;-AGTAACNGT-3&#x02032;. Referring to the sequences presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb1">1</xref>, we see that only one clone, 15, matches the proposed consensus at all eight of the specified positions. Eight clones matched the proposed consensus at seven of the specified positions, nine clones matched at six of the specified positions and three clones matched at five of the eight specified positions. Experiments to determine the relationship between relative binding affinities and number of matches to the derived consensus are in progress in this laboratory.</p><p>The nine base long consensus given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd164tb2">2</xref> is essentially identical to the consensus we obtained using gel mobility shift assays and DNA footprinting on the promoters of five <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes involved in germline sex determination and oogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c27">27</xref>; S.Lee and M.D.Garfinkel, submitted), four of which interact genetically and biochemically with <italic>ovo</italic>. Two clones (15 and 25) each matched a single footprint site along the entire nine base consensus and they each matched an additional three footprints at eight positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f4">4</xref>). Six more clones matched at least one gene footprint in eight positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f4">4</xref>). Eleven more clones matched at least one of the gene footprint sites in seven positions along the nine base consensus (data not shown). Overall, one-third (8&#x0002f;21) of the selected oligomers match at least one footprinted site at eight or nine positions; these footprinted sites correspond to 11 of the 17 reported on <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes. Thus, the selected oligomers share sequence characteristics with OVO-binding sites defined by DNase I footprinting on <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes. The consensus sequence is unusual for one recognized by a zinc finger array in its AT-richness. In these and other respects, the consensus sequence deviates from what one would predict from the DNA&#x02013;protein co-crystal structures of other zinc finger proteins and from other experimental determinations of the relationship between DNA bases and zinc finger amino acid side chains.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report we have shown that bacterially produced MalE&#x02013;OVO179 fusion protein, which contains an array of four C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers, of form LRLR-DFDR-QCSS-EEVL, binds synthetic DNA oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic>. Alignment of the 21 resulting oligomers enabled us to derive a consensus recognition site. This consensus is essentially the same as the consensus we derived from binding sites identified in five different natural <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c27">27</xref>; S.Lee and M.D.Garfinkel, submitted) and closely similar to one derived by others from a smaller sample of footprinted sites observed on two of the same genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c28">28</xref>). Our statistical analyses robustly demonstrate that the DNA consensus is only 9 nt long, suggesting that <italic>in vitro</italic> one of the four zinc fingers either binds DNA with no specificity or perhaps does not bind DNA at all. The marked lack of evolutionary conservation of OVO finger 4, as evidenced by its score in PROSITE and PFAM analyses (M.D.Garfinkel, unpublished observations) suggests that it is the non-contributing zinc finger within the array. Experiments to test this hypothesis are in progress in our laboratory.</p><p>Numerous studies (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c44">44</xref>) have attempted to establish a correspondence between each of the DNA triplets and the amino acids at each of the principal contact-critical positions in the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger. For example, the &#x02018;syllabic code&#x02019; proposed by Choo and Klug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c45">45</xref>), based on phage display of Zif268-derived proteins, makes several predictions for DNA recognition by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OVO finger array (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f5">5</xref>A). OVO finger 1, with leucine in the &#x0002b;3 position and arginine in the &#x0002b;6 position, should prefer DNA triplets that have a 5&#x02032;-position guanine residue and a middle position cytosine. OVO finger 2, which contains the major groove-contacting residues DDR, should prefer the DNA target subsite 5&#x02032;-GCC-3&#x02032; (a preference also noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c42">42</xref>). OVO finger 3, with major groove-contacting residues QSS, should prefer the DNA target subsite 5&#x02032;-GT(T or A)-3&#x02032;, but this requires assumptions concerning side chain&#x02013;side chain interactions within finger 3 and between finger 3 and finger 4. Assembling these predicted preferences yields the octamer 5&#x02032;-GT(A or T)GCCGC-3&#x02032;, a GC-rich sequence that bears little resemblance to either strand of our empirically derived, AT-rich, nonamer consensus. That said, we can &#x02018;dock&#x02019; our empirically derived nonamer consensus to the OVO finger array so as to preserve some of the features of the syllabic code predictions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f5">5</xref>B). However, in doing so, three discrepancies arise. The first is the distinctly different behaviors proposed for the two aspartates in OVO finger 2 and the second is the distinctly different behaviors proposed for the two arginines located in the &#x0002b;6 positions of OVO fingers 1 and 2. How might this arise? It should be emphasized that &#x02018;preferences&#x02019; of zinc finger major groove-contacting amino acids for DNA bases appear to be protein sequence context dependent. For example, interaction of arginine residues at the &#x0002b;6 position with guanine residues in the 5&#x02032;-most position of the DNA target subsite is not an absolute specificity. The assessed zinc finger of a Zif268-derived protein that contained the three major groove-contacting residues DDR exhibited a marked preference for the DNA target subsite 5&#x02032;-GCC-3&#x02032;, while the corresponding DAR finger had little specificity at any nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c42">42</xref>). The third discrepancy is that, in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f5">5</xref>B, we dislocated the nonamer DNA consensus one position relative to the putative DNA-contacting residues of OVO fingers 1&#x02013;3. We note that the OVO protein has amino acids in the &#x02013;1, &#x0002b;2 and &#x0002b;3 positions of each zinc finger that have not been characterized by other studies for their contributions either to protein&#x02013;DNA interaction or to side chain&#x02013;side chain interactions, and so they may be expected to have novel characteristics.</p><p>Details of the model depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd164f5">5</xref>B may be refined by computational methods such as threading and homology modeling, and are experimentally testable by biophysical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry in solution, and by X-ray diffraction of single crystals. That one of the human <italic>ovo</italic> cognate genes may be associated with clinical disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd164c24">24</xref>) greatly increases the significance of understanding the structural basis of how this subfamily of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins recognizes and regulates the expression of developmental target genes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd164f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The <italic>D.melanogaster svb</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ovo</italic> gene region codes for four C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers that are evolutionarily conserved.
