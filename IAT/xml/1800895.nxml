One class of the antisense RNA overlaps the alternative exon and the other the entire <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene. The antisense RNAs are alternative transcripts of the neighboring TATA-binding protein gene (<italic>Tbp</italic>) that are located mainly in the cell nucleus. Analogous alternative PDCD2 forms truncating the C-terminal domain were also detected in human and chicken. Alternative transcripts of the chicken <italic>PDCD2 </italic>and <italic>TBP </italic>genes also overlap. No correlation in the transcription of the alternative and overlapping mRNAs was detected. Allelic sequencing and transcription studies did not reveal any support for the candidacy of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>for <italic>Hst1</italic>. No correlated expression of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>with the other two genes of the highly conserved synteny was observed. <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, <italic>Chd1</italic>, and four other genes from this region were not imprinted in the embryo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The conservation of alternative transcription of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene in mouse, human and chicken suggests the biological importance of such truncated protein.

The conservation of the <italic>Pdcd2</italic>/<italic>Tbp </italic>sense-antisense overlap in the mouse and chicken points out its biological relevance. Our results also suggest that some cDNAs in databases labeled as noncoding are incomplete alternative cDNAs of neighboring protein-coding genes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome (Chr) 17, tail-to-tail to the gene for TATA-binding protein (<italic>Tbp</italic>), which makes it a candidate for the mouse <italic>Hst1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The distance between the stop codons of <italic>Tbp </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>is 4.8 kb. The arrangement of these two genes is also conserved in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and at least five nonmammalian vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The proteasome subunit C5 gene (<italic>Psmb1</italic>) is syntenic with these two genes in the mouse, being located head-to-head with <italic>Tbp</italic>, and in all vertebrates investigated thus far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These genes are nonrandomly distributed also in nonvertebrate genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The coordinated expression of these three genes could be one of the possible reasons for this observation.</p><p>In the rat, transcription of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>(also called <italic>Rp8</italic>) gene was induced when thymocytes underwent programmed cell death caused by applying radiation or dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and in fibroblasts after exposure to neutron radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The amount of the rat protein increased in nuclei of kidney fibroblasts after prolonged hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The mRNA of the human orthologous gene, <italic>PDCD2</italic>, was upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the upregulation of the mouse and human orthologous genes has not been universally associated with apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The product of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene and its orthologs consists of two domains: a MYND zinc-finger DNA-binding domain found in transcription regulators and a highly conserved C-terminal (CT) domain of unknown function. The human <italic>PDCD2 </italic>gene has two forms. The alternative, less abundant <italic>PDCD2 </italic>mRNA is formed due to a polyadenylation (polyA) signal in the third intron. The resulting product thus carries the MYND, but not the CT domain [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_144781">NM_144781</ext-link>]. <italic>PDCD2 </italic>is negatively regulated by the B-cell lymphoma 6 (<italic>BCL6</italic>) gene in lymph node germinal centers of human tonsils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but no such repression was found in immortalized primary B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>PDCD2 </italic>is also a regulator of the host cell factor C1 (<italic>HCFC1</italic>) gene; mutations in <italic>HCFC1 </italic>arrest cells in the middle of the G1 phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>PDCD2 </italic>is a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene on human Chr 6q27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>PDCD2 </italic>and <italic>TBP </italic>are candidate type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A possible haploinsufficiency effect at the 6q27 tumor-suppressor locus has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A haploinsufficiency gene (<italic>Thl1</italic>) is also located on mouse Chr 17, in a region that includes <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene has been considered a candidate imprinted gene, as it is differentially expressed in 9.5-day-post-coitum (E9.5) parthenogenetic versus androgenetic mouse embryos of the C57BL/6J (henceforth B6) strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to characterize in detail transcription within the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>locus and its vicinity, as well as its imprinting status and candidacy for the <italic>Hst1 </italic>locus. To elucidate the reasons for the conservation of the synteny surrounding <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, we also analyzed the transcription and imprinting of the neighboring genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alternative transcript of the mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene</title><p>To look for isoforms of the mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>mRNA, we used the BLAST program to identify ESTs matching the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>genomic sequence. The presence of a putative alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>exon, which starts 1217 bp from the 3' end of the constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript, was detected [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AA199080">AA199080</ext-link>, clone 657319 from E12.5 embryo]. The EST clone was then sequenced from its 3' end and a polyA tail was found. The 3' end was preceded by a polyA signal, AATAAA. No A-rich sequence that could cause a spurious priming of the oligo-dT primer during cDNA preparation was found in the genomic DNA. The alternative transcript of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>was confirmed by RT-PCR of testicular RNA (data not shown). The alternative mRNA contained a new exon on its 3' end, which replaced the fifth and sixth constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>exons and thus also changed the open reading frame (ORF). The alternative transcript thus does not contain the highly conserved CT domain, as with the human <italic>PDCD2 </italic>isoform 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, unlike the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>ORF, the human ORF is truncated by the end of exon 3 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_144781">NM_144781</ext-link>]. The 3' RACE method confirmed the 3' end of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript also in testicular RNA. The sequenced RACE product was the same as deduced from the EST clone 657319. The length of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>alternative exon was 1147 bp. The 3' end of the alternative exon matched another EST sequence from E12 embryo (BB097798), but the alternative exon was 1156 bp in length according to this EST [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906042">DQ906042</ext-link>].</p></sec><sec><title>RNAs transcribed from the opposite strand of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>locus and its vicinity</title><p>The BLAST output of the genomic region covered by the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript also contained five other ESTs (AA792289 from skin, CA887845 from differentiated neural stem cells, AA792289 from skin, BY723771 from hypothalamus, and CX219724 from neurosphere). Due to their orientation, these ESTs could represent an antisense transcript of the alternative exon of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>. The opposite end of the AA792289 EST clone was therefore sequenced. The antisense orientation was confirmed by the presence of polyA tail preceded by a polyA signal (AATAAA). There was no A-rich sequence in the genomic DNA that would cause a mispriming of the oligo-dT primer during cDNA preparation. The 3' RACE method and sequencing were then used to identify the antisense transcript in mouse testis as well. The EST and RACE sequences were identical and matched the genomic <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>sequence in the entire alternative exon and a part of the alternative intron, 382 bp apart from the constitutive polyA site of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>. The sequences did not contain the sequence of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>constitutive exons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). By RT-PCR and sequencing, it was confirmed that this transcript (termed <italic>Pdcd2as1</italic>) is a novel alternatively polyadenylated form of the neighboring <italic>Tbp </italic>gene.</p><p>Four other ESTs, two from mammary tumor (AW211687 and AW212179) and two from a forelimb of E13 embryo (CJ049248 and CR514396) were identified upstream of the 5' end of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, suggesting there may be a new gene transcribed from the same promoter as <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, but in the opposite orientation. This 5' region is not conserved in human. The transcription status of this mouse region was investigated by RT-PCR and RACE methods. A transcript encompassing this sequence upstream of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene was found in mouse testes and other tissues. At least two alternative forms of this transcript (termed <italic>Updcd2</italic>) formed by different polyadenylation were identified by 3' RACE and RT-PCR, one of them having the same 3'-end as the EST CR514396 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). 5' RACE detected the 5' end consistent with EST CJ049248 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906044">DQ906044</ext-link>]. The bi-directional function of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>promoter is also supported by our finding of two tags in the CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The CAGE method measures the expression levels of transcription starting sites by sequencing 5' ends of transcripts prepared through modifying their caps. The CAGE tags T17F00DAE0F6 and T17F00DAE115 suggest that transcription also occurs in the <italic>Updcd2 </italic>direction. However, there are about ten times more CAGE tags in the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>direction, suggesting the promoter activity is much stronger in the direction of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>than in that of <italic>Updcd2</italic>.</p><p>On the other hand, these identified RNAs could also represent a novel alternative transcript of the <italic>Tbp </italic>gene, an antisense read-through of the entire <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene. Therefore, RT-PCR with a <italic>Updcd2</italic>-specific primer used for reverse transcription and PCR with primer pairs along the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Tbp </italic>genes were used to identify this read-through transcript (henceforth <italic>Pdcd2as2</italic>). As the PCR products along the entire <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene, the <italic>Pdcd2-Tbp </italic>intergenic region and the last exons of <italic>Tbp </italic>genes were successfully amplified and sequenced, the <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcript appears to be another new alternative form of <italic>Tbp </italic>originating by alternative polyadenylation and encompassing the entire <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene in the antisense orientation [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906043">DQ906043</ext-link>]. Thus, our data indicate that there is both a new alternative <italic>Tbp </italic>mRNA and a new gene sharing the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>promoter.</p><p>Furthermore, the BLAST search of the <italic>Tbp-Pdcd2 </italic>intergenic region revealed nine ESTs, which apparently represent another alternative transcript(s) of the <italic>Tbp </italic>gene. Three 3' EST sequences (AU020825, AU019062, and the polyA-containing BG069472, all from the embryo) extend the previously characterized 3'UTR of <italic>Tbp </italic>by 416 bp. Six EST sequences (BQ934602 otocysts, BM945950 E18.5 brain, BG975205 mammary tumor, CK634594 E9.5-10.5 head, CB841791 E15.5 eye and BB068539 from E15 testes) overlap the former three ESTs and each other and extend by 1660 bp in the 3'direction. A 3'RACE product was obtained from a testicular RNA and sequenced. It contains the polyadenylation signal ATTAAA and carries the same end as EST BB068539. No A-rich sequence that could cause an oligo-dT mispriming during cDNA preparation was found in the genomic DNA.</p><p>Taken together, besides the <italic>Updcd2 </italic>transcripts, there are three to four alternative <italic>Tbp </italic>forms transcribed from the opposite DNA strand in the <italic>Pdcd</italic>2 locus and its vinicity, including <italic>Pdcd2as1</italic>, <italic>Pdcd2as2</italic>, 3'RACE-confirmed mRNA, and the transcript suggested by the three embryonic ESTs incl. BG069472. The alternative mRNAs of the <italic>Tbp </italic>gene arise by alternative polyadenylation and differ in overlaps with the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription analyses of mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and Tbp loci</title><p>The expression of all identified <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts was detected by RT-PCR in all eight tissues examined, as well as in different developmental stages of the testis (data not shown). To find whether the antisense transcripts could participate in the regulation of the ratio between the mRNA isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the level of expression of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Tbp </italic>alternative transcripts was more accurately determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) in seven mouse tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), as well as in developmental stages of the testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) using primers detecting the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>constitutive, alternative, <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcripts (primers Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>).</p><p>In tissues, relatively higher levels of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript correlated with upregulation of the <italic>Pdcd2-</italic>antisense alternative <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts. However, no such relationship was detected in the developmental stages of testes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The levels of all examined transcripts were determined using the absolute quantification method in seven mouse tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The levels of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts are on average 40 times lower compared to the level of the constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript in the analyzed tissues. The <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcript was expressed in tissues on average 5 times less than the constitutive <italic>Pdcd2</italic>. The levels of the <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>transcript in tissues were comparable to that of the constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript. The level of all <italic>Tbp </italic>forms (detected by primers from the TBP-coding region) in the testes was nearly 30 times higher than the level of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>-antisense alternative <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts, in contrast to only 3-fold difference in other tissues (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The variations of the expression of the sense/antisense (SA) transcripts in different cell types could make the SA relationship in developmental stages of the testis undetectable. To identify the <italic>Pdcd2</italic>/<italic>Tbp </italic>SA transcript ratios in homogenous cell populations, pure flow sorted populations of spermatogenic cells were isolated and the mRNA levels of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and antisense <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts were assessed by QRT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript was detected just in the population of leptotene spermatocytes. The expression of the antisense transcripts exhibited neither positive nor negative correlation with this restricted alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>expression, suggesting that there is no regulation of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>alternatives by the antisense RNAs in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Also, the higher quantity of total <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts was detected in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids.</p><p>Long perfect dsRNA duplexes, resulting from the antisense transcription, can be substrates for adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines. Massive A/I editing can cause the subsequent retention of the edited RNAs in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To test whether the <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>or <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcripts can drive the expression of the sense <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts by such a mechanism, the mRNA levels of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and both their antisense RNAs were measured in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by QRT-PCR. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios of the tested genes disclose the nuclear localization of <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcripts, but cytoplasmic localization of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative and antisense transcription at the chicken, rat, and human <italic>PDCD2 </italic>loci</title><p>Recently, the chicken region containing the <italic>PDCD2</italic>, <italic>TBP</italic>, and <italic>PSMB1 </italic>genes was sequenced and major transcripts identified by RT-PCR ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY376311">AY376311</ext-link>]). The genes are in the same order and orientation as their mouse and human orthologs. The organization of the coding exons of the chicken <italic>PDCD2 </italic>gene (also called Q6JLB0_CHICK) is the same as in the mouse and human. Provided that the alternative and antisense transcripts are important for the function of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>orthologous genes, these features should also be conserved in the chicken genome. Conserved overlapping transcription could also shed light on the synteny conservation. We therefore looked for alternative and antisense transcription at the chicken <italic>PDCD2 </italic>locus by EST analysis, RACE and RT-PCR. A putative alternative <italic>PDCD2 </italic>transcript that suggests skipping exons 5 and 4 and a part of exon 3 was detected in the dbEST database (BU309667 from the heart, CO773817 from the testes). The presence of the alternative transcript in chicken was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing of testicular RNA. This alternative mRNA does not contain the CT domain, as with the mouse and human alternative transcripts. However, unlike mouse or human, the chicken ORF is truncated before the end of exon 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906045">DQ906045</ext-link>]).</p><p>The overlapping transcription of chicken <italic>PDCD2 </italic>and <italic>TBP </italic>was suggested by ESTs (BU272933 from cerebrum, BU462305 and BU476463 from the ovary) and it was confirmed by RT-PCR of testicular RNA using primers from the intergenic region in combination with primers from the exons of <italic>TBP </italic>and <italic>PDCD2</italic>, respectively. The sequence of the PCR products indicated an overlap of at least 80 bp between alternative <italic>PDCD2 </italic>and <italic>TBP </italic>transcripts [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906046">DQ906046</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ906047">DQ906047</ext-link>]. The SA overlap is thus conserved in chicken. Our RT-PCR data also indicate that the chicken <italic>Tbp </italic>gene has another alternatively polyadenylated form even longer than the one published by Yamauchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The human <italic>PDCD2 </italic>has an alternative transcript formed by polyadenylation in the third intron [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_144781">NM_144781</ext-link>]. However, EST BQ187150 from fetal eye and eight others suggest alternative splicing rather than alternative polyadenylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, human transcript 2A). No overlapping transcription in the human is indicated by the ESTs, although there are 18 ESTs (including polyadenylated AW207335) in the <italic>PDCD2-TBP </italic>intergenic region, which could represent an alternative human <italic>PDCD2 </italic>isoform(s), generated by alternative polyadenylation. However, the analysis of this region is hindered by an A-rich sequence.</p><p>There is also a putative alternatively polyadenylated transcript of <italic>Rp8</italic>, the rat homolog of the mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene (polyadenylated rat EST AI704628 from E16.5 ventricle). Two ESTs matching the <italic>Rp8</italic>-<italic>Tbp </italic>intergenic region (AI412868 from the brain and CO571404 from the testes) suggest overlapping transcription in rat, because they are in the opposite orientation. There are also two ESTs in the third <italic>Rp8 </italic>intron (CB730473 and CB727152, hypothalamus) in the opposite direction than the <italic>Rp8 </italic>gene. The alternative form of the <italic>Rp8 </italic>gene lacking the CT domain has not been suggested by any EST yet.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of coordinated expression of three genes of a highly conserved synteny</title><p>The orthologs of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and its neighboring genes <italic>Tbp </italic>and <italic>Psmb1 </italic>are nonrandomly distributed in eukaryotic genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but the reason for this observation is unknown. As one of the possible reasons could be the coordinated expression of these three genes, we have tested this hypothesis by QRT-PCR in mouse tissues. The three genes are housekeeping, but the expression of <italic>Tbp </italic>has been reported to be highly elevated in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while the other genes were not tested in this organ. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>Tbp </italic>but not <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>or <italic>Psmb1 </italic>were overexpressed in the testis. Thus, there are some regulatory elements of <italic>Tbp </italic>not accessible by the other two genes. Indeed, analyses of a much broader panel of tissues and stages by microarrays suggested a different pattern of expression for these three genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is therefore improbable that the reason for the synteny conservation is the co-expression of these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>as a candidate for <italic>Hst1</italic></title><p>To evaluate the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene as a candidate for the <italic>Hst1</italic>, its testicular transcript was isolated by PCR from the C3H/J mouse testicular library and sequenced. The C3H/J strain carries the <italic>Hst1</italic><sup><italic>f </italic></sup>allele, but it has the same predicted protein product as B6 (<italic>Hst1</italic><sup><italic>S </italic></sup>allele). No polymorphism between B6 and C3H/J strains was detected in 249 bp of the promoter region of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>(data not shown).</p><p>In 15-day-old mice, significant differences between the frequency of pachytene spermatocytes in the testis of prospectively fertile and sterile hybrids can be detected (10% versus 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]), suggesting that <italic>Hst1 </italic>could be differentially expressed at this stage. The amount of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts was therefore compared in fertile and sterile hybrid mouse testis by Northern blotting with the &#x003b2;-actin probe used as a standard (data not shown) and by QRT-PCR using the <italic>Gapdh </italic>gene as a standard (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The alternative <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>were also tested by QRT-PCR. There were no significant differences in the expression of these four transcripts between the prospectively fertile and sterile 15-day-old hybrids. Therefore, <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>is unlikely to be the <italic>Hst1 </italic>gene. A significant upregulation of the <italic>Tbp</italic>, <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcripts was detected in fertile compared to sterile adult hybrids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). This difference is probably caused by distinct cellular composition of adult fertile and sterile testes that differ in the number of pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These cell types vary in the pattern of expression of <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of genomic imprinting of mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and neighboring genes</title><p>Differential expression of the mouse <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene was reported in E9.5 parthenogenetic versus androgenetic mouse embryonic tissues of the B6 strain, suggesting it may be paternally imprinted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nikaido and colleagues have also suggested that the chromodomain 1 (<italic>Chd1</italic>) gene located 180 kilobases from <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>is maternally imprinted. The imprinting of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and neighboring loci could explain the conservation of the synteny. To determine whether the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene and its neighbors are imprinted, polymorphisms in their transcripts were searched comparing the sequences of the mouse strains B6 and PWD/Ph (henceforth PWD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in the coding region of the constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript. This synonymous G/A transition is located in exon 5 and thus not present in the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>). Primers used to amplify the constitutive mRNA were from exons 2 and 5 and did not detect the <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcript. The SNP was analyzed in <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts from RNAs of E9.5 embryos and placentas obtained from reciprocal backcrosses (B6 &#x000d7; (PWD &#x000d7; B6)) and ((B6 &#x000d7; PWD) &#x000d7; B6). Backcross animals were used to control the contamination of placentas by maternal tissues. The DNAs of the embryos were genotyped for Chr 17 and the RNAs from placentas of B6/B6 embryos were tested by RT-PCR for a B6/PWD polymorphic marker in <italic>Tbp </italic>(PWD-specific 6-bp insertion). We found that the placentas were strongly contaminated by maternal tissue and thus were not useful for testing the imprinting status (data not shown). Therefore, the imprinting status of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene was determined only in the embryos and yolk sacs from reciprocal F1 crosses and backcrosses of B6 and PWD. As both B6 and PWD alleles were present in B6/PWD heterozygous embryos, the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>constitutive transcript was imprinted neither in mouse E9.5 embryo nor in yolk sac. Polymorphisms were also detected in <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>mRNAs in the region not overlapping with the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts as well as in five other genes from this region, including <italic>Chd1</italic>, <italic>Tbp</italic>, <italic>Psmb1</italic>, <italic>D17Ph4e</italic>, and <italic>Dll1 </italic>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>). All these genes were tested for imprinting in the same way (data not shown). None of these genes was imprinted.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have analyzed in detail the transcription pattern of the putative apoptotic gene <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the tightly linked <italic>Tbp </italic>gene, a key factor in transcription initiation of all eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>One new alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript, arising by alternative splicing, and at least three new transcripts of <italic>Tbp </italic>originated by alternative polyadenylation have been identified in the mouse. The presence of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>mRNA was also found in human [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_144781">NM_144781</ext-link>] and chicken. Although the mechanism and structure of these transcripts is different, in all three species the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript encodes the MYND zinc-finger domain but not the highly conserved CT domain, suggesting the biological importance of such truncated protein. The function of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>product can be deduced from the reported study of cell-cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The cell line used has a mutation in the <italic>HCFC1 </italic>gene, causing an arrest of the cell growth at the non-permissive temperature. Transfection of a construct carrying the functional <italic>HCFC1 </italic>gene rescued the arrest. Cotransfection of the complete <italic>PDCD2 </italic>greatly decreased the colony formation, while cotransfection with a truncated <italic>PDCD2</italic>, consisting just of the MYND domain (as in the alternative transcripts), increased it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The function of the alternative <italic>PDCD2 </italic>is therefore likely to be opposite to that of the constitutive form. The ratio of the constitutive and alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>mRNAs differs in the tissues, suggesting a developmental role.</p><p>We identified four alternatively polyadenylated alternative forms of <italic>Tbp </italic>in the mouse. The regulation of the stability of <italic>Tbp </italic>mRNAs could be a potential role for all identified alternative forms of <italic>Tbp</italic>, as the 3' UTR determines the life-time of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, two of four newly identified transcripts of the <italic>Tbp </italic>gene overlap with <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts forming the SA pairs. The overlapping transcription of some alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Tbp </italic>transcripts was also confirmed in the chicken. The conservation of SA transcription could explain the conserved synteny of these two genes, although no correlated expression of <italic>Tbp</italic>, <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Psmb1</italic>, three genes of conserved synteny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], was observed. The mouse <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>transcript overlaps just the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcript, while <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>overlaps the entire <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene (both <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>forms). We determined that their level of transcription represents the minority (about 30% in six mouse tissues, 3% in the testes) of total <italic>Tbp </italic>transcription and that they are mostly localized in the cell nucleus. Both these facts suggest that they play some other regulatory role in gene expression than the protein coding one. Moreover, they are transcribed at a level sufficient to interfere with the transcription of the neighboring <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>gene. A possible mechanism of function of the <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcript could be the downregulation of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>expression at the level of transcription via antisense-induced methylation of the CpG island of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>or by post-transcriptional degradation of mRNA after the formation of dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Antisense transcripts can participate in the regulation of the ratio between mRNA isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Correlated expression of the <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts and overlapping antisense RNAs was suggested by our quantitative expression studies in mouse tissues, but it was not confirmed by the quantification of these transcripts in various developmental stages of the testis nor in flow-sorted populations of spermatogenic cells. The pattern of the expression of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>, <italic>Tbp</italic>, and <italic>Psmb1 </italic>genes in sorted populations of spermatogenic cells is in agreement with the Affymetrix microarray data of Namekawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], measuring gene expression in STAPUT-sorted spermatogenic cell populations. Schmidt and Schibler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] found that the <italic>Tbp </italic>gene is upregulated in the testis. We have confirmed their suggestion that the increased transcription of <italic>Tbp </italic>begins already in pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). On the other hand, mRNAs of both the <italic>Pdcd2</italic>-antisense <italic>Tbp </italic>alternative transcripts are present at a higher level in spermatocytes and downregulated in spermatids, suggesting a distinct role for these mRNAs and the constitutive <italic>Tbp </italic>transcript in these cells.</p><p>There are several possible reasons why we could not detect any SA relationship. First, the antisense transcript could influence the expression of its sense partner at the level of mRNA translation. This regulation is typical for micro-RNAs and small RNAs, which inhibit the target mRNAs without destroying the template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, this mechanism is improbable, as micro-RNAs do not show perfect complementarity with their target sequence in the majority of eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, the protein level of alternative and constitutive <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>needs to be determined. Second, the antisense regulation could be very dynamic or specific; the rapid change of SA ratio could be detectable just after specific stimuli in particular tissues or cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>We excluded that the antisense transcripts could drive the expression of the sense RNA via mechanisms connected with massive A/I editing of long perfect dsRNA duplexes, resulting from the antisense transcription and causing subsequent retention of the edited transcripts in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as we did not detect any difference in the sequence of cDNA of the alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>exon prepared from the nuclear RNA fraction. Moreover, we did not find any dramatic difference in the nuclear vs. cytoplasmic ratio of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts in comparison to control genes. Our results also suggest that the heterogeneity of the cell types in the testes was not the reason of the absence of any SA relationship through the measurement of <italic>Pdcd2</italic>-<italic>Tbp </italic>SA expression in the homogenous testicular cell populations. The proper biological function of <italic>Pdcd2as1 </italic>and <italic>Pdcd2as2 </italic>transcripts thus remains to be determined.</p><p>A large number of putative antisense transcripts have been found recently by mapping ESTs and/or cDNAs in the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, only a relatively small number of SA loci have been experimentally characterized by expression analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Here we present the identification and detailed characterization of a specific SA locus. The recent large-scale studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] suggested that 63 to 72% of all genome-mapped transcription units in the mouse overlap with antisense cDNA or EST and multiple-sized transcripts are often generated from the SA loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In general, over 65% of transcriptional units produce multiple splice variants, and transcript diversity also arises through alternative promoter usage and alternative polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The significance of gene overlap has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] by an evolutionary approach, as genes overlapping in mammals are more likely to have the same organization in the pufferfish. The <italic>Pdcd2</italic>/<italic>Tbp </italic>SA overlap is conserved in the mouse and chicken, suggesting its biological relevance.</p><p>We did not find any support for the candidacy of <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>for <italic>Hst1 </italic>by allelic sequencing and transcription analysis. Our data indicate that <italic>Pdcd2, Chd1</italic>, and four other genes from this region are not imprinted in E9.5 embryos as was suggested by Nikaido et al. An explanation for these conflicting results could be that <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>and <italic>Chd1 </italic>are non-imprinted, but regulated by imprinted genes. Alternatively, the conflict may be due to the use of placentas contaminated by maternal tissues by Nikaido et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been shown recently that the expression profiling of uniparental mouse embryos is highly inefficient in identifying novel imprinted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The alternative <italic>Pdcd2 </italic>transcripts, which encode the DNA-binding MYND zinc-finger domain but not the CT domain, were identified in the mouse, human and chicken, suggesting the biological importance of such putative truncated protein.
