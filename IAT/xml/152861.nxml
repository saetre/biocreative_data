In mammals, uracil, thymine and anti-cancer pyrimidine analogs are degraded in a three-step catabolic pathway, involving the enzymes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase (DHPase) and &#x003b2;-alanine synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c2">2</xref>). One of the end-products, &#x003b2;-alanine, is an essential precursor for the synthesis of pantothenate and coenzyme A, but in mammals it is also thought to have a neurotransmitter function due to its chemical similarity to the neural inhibitor &#x003b3;-aminobutyrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c3">3</xref>). Pyrimidine catabolic enzymes are the major cause for the inactivation of clinically applied pyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil, used in treatment of several tumors and viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c2">2</xref>). The degradation reduces the efficiency of the administered drug and requires the application of extremely high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c4">4</xref>), while the accumulating fluorinated products are neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c5">5</xref>). Pyrimidine catabolic enzymes may also play a role in the degradation of pyrimidine-based biocides, such as bromacil (5-bromo-3sec-butyl-6-methyluracil) or lenacil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c6">6</xref>).</p><p>DHPase, also known as dihydropyrimidinase, catalyzes the second step of the pyrimidine degradation, the reversible hydrolysis of 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU) or 5,6-dihydrothymine (DHT) to <italic>N</italic>-carbamoyl-&#x003b2;-alanine (NCBA) or <italic>N</italic>-carbamyl-&#x003b2;-aminoisobutyrate, respectively. Various DHPases can also open five-membered cyclic ureides, like hydantoins or succinimides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c7">7</xref>). So far DHPase has been isolated from various mammalian sources, such as bovine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c8">8</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c10">10</xref>), calf liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c11">11</xref>) and pig liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). Gene sequences coding for putative DHPase from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c13">13</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c14">14</xref>) and human liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c15">15</xref>) have been cloned from cDNA libraries. The bacterial counterpart of DHPase, the so-called hydantoinases (HYDases), have also been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c18">18</xref>) or purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c20">20</xref>) from different sources. However, bacterial HYDases may not be directly involved in degradation of pyrimidines, but rather only in the synthesis of <sc>d</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c22">22</xref>). Sequence alignments suggest a close relationship between DHPases and several proteins involved in neuronal development. Among those are different forms of the so-called human DHPase-related protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c14">14</xref>), the rat turned- on-after division 64 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c23">23</xref>) and the collapsin-response-mediator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian DHPases are tetrameric enzymes and contain tightly bound zinc ions which can be removed by chelators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). The pH dependencies of <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for native bovine amidohydrolase using 5-bromo-5,6-dihydrouracil as substrate showed the requirement for a single group that must be protonated for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c25">25</xref>). The pH dependence of kinetic parameters and solvent deuterium isotope effects has been used to probe the mechanism of DHPase from calf and pig liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). The resting DHPase primed for hydrolysis of DHU has a general base (p<italic>K</italic> &#x0223c; 7.5&#x02013;8) and a zinc-bound water (p<italic>K</italic> &#x0223c; 9&#x02013;10). DHU binds to the enzyme displacing the Zn-OH<sub>2</sub> (pK 9.6). The substrate likely binds with the 4-oxo group directly coordinated to the active site metal, so that the metal acts as a Lewis acid polarizing the carbonyl for the subsequent hydrolysis. The general base activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at C-4 to generate the tetrahedral intermediate. The latter in turn undergoes ring opening assisted by general acid protonation of the ring nitrogen using the same enzyme residue to give NCBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The reductive catabolism of pyrimidines has so far been characterized only in two eukaryotic groups, mammals and fungi. However, the fungal DHPase from <italic>Saccharomyces kluyveri</italic> has not been fully biochemically characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c26">26</xref>). In this report, we describe novel DHPases from insect, plant and slime mold. Furthermore, the <italic>S.kluyveri</italic> and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> DHPases were characterized for their substrate specificity and kinetics and compared with those of the mammalian DHPase.

AF 465756) contains 1785 bp and encodes a 594 amino acid protein with an estimated molecular weight of 65 kDa. The putative <italic>DdPYD2</italic> gene contains a 1512 bp long ORF (accession no. AF465757) and encodes a protein of 504 amino acids of 56 kDa.</p><p>Previously, a number of different mutants, <italic>pyd</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway have been isolated in the <italic>S.kluyveri</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c26">26</xref>). When the three putative ORFs were expressed under the control of the <italic>PYD3</italic> promoter in a yeast mutant deficient in DHPase, <italic>pyd2</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, they could complement the mutation. While the <italic>S.kluyveri</italic> mutant strain (Y777) cannot grow in a medium with uracil or dihydrouracil as the sole nitrogen source, the transformants carrying P478, P633 or P635 could grow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f1">1</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>At</italic>, <italic>Dm</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> ORFs indeed code for functional DHPases, which can catalyze the dihydrouracil ring opening <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the yeast mutants complemented with the slime mold and fruit fly <italic>PYD2</italic> genes grew almost like the wild-type yeast strain, the mutant strain carrying the plant <italic>PYD2</italic> was substantially slower on the selective media (data not shown).</p><p>The sequences of the three novel DHPases were aligned with the yeast and mammalian sequences. A phylogenetic analysis including DHPases, as well as similar enzymes, shows that eukaryotic DHPases have the same origin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f2">2</xref>). However, they are also closely related to bacterial HYDases and animal dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins, and relatively close to DHOases.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase</title><p>Two ORFs, coding for <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPases, were over-expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as His-tagged proteins. The proteins were purified on a Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-NTA column and eluted with imidazole gradient buffer. The DHPase-active fractions were pooled, concentrated and imidazole removed by repeated addition of imidazole-free buffer followed by concentration. The purified enzymes were studied for their native and subunit size, metal content, substrate specificity and kinetics (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>The subunit size and the native size of both recombinant DHPases was estimated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>; see also Supplementary Material). <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase was found to have a molecular mass of 220 kDa for the native enzyme and a subunit molecular mass of 56 kDa. The <italic>Sk</italic> enzyme (<italic>Sk</italic> DHPase) gave molecular masses of 255 and 60 kDa for the native and monomeric protein, respectively. These values are very similar to the size of native calf liver DHPase, 217 kDa, and its monomeric form, 54 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c11">11</xref>). Apparently, both DHPases are tetrameric, similar to their mammalian counterparts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>). DHPases over-expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> in Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium were not initially saturated with zinc, they contained also iron and other metals, most likely because the growth medium became depleted of zinc. Metal determinations, however, showed that <italic>Dd</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> DHPases fully saturated with zinc ions contained two metal ions per monomer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>When all metal ions were removed from <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase, the enzymatic activity of the inactive apoenzyme could be fully recovered by zinc but not by any other metal ion. Titration of the inactive apoenzyme was performed by overnight incubation with increasing amounts of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Aliquots of each incubation were afterwards measured for DHPase enzymatic activity and plots of enzymatic activity versus Zn concentration revealed the titration end point. Two independent experiments showed that <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase contained 2.12 and 1.9 zinc ions per subunit, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate specificity and kinetic parameters</title><p>In the forward reaction, the natural substrates for both <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase and <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase seem to be dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb2">2</xref>). The two DHPases exhibit their maximum enzymatic activity in the pH range 8.0&#x02013;10.0. When the pH is decreased to 6.0, the enzymatic activity is reduced to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the maximum value (data not shown). Substrate analogs, such as hydantoin, glutarimide and dihydroorotate (DHO), are not hydrolyzed by <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase. Hydantoin and DHO are not hydrolyzed by <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase, while glutarimide is hydrolyzed very slowly. These results indicate that the substrate binding site allows only a limited number of structural modifications for a potential substrate and that these two enzymes are highly specialized for degradation of pyrimidines.</p><p>From the point of view of structure and phylogenetics, as well as substrate specificity, the examined eukaryote DHPases represent a very uniform group, but the kinetic properties differ significantly from one enzyme to the other (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb2">2</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase for DHU at pH 8.0 are about 28- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than that of the calf liver DHPase. In general, the catalytic efficiency of the two DHPases with DHU as substrate is about 78- or 106-fold less for the <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase, respectively, than that of the mammalian counterpart. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for thymine are about 6-fold higher for <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase and about a factor of 2 smaller for <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase when compared with the calf liver enzyme.</p><p>In the reverse reaction direction, the formation of DHU from NBCA was determined. Maximal enzymatic activity in the direction of DHU formation was observed at pH 6.0 and 6.6 for <italic>Dd</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase, respectively, whereas the calf liver DHPase is maximally active at pH 5.5. Negligible enzymatic activity was found for the calf liver enzyme above pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c11">11</xref>), whereas the other two enzymes exhibit &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of their activity at pH 7.3. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for NCBA are lowest for the <italic>Dd</italic> and about 2.5-fold higher for <italic>Sk</italic> than that for calf liver DHPase. The catalytic efficiency of calf liver DHPase is 10 and 20 times lower for <italic>Dd</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase, respectively.</p><p>For the direction of DHP hydrolysis, only a few, not very effective inhibitors have been reported so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). For all DHPases tested so far, the product NCBA was always found to inhibit the forward reaction competitively. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> values of <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase for NCBA are 23 &#x000b1; 2 and 4.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 mM, respectively. DHPases are also inhibited by GAMA; the <italic>Sk</italic> enzyme shows competitive inhibition with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value of 15 &#x000b1; 1 mM, whereas the inhibition of <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase is non-competitive with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 4.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 mM. For the two DHPases discussed here, both inhibitors are less effective than for calf liver DHPase with <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> values of 0.21 mM for GAMA and 0.68 mM for NCBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). Both DHPases accept neither hydantoin nor DHO as substrates and these two compounds are not inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Uracil and thymine were shown in mammals, yeast and some bacteria to be degraded in a three step catabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c2">2</xref>). In humans, this pathway is of crucial importance for degradation of several anti-cancer drugs and a detailed understanding of this pathway is therefore highly relevant from a clinical point of view. The second step is catalyzed by DHPase and this enzyme and the corresponding gene have so far been characterized only in a limited number of organisms. In this study, we isolated sequences coding for putative DHPases from different eukaryotes. The corresponding ORFs from a unicellular eukaryote (<italic>D.discoideum</italic>), a plant (<italic>A.thaliana</italic>) and an insect (<italic>D.melanogaster</italic>) were shown by complementation of a yeast <italic>pyd2</italic> deficiency to encode functional DHPases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f1">1</xref>). These results demonstrate that DHPases, and thereby the reductive catabolism of pyrimidines, are likely to be present in all major eukaryotic kingdoms.</p><p>The sequences of the newly isolated DHPases were aligned with a number of DHPase-like enzymes, such as dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins, HYDases, DHOases, collapsin-response-mediator proteins, ureases and allantoinases, and analyzed for their phylogenetic relationship (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f2">2</xref>). <italic>Dd</italic> DHPase and <italic>Dm</italic> DHPase group together with other animal DHPases, and these are closely related to dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins. We propose that both sub-groups originated from a common progenitor upon gene duplication taking place in an early animal ancestor. The dihydropyrimidinase-related protein lineage became involved in the early development and propagation of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c39">39</xref>). A majority of bacterial HYDases belong to the same group as eukaryote DHPases, including plant and fungal DHPases, and animal dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins. Surprisingly, <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase is the least related member of this DHPases&#x0002f; dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins&#x0002f;HYDases group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f2">2</xref>). Apparently, the ancient progenitor of this group, presumably already existing in the common ancestor of all prokaryotes and eukaryotes, was likely to be a catabolic enzyme. The groups, which are the closest phylogenetic relatives of the DHPases&#x0002f;dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins&#x0002f;HYDases group, consist of allantoinases and small (type II) DHOases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c26">26</xref>), which catalyze the third reaction of the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The latter catalyzes the reverse of the reaction catalyzed by DHPases; it closes the dihydroorotate ring.</p><p>From a biochemical point of view DHPases belong to the amidohydrolase superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c40">40</xref>) containing proteins that catalyze various hydrolytic reactions at carbon and phosphorus centers. The superfamily can be divided into three subsets of three-dimensional structures of amidohydrolases differing in the presence of metal ions in the active site. Family I includes enzymes with binuclear metal centers, such as DHOase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c41">41</xref>), phosphotriesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c42">42</xref>) and urease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c43">43</xref>). Family II contains proteins with a mononuclear metal center such as adenosine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c44">44</xref>) whereas the third family includes proteins that carry out hydrolysis without a metal ion as shown for <italic>N</italic>-carbamyl-<sc>d</sc>-amino acid amidohydrolase from <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c45">45</xref>). In the latter, a triad of Glu-Cys-Lys executes hydrolysis. Family I and II enzymes have a cluster of four histidines and an aspartate in the metal binding site, but only family I proteins have an additional requirement for a carbamylated lysine to bridge the two metal ions. All proteins belonging to family I of the amidohydrolase superfamily, DHOase, urease and phosphotriesterase, each contain a lysine residue at this specific location.</p><p>At present no structural data are available for DHPase from any eukaryotic organism. Sequence alignment for eukaryote DHPases and <italic>E.coli</italic> DHOase, however, reveals the conservation of five, out of six, amino acid residues in the active site. Three histidine residues (H67, H69, H248), one aspartate (D326) and the crucial lysine (K165) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f3">3</xref>) are preserved in all DHPases with the exception of <italic>Sk</italic> DHPase. In addition, several other amino acid residues are conserved among the analyzed DHPases and <italic>E.coli</italic> DHOase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f3">3</xref>). DHOase was originally suggested to be a member of family II of the amidohydrolase superfamily because only a single divalent metal ion was found. Modeling of the DHPase sequence onto the DHOase structure shows clearly that the three histidines and the aspartate of both proteins are exactly in the same position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f4">4</xref>). The &#x003b5;-amino group of K165 of human DHPase is within 4.5 &#x0212b; of one of the metal ions. When the additional carboxyl group, however, is attached to the N&#x003b5; of K165 it seems very likely that the two metal ions could be bridged by the carbamylated lysine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f4">4</xref>). Therefore, we propose that DHPases belong to family I of the superfamily and contain two metal ions in their active site, especially in the light of the fact that a second zinc ion in DHOase has been found only recently via the three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c41">41</xref>). The presented metal determinations of <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPases also revealed two Zn ions per monomer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>). The presented modeling data could be useful for design of inhibitors and activators, which can modify degradation of anti-cancer drugs.</p><p>While DPHases show highly conserved sequences and most probably also structures, they differ in substrate specificity and kinetic parameters. The substrate specificity for <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb1">1</xref>) are more similar to each other than to the substrate specificity of calf liver DHPase, and more restrictive than that for rat liver imidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c46">46</xref>) and bacterial HYDases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c22">22</xref>). The imidase hydrolyzes phthalimide, glutarimide, succinimide, adipimide, hydantoin and dihydropyrimidines. The pH optimum of the imidase for the different substrates ranges from pH 7.5 for the phthalimide to pH 9.5 for adipimide and pH &#x0003e; 10 for DHU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c46">46</xref>), whereas the <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Dd</italic> DHPases hydrolyze preferentially DHU and DHT with a pH optimum around 9 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg258tb2">2</xref>). It seems that the rat liver imidase functions more like a detoxifying enzyme due to its broad substrate specificity for cyclic and acyclic imides. Similarly, bacterial HYDases may also have a number of functions in the cell, while eukaryote DHPases are likely to be involved only in the catabolism of pyrimidines.</p><p>On the basis of the pH dependence of kinetic parameters and kinetic solvent deuterium isotope effects a reaction mechanism has been proposed for DHPases from livers of calf and pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c12">12</xref>). The mechanism was written assuming a single active site Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> but now it has to be rewritten on the basis of the novel data of a binuclear Zn center (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f5">5</xref>). This mechanism is a modified version of that proposed for DHOase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg258c41">41</xref>). A general base, most likely D326 in human DHPase, which is homologous to D251 in DHOase, is required to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on C-4 of the DHU ring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg258f5">5</xref>). While DHPases can catalyze a reaction similar to the third step of the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis reaction, they cannot accept DHO, which is the usual substrate for DHOases. Apparently, the carboxyl group of DHO cannot be accommodated in the DHPase active site. However, it may be that only a limited number of amino acids have to be changed to increase the substrate specificity of DHPases and convert them into DHOases, and vice versa. A similar scenario could also have been followed in nature during the evolutionary history of small (type II) DHOases, DHPases and HYDases. Upon duplication of the progenitor enzyme, which could possibly catalyze both reactions, only a limited number of mutations was necessary to create the specialized, anabolic and catabolic, enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_6_1683__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_31_6_1683__Supplementary_material.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg258f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Spot assay.
