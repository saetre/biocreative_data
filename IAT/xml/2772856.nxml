Real-time PCR confirmed that cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;), dexamethasone (dex), or cytokines + dex increased TLR2 mRNA abundance. A synergistic increase was seen with cytokines + dex. To assess TLR2 function, epithelia pre-treated with cytokines &#x000b1; dex were exposed to the TLR2/TLR1 ligand Pam3CSK4 for 24 hours. While cells pre-treated with cytokines alone exhibited significantly enhanced IL-8 and CCL20 secretion following Pam3CSK4, mean IL-8 and CCL20 release decreased in Pam3CSK4 stimulated cells following cytokines + dex pre-treatment. This marked increase in inflammatory gene expression seen after treatment with cytokines followed by the TLR2 ligand did not correlate well with NF-&#x003ba;B, Stat1, or p38 MAP kinase pathway activation. Cytokines also enhanced TLR2 agonist-induced beta-defensin 2 mRNA expression and increased the antimicrobial activity of airway surface liquid.

This mucosal surface is a site of first contact with the environment and has evolved many mechanisms to recognize and respond to inhaled or aspirated microorganisms. Epithelial responses to microbes are initiated via pattern recognition receptors including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TLRs are a family of 10 receptors in humans that recognize a variety of microbial molecular patterns and regulate immune responses. Airway epithelial cell responses to a number of TLRs, including TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], TLR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], TLR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and TLRs 6 through 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have been investigated in human cells and animal models. TLR activation initiates signaling that culminates in a number of host defense responses including the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and chemokines by epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>TLR expression is regulated in a cell and tissue specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Experimental evidence in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] indicates that the expression and function of several TLRs is developmentally regulated. Here we focus on TLR2 expression and function in well-differentiated human respiratory epithelia. TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR6 or TLR1; these heterodimers recognize diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. TLR2 signaling occurs via a MyD88-dependent pathway leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and induction of various inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, and antimicrobial peptides, such as human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that first response cytokines would influence both the array of functional TLRs and their responses to stimuli. Further, dexamethasone, when co-administered with pro-inflammatory cytokines, was reported to synergistically enhance TLR2 expression in the human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell lines A549 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and BEAS-2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

The use of human tissues was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Well-differentiated (&#x0003e; 2 weeks in culture) tracheal and bronchial epithelia were used in all studies. Epithelia were maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin, and 2% Ultroser G. In a microarray experiment (described below), epithelia were incubated for 24 hours in 2% Ultroser G media containing 100 ng/ml each of recombinant interleukin-1-beta (IL-1&#x003b2;; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;; Sigma), and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;; Sigma). For all other experiments, epithelia were placed in serum free DMEM/F-12 for 48 hours, then incubated overnight (18 hr) in media containing cytokines (100 ng/ml each of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;), 1 &#x003bc;M water-soluble dexamethasone (D2915; Sigma), cytokines plus dexamethasone, or control serum-free media (100 &#x003bc;l volume applied apically, and 500 &#x003bc;l basolaterally).

A similar trend was seen in cytokine pre-treated cells, but did not reach statistical significance. These functional data suggest that TLR2 protein abundance is greater on the apical surface of polarized airway epithelia; however airway epithelia can respond to a TLR2 ligand from either surface.</p><p>The changes in TLR2 mRNA abundance were similar in pattern, though less pronounced, than those reported in epithelial cell lines. Prior studies in BEAS-2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and A549 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] cells demonstrated similar increases in TLR2-mediated IL-8 production following pre-treatment with cytokines plus dexamethasone, but did not compare findings to pre-treatment with cytokines alone. While we detected TLR2 protein in cell lines overexpressing the protein, we were unable to conclusively localize TLR2 protein expression in primary cells using commercially available antibodies and methods including immunohistochemistry and surface biotinylation (data not shown). We conclude that TLR2 protein is functionally present in this model but below the limits of immunodetection.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Cytokines on Pam3CSK4 Signaling Responses</title><p>Human airway epithelial cells respond to cytokines and bacterial products through induction of specific signaling pathways. The functional expression of TLR2 may be regulated by more than one receptor-mediated signaling pathway prominent in the early responses to bacterial and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several groups have studied the mechanisms by which dexamethasone enhances TLR2 expression. Glucocorticoids synergistically enhanced nontypeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>-induced TLR2 expression via induction of MAPK phosphatase-1, leading to inhibition of p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The results of Hermoso et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; and dexamethasone cooperatively regulate the TLR2 promoter, through the involvement of NF-kB and STAT transcription factors, as well as a 3'-glucocorticoid response element.</p><p>In these experiments we investigated signaling in response to conditions involving cytokine pre-treatment and TLR2 ligand application, as this setting was associated with the maximal responses to TLR2 ligand treatment. We initially assumed that cytokine augmentation of TLR2-mediated responses would coincide with increased nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway activation because this transcription factor is critical for regulation of the expression of many host defense genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Under basal conditions, epithelial and other cells sequester NF-&#x003ba;B family members in the cytoplasm bound to inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A variety of stimuli, including bacterial molecules and host mediators, induce serine phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B proteins, thereby targeting them for ubiquitination. These modifications of I&#x003ba;B lead to 26S proteasome degradation, resulting in NF-&#x003ba;B release and translocation to the cell nucleus where it mediates defense gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To assess NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation, we initially used immunoblot analyses to identify I&#x003ba;B degradation. As expected, the combination of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; for 30 minutes decreased I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), but this effect did not appear to persist after 24 hours of exposure followed by 30 minutes without treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, pretreatment with the cytokine mixture did not clearly affect I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; levels in epithelia after TLR2 receptor stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Assessment of NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene activation using an adenoviral vector expressing a luciferase gene driven by four tandem NF-&#x003ba;B sites revealed no cytokine augmentation of TLR2-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation that correlated with the observed increased inflammatory gene expression, although there was significant variability between samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Increased NF-&#x003ba;B activity was observed after cytokine treatment of epithelia. Thus, augmentation of NF-&#x003ba;B does not seem to account for cytokine pretreatment effects on TLR2-induced gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Cytokine-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation is minimally augmented during subsequent TLR2 stimulation</bold>.

IFN-&#x003b3;-induced effects in epithelial and other cells requires activation of the transcription factor Stat1 by phosphorylation of tyrosine-701, with subsequent nuclear translocation and binding to gamma interferon activation sites in IFN-&#x003b3;-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The combination of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; for 30 minutes induced Stat1 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), but this effect did not persist after 24 hours of exposure followed by 30 minutes without or with treatment with the TLR2 agonist (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Another pathway that modifies inflammatory gene expression in epithelial and other cells is the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Activation of p38 also occurs through phosphorylation, and the combination of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; for 30 minutes increased the level of phosphorylated p38 in epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This effect was more pronounced in epithelia treated with the TLR2 agonist, but no difference was noted without or with pretreatment with the cytokine mixture (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Based on these results, augmentation of TLR2-induced host defense gene expression with TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; pretreatment does not appear to be due to modulation of these three pathways (at least at the time points investigated), but likely is through other mechanisms, or combinatorial effects not assessed by these assays.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cytokine-induced Stat1 activation does not persist during subsequent TLR2 stimulation</bold>.

These results provide further evidence of decreased TLR2-mediated innate immune responses in the setting of combined exposure to cytokines plus dexamethasone. Furthermore, these data suggest that both pro-inflammatory cytokines and a TLR2 stimulus synergistically enhanced TLR2 function in airway epithelia. Together, these findings suggest that TLR2 function in cytokine-exposed human airway epithelia is diminished, rather than augmented, by dexamethasone, despite increases in TLR2 mRNA abundance.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>TLR2-mediated ASL antimicrobial activity</bold>.

Enhanced functional TLR2 expression following TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; exposure may serve as a dynamic means to amplify innate immune responses during infectious or inflammatory pulmonary diseases. Under conditions where first response cytokines are present, enhanced TLR2 signaling allows for further amplification of mucosal immunity. This increase in signalling does not correlate well with NF-&#x003ba;B, Stat1, or p38 MAP kinase pathway activation. The importance of lipopeptide recognition in airway defense is further demonstrated by the upregulation of several host defense proteins/peptides following receptor engagement. Our finding that glucocorticoids can act as a negative regulator of functional TLR2 expression in well-differentiated human airway epithelia has clinical implications in settings of systemic or inhaled corticosteroid use. Since TLR2-mediated responses may occur early in the host response to infection, any factors that negatively impact TLR2 expression or signaling might influence disease outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AAW, BNN, LJM, CW-L carried out the experimental work, the data analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
