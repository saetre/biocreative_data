Loss of Cdc42 function caused an increase in the endocytotic uptake of apical proteins, including apical polarity factors such as Crumbs, which are required for AJ stability. In addition, Cdc42 has a second function in regulating endocytotic trafficking, as it is required for the progression of apical cargo from the early to the late endosome. The Par complex acts as an effector for Cdc42 in controlling the endocytosis of apical proteins.

In most epithelia, AJs are organized as an apical belt, the zonula adherens (ZA), which is a component of the apical junctional complex that segregates apical from basolateral membranes in these highly polarized cells. AJs are dynamic structures and, during cell rearrangement, have to rapidly disassemble and reform to maintain ZA continuity and epithelial integrity. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate AJ stability, but our understanding of how AJ integrity is maintained during dynamic morphogenetic movements in vivo remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumbiner, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant and Stow 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halbleib and Nelson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo assembles a ZA when the first epithelium forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">M&#x000fc;ller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>). The ZA is maintained in epithelia throughout morphogenesis, during which frequent changes in cell&#x02013;cell contacts occur. One example is the ventral neuroectoderm, which is an epithelial layer that gives rise to neural and epidermal progenitor cells. About one third of the cells of the neuroectodermal epithelium ingress as individual cells and form neural progenitors (neuroblasts or neural stem cells), whereas the remaining cells retain epithelial character and differentiate into epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997</xref>). Zygotic expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cadherin (DEcad), the major adhesion molecule at the ZA in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, is required to maintain AJs in the neuroectoderm, whereas maternal expression of DEcad is sufficient to maintain the ZA in other epithelia that do not undergo cell rearrangements, such as the dorsal ectoderm. Moreover, blocking neuroblast specification and, thus, neuroblast ingression ameliorates the requirement of zygotic DEcad expression to support the integrity of neuroectodermal AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tepass et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uemura et al., 1996</xref>). These observations raise the question as to whether specific mechanisms are used to support AJ stability in the neuroectoderm.</p><p>Studies in mammalian cell culture have pointed to the GTPases of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, as one group of AJ regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukata and Kaibuchi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van Aelst and Symons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braga and Yap, 2005</xref>). Also, the analysis of Rho GTPases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that Rho1 is a critical regulator of AJ stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloor and Kiehart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>) and that Cdc42 impacts on AJs through its role as a component of the Par complex that controls epithelial polarity, including ZA formation in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutterer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macara, 2004</xref>). Cdc42 is a regulator of cell polarity in many systems, including yeast, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> zygote, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, and in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwood et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>). Cdc42 activates the apical Par complex by binding to Par6. Par6, in turn, recruits atypical PKC (aPKC), which phosphorylates targets such as the polarity proteins Lethal giant larvae or Crumbs (Crb) to promote the formation of the apical membrane and the ZA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutterer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sotillos et al., 2004</xref>). Cdc42 may also act through its effector Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (Wasp) to control junction-associated actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otani et al., 2006</xref>) or may contribute to epithelial organization by regulating vesicle trafficking (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerione, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ridley 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we address the function of Cdc42 in promoting the stability of dynamic AJs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroectoderm. Our findings suggest that Cdc42 acts through its effector, the Par complex, to modify apical endocytosis at two stages: Cdc42 prevents the endocytotic uptake of apical proteins from the plasma membrane, and it promotes the processing of apical proteins from the early to the late endosomal compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cdc42 is essential for maintaining AJs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroectoderm</title><p>To address the function of Rho GTPases in AJ formation and maintenance in vivo, we have expressed dominant-negative (DN) forms of Rho1, Rac1, and Cdc42 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo using the Gal4/upstream activation sequence (UAS) system and the ubiquitous driver line <italic>da-Gal4</italic>. We found that expression of Rho1-DN led to a rather general disruption of AJs, confirming the previous work of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloor and Kiehart, 2002</xref>). Rac1-DN showed only minor defects in AJ integrity, which were confined to the vicinity of the ventral midline (unpublished data). Interestingly, expression of Cdc42-DN showed a strong disruption of AJs in the ventral ectoderm. In contrast, AJs in other parts of the ectoderm, the ventral midline, and the dorsal ectoderm remained largely unaffected in these embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We also expressed constitutively active (CA) forms of all three GTPases in embryos and found that AJs became severely disrupted throughout the ectoderm where they were organized in irregular large clusters (unpublished data). Because of the intriguing differential requirement of Cdc42 in maintaining AJs, we concentrated our further analysis on this GTPase.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ventral ectodermal defects in embryos overexpressing Cdc42-DN and <italic>Cdc42 loss-of-function</italic> embryos.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Wild-type embryo (A), embryo overexpressing Cdc42-DN under the control of <italic>da-Gal4</italic> (<italic>Cdc42-DN</italic>; B), and embryo produced by a <italic>Cdc42<sup>3</sup></italic>/<italic>Cdc42<sup>6</sup></italic> female (<italic>Cdc42 lof</italic>; C) labeled for the AJ marker DEcad.

About one third of the epithelial cells ingress from the neuroectoderm to become neuroblasts during stages 8&#x02013;11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997</xref>). At later stages of development of <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos, AJs are reestablished in large areas of the ventral ectoderm, whereas cells in other ventral regions lose epithelial integrity and degenerate, causing the formation of holes in the ventral epidermis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). In contrast, AJs in the dorsal ectoderm and the ventral midline show only minor defects in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos. Preparations of the cuticle of <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos show holes in the ventral cuticle that affect &#x0223c;50% of the ventral region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and L</xref>). To quantify the strength of defects in the ventral epidermis, we counted the number of intact ventral abdominal denticle belts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 L</xref>). In contrast to wild-type embryos that display eight intact denticle belts, <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos have only four intact denticle belts on average. In addition, these embryos display defects in head development and dorsal closure. Also, <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant embryos, which have a reduced maternal <italic>cdc42</italic> contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genova et al., 2000</xref>), display holes in the ventral epidermis and show compromised AJs in the neuroectoderm similar to <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C, F, and L</xref>). The similarity between the defects observed in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos and <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant embryos suggests that Cdc42-DN specifically disrupts Cdc42 function in this system. As <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants still have some maternal <italic>cdc42</italic> contribution and the phenotypes of <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants and <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos are similar, it is unlikely that Cdc42-DN expression completely removes Cdc42 function. We were not able to reproduce the observations reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutterer et al. (2004)</xref>, who showed that expression of Cdc42-DN with strong maternal drivers causes morphological defects before gastrulation or that expression of Cdc42-DN causes the loss of epithelial polarity throughout the embryo. Collectively, our findings suggest a significantly higher requirement for Cdc42 function to stabilize AJs in the neuroectoderm as compared with other regions of the ectoderm.</p><p>The coincidence of neuroblast ingression and AJ breakdown in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos suggests that the ingression process itself causes the higher Cdc42 requirement. The ingression of epithelial cells requires dynamic AJs to maintain epithelial continuity. A majority of neuroectodermal cells undergo AJ disassembly and reformation as &#x0223c;30% of cells of the neuroectodermal epithelium ingress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997</xref>). In contrast, cell contacts remain constant in the dorsal ectoderm or the ventral midline cells during neurulation. To test for the possibility that the higher AJ turnover that results from neuroblast ingression requires higher Cdc42 activity, we suppressed neuroblast specification, and thus ingression, through the expression of a CA form of the Notch receptor (N<sup>intra</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieber et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebay et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Struhl et al., 1993</xref>). Notch signaling specifies epidermal progenitor fate and prevents specification of neuroblasts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campos-Ortega, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). Expression of N<sup>intra</sup> in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos effectively suppressed formation of ventral cuticle holes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, K and L</xref>) but not defects in head morphogenesis or dorsal closure (not depicted). Moreover, AJ integrity in the neuroectoderm of stage 11 embryos is dramatically improved in <italic>da&#x0003e;N<sup>intra</sup> da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos compared with <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 J</xref>). To control for the possibility that the introduction of a second UAS construct could suppress the <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> phenotype, we examined <italic>da&#x0003e;GFP da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos and found that they exhibit the same defects as <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 L</xref>). Together, our results suggest that the reformation of AJs that takes place as a result of neuroblast ingression requires high levels of Cdc42 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Cdc42-compromised neuroectodermal cells lose apical membrane&#x02013;associated proteins</title><p>To further characterize the neuroectodermal defects in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos, we examined additional molecular makers that highlight AJs and the apical and basolateral membrane of neuroectodermal cells.

The general loss of apical and AJ proteins is confined to the neuroectoderm, and only minor defects in the apical localization of these proteins were detected in the ventral midline cells or the dorsal ectoderm. Moreover, apical markers, similar to AJ proteins, showed a normal distribution in ventral epidermal cells that survive to later stages of development. In addition to the loss of apical and AJ proteins from the plasma membrane, we noticed that the apical transmembrane proteins Crb, Notch, Delta, and Cad87A but not the AJ proteins DEcad and Ed accumulated in prominent cytoplasmic puncta in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>; see following sections). These puncta were not confined to regions that had lost apical and AJ proteins from their plasma membrane and were seen throughout the ectoderm.

Cdc42 is found in a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm of all ectodermal epithelial cells. Cdc42 appears enriched at the plasma membrane, in particular the AJs, where it is also found in small puncta rather than uniformly distributed as suggested by the examination of deconvolved confocal z stacks (see Materials and methods).

Moreover, similar, abnormally large endosomes were seen at other stages of development such as cellularization, when no defects in epithelial polarity were apparent. We conclude that loss of Cdc42 function leads to the accumulation of apical transmembrane proteins in an abnormally enlarged endosomal compartment. Thus, Cdc42 function is required not only for preventing catastrophic loss of apical proteins in the neuroectoderm but also for the processing of apical proteins through the endocytotic pathway in all epithelia we examined.</p><p>To further support the hypothesis that Cdc42 activity negatively regulates apical endocytosis, we asked whether a reduction in endocytosis can ameliorate the phenotype of <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos and reconstitute apical protein localization in neuroectodermal cells. We coexpressed Rab5-DN with Cdc42-DN. Rab5 is a Rab GTPase critical for early steps in endocytosis, mediating the fusion of endocytotic vesicles with the early endosome. <italic>da&#x0003e;Rab5-DN</italic> embryos are lethal and displayed a defective cuticle, but no ventral holes were observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 G</xref>).

This, together with the observation that enlarged apical endosomes are seen in tissues that have not lost apical polarity, again suggests that Cdc42 acts independently in two steps of the apical endocytotic pathway: as a negative regulator of apical endocytosis and as a positive regulator of early to late endosomal processing.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of apical endocytosis rescues defects in Cdc42-compromised embryos.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Wild-type embryo (A), <italic>Cdc42-DN</italic> embryo (B), and embryo expressing both Cdc42-DN and Rab5-DN (C) labeled for DEcad.

This would imply that the endocytosis of apical proteins, which is counteracted by Rab5-DN, is the primary effect of the loss of Cdc42 function and that the failure to maintain AJs is secondary to the loss of apical polarity regulators such as Crb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>) or the Par proteins (see following section), which are known to control AJ assembly and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knust and Bossinger, 2002</xref>).

This representation underestimates the actual strength of the phenotypic enhancement, as only an estimated 50% of embryos evaluated for each genotype are double mutants, whereas the other 50% are <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos.

Apical proteins did not accumulate in the Rab11-positive recycling endosome in Cdc42-compromised embryos, suggesting that the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex could regulate entry into the recycling pathway but not the progression through this pathway back to the apical membrane. The suppression of Cdc42-DN&#x02013;induced loss of apical proteins by the coexpression of Rab5-DN is consistent with both an endocytotic or recycling defect given that this experiment does not allow us to determine whether the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex acts upstream or downstream of Rab5. However, the simplest explanation for the substantial increase in uptake of the endocytotic tracer FM4-64 in Cdc42-compromised neuroectodermal cells would be an increase in the frequency of endocytosis. A second aPKC target is likely associated with the Hrs-positive endosome, which marks the transition from early endosome to multivesicular body formation. Attractive candidates would be the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes that regulate multivesicular body formation. Defects in the function of these complexes can also lead to abnormally enlarged endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurley, 2008</xref>). It is remarkable that loss of Cdc42 and Par complex function causes the appearance of a single (on average), enlarged endosomal compartment per cell containing apical cargo.</p><p>Recently, the first evidence was published for the involvement of the Par complex in the regulation of endocytosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balklava et al. (2007)</xref> showed that the Par complex, similar to Cdc42, is required for effective endocytosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes and coelomocytes as well as human HeLa cells. This study identifies Cdc42 and Par proteins as positive regulators of endocytotic uptake of clathrin-dependent cargo or the recycling of clathrin-independent cargo. Cdc42 and Par proteins might act to stabilize apical proteins by promoting recycling. However, we did not detect colocalization of Cdc42 or apical proteins in either wild-type or <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos with the Rab11-positive apical recycling endosome, suggesting that the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex regulates surface uptake directly. This is also consistent with the reconstitution of apical proteins at the plasma membrane in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN da&#x0003e;Rab5-DN</italic> embryos. In addition to previous work, we show that the expression of an active form of aPKC suppressed the defects seen in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos, suggesting that the Par complex acts downstream and, thus, likely as an effector complex of Cdc42 in endocytosis similar to other aspects of cell polarization.</p><p>Cdc42 has been implicated as either a positive or negative regulator in several aspects of vesicle trafficking in both the biosynthetic or endocytotic/recycling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroschewski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">M&#x000fc;sch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wells et al., 2006</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerione, 2004</xref>), and Cdc42 can contribute to clathrin- and dynamin-dependent and -independent endocytotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balklava et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>). This diversity of Cdc42 requirements in vesicle trafficking suggests that its function is highly cell type and/or context dependent. Our work further extends the notion that Cdc42 has context-dependent functions, as we demonstrate that the highly dynamic AJs of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroectoderm are susceptible to reduced Cdc42 activity, whereas AJs in morphogenetically &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; regions of epithelia do not critically depend on normal levels of Cdc42 function. The rescue of neuroectodermal AJs in Cdc42-compromised embryos upon blocking neuroblast specification and ingression suggests that the essential role of Cdc42 in stabilizing AJs is not a general property of the neuroectoderm but a direct consequence of the breakdown and reformation of AJs upon neuroblast ingression. It remains to be seen whether Cdc42 becomes activated in response to cell rearrangement in the neuroectoderm or whether GTP-Cdc42 levels are uniform throughout the ectoderm, and an essential requirement for active Cdc42 only develops in response to cell rearrangement.</p><p>Cdc42 was reported to localize to the Golgi complex in mammalian cells, which is consistent with its function in Golgi to ER and Golgi to basolateral surface vesicle trafficking (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerione, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ridley, 2006</xref>). We did not find colocalization of Cdc42 as detected by Cdc42 antibodies or GFP-Cdc42 with Golgi markers or markers that label other components of the biosynthetic pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic epithelial cells. Moreover, Cdc42-compromised embryos did not accumulate apical or basolateral membrane proteins in the biosynthetic pathway, which is in contrast, for example, to embryos that lack exocyst function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blankenship et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we did not find any evidence for a function of Cdc42 in secretion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ectoderm. However, a minor defect in exocytosis such as a change in the kinetics of vesicle release from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">M&#x000fc;sch et al., 2001</xref>) may have been below our detection threshold. Alternatively, a role of Cdc42 in exocytosis may have not been detected because we did not study embryos that completely lacked Cdc42 function.</p><p>Cdc42 localizes to a population of small puncta throughout the cytoplasm and plasma membrane&#x02013;associated puncta that are enriched at the level of AJs. Expression of Cdc42-DN causes a relocalization of Cdc42; a more uniform labeling is observed along the lateral membrane, AJs, and marginal zone. In the cytoplasm, Cdc42 remains distributed in small puncta, which, however, now appear enriched in the apical cytoplasm, and Cdc42 is seen associated with an abnormally enlarged Hrs-positive (but Rab11, Rab5, Avl, and Rab7 negative) endosomal compartment. The N17 DN mutations of Rho and Ras GTPases are believed to have a higher affinity for guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) than the normal protein but remain GDP bound and thus inactive, suggesting that DN proteins such as Cdc42-DN act by binding and sequestering GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feig, 1999</xref>). A GEF that activates Cdc42 at the apical membrane or along the apical endocytotic pathway remains to be identified.</p><p>Several findings are consistent with the model that endocytotic regulation of apical proteins rather than endocytosis of AJ proteins is the immediate result of the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex function: (a) the fact that reduced Rab5 function rescues the loss of apical polarity observed in <italic>da&#x0003e;Cdc42-DN</italic> embryos, although Rab5 is essential for endocytosis of apical proteins but not AJ proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu and Bilder, 2005</xref>); (b) the tight association of Cdc42 effectors Par6 and aPKC with the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petronczki and Knoblich, 2001</xref>); and (c) the strong genetic interaction between Cdc42-DN and <italic>crb</italic> compared with the weak interactions between Cdc42-DN and <italic>shg</italic>. Thus, the loss of AJs in the neuroectoderm is presumably a secondary consequence of the loss of apical polarity proteins in Cdc42-compromised embryos. This model is also consistent with the observation that apical (e.g., Crb) and basolateral (e.g., DEcad or Ed) membrane protein follow different endocytotic routes. Despite the loss of DEcad and Ed from the membrane, these proteins are not detected in the abnormally enlarged Hrs-positive endosomes that accumulate apical proteins. Apical/tight junction proteins and basolateral/AJ proteins also take distinct endocytotic routes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macara and Spang, 2006</xref>). Independent regulatory mechanisms for apical and basolateral endocytosis may make important contributions to morphogenesis. For example, neuroblast ingression, a typical epithelial mesenchymal transition, requires the coordinated loss of apical polarity. This process may be initiated by a deactivation of Cdc42, which precipitates the rapid endocytosis of the apical membrane, including apical polarity proteins and a subsequent loss of AJs, most likely also through endocytosis.</p><p>A gradual loss of epithelial AJs is also observed in the ventricular zone of the mouse neuroepithelium mutant for <italic>Cdc42</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cappello et al., 2006</xref>). This remarkable similarity to the Cdc42-compromised <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroectoderm suggests that during mammalian neurogenesis, the movement of self-renewing progenitor cells from the ventricular zone epithelium to the subventricular zone also involves dynamic changes in AJs. The stability of these AJs and apical polarity likely depends on the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex function and, as a consequence, the maintenance of cells within the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cappello et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether the Cdc42&#x02013;Par complex&#x02013;dependent regulation of endocytosis contributes to the maintenance of the mammalian neuroepithelium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>The following stocks were used in this study: <italic>da-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wodarz et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>UAS-Cdc42.N17</italic>, <italic>UAS-Cdc42.V12</italic>, <italic>UAS-Rac1.N17</italic>, <italic>UAS-Rac1.V12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 1994</xref>), <italic>UAS-Rho1.N19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strutt et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>UAS-Rho1.V14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Cdc42<sup>3</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdc42<sup>6</sup></italic> (gift from R.
