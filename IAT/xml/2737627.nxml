Selected genes were confirmed by RT-PCR. As reported by other mesothelioma profiling studies, most of genes are involved in G2/M transition. Our list contains several genes previously described as prognostic classifier. Furthermore, we found novel genes, never associated before to mesotheliom that could be involved in tumour progression. Notable is the identification of MMP-14, a member of matrix metalloproteinase family. In a cohort of 70 mesothelioma patients, we found by a multivariate Cox regression analysis, that the only parameter influencing overall survival was expression of MMP14.

Epidemiological and clinical data show that there is an association between asbestos exposure and MM development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Mossman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, even if the exact mechanism whereby asbestos induces MM is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Hughes1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Spugnini1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Western countries delayed in applying prevention measures connected to the risk of asbestos and this will produce a global increase of MM in the next years. This pathology has a long latency but a very short survival; until now the small number of drugs used for MM therapeutic treatment, does not seem to provide any clear advantage if used in different combinations or as monotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Tomek1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The prognosis is generally poor with a reported median survival of 4 to 12 months in either untreated or treated patients. Moreover, the reported response rate to the different therapeutic protocols ranged from 10&#x00025; to 45&#x00025; with no clear advantage in terms of poor survival (4&#x02013;9 months). Currently, the trimodality approach - that employs extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by combination of chemoradiotherapy - is applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Sugarbaker1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Moreover, the combination of chemotherapy followed by surgery supplemented by postoperative radiotherapy in cases of incomplete resection, seems to be a promising treatment (Kaufman and Pass, 2008). Recent randomized studies on treatment of MM with combined chemotherapy demonstrate a survival benefit when a combination of cisplatin and antifolate drugs has been used (Fennell et al., 2008). A combined treatment, using the COX-inhibitors piroxicam with cisplatin, was recently tested in a murine orthotopic model of MM, showing an anti-tumour effects with survival increasing </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Spugnini2">&#x0005b;<italic>6</italic>&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Spugnini3">&#x0005b;<italic>7</italic>&#x0005d;</xref><italic>.

Indeed, the long incubation period of asbestos-related MM development, implies that the malignant transformation is related to different and multiple genetic changes. Microarray technology leads to perform transcriptomic analysis and correlates variations in the gene expression with cellular and physiological state; this is important because all processes determining variations in gene expression can give support to malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Vogelstein1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It is emerging that in MM the discovery of new diagnostic biomarkers is needed to achieve improved early diagnosis, in order to apply, in a selective way, multimodal therapy as in a pre-clinical stage or before definitive surgery.

Indeed, the role of these newly identified genes is being evaluated in further studies, aimed to analyze the protein expression pattern and the protein function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in MM cells.</p><p>In the second part of our manuscript, we focused our attention on the definition of putative biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in MM. Among genes involved in mesothelial cells tumour transformation we directed our attention to molecules present in the extra-cellular space and detectable in biofluids such as blood. These new molecules could be potentially used as early diagnostic MM markers to screen individuals previously exposed to asbestos. To this aim we focused our attention on MMP14. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper investigating MMP14 in MM. We found MMP14 to be widely expressed in all the samples analyzed, even if with different expression levels. Interestingly, high immunohistochemical expression of MMP14 was significantly correlated with poor survival. These observations strongly suggest that MMP14 plays a role in tumour progression in MM and could be a target for MM biological therapy. In particular, MMP14 could represent a putative target for a therapy based on specific MMP14 inhibitors. To consider MMP14 as drug target, detailed analysis of its inhibition effects in patients are needed. Treatment with MMP14 inhibitors is currently under investigation and preliminary experiments have been performed on <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Holmbeck1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, that showed multiple severe side effects probably related to secondary development defects and not to the protein deficiency. Thus, in order to consider MMP14 as anti-target, a more detailed MMP14 inhibition analysis in adults mice and in patients is needed. To this aim, high throughput proteomic techniques were recently applied to analyze in detail the effects on cells of a MMP14 inhibitor drug, in order to predict and possibly avoid side-effects of drug treatment in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007016-Butler1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies are urgently required both at molecular and clinical level to confirm these observations and to eventually propose MMP14 as a concrete target for therapy. Finally, in order to determine if the amount of cytoplasmic MMP14 reflects the amount that is secreted, it would be necessary to carry out prospective studies, analyzing the amount of MMP14 in the extra-cellular space of MM patients. These studies are necessary in order to eventually consider MMP-14 a biomarker for MM.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>MM is a rare, highly aggressive tumour related to asbestos exposure that develops after long time latency, with a very short survival after diagnosis. Since cancer therapies are more effective if used in the initial stages we analyzed MM to identify early biomarker that could be used to diagnose it in advance. Using microarray technology, we analyzed MM and normal pleural samples identifying new genes involved in tumour progression, focusing our attention on the identification of putative biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in MM. To this aim we analyzed the differentially expressed genes, looking for potential biomarkers specific for MM by identification of molecules both linked to cancer and respiratory disease, and also potentially detectable in specific body fluids such as blood or plasma.</p><p>We directed our attention to molecules present in the extra-cellular space, because these molecules could be used as early diagnostic MM markers to screen individuals previously exposed to asbestos. In particular, we found MMP-14 a member of the metalloproteinase family that mediates homeostasis of the extra-cellular environment. The protein mediates the breakdown of extra-cellular matrix a process needed for basement-membrane penetration during metastasis and its over-expression has been associated with many different tumours.</p><p>We found that expression of MMP-14 has a prognostic value in a group of MM patients showing that high immunohistochemical expression of MMP14 was significantly correlated with poor survival.</p><p>A prospective trial is undergoing in order to confirm the prognostic value of MMP-14 expression in MM patients. Finally, to better determine the role of MMP-14 as MM biomarker, our research group is actually working on the identification of MMP14 in the blood of MM patients. Our preliminary data show that this protein is, indeed, detectable in the peripheral blood of several MM patients, while it is not revealed in healthy controls (data not shown). Molecular analyses of MM are becoming crucial for the tumour comprehension next step that is the identification of molecules that can be used not only for prognostic purposes but to diagnose MM in a very early stage before surgery. The identification of such tumour biomarkers might in dept greatly facilitate surveillance procedures for all the cohorts of patients exposed to asbestos that will be expected increasing in the next 10&#x02013;15 years.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007016.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Differentially expressed genes in mesothelioma.
