PPAR-&#x003b3; can be activated by several endogenous lipid ligands and is a known target of the antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Thiazolidinediones are known for their lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing actions and are currently used to manage obesity-linked insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Although the molecular mechanism of action of thiazolidinedione/PPAR-&#x003b3; ligands on glucose and lipid metabolism is not fully understood, their ability to increase plasma levels of adiponectin, an adipose-specific secretory protein, is thought to be involved in their metabolic and insulin-sensitizing actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Adiponectin circulates as both a hexamer and a high&#x02013;molecular weight oligomer. The latter complex form mediates the effects of thiazolidinediones on insulin sensitivity, particularly on hepatic glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The insulin-sensitizing activity of adiponectin appears to involve the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>), a metabolic sensor that has been reported to alleviate obesity-driven insulin resistance through metabolic and gene expression effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><p>Anti-inflammatory mechanisms may also contribute to the beneficial action of PPAR-&#x003b3; activation on insulin sensitivity. Obesity is a state of abnormal inflammatory response, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are thought to promote insulin resistance in key metabolic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Activation of PPAR-&#x003b3; opposes the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), and negatively interferes with cytokine-inducible transcriptional pathways (e.g., nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B &#x0005b;NF-&#x003ba;B&#x0005d;, signal transducer and activator of transcription &#x0005b;STAT&#x0005d;, and activator protein 1 &#x0005b;AP-1&#x0005d;) in adipocytes, macrophages, and other vascular wall cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Thiazolidinediones inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS), a key inflammatory mediator in several cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). iNOS expression is increased in insulin-target tissues and pancreatic islets of animal models of dietary and genetic obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). We have previously reported that proinflammatory cytokines and the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce iNOS expression and marked NO production in L6 myocytes and isolated rat skeletal muscles, leading to defective insulin stimulation of glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). A key role for iNOS in the pathogenesis of obesity-linked insulin resistance is supported by our previous observations that targeted disruption of iNOS protects against muscle insulin resistance and improves whole-body insulin action in high-fat&#x02013;fed obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). More recently, iNOS disruption was also found to protect against the adverse effects of high-fat feeding on vascular insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>) and to reduce insulin resistance in genetically obese <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). Furthermore, iNOS is induced in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of type 2 diabetic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>) where its expression correlates with the occurrence of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p><p>Whereas thiazolidinedione-mediated PPAR-&#x003b3; activation reduces iNOS expression in several tissues, there is also evidence suggesting that activation of the iNOS/NO pathway can blunt PPAR-&#x003b3; activation. Shibuya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>) have shown that peroxynitrite, an oxidative NO derivative, inhibits ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of PPAR-&#x003b3; in macrophages, possibly through peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of PPAR-&#x003b3;. This suggests that the iNOS/NO pathway modulates PPAR-&#x003b3; activity, at least in myeloid cells. However, the potential role of the iNOS/NO pathway in the modulation of thiazolidinedione/PPAR-&#x003b3; action in key insulin-target tissues of an animal model of obesity and iNOS induction has not yet been investigated. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that iNOS modulates PPAR-&#x003b3; activity in insulin-target tissues by investigating the metabolic and glucoregulatory effects of the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone in both wild-type and iNOS-deficient obese mice. The results identify iNOS as a critical modulator of thiazolidinedione actions in obesity.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies.</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against P-Ser473 Akt, P-Ser79 acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and P-Thr172-AMPK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and were used at a 1:500, 1:1,000, and 1:1,000 dilution, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal iNOS, p85, and IRS-2 antibodies and rabbit monoclonal P-Ser82-PPAR-&#x003b3; antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and were used at a 1:500, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, and 1:1,000 dilution, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal adiponectin antibody was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Mouse monoclonal PPAR-&#x003b3; and P-Tyr (PY20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at a 1:1,000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit anti-RFP antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) was used at 1:10,000. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare (Baie d'Urf&#x000e9;, Quebec, Canada) and used at a 1:10,000 dilution.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and treatment.</title><p>This study was approved by the Animal Care and Handling Committee of Laval University. Breeding pairs of iNOS wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) and iNOS knockout mice (C57BL/6-NOS2<sup>tm1Lau</sup>) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Four-week-old mice were fed either a ground autoclaved standard chow diet (Sterilizable Global Rodent; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or an irradiated high-fat diet (55&#x00025; of calories derived from fat) (Mouse 9F; Test Diet, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 18 weeks. Half of the mice in each dietary cohort were then randomly assigned to a 15-day treatment with rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg diet as a food admixture; Avandia; GlaxoSmithKline), corresponding to 0.1 mg &#x000b7; mouse<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. This dose of rosiglitazone is relatively low compared with most studies (0.4&#x02013;3 mg/day) because it was designed to test for potential sensitization of rosiglitazone effects by iNOS gene disruption.</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose and insulin tolerance test.</title><p>Twelve days after the beginning of rosiglitazone treatment, mice were fasted at 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> for 5 h and were injected with 1 g/kg i.p. glucose or 1.5 units/kg i.p. regular human insulin (Humulin R; Lilly). Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at time 0 (before injection), 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after glucose or insulin injection, and blood glucose level was estimated with an Elite glucometer (Bayer, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada).</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect calorimetry and body composition determinations.</title><p>Randomly selected mice of each group (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6 per group) in a subset were individually monitored to determine oxygen consumption (<italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (<italic>V</italic>c<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>), and the respiratory quotient by indirect calorimetry. Mice were initially placed in their individual metabolic cage for 2 days before the beginning of the experiment. Measurements were made continuously during the following 2 days (36 measurements &#x000b7; mouse<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in an open circuit system with an oxygen analyzer (S-3A1; Applied Electrochemistry) and a carbon dioxide analyzer (CD-3A; Applied Electrochemistry). Data presented are the average of all measurements made over 2 days of monitoring. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (Piximus; Lunar, Madison, WI) was used to measure total fat and lean masses in mice anesthetized with isoflurane.</p></sec><sec><title>Acute insulin injection and death.</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood sampling (150&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;l) from the orbital sinus was performed for later plasma analysis. An acute injection of 3.8 units/kg i.v. insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) was then performed in the tail vein, and mice were killed by decapitation 4 min after injection. Tissues were then rapidly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Blood was collected and centrifuged at 3,000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C to isolate plasma.

Briefly, islets were distributed in batches of 10 with four replicates for each condition per genotype. Islets were washed and preincubated for 45 min at 37&#x000b0;C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mmol/l HEPES (KRBH, pH 7.4) with 0.5&#x00025; defatted BSA (Sigma) and 3 mmol/l glucose. The islets were then incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C in KRBH containing 3, 8, or 16 mmol/l glucose and 0.5&#x00025; BSA. Some experiments were also performed in the absence or presence of 0.4 mmol/l palmitate during the incubation. At the end of the incubation, media were withdrawn for insulin determination, and islets were harvested for assessment of total insulin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Adipose tissue histology.</title><p>Tissues were fixed in 10&#x00025; buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Multiple 10-&#x003bc;m sections were obtained from epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Images were acquired using a BX60 microscope (Olympus, NY) and an RT slider 2.3.0 camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Heights, MI) and were analyzed using SPOT 4.0.2 software. For each group (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), at least four fields, representing 300 adipocytes per slide, were analyzed, and the geometric mean of adipocyte diameter was calculated to estimate adipocyte mass.

One milligram of proteins was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with 2 &#x003bc;g PY20. Immune complexes were washed three times with PBS containing 1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40, 10 mmol/l NaF, 2 mmol/l Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and protease inhibitors. For Western blot analysis, 10&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g crude protein lysates or immune complexes were solubilized in sample buffer, loaded on a 7.5&#x00025; acrylamide gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).

Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with sodium nitroprusside (Sigma) or peroxynitrite (Upstate) for 24 h.

Cell lysates were used for determination of PPAR-&#x003b3; expression and Ser-82 phosphorylation. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and 10 &#x003bc;l was analyzed for PPAR-&#x003b3;-specific transcription factor binding activity as described by the manufacturer (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). In brief, nuclear extracts were loaded on a 96-well plate coated with a double-stranded DNA sequence containing the peroxisome proliferator response element. After 16-h incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, the plates were washed, and a primary antibody directed against PPAR-&#x003b3; was added for 1 h at room temperature. A secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to provide a sensitive colorometric readout at 450 nm. The results were corrected for total protein content in 10 &#x003bc;l nuclear extract. HEK293T cells were provided by Dr. J.

Except for basal physiological parameters, only data from the high-fat diet cohorts and the chow-fed untreated iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> group (used as a reference) are shown in the figures, because iNOS gene disruption and rosiglitazone treatments had only marginal effects in the chow-fed groups. The main effect of diet on all parameters were analyzed by a 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial ANOVA test. The main and interactive effects of genotype (iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>, iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and treatment (untreated, rosiglitazone) were analyzed separately for each dietary cohort by a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial ANOVA test. All parameters of each dietary cohort were also analyzed separately by ANOVA.

At the low dose used, rosiglitazone treatment of obese iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice improved ACC phosphorylation in WAT but not in muscle and liver. However, the thiazolidinedione markedly improved ACC phosphorylation in muscle, liver, and WAT of mice lacking iNOS. Interestingly, the enhanced ACC phosphorylation in both liver and fat (but not in muscle) was at least partly accounted for by an increased expression of ACC, especially in iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tissues. This effect of rosiglitazone to increase ACC protein levels has been recently reported in adipose tissue of high-fat&#x02013;fed rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Because AMPK activation switches on catabolic pathways and increases energy expenditure, we next determined whether enhanced activation of this pathway in rosiglitazone-treated obese iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> led to increased whole-body energy expenditure as measured by indirect calorimetry. As depicted in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>, total energy expenditure was similar in untreated obese iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and obese iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

This genotype effect was not observed in the high-fat&#x02013;fed mice. We also assessed PPAR-&#x003b3; phosphorylation on Ser-82/112, which is associated with decreased transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). We found that PPAR-&#x003b3; phosphorylation on Ser-82/112, corrected for the PPAR-&#x003b3; protein abundance in the sample, was significantly reduced in adipose tissue of both chow- and high-fat&#x02013;fed iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> counterparts. This effect was similar for PPAR-&#x003b3;1 (Ser-82) and PPAR-&#x003b3;2 (Ser-112) isoforms, which are both expressed in adipose tissue. This suggests that lack of iNOS increases PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity in adipose tissue. To more directly test this hypothesis, we next determined the effect of NO on PPAR-&#x003b3; in cultured adipocytes. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside for 24 h, and PPAR-&#x003b3; expression and phosphorylation were assessed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). These experiments revealed that sodium nitroprusside reduces the expression of PPAR-&#x003b3; (both &#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2 isoforms). Furthermore, the ratio of Ser-82/112 phosphorylated PPAR-&#x003b3; over total PPAR-&#x003b3; protein was increased, suggesting that sodium nitroprusside blunts PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity both by lowering its expression and increasing its inhibitory phosphorylation. Interestingly, these effects were not observed on exposing cells to the NO derivative peroxynitrite. To more directly test whether NO inhibits PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity, we prepared nuclear extracts from these cells to assess PPAR-&#x003b3; transcription factor binding (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). We also transfected HEK293T cells with a PPAR-&#x003b3; reporter (pGL3-PPRE) and looked at its troglitazone-induced activity after treatment with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside or peroxynitrite (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). These experiments revealed that sodium nitroprusside causes a dose-dependent inhibition of both PPAR-&#x003b3; binding and thiazolidinedione-induced activity, confirming that NO but not peroxynitrite blunts PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity in adipocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists, such as thiazolidinediones, are known for their antidiabetic and insulin-sensitizing properties. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are two clinically approved thiazolidinediones for the management of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, but some side effects are associated with their use. Treatment with thiazolidinediones is usually correlated with increased body weight gain due to differentiation of fat cells and fluid retention caused by accelerated sodium absorption by the collecting duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Thiazolidinedione treatment has also been recently associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). This prompts the elaboration of new PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists and the search for novel PPAR-&#x003b3; regulatory pathways. Here, we show that the iNOS/NO pathway is a novel and critical modulator of thiazolidinedione/PPAR-&#x003b3; action in an animal model of obesity.</p><p>To demonstrate the involvement of the iNOS/NO pathway in thiazolidinedione action in vivo, we compared the action of a low dose of rosiglitazone on several glucoregulatory and metabolic parameters in wild-type and iNOS knockout mice rendered obese by feeding a high-fat diet. A relatively low dose of rosiglitazone (0.1 vs. 0.4&#x02013;3 mg/day in most studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>&#x0005d;) and a short duration of treatment were used to better appreciate the effect of the absence of iNOS on the metabolic actions of thiazolidinedione. We found that this low dose of rosiglitazone improves insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling in muscle but failed to improve glucose tolerance and liver insulin signaling in wild-type obese mice. This is consistent with previous observations showing that muscle insulin sensitivity is rapidly improved by thiazolidinediones, whereas a longer duration of treatment is generally required to improve insulin action in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Recent studies using tissue-specific disruption of PPAR-&#x003b3; have dissected out the contribution of the principal PPAR-&#x003b3;-expressing tissues to action of thiazolidinedione. Muscle PPAR-&#x003b3; plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic insulin sensitivity and in mediating thiazolidinedione action in muscle but not in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). In contrast, liver PPAR-&#x003b3; expression is not required for thiazolidinedione action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), but studies using A-Zip mice lacking adipose tissue showed thiazolidinedione resistance in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that the beneficial effects of thiazolidinedione on the liver are most likely mediated by adipose tissue, which predominantly expresses PPAR-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). In agreement with these observations, the lack of significant effect of a low dose of rosiglitazone on liver insulin signaling and glucose tolerance in the present study was associated with failure of the thiazolidinedione to change adipose tissue morphology. In sharp contrast, iNOS disruption was found to sensitize obese mice to the action of rosiglitazone on glucose tolerance and liver insulin action without any further effect in muscle. This genotype-specific action of thiazolidinedione was linked to fat remodeling in iNOS-deficient mice as revealed by increased adipose tissue cellularity, an established indicator of adipose PPAR-&#x003b3; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists increase total plasma adiponectin levels by two- to threefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Adiponectin is thought to be the principal mediator of the insulin-sensitizing action of PPAR-&#x003b3;. Transgene-induced overexpression of adiponectin, which raises the secretion of the adipokine in its native oligomeric form by threefold, was found to induce effects similar to those of a chronic treatment with PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). More direct evidence for the role of adiponectin in thiazolidinedione action was recently provided using adiponectin-null mice. The ability of rosiglitazone to improve glucose tolerance in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice lacking adiponectin is markedly diminished. Furthermore, rosiglitazone failed to activate AMPK in tissues of adiponectin-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the high&#x02013;molecular weight complex structure of adiponectin is key to its insulin-sensitizing action, particularly in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). These studies showed that only high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin can reduce blood glucose levels when injected into adiponectin-deficient mice. Consistent with these observations, only mice lacking iNOS, which showed a marked elevation in plasma high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin levels, exhibited improved glucose tolerance and liver insulin action in response to rosiglitazone, confirming the high sensitivity of the liver to changes in high&#x02013;molecular weight form concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Adipose tissue remodeling caused by rosiglitazone treatment of iNOS knockout mice likely explains the raised plasma high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin complexes in these animals because previous studies reported a strong inverse relationship between adipose cell size and adiponectin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>).</p><p>Rosiglitazone treatment increased AMPK activity in fat but not in muscle and liver of wild-type obese mice, even though the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist induced a threefold increase in plasma adiponectin levels. At first sight, this may appear surprising because activation of AMPK by adiponectin is thought to be involved in its glucose metabolic and insulin-sensitizing actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). However, this may be explained by the failure of rosiglitazone to raise plasma adiponectin in its high&#x02013;molecular weight form in wild-type obese mice. Kobayashi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>) showed that only the high&#x02013;molecular weight complex of adiponectin can activate AMPK in endothelial cells. The lack of effect of rosiglitazone on high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin secretion could be linked to iNOS induction in these animals (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We propose that in iNOS-deficient obese mice, the effects of rosiglitazone on high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin secretion and AMPK activation are unopposed by iNOS-derived NO, resulting in improved metabolic actions, as reflected by enhanced energy expenditure and decreased levels of plasma triglycerides. The finding of unaltered respiratory quotient values among the high-fat&#x02013;fed obese iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> groups probably reflects the fact that both fat and glucose oxidation are expected to be increased on marked activation of AMPK in rosiglitazone-treated iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Hence, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that induction of the iNOS/NO pathway in adipose tissue of obese mice contributes to deteriorating hepatic insulin action and glucose tolerance by interfering with the ability of rosiglitazone to increase plasma high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin and liver AMPK activation.</p><p>We further explored whether the iNOS/NO pathway blunts the action of thiazolidinedione by interfering with PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation of PPAR-&#x003b3; on Ser-82/112 is known to suppress its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Inhibitory phosphorylation of both PPAR-&#x003b3; isoforms on Ser-82/112 was reduced in adipose tissue of iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, whereas treatment of adipocytes with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside enhanced PPAR-&#x003b3; Ser-82/112 phosphorylation and blunted thiazolidinedione-induced PPAR-&#x003b3; reporter activity, consistent with the hypothesis that iNOS-derived NO represses PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity. Our data further suggest that iNOS represses adipose PPAR-&#x003b3; expression. This finding was not observed in high-fat&#x02013;fed obese mice lacking iNOS, suggesting that other factors than NO may repress PPAR-&#x003b3; in adipose tissue of these obese mice.</p><p>NO exerts its action in part by inducing posttranslational modifications of specific amino acid residues within target proteins. <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation of cysteine residues within signaling proteins occurs in physiological conditions, whereas tyrosine nitration is typically associated with increased generation of the NO derivative peroxynitrite in oxidative stress&#x02013;related diseases. Shibuya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>) previously reported that treatment of macrophages with inflammatory cytokines, LPS, or peroxynitrite increased tyrosine nitration of PPAR-&#x003b3;, resulting in impaired ligand-dependent nuclear translocation. However, peroxynitrite failed to reduce PPAR-&#x003b3; transcriptional activity in our adipocyte studies, suggesting that PPAR-&#x003b3; regulation may be differently controlled in adipose versus myeloid cells. Further studies will be required to identify the mechanism(s) by which NO suppresses PPAR-&#x003b3; activity.</p><p>We have reported that iNOS induction is repressed after AMPK activation by PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). The present study confirms that this inhibitory effect of PPAR-&#x003b3; on iNOS induction also occurs in fat tissue of thiazolidinedione-treated obese mice. We hypothesize that the inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone treatment on iNOS induction may be linked to its ability to raise adiponectin levels because the adipokine suppresses cytokine production and NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation by activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>). However, we found that rosiglitazone treatment of wild-type mice, despite raising adiponectin levels, failed to reduce IL-6 and in fact slightly increased TNF-&#x003b1; levels in adipose tissue. This intriguing effect of rosiglitazone has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>). Interestingly, rosiglitazone failed to increase adipose TNF-&#x003b1; levels in iNOS-deficient mice, possibly because the drug further raised plasma adiponectin concentrations, particularly in its high&#x02013;molecular weight form, thus blunting rosiglitazone effect on TNF-&#x003b1; in the latter genotype. Thus, iNOS inhibition by PPAR-&#x003b3; activation is a key anti-inflammatory mechanism that likely contributes to the beneficial effects of thiazolidinedione in obese mice. This is exemplified by our data in iNOS-deficient mice where complete lack of iNOS was found to markedly sensitize PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism in WAT, as reflected by adipose tissue histology and adiponectin secretion, particularly in its high&#x02013;molecular weight form.</p><p>Taken together, our results allow the design of a model that integrates the metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects of thiazolidinedione in obesity, emphasizing the roles of PPAR-&#x003b3;, iNOS, adiponectin, and AMPK (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). iNOS is induced in obesity, which leads to the development of inflammation-mediated insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) and reduced action of PPAR-&#x003b3; ligands in adipose tissue. The latter results in reduced adiponectin secretion, particularly in its high&#x02013;molecular weight form, and limited activation of AMPK and tissue insulin signaling, particularly in the liver. Thiazolidinedione increase muscle insulin action by directly targeting muscle PPAR-&#x003b3;. Lack of iNOS improved insulin sensitivity in muscle but had no effect on the liver, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). However, iNOS disruption sensitizes adipose tissue to PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism, thus raising plasma high&#x02013;molecular weight adiponectin levels. This leads to increased AMPK activation in the liver and improvement of hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese iNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>The present results have potential clinical relevance. iNOS might represent a promising therapeutic target to increase PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism in obese insulin-resistant subjects, reducing the effective doses of thiazolidinediones for improving glucose tolerance. By increasing the efficacy of thiazolidinediones, iNOS inhibitors might limit the side effects of these drugs on the renal and cardiovascular systems. It has been reported that the endothelial hyperpermeability response to rosiglitazone was most pronounced at concentrations of the thiazolidinedione (10&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;mol/l) that correspond to the upper range of therapeutic plasma drug concentrations in routine clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>). Thus, combination therapy with a low dose of thiazolidinedione and iNOS inhibitors may represent a promising avenue for the treatment of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-0540_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-0540_SuppFigs.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>P.D. has received a studentship from the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
