Accumulation of Irga6 on the <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasitophorous vacuole membrane is associated with vesiculation and ultimately disruption of the vacuolar membrane in a process that requires an intact GTP-binding domain. The role of the GTP-binding domain of Irga6 in pathogen resistance is, however, unclear. We provide evidence that Irga6 in interferon-induced, uninfected cells is predominantly in a GDP-bound state that is maintained by other interferon-induced proteins. However, Irga6 that accumulates on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane after Toxoplasma infection is in the GTP-bound form. We demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody, 10D7, specifically detects GTP-bound Irga6, and we show that the formation of the 10D7 epitope follows from a GTP-dependent conformational transition of the N terminus of Irga6, anticipating an important role of the myristoyl group on Irga6 function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This study was supported by <grant-sponsor>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>SPP1110</grant-num>, <grant-num>SFB635</grant-num>, and <grant-num>SFB670</grant-num> and by the <grant-sponsor>University of Cologne</grant-sponsor>.

For several classes of GTPase, such as the Ras family of small GTPases, the G-proteins coupled to seven-transmembrane receptors, and the translation initiation and elongation factors, the molecular mechanisms by which the GTP cycle is controlled are known in considerable detail, and the biological contexts in which the activity cycles of the proteins function are well understood. All of these proteins function in cyclical processes in cells where the binding of GTP by a GTPase initiates a conformational change that drives a forward step in the cycle, whereas the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP terminates the forward activity and reverts the GTPase to its inactive ground state. There has been considerable recent interest in the function of several anomalous large GTPase families active in cell-autonomous immune resistance. However, no systematic study of the role of the GTP binding and hydrolysis cycle has been undertaken in order to define the functions of these proteins in biological processes associated with active pathogen resistance. In this paper, we have made some progress toward defining components of the activity cycle <italic>in vivo</italic> of Irga6, an interferon-inducible 47-kDa GTPase of the IRG family in mice.</p><p>IRG<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">3</xref> proteins are 47-kDa, interferon-inducible GTPases intimately involved in disease resistance against intracellular parasites in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Some biochemical parameters and the crystal structure of one member of the family, Irga6 (formerly IIGP1), have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Irga6 possesses a Ras-like GTP-binding domain slung between two helical modules of unknown function. The N terminus carries a myristoylation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) that is active <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The nonmyristoylated protein purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has affinities in the micromolar range for GDP (&#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and for GTP (&#x0223c;15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and a low basal turnover rate from GTP to GDP of less than 0.1/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Like many anomalous large GTPases, Irga6 shows cooperativity in specific turnover rate, with a maximum of &#x0223c;2.0/min. Cooperativity of Irga6 is also reflected in a tendency to form oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic> upon the addition of GTP that resolve upon hydrolysis of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>The mode of action of IRG proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> is not well understood. After induction by interferons, IRG proteins including Irga6 are expressed at high levels in all cell types analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Irga6 is &#x0223c;60% associated with the ER membrane and 40% freely cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Within a few minutes after infection by the protozoan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, cytoplasmic Irga6 accumulates on the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole (PVM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">4</xref> Within 1-2 h, the PVM becomes vesiculated and ultimately disrupts, the parasite is exposed to the cytosol, and parasite replication is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). This succession of events is blocked if an interferon-stimulated infected cell is also expressing what we have previously described as a &#x0201c;functionally dominant negative&#x0201d; mutant of Irga6, Irga6-K82A, demonstrating that the cell-autonomous resistance process is dependent on the function of IRG proteins and suggesting the importance of GTP binding and hydrolysis in the biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Next to nothing is known about the role of the GTPase function of the IRG proteins in pathogen resistance. In an early experiment, evidence was presented that another IRG protein, Irgm3 (formerly IGTP), isolated by immunoprecipitation from interferon-stimulated cells, co-purified with bound GTP, and the authors suggested that, unusually for a GTPase, Irgm3 exists in interferon-induced cells constitutively in the GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). It has so far not proved possible to effect a biochemical purification of Irgm3, so the kinetic parameters of this member of the IRG family, either as a guanylate binding protein or as a GTPase, are not known.</p><p>In this report, we have begun an analysis of the nucleotide-bound state of Irga6 <italic>in vivo</italic> in uninfected and infected cells. Our experiments strongly suggest that the resting state of Irga6 in the IFN-induced but uninfected cell is GDP-bound, whereas the Irga6 that accumulates on the PVM after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is in the GTP-bound state. Furthermore, our data suggest that the GDP-bound state of Irga6 in uninfected cells is actively maintained by a further interferon-inducible protein or proteins. We have shown elsewhere that this regulation is an active property of certain IRG proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). These results thus suggest that the resistance properties of Irga6 will prove to be properties of the GTP-bound, active state of the protein at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. During the course of these studies, we demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody can detect the GTP-bound state of Irga6 with high specificity, and we show that the target epitope of this reagent is subject to conformational influences both from local structural elements and distantly from the nucleotide binding site.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Expression Constructs</italic>&#x02014;The pGW1H-Irga6cTag1 construct was generated by amplification of the Irga6cTag1 sequence from pGEX-4T-2-Irga6cTag1 (former pGEX-4T-2-IIGP-m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) by using Irga6cTag1 forward (5&#x02032;-cccccccccgtcgaccaccatgggtcagctgttctcttcacctaag-3&#x02032;) and reverse (5&#x02032;-cccccccccgtcgactcagtcacgatgcggccgctcgagtcggcctag-3&#x02032;) primers and cloned into pGW1H vector (British Biotech) by SalI digestion.

Upon infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, however, Irga6 is rapidly recruited to the PVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In IFN&#x003b3;-induced mouse fibroblasts, we compared by indirect immunofluorescence the intracellular binding behavior of two IgG1 monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant Irga6. Antibody 10E7 showed strong fine reticular staining typical of ER-localized IFN&#x003b3;-induced Irga6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), whereas cytoplasmic Irga6 was scarcely detectable with antibody 10D7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, 10D7 and 10E7 gave equally strong signals for Irga6 on the PVM of infecting <italic>T. gondii</italic> organisms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>arrowheads</italic>). We sought to distinguish between two alternative explanations for these results. Either 10D7 specifically recognized a determinant exposed only on the Irga6 bound to the PVM, or 10D7 was a low affinity antibody that could bind bivalently and hence stably to the concentrated, immobilized Irga6 at the PVM but not to the distributed Irga6 in the cytoplasmic pool. We therefore prepared monovalent Fab fragments of 10D7 by papain digestion. Since monovalent Fab fragments are unable to bind bivalently, they should bind equally, whether weakly or strongly, to distributed and aggregated targets. Following papain digestion, monovalent fragments were separated from residual bivalent material by size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>, and supplemental Fig. 1). The binding activities of two fractions (B8 and B15, apparent molecular weights of 55,000 and 45,000, respectively) were compared by dilution in a Western blot against bacterially purified Irga6 protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The titer of the later eluting fraction (B15) was higher than that of the earlier eluting fraction (B8), showing that the activity detected was not derived from trailing of residual bivalent material down the column. This result already indicated that monovalent 10D7 Fab fragment (fraction B15) has an affinity for Irga6 on a Western blot comparable with that of the native 10D7. It did not, however, prove that the monovalent affinity of 10D7 for Irga6 at the PVM is also high. We therefore examined the binding of Fab fragments from 10D7 to Irga6 accumulated on the <italic>T. gondii</italic> PVM in interferon-induced cells. The fragments were detected with a fluorescent conjugate of an anti-mouse &#x003ba; light chain second stage reagent and the intensities of 10D7 Fab and the bivalent native 10D7 antibody signals examined at constant exposure times. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref> shows that strong signals were detected at the PVM from both 10D7 Fab and intact 10D7, and the exposure times required for equivalent signal strength were essentially identical. Thus, 10D7 binds with high affinity to Irga6 at the PVM because Irga6 in this site adopts a conformation distinct from that present in the distributed cytoplasmic pool. Subsequent experiments were dedicated to showing that the two distinct <italic>in vivo</italic> conformations represent GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, respectively.</p><p><italic>The Formation of Irga6 Oligomers in Vivo</italic>&#x02014;Since purified Irga6 forms enzymatically active oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), we were interested to find out whether such oligomers could be detected in the uninfected, interferon-induced cell. To this end, we transfected IFN&#x003b3;-induced fibroblasts expressing wild-type Irga6 with an Irga6 construct modified at the C terminus with an 11-residue peptide tag, cTag1 (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;), which causes a detectable size shift in SDS-PAGE. Twenty-four hours after transfection and interferon induction, Irga6cTag1 was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of the cells, and the product was resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot for Irga6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). In the absence of added nucleotides, no co-precipitated wild-type Irga6 could be detected (<italic>lane 1</italic>); thus, there is no stable Irga6-Irga6 association in IFN&#x003b3;-induced cells. The addition of GDP or GTP to the lysate also failed to permit detectable coprecipitation of native Irga6 (<italic>lanes 2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>), but in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP&#x003b3;S (<italic>lane 6</italic>), native Irga6 was strongly co-precipitated. These results suggested the possibility that Irga6cTag1 may indeed occur in cells in GTP-dependent oligomers with native Irga6 but that these rapidly hydrolyze GTP and dissociate again. However, the addition of nucleotides to the lysis risks the formation of artifactual postlysis oligomerization, and the results may not reflect the situation in the cell before lysis. It was shown earlier that the addition of AlFx and GTP to bacterially purified Irga6 <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in the formation of irreversibly locked oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The affinity of Irga6 for GDP is not altered by the presence of AlFx,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">5</xref> and the addition of GDP and AlFx to Irga6 does not cause oligomerization. Thus, the AlFx binding site is accessible only during the catalytic step immediately after cleavage of the &#x003b3;-phosphate from GTP. AlFx is cell-permeant and therefore able to trap active Irga6 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the addition of both AlFx and GTP during the immunoprecipitation procedure resulted in the co-precipitation of a significant amount of native Irga6 (<italic>lane 5</italic>), preincubation of the cells in AlFx before lysis failed to trap any mixed oligomers containing native Irga6 (<italic>lane 4</italic>). This result suggested, first, that no active, GTP-dependent oligomers are present in the uninfected, interferon-induced cells, and, second, that the complexes that were co-precipitated following the addition of nucleotides and AlFx to the lysate may have been formed postlysis. Proof that all of the mixed oligomers detected in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> were indeed formed postlysis during the immunoprecipitation procedure itself was provided by the results of the experiment shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>. Two separate cell populations were mixed at the time of lysis, one interferon-induced and the other transfected with Irga6cTag1. The mixed lysate was then immunoprecipitated for Irga6cTag1 in the presence of various nucleotides and AlFx (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic>,(<italic>i</italic>) + (<italic>t</italic>)</xref>) and compared with similar immunoprecipitates from the lysate of a single cell population that was both IFN&#x003b3;-induced and transfected with Irga6cTag1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic>,(<italic>i</italic> + <italic>t</italic>)</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref> shows that the addition of GTP&#x003b3;S or GTP + AlFx (<italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>) to the mixed lysates ((<italic>i</italic>) + (<italic>t</italic>)) resulted in strong co-precipitation of the native Irga6, quantitatively equivalent to the co-precipitates found in transfected and IFN&#x003b3;-induced ((<italic>i</italic> + <italic>t</italic>)) cells. In summary, the results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, taken together provide strong evidence that Irga6 expressed in IFN&#x003b3;-induced cells is not present in the form of GTP-dependent oligomers of any size, including dimers.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>10D7 is a high affinity antibody.</bold> Papain-cleaved 10D7 antibody was separated on a Superdex 75 column.

The possibility that these aggregates represented GTP-dependent oligomers was tested directly by co-immunoprecipitation from uninduced cells transfected simultaneously with both native Irga6 and Irga6cTag1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).

Since the AlFx binding site is inaccessible on GDP-bound Irga6, these results show that in the absence of other IFN&#x003b3;-induced proteins intracellular Irga6 exists at least partially in hydrolytically active, GTP-containing oligomers, which can be stabilized by AlFx in the living cell. These experiments showed that Irga6 can exist in two alternative states <italic>in vivo</italic>, namely monodispersed hydrolytically inert in the IFN-induced cell or assembled in GTP-dependent hydrolytically active oligomers in the transfected, uninduced cell.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>In uninfected cells, Irga6 forms GTP-dependent oligomers only in the absence of IFN</bold>&#x003b3;.

Figs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>A</italic></xref> show that 10D7 indeed binds as strongly to Irga6 aggregates in transfected cells as does the indiscriminate monoclonal antibody, 10E7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), or the anti-cTag1-specific serum 2600 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Thus, the Irga6 conformation recognized by 10D7 is the GTP-dependent, hydrolytically active conformation, implying that Irga6 detected by 10D7 around the PVM in IFN-induced cells is itself in the GTP-bound state. The binding of 10D7 to transfected Irga6 was largely eliminated if transfected cells were simultaneously induced with IFN&#x003b3;, especially in cells expressing relatively little of the transfected protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>arrow</italic>). This result is consistent with other evidence that the presence of other IFN&#x003b3;-induced IRG proteins normally maintains Irga6 in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p>That 10D7 binds specifically to the GTP-bound, active state of Irga6 <italic>in vivo</italic> was further supported by the behavior of two nucleotide-binding site mutants of Irga6, the &#x0201c;functionally dominant negative&#x0201d; P-loop mutant, Irga6-K82A, and a further mutant that has lost affinity for both GDP and GTP, Irga6-S83N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). We have shown elsewhere that transfected Irga6-K82A is functionally dominant negative <italic>in vivo</italic>, co-localizing in smaller or larger cytoplasmic aggregates with IFN&#x003b3;-induced wild-type Irga6 and inhibiting the accumulation of the latter on the PVM of infecting Toxoplasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). We have further shown that, although behaving functionally as a dominant negative, Irga6-K82A binds GTP with wild-type affinity but fails to hydrolyze it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Consistent with the suggestion that 10D7 binds to the GTP-bound active form of Irga6, 10D7 also bound strongly to Irga6 in cells transfected with Irga6-K82A, whether they were IFN&#x003b3;-induced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>) or not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>), while binding weakly to cells transfected with Irga6-S83N, again independent of simultaneous IFN&#x003b3; induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>The Nature of the 10D7 Epitope and Conditions for Its Formation</italic>&#x02014;The 10D7 epitope of Irga6 was constitutively exposed on Western blots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), suggesting that it is a linear epitope expressed by denatured protein. We further observed that the 10D7 epitope was also constitutively accessible in cells expressing the N-terminal 69 residues of Irga6 tagged at the C terminus with green fluorescent protein (data not shown). Thus, expression of the epitope is not dependent on the presence of the nucleotide binding or C-terminal domains. Deletion of residues 2-12 or 7-12 had no effect on the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the 10D7 epitope in these short constructs, whereas the epitope was eliminated by deletion of residues 7-25 (data not shown). By a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and short deletions of the full-length protein, it was possible to locate the epitope definitively between residues 20 and 25. Full-length Irga6 proteins carrying single replacements of residues 20-25 with alanines were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts and probed with 10E7 and 10D7 in a Western blot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). Side chains essential for the formation of the 10D7 epitope were found at Phe<sup>20</sup> and Tyr<sup>23</sup>; alanines at Gly<sup>22</sup>, Phe<sup>24</sup>, and Lys<sup>25</sup> also weakened the signal. Alanine at Thr<sup>21</sup> had no detectable effect, but a bulky substitution, T21I, also destroyed 10D7 binding (data not shown). Residues 20-25 of Irga6 make up most of Helix A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), the first resolved helix of the Irga6 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). This &#x003b1;-helix is partly exposed to solvent in the structure and partly masked by contacts to Helix B, Helix C, and Helix F. Phe<sup>20</sup>, Tyr<sup>23</sup>, and Phe<sup>24</sup> are buried in the interhelical space and not exposed on the solvent-accessible surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). In general, antibody epitopes on proteins are concentrated on loops and folds with a high degree of solvent exposure and are less common on regions of defined secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Antibodies recognizing helical epitopes interact only with side chains on the exposed surface of the helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Taken together, therefore, the data suggest that the structure of the 10D7 epitope is not accurately reflected by Helix A of the crystal structure and that under conditions in which 10D7 binds to Irga6, Helix A is restructured into a solvent-exposed loop on which the linear epitope at residues 20-25 is accessible.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Hydrolysis-deficient dominant-negative mutant of Irga6 forms aggregates independently of IFN</bold>&#x003b3;<bold>-induced factors and constitutively exposes the 10D7 epitope.</bold> Irga6cTag1-wt (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), Irga6cTag1-K82A (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>; functionally dominant negative), and Irga6cTag1-S83N (<italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>) constructs were transfected into gs3T3 fibroblasts either in the absence (<italic>A, C</italic>, and <italic>E</italic>) or in the presence of IFN&#x003b3; induction (<italic>B, D</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>).

As predicted from the properties of 10D7 summarized above, immunoprecipitation of wild-type Irga6 from the lysate was absolutely dependent on the presence of GTP&#x003b3;S. The functionally dominant negative mutant Irga6-K82A, which can bind GTP with wild-type affinity but not hydrolyze it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), and a second mutation, Irga6-E106A, which has similar properties,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">6</xref> were both immunoprecipitated by 10D7 whether GTP&#x003b3;S was added to the lysate or not, consistent with the expectation that these mutant proteins are already at least partially irreversibly GTP-bound at the time of lysis.

We investigated this possibility by co-immunoprecipitation from uninduced cells of transfected, untagged Irga6-&#x00394;7-12 with transfected Irga6cTag1-&#x00394;7-12.

The 10D7 epitope is exposed by GTP binding although itself distant from the nucleotide binding site. Since the epitope is partially buried in the known crystal structures of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and looks inaccessible to antibody, it is likely that GTP binding results in restructuring of the Helix A, exposing the whole linear epitope probably with partial unfolding. Indeed, the 10D7 epitope is probably loosely structured, since it is well expressed on Western blots of any Irga6 protein or fragment that contains the intact 20-25 sequence of Helix A. This property is also consistent with the fact that the 10D7 monoclonal antibody was produced in mice immunized with bacterially expressed Irga6 in Freund's complete adjuvant; the protein was probably largely denatured. In material isolated from cells, which is not intentionally denatured, the 10D7 epitope is constitutively exposed by loss of residues 7-12, which were not resolved in known crystal structures, suggesting that the presence of these residues is required to maintain Helix A in the &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; configuration in the absence of GTP. Likewise, loss of the myristoyl moiety results in constitutive loss of the 10D7 epitope in material isolated from cells, hinting that a direct or indirect interaction between the myristoyl group and Helix A is required to enable the GTP-dependent conformational change in Helix A to occur in otherwise normally conformed molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have provided evidence that Irga6 in interferon-induced cells must be predominantly GDP-bound (or possibly empty of nucleotide), whereas Irga6 that accumulates rapidly on the <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasitophorous vacuole in such cells is in the GTP-bound state. There are several grounds for believing that this change of state is accompanied by a significant conformational change in the Irga6 molecule. First, we present evidence that the target epitope of the anti-Irga6 monoclonal antibody, 10D7, is exposed on native wild-type Irga6 only when GTP, GTP&#x003b3;S, or GDP-AlFx is bound, and we show that it is strongly expressed on Irga6 associated with the <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasitophorous vacuole membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Second, published <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that soluble monomeric Irga6 forms oligomers in the presence of GTP that can be stabilized by the presence of AlFx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), showing that new interfaces are formed as a result of GTP binding and formation of the catalytic transition state that allow high affinity interaction between Irga6 monomers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Finally, the binding of 10D7 to Irga6 molecules is influenced by at least two other elements of the protein for which unfortunately no structural information yet exists, namely amino acids 7-12 adjacent to the N terminus, which are not resolved in any crystal structure of Irga6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), and the myristoyl group, which was not present on the bacterially expressed protein from which the crystal structures were obtained. The individual absence of these two elements resulted in constitutive gain and constitutive loss, respectively, of the 10D7 epitope (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>On kinetic grounds, we should expect that cytoplasmic Irga6 will be predominantly in the GDP-bound form. The single-site equilibrium affinity constant of bacterially purified Irga6 for GDP is 15 times that for GTP (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><italic>versus</italic> 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) a difference accounted for entirely by the difference in off-rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), whereas the concentration of free cellular GTP is reported to be only 3-fold higher than that of GDP (330 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><italic>versus</italic> 129 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). In addition, it is likely that the conformational change associated with GTP binding requires at least a dimerization of two GTP-bound Irga6 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), whereas the level of GTP-bound molecules will depend on the balance between the growth of GTP-bound, activated oligomers and their loss through hydrolysis of the bound GTP. Not all of the parameters required to calculate the expected level of GTP-bound, activated, oligomeric Irga6 are available, but it is clear that activated oligomers are expected to be rare relative to monomeric GDP-bound Irga6 or, presumably, nonactivated, monomeric Irga6 molecules, with GTP bound transiently to the low affinity binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Nevertheless, when Irga6 is expressed alone in uninduced cells, the protein accumulates in the GTP-bound state in aggregates of unknown structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). We have shown that this transition is prevented in interferon-induced cells by direct interactions between Irga6 and three other members of the IRG family, the GMS proteins Irgm1, Irgm2, and Irgm3, with their distinctive G1 motif sequence in the nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In the case of Irgm3, we could also show that GDP is required for the interaction with Irga6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Since the GMS proteins are predominantly or exclusively membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), we have argued that effective interactions between Irga6 and GMS proteins occur on cellular membranes rather than in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Irga6 is &#x0223c;60% bound to the ER membrane and 40% cytosolic in IFN-induced cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), presumably in a dynamic equilibrium, and it is plausible that the much higher effective concentration of Irga6 on ER membranes than in the cytosol tends to increase the rate of formation of activated GTP-bound dimers and oligomers in the transiently membrane-bound pool. Our speculation on the role of the GMS proteins is that they attenuate the activation process at intracellular membranes by retaining Irga6 molecules in the GDP-bound state until they are released from the membrane. In the absence of GMS proteins, in cells not stimulated with IFN&#x003b3; and expressing Irga6 by transfection or by induction from a synthetic inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), activation of Irga6 proceeds until the rate of GTP hydrolysis is equal to the rate of growth of activated oligomers, resulting in a steady state with visible GTP-bound Irga6 accumulations with a high affinity for 10D7.</p><p>The role of the myristoyl group in the conformational transition associated with GTP-dependent activation of Irga6 and exposure of the 10D7 epitope is unclear. We have shown that the nonmyristoylated Irga6-G2A mutant can transfer only inefficiently to the parasitophorous vacuole in <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected IFN-induced cells and also acts as a weak dominant negative, reducing the efficiency with which wild-type Irga6 accumulates on the vacuole.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">7</xref> This suggests that the myristoyl group is required for strong association of the activated protein with the PVM and is likely to be essential for the resistance function. A similar conjecture was made recently for the presumed myristoylation of another IRG protein, Irgb10, in its role in resistance of mouse cells against the vacuolar bacterium, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Nevertheless, myristoylation cannot be a <italic>sine qua non</italic> of effector function in all IRG proteins, since several other members of the family do not carry a myristoylation signal, including all three GMS proteins as well as Irgb6 and Irgd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). A GTP-dependent exposure of the myristoyl group associated with protein function at membranes is reminiscent of the properties of another myristoylated GTPase, ARF1, where the myristoyl group, normally partially buried in the protein structure, is exposed by a conformational change initiated by binding of GTP and contributes to the docking of ARF1 to its target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>).</p><p>In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>A</italic></xref>, we present a preliminary model for the conformational effects we have documented, based on the hypothesis that the 10D7 determinant is generated by a conformational transition in Helix A from a helical to an extended conformation, a transition that normally occurs when GTP-bound Irga6 monomers interact to form a dimer (or possibly higher order oligomer) and in which repositioning of the myristoyl group plays a role. We further hypothesize that such dimers or higher order oligomers, when assembled on the <italic>T. gondii</italic> PVM, represent the active form of the IRG protein, a form in which it is equipped to exercise its effector function against the parasite (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>B</italic></xref>). By analogy with another large GTPase, dynamin, which associates with its target membranes at the neck of clathrin-coated endocytic invaginations in the GTP-bound state and functions in vesicle scission by hydrolysis of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), it is plausible that the effector function of Irga6 and other IRG proteins of the GKS group is fulfilled via GTP hydrolysis at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, leading to the observed vesiculation of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and ultimately to its rupture.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of Irga6 nucleotide-dependent conformational change and membrane interaction.</bold><italic>A</italic>, the model proposes that regulated GTP binding by wild-type Irga6 initiates a complex conformational change requiring the presence of a &#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d; at residues 7-12 (<italic>yellow strand</italic>) that releases the myristoyl group (<italic>red</italic>) from a bound or cryptic configuration and exposes the 10D7 determinant by partial unfolding of Helix A residues 20-25 (<italic>green oval</italic>). In the absence of the myristoyl group (G2A), the motion is aborted for unknown reasons, and the 10D7 epitope is not exposed. In the &#x00394;7-12 mutant, the critical hinge-like residues are absent, the myristoyl group is constitutively mispositioned, and the 10D7 epitope is constitutively exposed. In the S83N mutant, which cannot bind nucleotides, Irga6 is constitutively in the inactive, closed configuration, and the 10D7 determinant is constitutively not exposed. In the K82A and E106A mutants, Irga6 is constitutively GTP-bound <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the 10D7 determinant is constitutively exposed. <italic>B</italic>, in IFN&#x003b3;-induced cells, the GMS group of 3 IRG proteins favor the GDP-bound inactive state of Irga6, which remains predominantly monomeric in the cytoplasm and at the ER membrane with the 10D7 epitope not exposed. Upon infection, Irga6 is released by an unknown mechanism from GMS control and interacts with the PVM in its GTP-bound form, probably by insertion of the myristoyl group, and exposing the 10D7 epitope. Homooligomerization of GTP-bound Irga6 could increase the avidity of this interaction, stabilizing active Irga6 on the vacuolar membrane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0480856330009"></graphic></fig></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M804846200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M804846200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Rita Lange, Manuel von Osten, and Claudia Poschner for assistance at various points during this study and to members of the laboratory for valuable discussions.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Bernstein-Hanley, I., Coers, J., Balsara, Z.
