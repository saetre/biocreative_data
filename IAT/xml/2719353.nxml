NMDA receptors themselves are subject to regulation through signaling pathways that are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study we investigate the ability of NMDA receptors to regulate the signaling of GPCRs by focusing on the G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor expressed endogenously in mouse cerebellar granule neurons. We show that NMDA receptor activation results in the phosphorylation and desensitization of M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptors through a mechanism dependent on NMDA-mediated calcium influx and the activity of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our study reveals a complex pattern of regulation where GPCRs (M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic) and NMDA receptors can feedback on each other in a process that is likely to influence the threshold value of signaling networks involved in synaptic plasticity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Glutamate neurotransmission mediated through the ionotropic <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparate (NMDA),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptors is the primary excitatory stimulus in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). NMDA and AMPA receptors are found co-expressed at the post-synaptic membrane of glutaminergic synapses. AMPA receptors, permeable to sodium and potassium ions, open in response to glutamate generating rapid excitatory post-synaptic potentials. NMDA receptors allow for the influx of extracellular calcium into the post-synaptic cell in response to glutamate and a concomitant depolarization that relieves the magnesium block of channel conductance. Through the temporal and spatial summation of excitatory post-synaptic potentials and glutamate release, NMDA receptors can contribute significantly to post-synaptic membrane depolarization.</p><p>In addition, NMDA receptors can influence post-synaptic activity in a more subtle manor by allowing for changes in intracellular calcium concentrations that initiate calcium-dependent signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Prominent among these signaling cascades is the regulation of protein phosphorylation via both calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and the protein phosphatases protein phosphatase 1 and calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>These signaling events are among a number of mechanisms that are proposed to regulate NMDA-mediated changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Synaptic plasticity of this type is frequently measured as long term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) and is widely regarded as a molecular mechanism that contributes to memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is now clear that the clustering of signaling molecules around NMDA and AMPA receptors at specialized post-synaptic sites coordinate signaling pathways involved in the adaptation of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Among these signaling molecules are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) where receptors such as metabotropic glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), adrenergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and muscarinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) receptors are found closely associated with NMDA receptors. These GPCRs regulate NMDA function through a variety of signaling pathways such as the well established second messenger-regulated pathways of calcium mobilization, protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and additionally via nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Pyk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and control of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). There is, therefore, an extensive range of mechanisms by which GPCRs can influence NMDA receptor function in neurons.</p><p>In the current study we investigate further the relationship between NMDA receptors and GPCRs by focusing on the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor endogenously expressed in cerebellar granule (CG) neurons. Previous studies have determined that muscarinic receptors regulate both NMDA receptor function and contribute to LTP and LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the NMDA receptor-mediated activation of CamKII results in the phosphorylation of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor and subsequent uncoupling of the receptor from the G<sub>q/11</sub>/phosphoinositide pathway. Our study demonstrates that there is a complex reciprocal relationship between GPCRs and NMDA receptors where each is able to regulate the activity of the other in a process that is likely to be essential in establishing the threshold activities that contribute to synaptic plasticity.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Primary Cell Culture</title><p>Mouse CG neurons were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

The current study extends these findings by demonstrating that NMDA receptors can also feedback onto GPCR signaling. Hence, there appears to be a reciprocal regulatory process where both receptor types are able to mediate cross-talk allowing for fine tuning of the signaling mechanisms that ultimately lead to physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor subtype is a &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptor that has been shown to couple to PLC-&#x003b2; isotypes in CG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Furthermore, muscarinic receptor subtypes are among a group of GPCRs that are known to regulate NMDA function through a number of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Hence, CG neurons are an ideal native cell type to test the possibility that NMDA receptors might cross-talk with GPCRs. We have done this here by focusing on the post-translational modification and signaling properties of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor.</p><p>Our previous studies have determined that the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor is phosphorylated in response to agonist occupation by a range of receptor-specific kinases that include members of the well characterized G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and also by protein kinases CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and CK1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In these studies we have found no evidence for a role of calcium-regulated protein kinases in agonist-mediated phosphorylation of M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Confirmation of this fact is reported in the current study where withdrawal of extracellular calcium from the medium had no significant effect on the agonist-regulated phosphorylation of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor in CG neurons. In contrast, we show here that stimulation of NMDA receptors results in phosphorylation of M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptors in CG neurons via a mechanism that is completely dependent on extracellular calcium. This immediately suggested that the elevation of intracellular calcium mediated via calcium entry through the NMDA receptors was activating calcium-regulated protein kinases responsible for M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation. CamKII is a well established downstream effector of calcium entry through NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). By the use of pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA, we established here that CamKII activity was necessary for NMDA-mediated phosphorylation of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor.</p><p>The data presented here does not, however, show conclusively that CamKII directly phosphorylates the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor. The possibility that CamKII is on a protein kinase cascade that results in receptor phosphorylation cannot be eliminated.</p><p>Our previous work had determined that the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor is phosphorylated on different sites by different protein kinases and that this results in differential regulation of receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This is illustrated by the fact that M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor internalization is mediated by GRK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 has no effect on receptor internalization but regulates the ability of the receptor to signal to the Jun-kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In this regard it is interesting to observe in the current study that CamKII-dependent phosphorylation of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor in CG neurons does not mediate receptor internalization. It is likely, therefore, that CamKII directs phosphorylation of the receptor on different sites from that of the GRKs and that the signaling outcome of phosphorylation is therefore different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) Our mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the third intracellular loop of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor can act as a substrate for CamKII. Ongoing work in the laboratory is aimed at determining whether the sites of CamKII are indeed distinct from that of established receptor kinases (<italic>i.e.</italic> GRK2/6, CK1&#x003b1;, and CK2).</p><p>To determine the functional significance of NMDA-mediated phosphorylation of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor, we examined the coupling of the receptor to the G<sub>q/11</sub>/phosphoinositide signaling pathway. Although it is possible to measure bulk IP<sub>3</sub> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), this approach is not sufficiently sensitive for reliable use in CG neurons. We therefore turned to measuring the activation of the phosphoinositide signaling cascade via the translocation of the PIP<sub>2</sub>/IP<sub>3</sub> biosensor eGFP-PH<sub>PLC</sub>&#x003b4; <sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>)<sub>.</sub> A short pulse of NMDA was able to significantly desensitize the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide response. This was dependent both on extracellular calcium and CamKII activity and as such mimicked characteristics of NMDA-mediated receptor phosphorylation. It appears, therefore, that the process of NMDA-mediated desensitization of the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor response is a consequence of CamKII-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor.</p><p>This study, coupled with our previously published work, suggests a complex process of by which NMDA receptors can regulate the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor phosphoinositide response in CG neurons. Here we demonstrate that pre-exposure to NMDA results in desensitization of the phosphoinositide response, whereas our previous work showed that concomitant NMDA/muscarinic receptor activation results in an enhancement of phosphoinositide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Both of these effects are via calcium entry-mediated by the NMDA receptor. In the pre-exposure experiments, calcium entry results in CamKII activation and receptor phosphorylation, which uncouples the receptor form G<sub>q/11</sub>. If, however, the NMDA receptor is simultaneously stimulated with the M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor, then the elevated intracellular calcium levels will feed forward to sensitize PLC-&#x003b2; and enhance the receptor-mediated response in a process that allows for coincidence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Thus, the signaling outcome of the interaction between NMDA and M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptors is dependent on the temporal pattern of NMDA and muscarinic receptor stimulation.</p><p>This complex relationship between the NMDA and muscarinic receptors in CG neurons is consistent with an emerging understanding of the multilayered regulatory mechanisms that control NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity. The fact that neuronal plasticity is itself a dynamically regulated process is now acknowledged and described by some as metaplasticity or &#x0201c;plasticity of plasticity&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Signaling pathways regulated by GPCRs have been identified as major players in regulating NMDA receptor function and defining the subtle changes in NMDA receptor activity that determines whether a threshold is obtained that drives synaptic strengthening (LTP) or alternatively the threshold associated with synaptic weakening (LTD) is the one that is attained. Our identification, in this study, of a further layer of interaction between GPCRs and NMDA receptors reveals an additional regulatory mechanism that can be recruited by neurons in fine tuning the signaling networks that converge on synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M901031200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M901031200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work is supported by Wellcome Trust Grant 047600.</p></fn><fn id="FN2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p><sup><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></sup> The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains supplemental Figs. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M901031200/DC1">S1&#x02013;S4</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN4"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">NMDA</term><def><p><italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-asparate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">AMPA</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">CamKII</term><def><p>calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">CG</term><def><p>cerebellar granule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">eGFP</term><def><p>enhanced green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">GPCR</term><def><p>G-protein-coupled receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">GRK</term><def><p>GPCR kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">IP<sub>3</sub></term><def><p>inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">LTD</term><def><p>long term depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">LTP</term><def><p>long term potentiation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">PH</term><def><p>pleckstrin homology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">PIP<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">PLC</term><def><p>phospholipase C</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">GST</term><def><p>glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">MALDI-TOF</term><def><p>matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">LC-MS/MS</term><def><p>liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Jurgen Wess (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for providing the M<italic><sub>3</sub></italic>-muscarinic receptor knock-out mice.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>J.
