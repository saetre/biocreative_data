Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP) has been identified as a novel PKB binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and appears to be a negative PKB regulator with tumor suppressor-like properties. In the present study we investigate novel mechanisms by which CTMP plays a role in apoptosis process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CTMP is localized to mitochondria. Furthermore, CTMP becomes phosphorylated following the treatment of cells with pervanadate, an insulin-mimetic. Two serine residues (Ser37 and Ser38) were identified as novel <italic>in vivo </italic>phosphorylation sites of CTMP. Association of CTMP and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibits the formation of complexes containing apoptotic protease activating factor 1 and Hsp70. Overexpression of CTMP increased the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis, most likely due to the inhibition of Hsp70 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that phosphorylation on Ser37/Ser38 of CTMP is important for the prevention of mitochondrial localization of CTMP, eventually leading to cell death by binding to Hsp70. In addition to its role in PKB inhibition, CTMP may therefore play a key role in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by localizing to mitochondria.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and regulates cell proliferation, survival, and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PKB activation occurs when PtdIns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]P<sub>3 </sub>(a product of PI3K) binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB. Phosphorylation of two amino acids (Thr308 and Ser473) is then required for full PKB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Unphosphorylated PKB is inactive, but PKB phosphorylation on Thr308 (by PDK1) stimulates PKB activity by approximately 100-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Phosphorylation on a second regulatory site at the carboxyl terminus (Ser473; termed the hydrophobic motif) by rictor-mTOR and DNA-PK can further activate PKB seven- to ten-fold ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The crystal structure of PKB suggests that Ser473 phosphorylation is important for kinase activation and stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, C-terminal modulator protein (CTMP) was identified as a PKB binding partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CTMP overexpression inactivates PKB in v-Akt-transformed cells transplanted into mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in a K-ras-induced lung cancer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The tumor suppressor-like properties of CTMP are supported by a report demonstrating inhibition of CTMP expression by hypermethylation of its promoter in malignant glioblastomas, where PKB activity is frequently altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Mitochondria regulate cellular energy supplies, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. Alterations in mitochondrial function are responsible for a range of inherited and acquired human diseases and are implicated in the aging process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cytosolic mitochondrial protein precursors contain information that is necessary to direct them to the mitochondria. Mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol are present as complexes with factors that stabilize them, as they are prone to degradation and aggregation. Several such factors are implicated as cytosolic chaperones; however, convincing data exist only for heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe CTMP phosphorylation on two sites following treatment with pervanadate, an insulin-mimetic. Surprisingly, CTMP C-terminally tagged with GFP was localized to mitochondria, whereas CTMP N-terminally tagged with GFP was mainly found in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this observation, mitochondrial localization of endogenous and exogenous CTMP has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] while this study was in review. Mitochondrial localization of CTMP was dependent on an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and was inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser37/Ser38. Finally, CTMP overexpression sensitizes the cell to apoptosis by sequestering Hsp70 away from apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), suggesting that CTMP is involved in apoptotic processes through its mitochondrial localization and binding to Hsp70.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of phosphorylated residues of CTMP in pervanadate-stimulated CCL64 cells</title><p>We previously observed CTMP phosphorylation upon pervanadate treatment in cells stably expressing Flag-CTMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], prompting us to map the phosphorylation sites in CTMP. Flag-CTMP was isolated from <sup>32</sup>P-metabolically labeled cells prior to pervanadate treatment. Autoradiography after SDS-PAGE showed that CTMP phosphorylation was higher in pervanadate-treated cells versus untreated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Phosphoamino acid analysis of total protein revealed this 3-fold increase of <sup>32</sup>P-incorporation was predominantly due to serine phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Bands corresponding to Flag-CTMP were excised and digested with trypsin. The resultant mixture of peptides was separated on a C<sub>18 </sub>column by HPLC. The UV-trace, as well as the peptide masses detected was very similar between two samples whereas the radiolabeled phosphopeptide abundance derived from pervanadate treated cells was markedly increased compared to control cells (data not shown). Fractions with higher radioactivity were further analyzed by NanoESI-MS/MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The NanoESI-MS/MS measures the mass to charge ratio (<italic>m/z</italic>) of each peptide in the mixture that, upon fragmentation, liberates a species with a <italic>m/z</italic> of 79 Da (corresponding to a single phosphate group) allowing detection of phosphopeptides among other peptides in each fraction. An example of the specificity is shown for fraction 16 from pervanadate-treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Approximately 20 peptides were detected by NanoESI-MS in the positive full scan mode (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>); however, only one phosphopeptide was detected in the <italic>m/z</italic> 79 precursor scan mode (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The observed <italic>m/z</italic> value of 607 accounted for the CTMP-derived peptide SF SSEEVILK (35&#x02013;44 a.a.), which was 80 Da heavier than expected for the non-phosphorylated form based on phosphorylation at one residue. To precisely locate the phosphorylation site of this phosphopeptide, CID tandem MS was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The CID tandem MS clearly showed the phosphate was located on either Ser37 or Ser38, but not at both residues, based on the observed mass (1218 Da). Since we detected the ions y<sub>6 </sub>(m/z 730), y<sub>7 </sub>(m/z 817), (indicating Ser37 was phosphorylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>)), as well as the ions y<sub>6 </sub>(<italic>m/z</italic> 730), y<sub>7 </sub>(<italic>m/z</italic> 897), and y<sub>7</sub>-H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (<italic>m/z</italic>799), (suggesting Ser38 was phosphorylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>)), we concluded this fraction probably contained a mixture of the peptide phosphorylated at either Ser37 or Ser38.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Serine 37 or Serine 38 of CTMP is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>following stimulation of CCL64 cells with pervanadate</bold>.

Analysis of the CTMP sequence using the PSORTII prediction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] indicated CTMP had a 69.6% probability for mitochondrial localization with a 21.7% probability for cytoplasm localization. These findings were also supported by TargetP V1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and MitoProt II 1.0a4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, CTMP subcellular localization in U2OS cells was examined using GFP-NT-CTMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], since U2OS cells exhibit epithelial adherent morphology and are convenient for localization studies. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that 92% of cells expressed GFP-NT-CTMP in the cytoplasm, with a smaller amount of cells (8%) expressing GFP-NT-CTMP at the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). GFP C-terminal tagged CTMP were also prepared to explore the possibility that the GFP tag at the N-terminus affected mitochondrial localization of CTMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Strikingly, about 46% of cells expressed GFP-CT-CTMP in the mitochondria, with 32% of cells expressing GFP-CT-CTMP at the mitochondria and cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that CTMP may localize to the mitochondria. We confirmed these findings using DsRed-mito as a mitochondrial marker, which co-localized with GFT-CT-CTMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Additional biochemical analysis, using cell fractionation, indicated CTMP was present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Since all experiments to date were performed using an overexpression system, we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous CTMP in HEK293 cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed endogenous CTMP was localized at the mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). To determine the precise localization of CTMP in mitochondria, we first isolated mitochondria fractions which were isolated under the following conditions: i) 2 M NaCl for mitochondria outer membrane, ii) 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>for intermembrane space and/or mitochondrial matrix and iii) 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for mitochondria inner or outer membrane protein. CTMP was solubilized in Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), indicating that CTMP is a soluble protein in either the inter-membrane space and/or the mitochondrial matrix.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Functional mitochondrial localization of CTMP</bold>.

In order to investigate the potential mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of CTMP, an N-terminal 31-amino acid deletion-mutant of CTMP (GFP-CT-CTMP &#x00394;N31) was constructed based on the prediction of MitoProt II 1.0a4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As predicted, this mutant form of CTMP did not localize to the mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Since CTMP overexpression appears to enhance the staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;3F</xref>), the possible interaction of CTMP with these Hsp proteins was monitored in HeLa cells expressing HA-CTMP. Immunoprecipitation of HA-CTMP revealed that Hsp70 interacts with CTMP while Hsp90 displayed negligible binding with CTMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), suggesting that this binding of CTMP and Hsp70 is specific. Furthermore, endogenous association of CTMP and Hsp70 was also observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Since Hsp70 is able to directly inhibit caspase processing by interacting with Apaf-1 to prevent the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the apoptosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the interaction between Hsp70 and Apaf-1 was monitored in HeLa cells.

Taken together, CTMP is able to enhance apoptosis process by sequestering Hsp70 thus preventing its binding to Apaf-1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of CTMP to Hsp70 inhibits the formation of a complex containing Hsp70 and Apaf-1 in HeLa cells</bold>. (A) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with HA-CTMP and cultured for 24 h. Bound proteins in HA-CTMP immunoprecipitates were detected using anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp90 antibodies (top two panels). (B) HeLa cell extracts were incubated with anti-CTMP antibody and bound Hsp70 was assessed by immunoblotting (top panel). (C) HeLa cells were infected with GFP- and CTMP-adenovirus for 24 h. After immunoprecipitation of Apaf-1, bound Hsp70 was detected (top panel). Input of each protein was also detected (bottom). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. (D) In addition to CTMP's role in PKB inhibition, CTMP has a key role in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by localizing to mitochondria. CTMP appeared to be phosphorylated on Ser37/Ser38 in response to pervanadate stimulation, resulting in the cytosolic localization of CTMP. In this context, CTMP sensitizes the cell to apoptosis by binding to Hsp70, thus preventing its binding to Apaf-1. Therefore, CTMP may have distinct roles in various subcellular compartments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-53-4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitochondria are essential organelles in most eukaryotic cells and function in the maintenance of cellular energy supplies. Mitochondria are responsible for thermoregulation and synthesis of essential molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, mitochondria also participate in key signaling events regulating cell proliferation and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. PKB has a critical role in regulating apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and directly phosphorylates and interacts with key factors involved apoptosis signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. PKB also indirectly regulates apoptotic transcription factors such as FOXO3a and NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Additionally, activated PKB is localized to various subcellular compartments including the mitochondria and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, there is a complex interplay between PKB signaling and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>We provide the first evidence that CTMP, a negative regulator of PKB, localizes to the mitochondria in a MTS-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We found CTMP is located at the mitochondrial intermembrane space and/or matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;2F</xref>). In addition, we discovered CTMP is phosphorylated on Ser37/Ser38 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and phosphorylation on these residues inhibited CMTP mitochondrial localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated CTMP overexpression sensitized cells to staurosporine-stimulated apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;3F</xref>). Interestingly CTMP interacts with Hsp70, resulting the sequestration of Hsp70 from Apaf-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest CTMP is a novel mitochondrial protein and is involved in apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggest that CTMP negatively regulates PKB activity in v-<italic>Akt </italic>transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], ciliary ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and <italic>K</italic>-ras-induced lung cancer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This observation is further supported by a recent report showing epigenetic down-regulation of CTMP transcription in malignant glioblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], CTMP is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>in response to pervanadate stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the current study, two serine residues on CTMP that are phosphorylated in response to pervanadate <italic>in vivo </italic>were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Ser37/Ser38 is located at the amino-terminus of CTMP, close to the putative MTS, as predicted by MitoProt II 1.0a4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These two seine residues are conserved in CTMP homologues from mouse (NP_03707.1), rat (NP_001020188.1) and dog (NP_001074103.1) but lower organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. pombe </italic>or <italic>C. elegans </italic>do not appear to contain a gene for CTMP, suggesting CTMP is a relatively recent protein during evolution and the two identified serine residues might be important for its function. In addition, Ser37 was predicted by the motif prediction program (Prosite) to be phosphorylated by Casein kinase II. However, this possibility needs to be experimentally evaluated in the context of apoptosis and will provide detailed insight into CTMP regulation.</p><p>CTMP was detected in the membrane and cytosol fraction of LN229 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, two molecular species corresponding to CTMP were observed in different cell lines, suggesting post-translational modifications. In addition, CTMP associated with intracellular structures similar to membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, a nuclear pool of CTMP was detected in human pancreatic duct epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Consistent with recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], a mitochondrial pool of CTMP from HEK 293 cells dependent on its MTS was detected in our experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, this mitochondrial CTMP localization was inhibited by phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Therefore, CTMP may have distinct roles in various subcellular compartments.</p><p>Mitochondrial localization is mediated by the MTS. In most cases, the MTS is present as a cleavable sequence at the N terminus, also called a pre-sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Bioinformatic analysis of the CTMP sequence indicated that a potential MTS exists in CTMP at the N-terminus of protein. This predicted N-terminal MTS appears to be functional since an N-terminal 31-amino acid deletion-mutant of CTMP did not localize to the mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). N-terminal MTS of mitochondrial precursors are in most cases cleaved by the mitochondrial-processing peptidase (MPP) as soon as the cleavage sites reach the mitochondrial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Mutational studies show the R-2 or R-3 motif are important but not sufficient to direct cleavage by MPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis of the -2 or -3 arginine in different precursor molecules completely or partially inhibits processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Further studies are needed to interrogate if the R-2 motif of CTMP is important in MTS-mediated mitochondria localization.</p><p>The molecular pathways that mediate apoptosis are tightly regulated by a series of positive and negative signals, the balance of which determines whether or not cells commit suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that the coordinated interaction between Hsps and the components of apoptosis machinery may determine cellular susceptibility to damaging stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Indeed, CTMP associate specifically Hsp70, but not Hsp90, in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Furthermore, complex formation of Hsp70 and Apaf-1 was decreased in CTMP-infected cell compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), indicating why CTMP overexpression sensitized the cell to apoptosis induced by staurosporine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Indeed, Miyawaki and colleagues recently reported that upregulation of CTMP in hippocampal neurons is required for ischemia-induced neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Based on previous studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], CTMP phosphorylation event occurs at the plasma membrane in response to activation of growth factor signaling, leading to the release of PKB. In the case of apoptosis, phosphorylation of the mitochondria pool of CTMP by as-yet-unidentified kinase will promote the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of CTMP, resulting the sequestration of Hsp70 from Apaf-1. One can also proposed that 14-3-3 may bind the phosphorylated CTMP and maintain it's cytoplasmic localization. In this regard, it will be of course interesting to discover how phosphorylation affects the interaction between CTMP and Hsp70. Further studies are required to elucidate mechanisms of CTMP-dependent apoptosis under pathophysiological conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this work provides the first evidence for the involvement of phosphorylation in the MTS-mediated mitochondrial localization of CTMP. In addition to its role in PKB inhibition, CTMP has a key role in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by localizing to mitochondria. Whether phosphorylation of these serine residues affects CTMP protein-protein interactions remains unknown. Further analysis is likely to elucidate additional CTMP regulatory mechanisms, which will provide a better understanding of its role in signaling and its potential in therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The anti-CTMP antibody used was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
