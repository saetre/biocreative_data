ETO1 directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of AtACS5. In addition, a specific interaction between ETO1 and AtCUL3, a constituent of a new type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggests the molecular mechanism in promoting AtACS5 degradation by the proteasome-dependent pathway. Because orthologous sequences to ETO1 are found in many plant species including tomato, we transformed tomato with <italic>Arabidopsis ETO1 </italic>to evaluate its ability to suppress ethylene production in tomato fruits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transgenic tomato lines that overexpress <italic>Arabidopsis ETO1 </italic>(<italic>ETO1</italic>-OE) did not show a significant delay of fruit ripening. So, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate potential heterologous interaction between ETO1 and three isozymes of ACC synthases from tomato. In the yeast two-hybrid system, ETO1 interacts with LE-ACS3 as well as AtACS5 but not with LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4, two major isozymes whose gene expression is induced markedly in ripening fruits. According to the classification of ACC synthases, which is based on the C-terminal amino acid sequences, both LE-ACS3 and AtACS5 are categorized as type 2 isozymes and possess a consensus C-terminal sequence. In contrast, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 are type 1 and type 3 isozymes, respectively, both of which do not possess this specific C-terminal sequence. Yeast two-hybrid analysis using chimeric constructs between LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS3 revealed that the type-2-ACS-specific C-terminal tail is required for interaction with ETO1. When treated with auxin to induce <italic>LE-ACS3</italic>, seedlings of <italic>ETO1</italic>-OE produced less ethylene than the wild type, despite comparable expression of the <italic>LE-ACS3 </italic>gene in the wild type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that ETO1 family proteins specifically interact with and negatively regulate type 2 ACC synthases. Our data also show that <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ETO1 can regulate type 2 ACS in a heterologous plant, tomato.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ethylene is a simple gas that acts as a plant hormone; it controls various processes in the plant life cycle, including seed germination, root hair development, root nodulation, flower senescence, abscission, and fruit ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ethylene also is synthesized in response to stresses such as pathogen attack, wounding, hypoxia, ozone, chilling, and freezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These responses are controlled through integration of the pathways for ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signal transduction. The ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathways have been well characterized with regard to physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. Studies of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>revealed a universally conserved set of components in the ethylene signaling pathway for all plants. Ethylene is perceived by ethylene receptor family ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, ERS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and their assembly requires the RAN1 copper transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The signal is further transduced by the signaling pathway components CTR1, a Raf-like MAPKKK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], EIN2, an Nramp-related integral membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and a cascade of transcriptional regulators EIN3/EILs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], ERF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], EDF1-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The proteolysis of EIN3/EIL proteins by ethylene-regulated EBF1/2 F-box proteins plays a key role in regulation of all known responses to the hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A MAPK (including AtMPK6) cascade was proposed to be involved in ethylene signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], however, a recent study showed that AtMPK6 is not involved in ethylene signaling but instead involved in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis through AtACS6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other yet unidentified components are thought to be involved as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The biosynthetic pathway of ethylene has been studied in detail, and genes encoding the two key enzymes have been cloned and characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS) converts <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to ACC and then, ACC oxidase (ACO) produces ethylene through oxidization of ACC. Generally, the reaction catalyzed by ACS is a rate-limiting step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Both ACS and ACO are encoded by gene families in many plant species. In the case of tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>Mill.), there are at least 10 <italic>ACS </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and four <italic>ACO </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The members of <italic>ACS </italic>and <italic>ACO </italic>gene families are differentially expressed in development or in response to stimuli such as germination, leaf senescence and flower abscission, fruit ripening, wounding, flooding, exposure to ozone, touch, hormone treatment, and pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Recent findings suggest that posttranscriptional regulation is an important aspect of the control of <italic>ACS </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Pharmacological and molecular biological studies have suggested that phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of ACS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A tomato ACS, LE-ACS2, is phosphorylated in the C-terminal region and this modification appears to be involved in the posttranslational regulation of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which plants regulate ethylene biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional or posttranslational levels remain unclear.</p><p>Recent studies of the <italic>Arabidopsis <underline>et</underline>hylene-<underline>o</underline>verproducer </italic>mutants <italic>(eto1</italic>,<italic>eto2-1</italic>,<italic>eto3) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] revealed mechanisms underlying the posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. The <italic>eto </italic>mutants constitutively display the ethylene-evoked triple response phenotypes in the absence of exogenously applied hormone; they can be distinguished from <italic>ctr1 </italic>mutants, which also displays the triple response in the absence of ethylene, because the phenotypes of <italic>eto </italic>mutants are suppressed by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, the <italic>eto </italic>mutants are likely impaired in either the regulators or the structural enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis. <italic>eto1 </italic>is a recessive mutation that results in an approximately 10-fold ethylene overproduction in etiolated seedlings compared to wild-type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], whereas <italic>eto2-1 </italic>and <italic>eto3 </italic>are dominant mutations that cause 20- and 100-fold increases of ethylene biosynthesis, respectively, in etiolated seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The <italic>eto2-1 </italic>and <italic>eto3 </italic>were identified as mutations within the closely related <italic>AtACS5 </italic>and <italic>AtACS9 </italic>genes, respectively. These mutations cause alterations of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of each protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, both <italic>eto1 </italic>and <italic>eto2-1 </italic>mutations increase the stability of the AtACS5 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], suggesting that the C-termini of some ACC synthases are involved in posttranslational regulation/processing or stability of the ACS proteins mediated by ETO1. Also another study showed that AtMPK6 phosphorylates the C-terminus of AtACS6 to stabilize the isozyme by a yet unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanism(s) regulating the activity and stability of AtACS5 was revealed by identification of the ETO1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. ETO1 is a member of a novel plant-specific protein family with three distinct protein-protein interaction motifs, namely the BTB domain in its N-terminus and the TPR motifs together with a coiled-coil motif in its C-terminus. The C-terminal TPR domain interacts with AtACS5 and the N-terminal BTB domain interacts with AtCUL3, a constituent of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes in which ETO1 is proposed to serve as a substrate-specific adaptor protein. ETO1 inhibits the enzyme activity of AtACS5 and targets this protein for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Other studies also suggest that proteolysis is involved in regulation of ethylene biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>ETO1 has two paralogs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, EOL1 and EOL2 (<underline>E</underline>T<underline>O</underline>1-<underline>L</underline>IKE), both of which also interact with and inhibit the activity of AtACS5. Although ETO1-related sequences are found in many other plant species including tomato, no studies have examined whether members of the ETO1 protein family can interact with and regulate ACC synthases other than AtACS5. In this study, using a heterologous system in tomato, we demonstrate that ETO1 specifically interacts with a subfamily of ACC synthases, namely type 2 ACC synthases including AtACS5, AtACS9 and LE-ACS3, but not with other types of ACC synthases including AtACS6, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4. We also show that constitutive expression of <italic>ETO1 </italic>results in posttranscriptional suppression of a type 2 ACC synthase, LE-ACS3, in transgenic tomato. These results suggest that members of the ETO1 protein family are components in the negative regulation of type 2 ACC synthases in the plant kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Fruit ripening is not altered in transgenic tomato plants that overexpress ETO1</title><p>Orthologous sequences to ETO1 are found in many plant species including tomato [HY and JRE, unpublished data]. These orthologs share high similarity with ETO1 in their TPR domains that are thought to be involved in specific interaction with ACC synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Actually, two ETO1 paralogs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, EOL1 and EOL2, interact with AtACS5 in yeast cells and suppress its activity in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In tomato, ethylene is a critical regulator of fruit ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 have been shown to be involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. So, there is a possibility that any of the ETO1 ortholog(s) in tomato interact with and regulate these ACS isozymes. Because we expected heterologous interaction between <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ETO1 and LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4, leading to suppression of ethylene biosynthesis in tomato fruits and retardation of its development, we introduced the <italic>Arabidopsis ETO1 </italic>cDNA controlled by the CaMV 35S promoter into tomato (<italic>L. esculentum </italic>cv. Shu-gyoku) via <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. Transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing medium and verified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see methods). Expression of the <italic>ETO1 </italic>transgene in the T<sub>1 </sub>segregating individuals was detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. All of the T<sub>1 </sub>lines harbouring the transgene showed expression of the exogenous <italic>ETO1 </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Twenty-two T<sub>1 </sub>individual <italic>ETO1</italic>-overexpressing (<italic>ETO1</italic>-OE) lines were derived from four independent T<sub>0 </sub>lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). However, all of the fruits of <italic>ETO1</italic>-OE lines developed a full red color over the same time course as wild-type plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results suggest that ETO1 may not suppress the two major ACS isozymes in ripening tomato fruit, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4, because there is no noteworthy interaction of ETO1 with either LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4.</p></sec><sec><title>ETO1 specifically interacts with LE-ACS3, but not with LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4, in yeast cells</title><p>To investigate the potential interaction between the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ETO1 and ACC synthases of tomato, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays between ETO1 and three ACS isozymes of tomato, LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, and LE-ACS4. As described above, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 are major ACS isozymes involved in ripening tomato fruits. LE-ACS3 is induced by auxin and flooding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, whereas LE-ACS3 showed a strong interaction with ETO1, at a level comparable to that of AtACS5, neither LE-ACS2 nor LE-ACS4 interacted with ETO1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results suggest that ETO1 may have a preference for a type of ACS isozymes that include LE-ACS3 and AtACS5.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we focused on the C-termini of various ACC synthases from <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and tomato as potential targets of ETO1. C-terminal amino acid sequences of ACC synthases are the least-conserved portion of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, there is one small conserved motif, RLSF (arginine [R] &#x02013; leucine [L] &#x02013; serine [S] &#x02013; phenylalanine [F]), in the C-termini of several ACC synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A classification of ACC synthases based on the similarity of DNA sequences was reported by Oetiker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and phylogenetic classifications based on the similarity of amino acid sequences of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ACC synthases were also devised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Apart from these classifications, based on the C-terminal consensus motif mentioned above, we further classified the ACS isozymes of tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>into three types as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>: (1) isozymes with long tails (23&#x02013;27 amino acids) after the RLSF consensus sequence (like LE-ACS2); (2) isozymes that possess the 'WVF (tryptophan [W] &#x02013; valine [V] &#x02013; phenylalanine [F])' consensus sequence just before the RLSF, have short tails (5&#x02013;8 amino acids) rich in arginine [R] and acidic amino acids (aspartic acid [D] or glutamic acid [E]) after the RLSF, and end with the 'ER (glutamic acid [E] &#x02013; arginine [R])' consensus (like AtACS5 and LE-ACS3); and (3) isozymes lacking the RLSF consensus sequence (like AtACS7 and LE-ACS4). AtACS3, AtACS10, and AtACS12 are not included in this alignment because <italic>AtACS3 </italic>is a pseudogene, and AtACS10 and 12 are not ACC synthases but aminotransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hereafter, we use the word "type" instead of "class" to avoid confusion between former sequence-based classifications and our functional classification based on C-terminal motifs and the capacity to bind ETO1/EOL proteins.</p><p>Although the lengths of the C-terminal tails of AtACS11, LE-ACS4, and LE-ACS5 are comparable to those of type 2 isozymes, they lack the RLSF motif and the R/D/E-rich region. Therefore, we classified these three isozymes as type 3 isozymes along with AtACS7, which has a much shorter C-terminal tail. Both AtACS5 and LE-ACS3, which interact strongly with ETO1, belong to type 2, whereas LE-ACS2 belongs to type 1 and LE-ACS4 to type 3. Because we previously showed that the C-terminus of AtACS5 is a target of ETO1, this raises the possibility that the C-termini of type 2 ACC synthases contain some specific features necessary for the interaction with ETO1 that may also be conserved in other plants.</p></sec><sec><title>ETO1 does not interact with a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of LE-ACS2 in yeast</title><p>As described above, one notable feature of type 2 ACC synthases is the length of the C-terminal tail after the RLSF motif. Type 1 ACC synthases possess longer C-terminal tails after the RLSF than type 2, whereas type 3 isozymes lack the RLSF. Furthermore, the C-terminus of ACS appears to be proteolyzed <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Although another study showed that C-terminal truncation of a type 1 enzyme, LE-ACS2, does not occur <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], other type 1 ACC synthases may have their C-termini truncated to an "optimal length" (i.e., length comparable to type 2) and may then become capable of interacting with ETO1 family proteins. Therefore, we examined the effect of altering the length of ACS protein C-terminal tails on their interaction with ETO1.</p><p>Two C-terminally truncated mutants of LE-ACS2 were constructed and the cDNA was cloned into pACT2 (see methods). LE-ACS2&#x00394;16 contains a deletion of 16 amino acids from the C-terminal end; and as a result its C-terminus has a length comparable to native type 2 ACS proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The other mutant, LE-ACS2&#x00394;28, was trimmed to one amino acid upstream of the RLSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). If a specific length of the C-terminal tail after the RLSF is necessary for the interaction with ETO1, then LE-ACS2&#x00394;16 should interact with ETO1 whereas LE-ACS2&#x00394;28 should not. However, neither of these truncated mutants was able to interact with ETO1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results suggest that the length of C-termini of type 1 ACS is not preventing ETO1 binding. Simply truncating the C-terminal tail of type 1 ACS to the length of type 2 isozymes is not sufficient to allow for interaction with ETO1 and implies that other factors are necessary for mediating this interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>The C-terminal sequence specific to type 2 ACC synthases is required for the interaction with ETO1</title><p>Next we examined the effect of type-2-specific amino acid sequence around the RLSF on the interaction with ETO1. As mentioned above, type 2 ACC synthases have a specific C-terminal consensus sequence (i.e., the WVFRLSF motif followed by the R/D/E-rich region). The RLSF is conserved in both type 1 and type 2 ACC synthases, whereas the WVF motif and R/D/E-rich region are conserved only in type 2 ACC synthases in tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In the <italic>eto3 </italic>mutant, the valine residue in this WVF motif is mutated to aspartic acid in AtACS9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], suggesting an important role of this small motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We replaced the C-terminal 31 amino acids of LE-ACS2 with amino acids 456&#x02013;469 of LE-ACS3 (LE-ACS2&#x00394;C31::LE-ACS3<sub>456&#x02013;469</sub>). This chimeric ACS protein was sufficient to recover the strong interaction with ETO1 to a level comparable to LE-ACS3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the C-terminal tail specific to type 2 ACS, comprising the WVFRLSF motif and the R/D/E-rich region, is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with ETO1.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of ETO1 suppresses auxin-induced ethylene biosynthesis in tomato seedlings</title><p>To investigate the interaction between ETO1 and LE-ACS3 <italic>in planta</italic>, we examined the induction of ethylene biosynthesis in etiolated tomato seedlings by a synthetic auxin, 2,4-D. Using T<sub>2 </sub>seedlings of a homozygous line of <italic>ETO1</italic>-OE (14-1-H2; not included in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), we measured ethylene evolution from auxin-treated wild-type and <italic>ETO1 </italic>transgenic tomato seedlings.</p><p>When 6-day-old etiolated wild-type seedlings were treated with 100 &#x003bc;M 2,4-D for 24 h, they produced 2.1-fold more ethylene than untreated seedlings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). <italic>LE-ACS3 </italic>mRNA was induced by the 2,4-D treatment in the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). However, when the <italic>ETO1</italic>-OE transgenic plants were treated in this manner, they produced only 1.6-fold more ethylene when compared to untreated plants, despite <italic>LE-ACS3 </italic>mRNA being strongly induced to a level comparable to wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results, together with those of the yeast two-hybrid assays, indicate that overexpressed ETO1 protein may suppress the ACS activity of LE-ACS3 by a direction, which results in a reduction in ethylene biosynthesis, same as the case of AtACS5 and cytokinin treatment in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>ETO1 interacts with and inhibits type 2 ACC synthases</title><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that ETO1, a novel plant-specific BTB/TPR protein, negatively regulates an ethylene biosynthetic enzyme of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>seedlings, AtACS5, via direct interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, whether the interaction and the regulatory effect are limited to AtACS5 and its paralogs/orthologs &#x02013; or are common to the entire plant ACC synthase family &#x02013; has not been clarified. In this study, we showed the interaction between ETO1 and ACS is restricted to type 2 ACS isozymes. We classified ACC synthases into three types based on their C-terminal amino acid sequences. All members of 'class I' ACC synthases of tomato (LE-ACS1A, LE-ACS1B, LE-ACS6) in the classification of Oetiker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] correspond to our type 1 ACC synthases, while both of their 'class II' (LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4) and 'class III' (LE-ACS3 and LE-ACS5) contains members of our type 1 and type 3. This discrepancy may result from the different methods of the phylogenetic anlysis (i.e. partial DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and C-terminal amino acid sequences [this paper]). On the other hand, our type 2 isozymes of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>are grouped into two closely related phylogenetic branches in the group B ACC synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and the type 3 isozymes belong to the branches in the group B other than the 'type 2' branches. Also our type 1 isozymes correspond to the group A isozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These coincidences may reflect the functional relevance of each type of the isozymes, and, indeed, functional heterodimerizations between closely related ACS isozymes have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the endogenous regulators of ethylene biosynthesis in the control of plant development, response to stress or fruit ripening. Because tomato has at least one ETO1 ortholog [LeEOL1; HY and JRE, unpublished], a family of ACS isozymes and many ethylene-related phenotypes, we tested whether ETO1 could interact with and inhibit members of the ACC synthase family from tomato. We showed that ETO1 specifically interacts with two type 2 ACC synthases, AtACS5 and LE-ACS3, but not with LE-ACS2 (type 1) or LE-ACS4 (type 3) in the yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of the <italic>ETO1 </italic>transgene posttranscriptionally suppresses the activity of LE-ACS3 in a heterologous plant. These results suggest that type 2 ACC synthases represent a group that specifically interact with and are inhibited by ETO1 family proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Whether the inhibitory effect of the ETO1 family <italic>in planta </italic>is limited to type 2 is still unknown; we have not yet checked the interaction of ETO1 with LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 <italic>in planta</italic>. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of ETO1 was obviously restricted to type 2 isozymes. However, <italic>in planta</italic>, AtMPK6-dependent phosphorylation of AtACS6 (a type 1 ACS) can stabilize this isozyme and increase ethylene biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Phosphorylation of such kind of modification of type 1 ACC synthases may confer an ability to interact with ETO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Also, a calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the serine residue within the RLSF motif of LE-ACS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], or any proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] may change the C-terminal conformation and enable interaction with the ETO1 family. These possibilities may be elucidated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies that can distinguish phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated forms of type 1 ACS, or pull-down assay using type-1-specific C-terminal peptide. In contrast, type 3 ACC synthases does not contain this potential phosphorylation site, suggesting that they may not be similarly regulated. The Ctr<sup>- </sup>phenotype of plants constitutively expressing the C-terminally truncated version of AtACS5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] supports this hypothesis.</p><p>Another question is whether any other members of the ETO1 family interact with other types of ACC synthases. In the yeast two-hybrid system, both of the two paralogs of ETO1, EOL1 and EOL2, showed an interaction with ACC synthases from tomato similar to that of ETO1 (i.e., they interacted only with type 2 ACS but not with type 1 or type 3; data not shown). This suggests that type-2-specific regulation may be common to other members of the ETO1 family at least in yeast cells. However, a possibility that any EOL proteins may interact with and inhibit ACC synthases other than type 2 isozymes modified <italic>in planta </italic>is still not excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>C-Terminal sequence specific to type 2 ACS is a target of ETO1</title><p>The C-terminal amino acid sequence specific to type 2 ACS (i.e., the WVFRLSF followed by the R/D/E-rich region), is a target of ETO1. In addition, mutations found within the RLSF to the R/D/E-rich region of AtACS5 of <italic>eto2-1 </italic>and the WVF motif of AtACS9 of the <italic>eto3 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] strongly implicate the importance of this amino acid sequence. Among molecular lesions of <italic>Arabidopsis eto1 </italic>mutations identified so far, <italic>eto1-1</italic>, which lacks only the last TPR motif, has a phenotype similar to the other alleles, and a C-terminal deletion mutant of ETO1 (tETO1) impaired in its last TPR motif failed to interact with AtACS5 in the yeast two-hybrid assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These results indicate that TPR motifs of ETO1 are essential for interaction with AtACS5.</p><p>TPR motifs are involved in various protein-protein interactions. Generally, the interaction between TPR domains and their target peptide are strictly limited by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In this regard, type-2-specific C-termini of ACC synthases have some features required for the strict interaction with the TPR of ETO1. The crystal structure of LE-ACS2 has been determined, and the C-terminal tail of LE-ACS2 seems to protrude from the surface of the ACS monomer and dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In the dimeric form (head-to-tail orientation) of LE-ACS2, N-terminal residues 11&#x02013;19 make contact with the C-terminal helix H14 just before the C-terminal tail. The significance of the interaction between the N- and the C-termini is not clear but may be important for conformation stabilization and catalysis, as suggested by biochemical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The WVF motif is likely located outside this N- and C-terminal interaction region and may be important for formation of the interacting surface with ETO1. Crystal structure analysis of the ETO1-ACS complex would reveal the significance of the WVF motif. Also, an isozyme of type 2 ACS, LE-ACS8, does not possess the precise WVF sequence. Instead, it contains W<underline>G</underline>F, which is very closely related to WVF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>eto3 </italic>version of AtACS9, in which the valine residue of the WVF motif was altered to the charged aspartic acid residue, the glycine residue in the C-terminus of LE-ACS8 is a neutral amino acid. Therefore, it is likely that LE-ACS8 may also interact with ETO1 as do other type 2 isozymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis</title><p>We have identified many orthologous sequences of <italic>ETO1 </italic>from other plant species including tomato, suggesting that the ETO1-based regulatory system is common among the plant kingdom. In the present study, we showed that <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ETO1 interacts with and posttranscriptionally regulates LE-ACS3, a type 2 ACS, in a heterologous plant, tomato. This indicates that the ETO1 protein family is a common component in the negative regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in plants. Given that ETO1-homologous sequences are found in all plants but not in animals or prokaryotes, this system of regulation of ethylene may have developed early in plant evolution. ACC synthases are similar to the subgroup I family of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Most of the similarity between these two families is found around the active sites, while the target of ETO1 lies in the C-terminus of ACS, which is outside the conserved region. It is an intriguing question as to how early plants acquired this unique mechanism to regulate ethylene biosynthesis.</p><p>Finally, one may ask why only type 2 ACC synthases are regulated by ETO1. It is imperative for plants to have ethylene synthesized in a timely manner. For instance, a remarkable phenotype of all <italic>eto </italic>mutants was observed in the etiolated seedling stage, suggesting that production of ethylene is regulated by ETO1 during germination. Although ethylene evolution is important for germination, seedlings with excessive level of ethylene for an extended time would continue to exhibit phenotype similar to that of the triple response, which is normally disappeared after germination. Also ethylene is important to respond to various stresses. To avoid unnecessary overproduction of ethylene in physiological and developmental processes, a tightly regulated system consisted of the type 2 ACC synthases and ETO1 protein family together with yet unknown system (for instance, AtMPK6-AtACS6 system) must have been evolved in plants to timely control ethylene biosynthesis until this important growth regulator and stress phytohormone is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we elucidated the substrate specificity of ETO1 protein.

ACC synthases and ETO1 proteins are shown in light blue and red, respectively. C-terminus of ACS is drawn as a small light blue circle or oval. Note that each pair of ACC synthases forms a dimer with shared active site (two pockets per dimer). Upper panel:, type 2 ACS dimer interacts with ETO1. As a result, the ACS is inhibited for enzymatic activity and targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation. Yet unknown modification (possibly phosphorylation (yellow circles)) of the C-termini of type 2 ACS may inhibit interaction between ACS and ETO1, resulting in ACC production. Lower panel (left) type 1: Although ETO1 does not interact with type 1 ACS dimer because type 1 ACS has a C-terminal tail (blue oval) not suitable for the interaction with ETO1, it is also degraded with yet unidentified mechanism. Triple phosphorylation of the C-termini by MAPK stabilizes type 1 ACS dimer and the dimer produces ACC from SAM. Lower panel (right), type 3: ETO1 does not interact with type 3 ACS dimer because it lacks the specific C-terminal tail required for the interaction with ETO1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-5-14-6"/></fig></sec></back></article>
