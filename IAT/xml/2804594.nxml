LRP16 is both an ER&#x003b1; target gene and an ER&#x003b1; coactivator, and plays a crucial role in ER&#x003b1; activation and proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, the regulation of the functional availability of this coactivator protein is not yet clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) identified the cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein keratin 18 (K18) as a novel LRP16-interacting protein. Fluorescence analysis revealed that GFP-tagged LRP16 was primarily localized in the nuclei of mock-transfected MCF-7 cells but was predominantly present in the cytoplasm of K18-transfected cells. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the amount of cytoplasmic LRP16 was markedly increased in cells overexpressing K18 whereas nuclear levels were depressed. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous K18 expression in MCF-7 cells significantly decreased the cytoplasmic levels of LRP16 and increased levels in the nucleus. CoIP failed to detect any interaction between K18 and ER&#x003b1;, but ectopic expression of K18 in MCF-7 cells significantly blunted the association of LRP16 with ER&#x003b1;, attenuated ER&#x003b1;-activated reporter gene activity, and decreased estrogen-stimulated target gene expression by inhibiting ER&#x003b1; recruitment to DNA. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays revealed that K18 overexpression blunted the estrogen-stimulated increase of S-phase entry of MCF-7 cells.

Classically, ER&#x003b1; is activated by estrogen binding, and this leads to receptor phosphorylation, dimerization, and to recruitment of coactivators to the estrogen-bound receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Oncogenesis in breast cancer frequently involves excessive activation of the ER&#x003b1; signaling due primarily to overexpression of ER&#x003b1; and/or its coactivators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Factors that affect the balance of ER&#x003b1; and its cofactors in breast cancer cells can modulate ER&#x003b1; signaling and thereby alter the cell growth response to estrogen stimulation. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells express functional ER&#x003b1; and display estrogen-dependent growth, and have been widely used as an in vitro model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of ER&#x003b1; action in estrogen-dependent breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Most coactivator proteins contain different activation domains or enzyme activity modules that include classical histone acetylase, bromo, chromo, Su(var) 3-9, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax and ATPase domains, by which coactivators facilitate the assembly of the transcription initiation complex through their chromatin remodeling activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. LRP16 is a member of the macro domain superfamily with a simple structure compared to other members because it contains only a single stand-alone macro module in its C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. LRP16 was previously identified as a target gene for both ER&#x003b1; and the androgen receptor (AR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The proximal region (nt -676 to -24) of the human LRP16 promoter contains a 1/2 ERE/Sp1 site and multiple GC-rich elements that confer estrogen responsiveness and is sufficient for estrogen action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. LRP16 protein interacts with both ER&#x003b1; and AR and enhances their transcriptional activities in a ligand-dependent manner, thus establishing a positive feedback regulatory loop between LRP16 and ER&#x003b1;/AR signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, LRP16 has also been reported to act as a potential coactivator that amplifies the transactivation of 4 other NRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Overexpression of LRP16 can stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by enhancing estrogen-stimulated transcription mediated by ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Inhibition of <italic>LRP16 </italic>gene expression significantly suppresses the proliferative activity and invasiveness of estrogen-responsive epithelial cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Consistent with findings in cell culture, a positive correlation was found between LRP16 mRNA levels and the progression of primary breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the mechanisms of estrogen regulation of LRP16 expression and the functional role of LRP16 in ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional regulation are relatively well characterized, the regulation of the functional availability of this coactivator protein is unclear.</p><p>The cytoskeleton of epithelial cells is predominantly formed by intermediate filament protein keratins (KRTs) that are subclassified into type I (acidic, KRT9 through KRT20) and type II (neutral-basic, KRT1-KRT8) families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. K18 (KRT18) is expressed in single-layer epithelial cells of the human body and is localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. In the normal mammary epithelium, K18 is expressed in the luminal cells that represent the differentiation compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. K18 has been recognized for many years as an epithelial marker in diagnostic histopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The level of K18 expression has been inversely associated with the progression of breast cancer: 25% to 80% of all breast carcinomas exhibit loss of K18 expression and this is associated with significantly poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Transfection of K18 into ER&#x003b1;-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells caused significant reduction of malignancy both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Results from cell-culture experiments and clinicopathological parameter analyses have also revealed a relationship between decreased amounts of K18 in the cytoplasm and increased proliferative activity of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These previous studies suggest that K18 plays an important role in tumor progression in breast cancer patients, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study we first used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate proteins interacting with LRP16. This revealed that K18 physically interacts with LRP16 through its C-terminal region. Moreover, K18 binding sequesters LRP16 in the cytoplasm and prevents its enhancement of ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription in MCF-7 cells. Using estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells as a model we have demonstrated that K18 modulates both estrogen activation of ER&#x003b1; target genes and cell cycle progression. These results suggest that loss of K18 expression in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cells, and failure of cytoplasmic sequestration of the ER&#x003b1; coactivator LRP16, may contribute to tumor proliferation by increasing ER&#x003b1; signaling in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>K18 is a novel interactor of LRP16</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for new polypeptides interacting with LRP16. Sequences from a MCF-7 breast cancer cell cDNA library were screened for binding to LRP16; this identified nine clones corresponding to 12 different potential LRP16-binding proteins. One such cDNA clone was found to contain a full-length coding sequence (amino acids 1-430) for the cytokeratin K18. The specificity of the interaction between LRP16 and K18 was demonstrated by chromogenic assay using X-Gal; no staining developed using either factor alone or in pairwise controls containing only the Gal4 activation domain (AD) or the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>K18 interacts with LRP16 in yeast cells</bold>.

A series of K18 deletion constructs were then used in GST pull-down assays to identify the region within K18 that is required for LRP16 binding. GST-LRP16 failed to bind to either K18-N (amino acids 1-150) or K18-F (80-375) but bound strongly to both K18-C1 (301-430) and K18-C2 (390-430) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We then tested N- and C-terminal LRP16 deletion constructs for K18 binding. Full-length K18 polypeptide bound strongly to GST-LRP16-C (amino acids 161-324) but only weakly to GST-LRP16-N (1-160); K18 failed to bind to GST alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Together these results indicate that the interaction between K18 and LRP16 is mediated primarily by the C-terminal region of K18 and the single macro domain of LRP16.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>K18 interacts with LRP16 protein by its C-terminal region mediation</bold>.

A pcDNA3.1 expression vector directing the expression of LRP16 (pcDNA3.1-LRP16) was transfected into MCF-7 cells; cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against either K18 or LRP16. Precipitates were resolved by gel electrophoresis and probed with antibody against LRP16. The empty pcDNA3.1 expression vector provided a negative control. An intense band corresponding to LRP16 was detected in anti-K18 antibody immunoprecipitates from LRP16-overexpressing MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 5). In addition, a weak band corresponding to endogenous LRP16 was detected in anti-K18 immunoprecipitates from vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 6). Nonspecific IgG antibody failed to immunoprecipitate LRP16 (lanes 3 and 4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To confirm the specificity of LRP16-K18 complex formation we transiently transfected Flag-tagged empty vector or Flag-K18-C1 (amino acids 301-430) into MCF-7 cells for CoIP assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, the exogenous Flag-K18-C1 and the endogenous LRP16 could be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated by use of anti-Flag and/or anti-LRP16 antibodies.

By contrast, LRP16 acts as a common coactivator for the nuclear receptors ER&#x003b1; and AR, and this implies that LRP16 is present in the nucleus. The physical association between K18 and LRP16 therefore suggested the possibility that K18 might modulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of LRP16.</p><p>To address this possibility we examined whether increased K18 expression in MCF-7 cells might alter the subcellular distribution of a LRP16-GFP fusion protein. As expected for a nuclear protein, LRP16-GFP fluorescence was found primarily in the nucleus, and nuclear fluorescence was detected in 78% of GFP-positive cells; cytoplasmic fluorescence was only detected in 22% of GFP-positive cells cotransfected with empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). However, the distribution was reversed when cells expressing LRP16-GFP were cotransfected with a construct directing the expression of K18. Here nuclear fluorescence was detected in only 32% of GFP-positive cells whereas 68% exhibited cytoplasmic localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

Three different small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes directed against human K18 mRNA, siRNA361, 609 and 908, were designed and transfected into MCF-7 cells; levels of LRP16 in the total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions were measured by immunoblotting as before. Levels of K18 polypeptide were significantly reduced by transfection with all three K18 siRNAs as compared to cells transfected with a control siRNA; knock-down activity declined in the order siRNA361, 609, 908 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). None of the siRNAs affected the total levels of LRP16, but knockdown of endogenous K18 expression with the three siRNAs led to a significant and graded decrease in cytoplasmic LRP16 levels and a corresponding graded increase in nuclear levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similar effects of K18 overexpression and knockdown on the subcellular distribution of endogenous LRP16 protein were also observed in human cervical cancer HeLa cells (data not shown). Together these data indicate that endogenous K18 sequesters LRP16 in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>K18 binding to LRP16 modulates ER&#x003b1; signaling</title><p>Our previous studies demonstrated that LRP16 is a coactivator of ER&#x003b1; in the nucleus and that knockdown of LRP16 in MCF-7 cells can significantly attenuate estradiol (E2)-stimulated ER&#x003b1; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Because K18 can sequester LRP16 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm it is possible that K18 expression might modulate ER&#x003b1; signaling. To explore this possibility we assayed E2-activation of a construct in which expression of a luciferase gene (<italic>Luc</italic>) is under the control of three estrogen-response elements (EREs). Cotransfection of MCF-7 with the 3&#x000d7; ERE-TATA-<italic>Luc </italic>reporter construct and with ER&#x003b1; and the pcDNA3.1 empty vector revealed background luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 1). Reporter gene activity increased by 2.3-fold on treatment with E2 (100 nM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 2). However, activation was significantly attenuated by cotransfection with a construct directing K18 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 3). Consistent with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the E2-activated reporter system was further augmented by LRP16 transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 4), but this LRP16-enhanced reporter gene activity was also markedly impaired by cotransfection with the K18 expression construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 5). Comparison of reporter gene activities in lanes 3 and 5 revealed that K18 suppression of E2-stimulated ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity was efficiently antagonized by overexpression of LRP16. We next used RNA interference in the cotransfection system to explore K18 suppression of reporter gene expression in MCF-7 cells. siRNA directed against K18 was found to enhance ER&#x003b1;-mediated transactivation in the presence of E2. In the absence of E2, however, knockdown of endogenous K18 failed to increase reporter gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Furthermore, CoIP analysis revealed that ectopic K18 expression in MCF-7 cells markedly attenuated the association of ER&#x003b1; with LRP16; there was no evidence for any direct interaction between K18 and ER&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, left panel). Consistent with our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], E2 stimulation enhanced the interaction between LRP16 and ER&#x003b1; but had no effect on the interaction between K18 and LRP16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, right panel).

To determine whether the K18-LRP16 association might modulate the E2-stimulated transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, MCF-7 cells were transfected with constructs directing the expression of K18 and/or LRP16 as well as with a GFP expression plasmid. The extent of DNA synthesis was assessed by incorporation of BrdU into GFP-positive cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref> (lane 1), S-phase entry was 13% greater in E2-treated cells than in control cells (lane 2), whereas in cells transfected with a construct expressing K18 there was only a 4% increase in S-phase entry in K18-transfected cells (lane 3). Furthermore, overexpression of LRP16 substantially increased E2-stimulated S-phase entry (lane 4); however, this increase was blocked by K18 overexpression (lane 5).

A common mechanism is sequestration of the factor into inactive compartments, and this typically takes place via direct or indirect association with the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. LRP16 is a new type of ER&#x003b1; coactivator that augments the receptor's transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner and can have a profound impact on the final output of cellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. LRP16 is though to modulate ER&#x003b1; activity in the nucleus; in the present paper we have confirmed that a LRP16-GFP fusion protein localizes primarily to MCF-7 cell nuclei. We also report a new LRP16 ligand, K18, identified by yeast two-hybrid screening. K18 is a member of the family of intermediate filament proteins that contribute to cytoskeletal architecture. In the present study we report that K18 binds to and sequesters LRP16 in the cytoplasm, thus preventing its nuclear action and attenuating both E2-induction of ER&#x003b1; target genes and E2-stimulated cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells. These findings underscore the functional role of K18 in regulating the ER&#x003b1; signaling pathway.</p><p>LRP16, a member of the macro domain protein superfamily, contains a single stand-alone macro module in its C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that LRP16 is a non-redundant coactivator of both ER&#x003b1; and AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. LRP16 was also able to interact with another 4 nuclear receptors (NRs) <italic>in vitro</italic>, including estrogen receptor &#x003b2;(ER&#x003b2;), the glucocorticoid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &#x003b1; and &#x003b3;, and can efficiently amplify the transactivation of these NRs in a ligand-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our finding that K18 binds to and sequesters LRP16 in the cytoplasm suggests that differential tissue expression of K18 could constitute a new layer in the regulatory cascade of signaling pathways in which LRP16 participates.</p><p>Keratins (KRTs) provide mechanical stability to tissues, as evidenced by the range of pathological phenotypes seen in patients bearing mutations in epidermal keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The intermediate filament network in simple glandular epithelial cells predominantly consists of heterotypic complexes of KRTs K8 and K18. Additional evidence for a more widespread role of KRTs comes from mouse gene knockout studies. Double deletion of the genes encoding K18 and K19 results in complete loss of a functional cytokeratin skeleton and embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The assembly of intermediate filament involves several steps during which the &#x003b1;-helical rod domain of the cytokeratin molecules plays a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The head and the tail domains are not thought to be part of the filamentous backbone, and instead these protrude laterally and contribute to profilament and intermediate filament packing and to intermediate filament interaction with other cellular components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. By associating with signal transduction factors K18 may modulate both intracellular signaling and gene transcription. For example, K18 is known to bind specifically to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1(TNFR1)-associated death domain protein (TRADD) through its N-terminal region and prevent TRADD from binding to activated TNFR1, thus attenuating TNF-induced apoptosis in simple epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>We report here that K18 binding to LRP16 is primarily mediated by the C-terminal region of K18 and the single macro domain of LRP16. We used two independent approaches, including subcellular localization analysis of GFP-tagged LRP16 and cytoplasmic/nuclear LRP16 protein expression analyses, to demonstrate that ectopic K18 expression in MCF-7 cells sequesters LRP16 in the cytoplasm. Conversely, knockdown of <italic>K18 </italic>gene expression increased the nuclear localization of LRP16. By binding to and sequestering LRP16 in the cytoplasm, K18 prevents the nuclear action of LRP16 and attenuates ER&#x003b1; signaling, thus blunting estrogen-stimulated cell-cycle progression of ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cells.</p><p>Accumulating evidence from clinicopathological observations has shown that the level of <italic>K18 </italic>gene expression correlates inversely with the progression of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Several reports have proposed that downregulation of K18 might increase the invasiveness of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It was previously demonstrated that overexpression of K18 in the ER&#x003b1;-negative and highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line caused a marked reduction in the aggressiveness of the cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>but had no significant effect on cell growth rate. This change was accompanied by complete loss of the previously strong vimentin expression in the parent cell line and upregulation of adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, experimental studies and clinicopathological observations also revealed a significant association between K18 expression and the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells. Analysis of the association between K18 expression and different clinicopathological risk factors revealed that K18 expression is highly and significantly correlated with size (pT1-3), differentiation grade, and mitotic index of the primary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These parameters are a function of the proliferation rate of the primary tumor, and this suggests that there is a relationship between downregulation of K18 expression and increased proliferative activity. In addition, the expression of the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 is significantly associated with the downregulation of K18 in a subset of primary breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, cell culture experiments on bone-marrow micrometastases of breast cancer have indicated that most proliferating tumor cells lack detectable expression of K18 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These previous data suggested that K18 might make an important contribution to tumor metastasis as well as to tumor cell growth. In the present study we have demonstrated that, by blunting estrogen-stimulated ER&#x003b1; signaling activity, K18 can significantly suppress the growth response of MCF-7 cells to estrogen. We propose that the regulatory mechanism of ER&#x003b1; transactivation by the K18-LRP16 association might explain in part the relationship between K18 downregulation and increased proliferative activity of breast cancers. However, K18 loss is also associated with the metastasis of ER&#x003b1;-negative breast cancers (47), and it therefore appears likely that K18 can modulate breast cancer progression by more than one mechanism.</p><p>Oncogenesis in breast cancer commonly involves excess activation of ER&#x003b1; signaling. We previously reported that LRP16 mRNA is overexpressed in nearly 40% of all primary breast cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. LRP16 overexpression in breast cancer cells is tightly linked with cell proliferation and enhanced ER&#x003b1; activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As a functional suppressor of LRP16, K18 is frequently absent from different types of breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Excess activation of ER&#x003b1; function in tumor cells is commonly mediated by overexpression of ER&#x003b1; and/or its coactivators including LRP16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We now propose a further level of regulation that can modulate ER&#x003b1; function in breast cancer. Loss of K18 from ER&#x003b1;-positive breast tumor cells releases the functional activity of LRP16, and is thus likely to promote tumor cell proliferation. Tests that evaluate the subcellular localization of LRP16 in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast tumor cells therefore have potential in the categorization of different clinopathological stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, these findings provide evidence that K18 binding to LRP16 leads to cytoplasmic sequestration of LRP16. By determining the nuclear availability of the receptor coactivator LRP16, K18 can not only modulate the transcriptional activity of ER&#x003b1; in response to estrogen but can also govern estrogen-stimulated cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells. Loss of K18 from ER&#x003b1;-positive breast tumor cells releases the functional activity of LRP16, and such loss is thus likely to promote tumor proliferation. These findings underscore a functional role for K18 in regulating the ER&#x003b1; signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals, cell lines and small interfering RNA (siRNA)</title><p>17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).
