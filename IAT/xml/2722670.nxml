To improve the poor prognosis, it is necessary to diagnose esophageal SCC at early stages using new tumor markers. SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning) is suitable for large-scale screening of tumor antigens and has been applied for various types of human tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Tumor markers of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were screened by SEREX method. The presence of serum anti-makorin 1 (MKRN1) antibodies (s-MKRN1-Abs) was examined by Western blotting using bacterially expressed MKRN1 protein. The expression levels of MKRN1 mRNA in tissues were examined by RT-PCR. The biological activity of MKRN1 was examined by transfection of ras-NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts with MKRN1 cDNA. Major ubiquitinated proteins in MKRN1-transfected cells were identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin antibody followed by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>MKRN1 was identified as a novel SEREX antigen of esophageal SCC. Although a total of 18 (25%) of 73 patients with esophageal SCC had s-MKRN1-Abs, none of the 43 healthy donors had a detectable level of s-MKRN1-Abs. There was no correlation between the presence of s-MKRN1-Abs and clinicopathological variables other than histological grading. Well-differentiated tumors were associated significantly with the presence of s-MKRN1-Abs in the patients. The mRNA levels of MKRN1 were frequently higher in esophageal SCC tissues than in the peripheral normal esophageal mucosa. Stable transfection of ras-NIH3T3 cells with MKRN1 cDNA induced prominent morphological changes such as enlargement of the cell body and spreading. Ubiquitination of 80- and 82-kDa proteins were clearly observed in MKRN1-transfected cells but not in the parental cells, which were identified as L-FILIP (filamin A interacting protein 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MKRN1 is a novel SEREX antigen of esophageal SCC, and s-NKRN1-Abs can be a candidate of diagnostic markers of esophageal SCC with high specificity. It is plausible that MKRN1 is involved in carcinogenesis of the well-differentiated type of tumors possibly via ubiquitination of L-FILIP.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents one of the most malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The poor prognosis of this tumor is attributed largely to a delay in diagnosis. Several tumor markers have been used for the diagnosis of esophageal SCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, to improve the detection of esophageal SCC, new tumor markers are necessary. It has been known for several decades that the immune system is able to recognize tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This was developed by Sahin <italic>et al</italic>. to establish a new method called SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning), which involves the immunoscreening of cDNA libraries prepared from tumor specimens with autologous or allogeneic sera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since clones isolated by SEREX can be easily identified by nucleotide sequencing, SEREX is suitable for large-scale screening of tumor antigens. SEREX screening of several different human tumor types has identified many novel tumor antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A previous application of the SEREX method to esophageal cancer resulted in the identification of NY-ESO-1, a cancer-testis antigen expressed in various cancer cells but not in normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. SEREX analysis has also led to the isolation of several antigens with known cancer relatedness, including a mutated version of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, while the presence of antibodies to p53 in serum was associated with poor prognosis in esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We applied the SEREX methodology to esophageal SCC with the aim of adding to the catalogue of defined immunogenic proteins in human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this study, we report that makorin1 (MKRN1) is a new tumor antigen of esophageal SCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human esophageal carcinoma cDNA library</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethic Committee of Chiba University, Graduate School of Medicine.

MKRN1 locus maps to a conserved syntenic group near the T-cell receptor cluster in chromosome 7q34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. MKRN1 is widely expressed in mammals at high levels in the murine embryonic nervous system and adult testis. Thus far, several MKRN1-related genes have been reported, and MKRN1 is the ancestral founder of the MKRN1 gene family. This family encodes putative ribonucleoproteins with a distinct collection of four zinc-finger motifs followed by a RING zinc-finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is intrinsic to RING domain-containing molecules such as Mdm2 and c-Cbl. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that MKRN1 binds and promotes ubiquitination of TERT and subsequent proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, Hirotsune <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that a putative pseudogene-induced destabilization of MKRN1 led to defects of differentiation such as polycystic kidneys and bone deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The presence of serum MKRN1 antibodies (s-MKRN1-Abs) in cancer patients was examined by Western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). s-MKRN1-Abs were frequently observed in patients with esophageal SCC (25%) and colon carcinoma (38%) but not in healthy donors. Even in patients with early-stage (T1) esophageal tumors, s-MKRN1-Abs were positive for 3 (16%) of 19 patients (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, s-MKRN1-Abs can be a candidate of diagnostic markers of esophageal SCC with low false positive rates.</p><p>There was no correlation between the presence of s-MKRN1-Abs and clinicopathological variables except histological grading (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Well-differentiated type tumors were observed more frequently in the patients with s-MKRN1-Abs than in the patients without s-MKRN1-Abs. This is consistent with the report of Hirotsune <italic>et al</italic>. that MKRN1 has a crucial role in differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of MKRN1 mRNA was frequently higher in esophageal SCC tissues than in the peripheral normal esophageal mucosa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Densitometric analysis revealed that the relative expression levels of MKRN1 versus &#x003b2;-actin mRNA in esophageal SCC were approximately 2.5-fold higher than in the normal esophageal mucosa. This elevated expression may, in part, account for the development of serum antibodies, and give a rationale of application of s-MKRN1-Abs as a tumor marker.</p><p>Stable transfection of ras-NIH3T3 cells with MKRN1 cDNA showed prominent morphological changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which resembled phenotypic reversion of ras-NIH3T3 cells to NIH3T3-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This suggests an effect of MKRN1 on actin cytoskeleton because such changes were frequently associated with reorganization of actin stress fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, ubiquitination of 80- and 82-kDa proteins was induced by transfection with two MKRN1-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Mass spectrometry revealed that these ubiquitinated proteins are L-FILIP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). FILIP interacts with filamin A, a component of stress fibers, and induces degradation of filamin A, leading to alteration of cell shape and decrease in cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, MKRN1-induced ubiquitination of L-FILIP followed by degradation with proteasome system may explain the prominent morphological changes in MKRN1-transfected cells as well as the effects on differentiation.</p><p>The expression of MKRN1 is increased in half (5 out of 10 cases) but not all esophageal SCC tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, it is implausible that MKRN1 has an indispensable role in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, involvement in differentiation and the effects on the cytoskeleton via L-FILIP suggest that MKRN1 has a key role in a certain type of esophageal carcinogenesis. Suppression of MKRN1 activity might be a novel strategy for esophageal SCC therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is plausible that MKRN1 is involved in differentiation and carcinogenesis of a certain type of esophageal SCC. s-MKRN1-Abs can be a candidate of diagnostic markers of esophageal SCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IPTG: isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside; ORF: open reading frame; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-PCR; SCC: squamous cell carcinoma; SEREX: serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning; s-MKRN1-Abs: serum anti-MKRN1 antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HS carried out gene manipulation and the statistical analysis.
