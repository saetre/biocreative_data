Inclusion bodies of &#x003b1;-glucosidase started to disaggregate after arrest of protein synthesis in a ClpB and DnaK dependent manner, followed by degradation or reactivation.

The metabolic burden of the synthesis of recombinant and stress proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] may result in stop of the synthesis of components of the protein synthesising machinery, and ribosomes may be actively degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most commonly, the heat-shock response is induced, as the recombinant proteins &#x02013; unable to fold properly &#x02013; overload the chaperone network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While appropriate execution of stress responses is of vital importance for the host <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the high metabolic load of strong foreign protein production can prevent proper adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The stress situation can become permanent, and only few cellular proteins except heat-shock proteins are synthesised.</p><p>Analogously, incubation at extreme temperatures is characterised by near exclusive heat-shock protein synthesis as a consequence of extensive aggregation of cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To deal with this challenge, the chaperone DnaK changes its function: Under physiological conditions, DnaK promotes folding of kinetically trapped intermediates by ATP-dependent partial unfolding, but at high temperatures it becomes a holding chaperone and binds its client proteins permanently, unable to release them in a folding-competent conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are intrinsic holding chaperones of multimeric structure. The multimers dissociate at high temperatures into smaller entities for exposure of client binding sites. After binding of misfolded client proteins, the sHsps form large globular assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thereby, they prevent irreversible aggregation, and under permissive conditions transfer the client proteins to ATP-dependent chaperones for refolding or degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Also the <italic>E. coli </italic>sHsps, IbpA and IbpB, reversibly dissociate upon prolonged incubation at 50&#x000b0;C from multimers of 2 &#x02013; 3 MDa to monomers in the case of IbpA and to oligomers of 650 &#x02013; 700 kDa in the case of IbpB, exposing hydrophobic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. IbpA and IbpB are highly homologous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but show distinct features. While IbpB is soluble when overexpressed alone, prevents inactivation or aggregation of proteins upon heat and oxidative stress <italic>in vitro </italic>and facilitates their subsequent refolding by DnaK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a role for IbpA in mediating the transfer of IbpB and other proteins into the insoluble cell fraction has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. IbpA and IbpB have been found associated with thermally aggregated cellular proteins and with inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The resolubilisation of protein aggregates, which <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>is mediated by ClpB together with DnaK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], can be retarded both in strains overexpressing <italic>ibpAB </italic>as well as in some cases in strains lacking <italic>ibpAB </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. IbpA and IbpB might control the reversible transition between soluble and aggregated forms that account for the plasticity of inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The role of IbpA/IbpB in cell protection is less clear. Overexpression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>confers resistance to heat and other stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but deletion of the <italic>ibpAB </italic>operon does not affect growth even at high temperatures. Only recovery from prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures such as 50&#x000b0;C are impaired in an <italic>ibpAB </italic>mutant, and growth of <italic>ibpAB dnaK </italic>double mutants at high temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study we exploit the similarities between incubation at extreme temperature and production of aggregation-protein proteins to examine the functions of the small heat-shock proteins IbpA/IbpB in inclusion body metabolism and stress relief during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production. The enzyme &#x003b1;-glucosidase from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>produced in recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>is a suitable model system. It accumulates as inclusion bodies and induces the heat-shock response including prolonged expression of the <italic>ibpAB </italic>operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is, however, also able to fold into its native conformation in <italic>E. coli </italic>if produced at low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], enabling the study of in-vivo-reactivation kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>IbpA/IbpB levels during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production with and without <italic>IbpAB </italic>coexpression</title><p>The concentrations of IbpA and IbpB were estimated from the proteomes of cells producing &#x003b1;-glucosidase for two hours. The <italic>ibpAB </italic>operon was induced already during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production at 30&#x000b0;C, with moderately higher levels at elevated temperatures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), whereas no IbpA/IbpB was detected in the plasmid-free strain. The <italic>ibpAB </italic>operon including its own promoter was inserted immediately downstream of the &#x003b1;-glucosidase gene into the plasmid pKK177-3/GLUCP1, expecting overexpression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>from its heat-shock promoter and as a tricistronic operon together with &#x003b1;-glucosidase. This plasmid gave ten and four times higher concentrations of IbpA and IbpB, respectively, at 30&#x000b0;C, and the sHsp level increased further in proportion to temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). With <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression, the IbpA accumulation was intensified more strongly and the ratio of IbpA to IbpB rose from 2&#x02013;3 to 6&#x02013;8. As the two sHsp may exert different functions, this change need to be accounted for. Depending on the temperature, overexpression increased the concentrations of IbpA and IbpB relative to their concentrations without overexpression four to more than 25 times (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This wide range of concentrations served to investigate the impact of IbpA/IbpB on &#x003b1;-glucosidase production and in-vivo-reactivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated levels of IbpA/IbpB increase &#x003b1;-glucosidase accumulation</title><p>&#x003b1;-Glucosidase was produced in <italic>E. coli </italic>MC4100 with and without <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression and in an otherwise isogenic <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant. &#x003b1;-Glucosidase accumulation was enhanced at elevated IbpA/IbpB level and reduced in the deletion strain in a temperature dependent manner; the effect was strongest at high temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). At temperatures below 30&#x000b0;C, the IbpA/IbpB levels did not influence the amount of &#x003b1;-glucosidase, which accumulated mainly in the soluble cell fraction in active form (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Post-induction growth of the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant was retarded at higher temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), although there was no impact of the <italic>ibpAB</italic> deletion on growth without induction of &#x003b1;-glucosidase synthesis (not shown) or concomitant to production at lower temperature.</p><p>Thus, the sHsp are effective only under conditions that favour inclusion body formation.</p></sec><sec><title>IbpA/IbpB attenuate accumulation of stress proteins during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production</title><p>To study the impact of IbpA/IbpB on cellular reactions during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production, the proteomes of cultures producing &#x003b1;-glucosidase for two hours at various temperatures were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (shown for 42&#x000b0;C in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). While chaperones assisting de-novo protein folding such as GroEL and GroES were not significantly influenced by IbpA/IbpB level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the DnaK concentration showed a negative correlation with IbpA/IbpB availability at 42&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The disaggregating chaperone ClpB reached higher concentrations in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant at all temperatures, in addition to the induction at elevated temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). ClpB accumulation was repressed, however, in the wildtype strain at 30&#x000b0;C, and with overexpression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>both at 30 and 37&#x000b0;C. As the overall level of IbpA/IbpB was low at these temperatures, and other cellular proteins were not affected, this repression is unlikely to be a passive effect of the metabolic burden of <italic>ibpAB </italic>expression.</p><p>A similar pattern was found for enolase, which showed higher levels at elevated temperatures only in the deletion mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As enolase is a glycolytic enzyme as well as a putative structural component of the RNA degradosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], we examined another metabolic enzyme, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNP), another RNA degradosome member. The positions on the 2D gels of further degradosome components, RNAse E and RhlB, are not listed in the database. While PNP accumulated to higher concentrations at elevated temperatures and reached highest levels in the deletion mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), GAPDH concentration was not significantly affected by temperature and had a slightly lower concentration in the <italic>ibpAB</italic> deletion mutant at 42&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, enolase seems to be induced as a part of a stress response rather than as a metabolic enzyme.</p><p>A typical house-keeping protein, the translational elongation factor EF-Tu, had a two to three times higher level at 42&#x000b0;C than at lower temperatures, but the concentrations were not effected by IbpA/IbpB level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Thus, while housekeeping proteins are not influenced by IbpA/IbpB levels, the accumulation of ClpB and components of the RNA degradosome was intensified in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant and attenuated with <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression. This indicates that IbpA/IbpB can relieve the cells of the stress encountered during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production.</p></sec><sec><title>Impact of chaperones on in-vivo-reactivation and degradation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase from inclusion bodies</title><p>The impact of chaperones on the metabolism of &#x003b1;-glucosidase inclusion bodies was examined in wildtype <italic>E. coli </italic>MC4100 with or without overexpression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>and in isogenic strains carrying deletions of <italic>ibpAB</italic>, <italic>clpB</italic>, or <italic>dnaK</italic>. After production of &#x003b1;-glucosidase at 37&#x000b0;C for two hours, the cultures were treated with tetracycline to arrest protein synthesis and transferred to 30&#x000b0;C to initiate disaggregation of inclusion bodies as reported for other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the wildtype and <italic>ibpAB </italic>strains, disintegration of inclusion bodies, increase of &#x003b1;-glucosidase activity, and higher concentrations of &#x003b1;-glucosidase in the soluble cell fraction could be detected already within 20 min; the disaggregation was accompanied by degradation (cf. below). While the concentration of &#x003b1;-glucosidase was 10&#x02013;25% higher in <italic>dnaK </italic>and <italic>clpB</italic> deletion mutants than in the wildtype strain, the specific activities obtained during the production phase were less than 0.1 Umg<sup>-1</sup>, compared to about 0.3 Umg<sup>-1 </sup>in the other strains (data not shown). Importantly, neither disaggregation, nor reactivation nor degradation took place in these mutants within two hours, and the concentration of &#x003b1;-glucosidase inclusion bodies remained unchanged.</p><p>The kinetics of disaggregation, reactivation and degradation of inclusion bodies at modified levels of IbpA/IbpB, i.e. with deletion or overexpression of <italic>ibpAB</italic>, were investigated as a function of temperature. After production of &#x003b1;-glucosidase at 37&#x000b0;C, the cultures were transferred to various temperatures. As protein synthesis was arrested before the transfer, the initial IbpA/IbpB level did not depend on the disaggregation temperature. The &#x003b1;-glucosidase concentration in the insoluble cell fractions of all cultures decreased with time, but with different kinetics. In the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain, the disaggregation kinetics were not influenced by the incubation temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;D</xref>). With overexpression of <italic>ibpAB</italic>, the removal of &#x003b1;-glucosidase from the inclusion bodies was fastest at 15&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), proceeding with similar rates as in the other strains. The disaggregation was, however, progressively slower at 30 and 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref>). At 37&#x000b0;C, &#x003b1;-glucosidase was largely preserved in the insoluble cell fraction of the <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpressing strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Thus, disaggregation was retarded at higher temperatures in an IbpA/IbpB dependent manner.</p><p>Disaggregation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase inclusion bodies was accompanied by an increase of the specific &#x003b1;-glucosidase activities in the cell extracts. The reactivation showed a clear temperature optimum in the range of 24 to 30&#x000b0;C, most evident with wildtype levels of IbpA/IbpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F,G</xref>). The specific &#x003b1;-glucosidase activities increased sevenfold up to 2 Umg<sup>-1 </sup>within 3 h, whereas at both higher and lower temperatures of 37&#x000b0;C and 15&#x000b0;C, only 0.5&#x02013;0.75 Umg<sup>-1 </sup>were obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,H</xref>). Both, <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression and deletion, did not improve the maximum reactivation yields. The resolubilisation, measured as an increase of the &#x003b1;-glucosidase concentrations in the soluble cell fraction, showed very similar kinetics as the reactivation (data not shown).</p><p>A large part of the disaggregated &#x003b1;-glucosidase was subjected to proteolysis: within three hours after arrest of protein synthesis, 30 &#x02013; 40% of &#x003b1;-glucosidase were lost due to degradation at 15&#x000b0;C in all three strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>), and in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant at all temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I&#x02013;L</xref>). Similar to the effect on disaggregation, higher <italic>ibpAB</italic> expression levels or elevated temperatures synergistically retarded degradation, reducing the loss to 10% with <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>). IbpA/IbpB thus influenced disaggregation, resolubilisation, reactivation and degradation in a temperature-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>IbpA/IbpB favour reactivation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase produced at high temperature</title><p>As IbpA/IbpB are designed for action at extreme temperature, &#x003b1;-glucosidase inclusion bodies were produced at 42&#x000b0;C, followed by arrest of protein synthesis and incubation at 30&#x000b0;C. The production temperature did not influence the initial disaggregation kinetics (data not shown). About one third of the &#x003b1;-glucosidase produced concomitant to <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression was resistant to disaggregation after incubation over night, while it was eliminated apart from traces in the other strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Also the removal of other components of the inclusion bodies, which appear as smear in the SDS PAGE of the insoluble cell fractions, were impaired in the overexpressing strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), resembling the core inclusion bodies that remain with other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], whereas the inclusion bodies produced at low IbpA/IbpB levels were completely dissolved after prolonged incubation. Only outer membrane proteins (indicated by arrows) that result from coprecipitation of cell debris during inclusion body preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] remain at constant level in the insoluble cell fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Thus, the delay of disaggregation by IbpA/IbpB is not specific to &#x003b1;-glucosidase, but effects also cellular proteins in a similar way.</p><p>Production at 37&#x000b0;C resulted in degradation of 20% of &#x003b1;-glucosidase during incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 3 h in the wildtype strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref>). After production at 42&#x000b0;C, however, there was less than 10% of &#x003b1;-glucosidase lost during reactivation at 30&#x000b0;C with or without <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, degradation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase after arrest of protein synthesis was predetermined by the preceding production temperature. The protection was dependent on IbpA/IbpB availability, as in the deletion mutant the loss of &#x003b1;-glucosidase was substantial regardless of the production temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, disaggregated &#x003b1;-glucosidase was quantitatively transferred to the soluble cell fraction after production at 42&#x000b0;C concomitant to <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression, and became the most prominent band in the gel. The band intensity increased from 2 to 7% of the total cellular protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, significantly less &#x003b1;-glucosidase could be detected in the soluble fraction of the deletion mutant even after prolonged incubation, finally corresponding to only 4% of cellular protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003b1;-glucosidase activity increased during the initial reactivation phase with similar slopes with and without <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Stationary level of activity was reached earlier, however, in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant and in the wildtype strain without overexpression. Hence the final activities in these strains were independent of the production temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). In contrast, the activity continued to increase for about 12 h after arrest of protein synthesis subsequent to &#x003b1;-glucosidase production at 42&#x000b0;C with <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), resulting in higher activity yields than obtained in the wild type strain. The final &#x003b1;-glucosidase activities after production with overexpression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>at 42&#x000b0;C were two times higher than after production at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). IbpA/IbpB can thus ameliorate reactivation of inclusion bodies produced at high temperature.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Intensified stress response and growth impairment in <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain</title><p>Impairment of cell growth by <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion is observed only under conditions characterised by depletion of free DnaK, such as under extremely high temperature or artificially controlled low level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Accumulation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase as inclusion bodies mimics the aspect of permanently impaired protein folding, and growth impairment during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production was more intense in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>mutant. Moreover, DnaK controls the expression of heat-shock genes. Consequently, chromosomal <italic>ibpAB </italic>and other heat-shock genes were induced during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production. Especially in the deletion strain, lack of IbpA/IbpB was compensated by enhanced accumulation of the disaggregating chaperone ClpB. Also the levels of two components of the RNA degradosome, enolase and PNP, were elevated in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain at 42&#x000b0;C. Enolase homologues have been reported to be induced by heat shock in a variety of species, including <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but there was no indication that the <italic>E. coli eno </italic>gene can be induced by heat-shock or high temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Both ClpB and DnaK are essential for disaggregation and de novo protein folding</title><p>ClpB and DnaK accumulated to higher levels in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain. These chaperones cooperate with IbpA/IbpB in a "disaggregation triad" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Each chaperone, ClpB and DnaK, was essential for reactivation as well as degradation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase, indicating that both processes operate after disaggregation of the inclusion bodies. With other protein aggregates, varying dependencies on DnaK and ClpB for degradation or reactivation were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. To the aggregate-specific factors influencing the chaperone demand for disaggregation <italic>in vitro </italic>belong their sizes and accessible surface areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Also the substrate specificity of chaperones may influence the protein-specific requirements.</p><p>The impaired disaggregation in <italic>clpB </italic>and <italic>dnaK </italic>mutants reduced the accumulation of active &#x003b1;-glucosidase already during production, and a negative impact of the <italic>clpB </italic>deletion on <italic>de novo </italic>folding has been observed also with a number of other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Resolubilisation from aggregates might thus be a general route to active protein, in accordance with a quantitative model of inclusion body formation kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This constitutes a major difference to the irreversible aggregation at extreme temperatures, when the client release of DnaK is retarded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>IbpA/IbpB disburden DnaK and reduce degradation</title><p>Ongoing attempts to fold &#x003b1;-glucosidase will finally result in its degradation. IbpA/IbpB, which are postulated to recognise similar traits of aggregation prone proteins as DnaK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], will withdraw &#x003b1;-glucosidase from the futile cycle of DnaK binding and release. Thereby, IbpA/IbpB on the one hand disburden the DnaK system to make resources available to repress stress responses, and on the other hand protect &#x003b1;-glucosidase from degradation. These functions might be related, as the heat-shock response includes also proteases that may accumulate to lower levels with <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression. Deletion of <italic>ibpAB</italic>, conversely, lowers the amount of &#x003b1;-glucosidase and other recombinant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Consequently, unlike to incubation at 50&#x000b0;C, <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion did not increase aggregation during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production, rather reduced accumulation of insoluble &#x003b1;-glucosidase. Functional replacement of DnaK by IbpA/IbpB is also reflected by the amount of DnaK associated with inclusion bodies and aggregated cellular proteins, that is increased in the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion mutant and decreased by <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], unpublished results].</p></sec><sec><title>IbpA/IbpB prevent degradation in a temperature-dependent manner</title><p>Disaggregation and degradation of inclusion bodies took place after arrest of protein synthesis. The disaggregation at and above 30&#x000b0;C was retarded by high levels of IbpA/IbpB. In wildtype cells, IbpA/IbpB accumulation is therefore restricted to requiring conditions, e.g. by degradation of IbpA/IbpB after dissociation from protein aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or repression of <italic>ibpAB </italic>expression despite an otherwise active heat-shock response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Temperatures during both, formation and disaggregation of inclusion bodies, were important for the rate of disaggregation and yield of reactivation. Irreversible structural changes of IbpA/IbpB at low temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] may impair the protective function, making the disaggregation kinetics at 15&#x000b0;C independent of the IbpA/IbpB level. Hence with other systems, depending on the conditions, no influence of the <italic>ibpAB</italic> deletion on disaggregation kinetics or even delayed disaggregation in the mutant were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The reactivation rate is determined by the difference of disaggregation and degradation rates, which are influenced in parallel by the availability of the sHsps. Hence reactivation was hardly effected by <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion or overexpression, in accordance with observation for other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>With high temperature during production, degradation during the subsequent disaggregation phase was nearly completely avoided in <italic>ibpAB </italic>proficient strains. In the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain, on the contrary, production temperature did not ameliorate the recovery of soluble &#x003b1;-glucosidase. Consequently, the reactivation phase was prolonged with higher IbpA/IbpB concentrations, and the final &#x003b1;-glucosidase activities were increased from 4 in the wildtype cells to 5 Umg<sup>-1 </sup>with <italic>ibpAB </italic>overexpression. As the yield of reactivated protein is more important for heat-stress survival than the rate of disaggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], the reduction of degradation may also contribute to the cell protective function of the sHsps.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Deletion of <italic>ibpAB </italic>renders <italic>E. coli </italic>more susceptible to growth impairment by production of &#x003b1;-glucosidase. Without recombinant protein production, <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion affects growth only at extreme temperatures or in combination with mutations of <italic>dnaK</italic>. Thus, production of an aggregation prone protein constitutes a good model system to study the functions of IbpA/IbpB under non-lethal conditions. Two major functions were found for IbpA/IbpB: First, the sHsps protect cells during &#x003b1;-glucosidase production and disburden the DnaK system. In the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain, insufficient free DnaK was available to control ClpB accumulation, which was strongly intensified. Also enolase and PNP showed a similar pattern.</p><p>Second, IbpA/IbpB reduce degradation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase during disaggregation from inclusion bodies. The IbpA/IbpB function depends on elevated temperature. Improved reactivation and protection from degradation were found after production at higher temperature, in accordance with the known heat-activation of sHsps. Also during disaggregation, a higher temperature was beneficial, whereas no protection from degradation was found at 15&#x000b0;C. In the <italic>ibpAB </italic>deletion strain, however, removal of inclusion bodies was accelerated, possibly due to the higher levels of ClpB and DnaK that were found to be essential for reactivation and degradation of &#x003b1;-glucosidase. Thus, the sHsp level is in a delicate balance: IbpA/IbpB are required to protect the cell, but abundant IbpA/IbpB impede the necessary adaptation and retards removal of aggregates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and Plasmids</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>MC4100 <italic>araD139 &#x00394; (argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 relA1 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsR </italic>and JGT17 MC4100 &#x00394; <italic>ibpAB </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] were used to produce the yeast &#x003b1;-glucosidase encoded on the plasmid pKK177-3/GLUCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].
