Here, we have investigated the regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription. We identified the promoter region and major transcription start sites of mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and found two important <italic>cis</italic>-elements within the core promoter region. One is an E2F binding site, and the other is a binding site for an as yet unidentified factor. Point mutations in the two <italic>cis</italic>-elements decreased promoter activity in both non-transformed and transformed cells. Thus, both sites play a critical role in regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription in proliferating cells. Treatment with trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, increased <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity in G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub>-arrested NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, the decrease in promoter activity induced by expression of E2F-1 and Rb was reversed by trichostatin A treatment of Saos-2 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that transcription of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is regulated in a complex fashion by E2F and other transcription factors through E2F-Rb-HDAC-dependent and -independent pathways.

DNA methylation is correlated with gene silencing and condensation of chromatin structure. Inhibition of transcription by DNA methylation occurs either because methyl groups on cytosine limit the access of transcription factors to DNA binding sites or by the recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) via methyl-CpG binding proteins such as MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Patterns of DNA methylation are generated during development by DNA methyltransferases such as Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c7">7</xref>). Dnmt1 prefers hemi-methylated DNA over non-methylated DNA as a substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c8">8</xref>), and expression of Dnmt1 increases during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c10">10</xref>). Dnmt1 is recruited to replication foci through protein interactions involving the DMAP1 binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c11">11</xref>), the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c12">12</xref>) and the replication foci targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c10">10</xref>). We have recently found a direct interaction between Dnmt1 and MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c13">13</xref>), which may confer accurate maintenance of DNA methylation patterns through stepwise interactions during DNA replication.</p><p>Aberrant CpG methylation has been observed in several tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c14">14</xref>). Some CpG islands are hypermethylated in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c16">16</xref>), suggesting that a fundamental disruption of methylation control has occurred. This aberrant hypermethylation can act in a manner analogous to deletion or mutation of growth inhibitory genes, thereby producing a selective growth advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c16">16</xref>). Dnmt1 has been shown to act as an oncogene in cultured fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c17">17</xref>). Further, NIH 3T3 cells transformed by Dnmt1 show enhanced DNA methylation, and these cells form tumors when transplanted into nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c17">17</xref>). Conditional expression of c-<italic>fos</italic> up-regulates expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, resulting in morphological transformation of rat fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c18">18</xref>). Interestingly, a low level of Dnmt1 over-expression leads to cell transformation whereas a high level is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c17">17</xref>). In addition, s.c. injection of the Dnmt1 inhibitor 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine decreases polyp number in Min mice that are heterozygous for the multiple intestinal neoplasia mutation of the adenomatosis polyposis coli (<italic>Apc</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c19">19</xref>). Thus <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression must be tightly regulated during normal cell growth.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription are poorly understood. Expression of immediate early genes such as c-<italic>fos</italic> increases drastically within 1 h after serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c21">21</xref>). However, expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA varies in a cell cycle-dependent manner reaching a maximum during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c9">9</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is controlled not only by c-fos but also by other transcription factors. Expression of human <italic>DNMT1</italic> is increased by binding of Jun homodimers or Fos&#x02013;Jun hetrodimers to a region located between exons 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c22">22</xref>). Nuclear run-on assays in BALB&#x0002f;c 3T3 and myoblast G8 cells indicated that the transcriptional activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is constant throughout the cell cycle and during cellular differentiation, suggesting that mRNA levels may be modulated at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c23">23</xref>). These contradictory findings stimulated us to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>.</p><p>The expression of many replication-related genes, such as <italic>PCNA</italic>, <italic>cyclin E</italic>, <italic>pol</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>E2F-1</italic> and <italic>cdc6</italic>, is regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>). The transcriptional activity of E2F is controlled by binding of Rb family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c25">25</xref>). The Rb&#x0002f;E2F complex is disrupted by Rb kinases (cyclin D&#x0002f;cdk4, cdk6 and cyclin E&#x0002f;cdk2) and by simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen, resulting in activation of E2F target genes such as <italic>cyclin E</italic> and <italic>E2F-1</italic> and entry into S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c27">27</xref>). The promoters of <italic>cyclin E</italic> and <italic>p107</italic> contain E2F binding sites, and repression of their expression by Rb has been shown to be HDAC-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>). However, the expression of other E2F target genes, <italic>PCNA</italic>, <italic>E2F-1</italic> and <italic>b-Myb</italic>, is insensitive to treatment with trichostatin A (TSA). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c28">28</xref>). For each E2F target gene, the pathways regulating transcription are classified as either HDAC dependent or independent.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the transcriptional regulation of mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic>. We demonstrate that transcription of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during cell cycle progression is modulated by two <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the promoter region. We propose that a combination of E2F-Rb-HDAC-dependent and -independent pathways control <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription during cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>COS-7 cells, NIH 3T3 cells, 3Y1-B clone 1-6 (RCB 0488), SR-3Y1 (JCRB 0742), HR-3Y1 (JCRB 0743), E1A-3Y1 (JCRB 0738) and SV-3Y1 (JCRB 0735) cells and Saos-2 cells (RCB 0428) were all maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Nine hours after addition of serum, about 7&#x00025; of cells had entered S phase, whereas after 12 h, 23&#x00025; of cells had entered S phase. After 16 h, 74&#x00025; of cells had progressed into S phase, and then passed through S phase at 20 h. Similar results on FACScan analysis were obtained from two independent experiments. At 0 h, the quiescent cells had very low levels of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, <italic>cyclin D1</italic> and <italic>cyclin E</italic> mRNA, but expression of all three genes increased 20- to 30-fold following serum stimulation. <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>cyclin D1</italic> mRNA remained constant following their initial accumulation, whereas <italic>cyclin E</italic> mRNA declined as cells proceeded through S phase. <italic>cyclin D1</italic> mRNA started to accumulate from mid-G<sub>1</sub> phase, while <italic>Dnmt1</italic> RNA started to accumulate from late G<sub>1</sub> to early S phase. These results indicate that the transcription of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was activated at late G<sub>1</sub> in our system.</p><p>To examine <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression in transformed cells, total RNA was prepared from rat-derived 3Y1 (WT), RSV-transformed 3Y1 (SR-3Y1), Ha-ras-transformed 3Y1 (HR-3Y1), E1A-transformed 3Y1 (E1A-3Y1) and SV40-transformed 3Y1 cells (SV-3Y1 cells). The transformed cells had approximately 2- to 3-fold more <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA than the parental wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f1">1</xref>C), suggesting that a modest increase in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA is associated with cell transformation.

To confirm this experimentally, RNase protection assays were performed using RNA from NIH 3T3 cells. Probes used were an 80 base fragment directly downstream from the ATG in somatic exon 1 (probe 80) and a 380 base fragment spanning from 300 bases upstream of the ATG to 80 bases downstream of the ATG (probe 380) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f2">2</xref>B). Probe 80 is a positive control for the molecular weight of hybridized RNAs. As expected, probe 80 detected an 80 bp fragment of somatic exon 1 (arrowhead in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f2">2</xref>C). Probe 380 produced a major signal at &#x0223c;190 bp (arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f2">2</xref>C). This result shows that transcription is initiated around 110 bases upstream from the translation start codon ATG. To further confirm the transcription start sites, northern blot analysis was performed using two probes, one of which hybridizes 610 bases upstream from the initiator sequence (probe 1) and the other (probe 2) corresponding to the catalytic domain in the coding sequence of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>. Probe 1 detected no <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA, whereas probe 2 detected a 5.2 kb band, which is the major transcript size of somatic <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f2">2</xref>D). These data indicate that the major transcription start sites are between &#x02013;123 and &#x02013;117.</p></sec><sec><title>Two major <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the core promoter of <italic>Dnmt1</italic></title><p>To identify the promoter region essential for transcriptional regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during cell proliferation, we transfected COS-7 cells with luciferase reporter constructs containing deletions of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> 5&#x02032;-flanking region. The luciferase activity from plasmids containing 2061, 736, 500 or 300 bp upstream of the translation start codon of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was 25- to 40-fold higher than that of a control plasmid without insert (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>A). However, the luciferase activity of a plasmid containing 100 bp of 5&#x02032; sequence of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was similar to control levels. To confirm that the promoter activity of the upstream sequence was unidirectional, we constructed a luciferase reporter plasmid containing 736 bp of upstream sequence in the reverse orientation (R736). The luciferase activity of R736 was comparable to the control levels. These data indicate that the 300 bases of the 5&#x02032; flanking region of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is a core promoter sequence. Additionally, we examined the 1.5 kb region upstream from the oocyte-specific ATG codon using luciferase assays. No luciferase activity was detected in COS-7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the oocyte-specific form of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may be regulated by an oocyte-specific regulatory mechanism.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f1">1</xref>, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The core promoter region of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> contained four putative E2F binding sites (sites A&#x02013;D, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f2">2</xref>A). To test the possibility that transcription of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may also be regulated by E2F transcription factors, we analyzed the luciferase activity of the core promoter sequence of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> by creating point mutations in the putative E2F binding sites. Relative to wild-type sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>B, column 1), point mutations at either site A or site C decreased the promoter activity by 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>B, columns 2 and 4). However, mutation in either site B or site D reduced the promoter activity only slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>B, columns 3 and 5). The combination of several point mutations showed that mutations of both site A and site C further decreased the promoter activity by &#x0223c;60&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>B, columns 7, 8 and 10). Other plasmids containing mutations in either site A or site C produced 60&#x00025; of the promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>B, columns 6 and 9). These findings showed that the putative E2F binding site A and site C in the core promoter play a significant role in the activation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription.</p><p>To confirm that these decreases in the promoter activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> are not specific to COS-7 cells, we also analyzed <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity of site A and site C in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>C). The decrease in promoter activity in NIH 3T3 cells was similar to that observed in COS-7 cells, indicating that these two <italic>cis</italic>-elements are crucial for the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in proliferating cells.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter activity in oncogenic transformed cells</title><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f1">1</xref>C, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA increased approximately 2-fold in transformed cells. To examine whether this accumulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA reflects altered promoter activity, we transfected the luciferase reporter construct containing the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter (300-luc in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>A) into transformed 3Y1 cells. All transformed cells showed at least 30 times more transctiptional activity than parental 3Y1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>A), indicating that the promoter activity is increased in the transformed cells.</p><p>E2F trans-activity is inactivated by binding to Rb, but it is activated by releasing Rb on phosphorylation of Rb by Rb kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>). The Rb-E2F complex is also disrupted by SV40 large T antigen or expression of a pocket domain mutant form of Rb which cannot bind to E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>). To determine whether up-regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA is dependent on E2F binding to site A and site C in the promoter, we measured luciferase activity of mutated <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoters in SV-3Y1 cells which have been transformed with SV40 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>B). In SV-3Y1 cells, the wild-type <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter had 30-fold greater promoter activity than parental 3Y1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>A). The constructs containing mutations in site A (300A), site C (300C) or in both (300AC) showed lower promoter activity than the wild-type construct (300) in SV-3Y1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>B). These results indicate that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription may be activated by SV40 large T antigen through sites A and C. Therefore, transcription of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is likely activated by E2F transcription factors binding to sites A and C in the promoter, and both putative E2F binding sites A and C are required to enhance promoter activity in SV-3Y1 cells. These observations are unlikely to result from differences between species, because the core promoter region is highly conserved across mouse and rat <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>C).</p><p>Interestingly, the sequence of site C in mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic> matches exactly with that of site C in rat, but the sequence of site A differs between mouse and rat. Taken together, our findings suggest that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription is controlled through two <italic>cis</italic>-elements in both normal and transformed cells. It is possible, however, that factors other than E2F are responsible for activation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression through these <italic>cis</italic>-elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Two distinct transcription factors bind to two <italic>cis</italic>-elements</title><p>To examine whether E2F binds to sites A and C in the promoter of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, we performed EMSA using oligonucleotides corresponding to site A or site C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>C, probes A and C) and to the E2F consensus binding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c36">36</xref>). Binding activity to probe A was detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>A, lane 2), and the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes disappeared when unlabeled probe A was used as a competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>A, lane 3). However, binding was present when the sequence of site A was mutated in the competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>A, lane 6), consistent with the luciferase assays using the point mutated constructs shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f3">3</xref>. Moreover, neither the E2F consensus oligonucleotide nor the site C oligonucleotide was able to compete against probe A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that E2F does not bind site A. To confirm this, we repeated EMSA under another condition in which poly(dI&#x02013;dC) was used as a blocking reagent. In this condition, the major shifted band was competed off by probe A but not by mutated probe A, E2F consensus oligonucleotide or Sp-1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6). EMSA with mutant probe A showed no detectable specific shift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>B, lane 7), findings that indicate that a transcription factor other than E2F binds to site A. To examine this further, we analyzed whole cell extracts from NIH 3T3 cells by EMSA, using the site A and E2F consensus oligonucleotides as probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>C). The mobility shift of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes using site A differed from that of those using the E2F consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that E2F transcription factors are unable to bind to site A. The oligonucleotides corresponding to site A differ from the Sp-1 consensus sequence (G&#x0002f;T)GGGCGGG(GGC&#x0002f;AAT) and Sp-1&#x0002f;3 consensus sequence (GGCAAGGGGGAGGTG), which lie upstream of site A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c37">37</xref>), and also from the AP-1 consensus sequence TGACTCA. As expected, the protein bound to site A was not competed off by the Sp-1 consensus sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>B, lane 6). EMSA using the Sp-1&#x0002f;3 binding element previously detected three major bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c37">37</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that the protein bound to site A is a factor other than E2F, Sp-1 or AP-1. On the other hand, site C oligonucleotide specifically inhibited formation of E2F consensus oligonucleotide&#x02013;protein complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>C, lane 4) and vice versa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f5">5</xref>D, lane 4). These data collectively suggest that the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter may be activated by both E2F at site C and another unidentified transcription factor at site A.</p></sec><sec><title>E2F-1 activates the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter</title><p>The family of E2F transcription factors consists of E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4 and E2F-5, all of which possess DNA binding activity, and E2F-6, which does not have a transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c24">24</xref>). Individual E2F members recognize specific binding sequences of target genes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c38">38</xref>). E2F-1 possesses both oncogenic and tumor suppressor properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c39">39</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in NIH 3T3 cells causes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c17">17</xref>). Considering these observations and the apparent E2F binding properties of site C in the mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is potentially a target gene of E2F-1. To examine this, we co-transfected the core promoter reporter plasmids along with an E2F-1 expression vector into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>A). With the wild-type promoter, co-transfected E2F-1 increased the promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>A, column 2). The mutation in site C decreased luciferase activity of E2F-1 by half (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>A, column 4), whereas the mutation in site A decreased luciferase activity only slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>A, column 3). These results indicate that activation of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter by E2F-1 depends upon site C but not site A. Remarkably, double mutation at sites A and C reduced the promoter activity further than the site C single mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>A, column 5). These data indicate that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is activated by E2F-1 mainly through site C; however, a molecule bound to site A works cooperatively with E2F-dependent transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct roles of two <italic>cis</italic>-elements during the cell cycle</title><p>To examine which <italic>cis</italic>-element contributes to the regulation of transcriptional activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during the cell cycle, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the wild-type <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter or the promoter containing point mutations in site A and site C. Luciferase activities were measured in quiescent cells by serum starvation (G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase) and 9 (late-G<sub>1</sub> phase), 12 (G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase) and 16 h (S phase) after serum stimulation of these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, cf.

Overall, plasmids in which site C remained intact showed cell cycle-dependent variation in luciferase activity, whereas plasmids with mutated site C showed far less variation.</p><p>In G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase, luciferase activity was detectable, illustrating that the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter had basal <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity in resting cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, column 1), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c40">40</xref>). The plasmids with mutated site A had decreased luciferase activity whereas those with mutated site C showed increased activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, columns 2 and 3). These results suggest that transcriptional activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is repressed by the binding of E2F-Rb complex to site C, and that a nuclear factor which activates <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression through site A exists in G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase cells.</p><p>In late G<sub>1</sub> phase, transcriptional activity was repressed through the E2F binding site (site C) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, compare columns 6 and 8).

The site A-binding nuclear factors may act differently between G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> and mid&#x0002f;late-G<sub>1</sub> phase. <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity peaked in G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, column 11), and declined slightly at S phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, column 16).</p><p>Promoter activity of reporter plasmids with the mutation at site C did not vary during the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, columns 3, 8, 13 and 18), whereas in each phase transcription from the double mutant plasmids was lower than transcription in the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f6">6</xref>B, columns 4, 9, 14 and 19). These data suggest that these two <italic>cis</italic>-elements play distinct and important roles in the regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression.

The amount of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA was reduced in TSA-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>A).

A low dose of TSA (50 nM) arrested the cells in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase, confirming that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA declined in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> phases. However, the S phase distribution of the cells treated with higher doses of TSA increased slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>C), and <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA levels in TSA-treated cells appeared to increase in a TSA dose-dependent fashion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>A).</p><p>It is known that supercoiled plasmid DNA introduced into mammalian cell lines or <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes forms nucleosome-containing minichromosomes in the nucleus after 16 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c44">44</xref>). We examined <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity in cells at G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase by luciferase assay to see if there is any HDAC-dependent repression. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids were arrested at G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> and treated with 200 nM TSA for 24 h. In all cases, the luciferase activity was higher in TSA-treated cells than in untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>D). The luciferase activity of plasmids with a mutation in site A increased to a greater extent than that of the control plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>D, columns 6 and 7), implying that the binding of E2F to site C resulted in the formation of E2F-Rb-HDAC complex. When 200 nM TSA was added to serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, the distribution of the cell cycle was unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>E). The luciferase activity of the plasmids with the mutated E2F site (site C) increased 3-fold after TSA treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>D, columns 3 and 8), suggesting that the site A-binding complex possesses some HDAC activity. The luciferase activity of plasmids with a mutation in site A is dependent upon promoter activity of site C. Plasmid 300A showed a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity following TSA treatment in G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> arrested cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>D, columns 2 and 7, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>E). As expected, the double mutated promoter activity did not increase significantly when TSA was added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f7">7</xref>D, columns 4 and 9). These data indicate that the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter is regulated through dual pathways dependent upon sites A and C, and these sites are associated with HDAC activity.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity is negatively regulated by E2F-Rb-HDAC</title><p>To investigate whether negative regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter activity is associated with the formation of E2F-Rb-HDAC complexes, we co-transfected luciferase reporter plasmids and E2F-1 and Rb expression vectors into Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells which lack functional Rb and express E2F target genes at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c45">45</xref>). TSA was added to the cells 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested after 24 h in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f8">8</xref>). As expected, the core promoter activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> when co-transfected with the E2F-1 expression vector increased by 50&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f8">8</xref>, column 2); however, co-transfection with E2F-1 and Rb expression vectors decreased luciferase activity by 50&#x00025; as compared to co-transfection with E2F-1 expression vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f8">8</xref>, columns 2 and 3). These results indicate that the formation of an E2F-1-Rb complex repressed the Dnmt1 core promoter activity. The decrease in luciferase activity caused by Rb expression was reversed by addition of 100 or 200 nM TSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f8">8</xref>, columns 4 and 5). We performed luciferase assays with the reporter plasmids containing a mutation in site A and obtained similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f8">8</xref>, columns 6&#x02013;10). Our data indicate that repression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> core promoter activity by E2F-1-Rb complexes is dependent upon HDAC and occurs through site C. Taken together, these findings show that the Dnmt1 promoter activity is both positively and negatively regulated by E2F complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that there are two major <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the promoter region of mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic> that control transcriptional levels during the cell cycle. Dual regulatory pathways, one involving unknown transcription factors and the other involving E2F-Rb-HDAC, play a pivotal role in cell cycle-dependent regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression. Both pathways may be necessary for controlling gene expression by methylation; however, further investigation of growth-sensitive methylation checkpoints will be required in both normal cell growth and tumor development.</p><p>It has been thought that DNA methylation <italic>in vivo</italic> is maintained by activation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, whereas demethylation is achieved passively by inactivation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>. However, over-expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> has been reported in several cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c47">47</xref>), and an intimate relationship between aberrant methylation of genomic DNA and tumorigenesis has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c17">17</xref>). To clarify how cells produce the appropriate amount of Dnmt1, we investigated the regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression. First, we identified the promoter region and the major transcript start sites of mouse <italic>Dnmt1</italic>. Expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was regulated through at least two distinct <italic>cis</italic>-elements (sites A and C). Site C binds E2F and site A binds factors yet to be identified. Our data show that the E2F binding site regulates transcriptional activity of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> both positively and negatively in a cell cycle-dependent manner. A model of this complex regulation is proposed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f9">9</xref>. The E2F binding site activates transcription at late G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase and represses it to basal levels at G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase by recruiting HDAC through the formation of E2F-Rb-HDAC complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f9">9</xref>). Since <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcription occurs in resting cells, it appears that Dnmt1 functions outside of the cell cycle in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells.</p><p>Loss of <italic>E2F-1</italic>, <italic>E2F-2</italic>, <italic>E2F-3</italic>, <italic>E2F-4</italic> and <italic>E2F-5</italic> gene function results in a diversity of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c51">51</xref>). In particular, mice lacking <italic>E2F-1</italic> develop tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c39">39</xref>), implying that E2F-1 functions as a tumor suppressor <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, the Rb-E2F pathway is responsible for control of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c33">33</xref>). Our data suggest that disruption of the E2F-1-Rb-HDAC regulatory complex formed on the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter leads to ectopic expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, potentially contributing to tumor progression. The different patterns of methylation observed in cancer cells suggest that this E2F-Dnmt1 pathway might accelerate aberrant methylation in tumor malignancy. Rb-E2F pathways may be involved in Dnmt1-associated tumorigenesis at multiple levels. Recently, mice have been made with disruptions in Rb family genes, eliminating the possibility for compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c53">53</xref>). Embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice are immortal and exhibit properties of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c53">53</xref>). Colony formation was completely inhibited by reintroduction of Rb into these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c52">52</xref>). Considering these results, our findings strongly suggest that disruption of the Rb-E2F-Dnmt1 regulatory pathway may play a critical role in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Robertson <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that Dnmt1 directly interacts with Rb, thereby reducing transcriptional activity of E2F-responsive genes via histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c54">54</xref>). Dnmt1 also interacts directly with E2F-1 and HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c55">55</xref>), implying that Dnmt1 works not only through maintenance of genome-wide methylation, but also through histone deacetylation. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the inhibition of Dnmt1 results in enhanced promoter activity of tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4A</italic></sup>, <italic>p19</italic><sup><italic>Arf</italic></sup> and <italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>Waf1</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c57">57</xref>). In the case of <italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>Waf1</italic></sup>, although its promoter activity is elevated by decreases in Dnmt1, the CpG sequences in the promoter region are completely unmethylated even though Dnmt1 is expressed normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c57">57</xref>). This suggests that Dnmt1 itself may participate in a transcriptional regulatory mechanism in addition to its role in maintenance methylation. Since <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is E2F-responsive, Dnmt1 may regulate its own transcription through a negative feedback system, through the formation of complexes such as E2F-Rb-Dnmt1-HDAC. Ectopic expression of Dnmt1 in higher levels than levels in transformed cells leads to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c6">6</xref>), while most transformed cells express apporoximately 2-fold more <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA than normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c18">18</xref>). Therefore, Dnmt1 may be required as part of a restrictive regulatory system to continue normal cell growth.</p><p>Inappropriate levels of Dnmt1 may trigger tumor initiation or progression at multiple steps by disturbing tightly regulated molecular interactions. In SV40-transformed cells, increased levels of Dnmt1 interfere with the molecular interaction between p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c12">12</xref>), because the binding domain of PCNA for p21<sup>Waf1</sup> is the same as that for Dnmt1. Thus, increased Dnmt1 may enhance tumor progression by inappropriate interaction with cell cycle- or DNA repair-related molecules such as Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c54">54</xref>) and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c12">12</xref>). Importantly, down-regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> decreases or arrests cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c58">58</xref>). <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-deficient ES cells grow normally, but they die when induced to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c6">6</xref>). Furthermore, Min mice crossed with <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup><italic>S&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice, which completely lack Dnmt1 activity on one allele, showed 50&#x00025; fewer intestinal adenomas without large-scale demethylation of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c19">19</xref>). A recent study has reported that Min mice crossed to <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup><italic>N&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice, which partially retain Dnmt1 activity on one allele, also show fewer polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c59">59</xref>). The mutant <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup><italic>N&#x0002f;N</italic></sup> ES cells have slightly reduced levels of Dnmt1 enzymatic activity relative to the parental ES cells, yet they retain nearly normal genomic CpG methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c60">60</xref>). Although both monoallelic expression of Dnmt1 and slightly reduced levels of Dnmt1 activity seem to be sufficient for the maintenance of genome-wide methylation and cell viability, these subtle differences affect tumor development significantly. These reports strongly suggest that maintenance of absolute levels of Dnmt1 is critical for both normal and abnormal cell growth. Both methyltransferase activity of Dnmt1 and its ability to interact with other molecules may play important roles in cell proliferation.</p><p>Although site A of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> resembles a putative E2F binding sequence, the molecule bound to site A appears to be quite different from E2F transcription factors. Site A mainly functions as a positive regulator of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during the cell cycle. The coordination of the two regulatory sites controls basal and functional activation of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter in proliferating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f9">9</xref>). The transcriptional activity mediated by site A can explain the constant transcriptional rate in G<sub>0</sub> phase cells and differentiated cells, compared to proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg406c40">40</xref>). The sequence of the mouse site A is not completely conserved in rat, but proteins derived from rat act on mouse site A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg406f4">4</xref>A and B). These findings indicate that the molecule bound to site A recognizes a longer sequence motif than the putative E2F binding site. Further study is required to identify the molecule that binds site A, and to understand the complex molecular mechanisms of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression regulation in cell growth.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg406f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA during the cell cycle and in oncogenic transformed cells.
