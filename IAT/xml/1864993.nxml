The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 3-year-old child from Australia diagnosed with pneumonia. A random library was generated from nucleic acids extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate and analyzed by high throughput DNA sequencing. Multiple DNA fragments were cloned that possessed limited homology to known polyomaviruses. We subsequently sequenced the entire virus genome of 5,229 bp, henceforth referred to as WU virus, and found it to have genomic features characteristic of the family Polyomaviridae. The genome was predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St. Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus&#x02013;specific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus. The presence of multiple instances of the virus in two continents suggests that this virus is geographically widespread in the human population and raises the possibility that the WU virus may be a human pathogen.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>We have identified a novel virus, referred to as WU virus, in the family Polyomaviridae by screening of human respiratory secretions. Two human polyomaviruses, BK and JC, were identified in 1971 and infect the majority of humans around the world. These two viruses are closely related to each other and are both are pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals. Earlier this year, a third polyomavirus, KI, was described in human clinical specimens, although its pathogenicity and prevalence in humans has not yet been established. The discovery of WU virus brings the number of polyomaviruses detected in humans to four. WU differs from BK and JC significantly in its genome sequence and in its relative tissue tropism, suggesting that it is likely to have unique biological properties. This discovery raises many questions for further investigation, such as, Is WU virus a human pathogen? If so, what kind of disease does it cause? Where in the body does WU virus reside? At what age does infection typically occur? Perhaps most importantly, there are likely to be many more as of yet unidentified viruses infecting the human body.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Gaynor AM, Nissen MD, Whiley DM, Mackay IM, Lambert SB, et al.

The advent of these new technologies has greatly stimulated efforts to identify novel viruses in the respiratory tract and in other human disease states.</p><p>Viruses in the family Polyomaviridae possess double-stranded DNA genomes and infect a variety of avian, rodent, and primate species. To date, two polyomaviruses, BK virus and JC virus, have been unambiguously described as human pathogens. BK and JC viruses are ubiquitous worldwide, and in adult populations, seroprevalence rates approaching 75&#x00025; and 100&#x00025;, respectively, have been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Although human polyomaviruses have been suggested to utilize a respiratory route of transmission, detection of BK and JC polyomavirus nucleic acids in the respiratory tract has rarely been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Infection with these two viruses is predominantly asymptomatic, although in the context of immunosuppression a number of syndromes have been clearly linked to these viruses. JC virus causes primary multifocal leukoencephalopathy, while BK virus has been associated with a variety of renal and urinary tract disorders, most importantly tubular nephritis, which can lead to allograft failure in renal transplant recipients and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. These viruses are believed to persist in a latent phase primarily in the kidney and can periodically undergo reactivation. Excretion of BK and JC viruses in urine has been reported in up to 20&#x00025; of the general population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Besides JC and BK virus, a very recent report has described a novel polyomavirus, KI, detected in human respiratory secretions and stool &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the pathogenicity and prevalence of this virus has not yet been established. In addition, in the late 1950s, &#x0223c;100 million people in the United States, and many more worldwide, may have been exposed to SV40, a polyomavirus that naturally infects rhesus monkeys via contaminated polio vaccines, leading to widespread debate about whether or not SV40 is capable of sustained infection and replication cycles in humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Much of the interest in polyomaviruses and SV40 in particular derives from the transforming properties carried by the early transcriptional region of the viral genome that encodes for the small T antigen (STAg) and and large T antigen (LTAg). T antigen is capable of binding both p53 and Rb proteins and interfering with their tumor suppressor functions. The early region alone is sufficient to transform established primary rodent cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and in concert with telomerase and <italic>ras</italic> transforms primary human cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

One 384-well plate of clones was sequenced using a universal M13 primer, and the resulting sequence reads were analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Of the 384 reads, there were 37 poor quality sequences that were rejected from further analysis, 327 human sequences, six bacterial sequences, six viral sequences, and eight sequences of unknown origin that could not be classified. The bacterial sequences had greater than 97&#x00025; nucleotide identity to known bacterial species, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">Haemophilus influenzae</named-content> (three reads), <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphthericum,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Leifsonia xyli</named-content> (unpublished data). Upon further examination, the six viral reads were collapsed into three unique regions, each of which possessed only limited homology to known polyomavirus proteins (sequences available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030064-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The highest scoring BLASTx hits for each of these three contigs possessed 35&#x00025;, 50&#x00025;, and 34&#x00025; amino acid identity to JC virus STAg, BK virus LTAg, and SV40 VP1, respectively. At the time these experiments were performed, the KI virus genome had not yet been published. Subsequent analysis revealed amino acid identities of 66&#x00025;, 65&#x00025;, and 69&#x00025; to KI virus for the three contigs. Furthermore, three of the eight previously unclassified sequence reads were determined to have between 58&#x00025;&#x02013;84&#x00025; amino acid identity to KI virus VP1 and VP2 proteins by BLASTx analysis. Based on the limited sequence homology to known viruses, we tentatively assigned the name WU to the unknown polyomavirus.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Complete Genome Sequencing and Genome Analysis</title><p>The complete genome of WU was sequenced to 3&#x000d7; coverage using cloned fragments of the viral genome generated by a series of PCR primers. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed genomic features characteristic of polyomaviruses. First, the WU genome size of 5,229 base pairs (bp) was quite comparable to those of the primate polyomaviruses BK (5,153 bp), JC (5,130 bp), and SV40 (5,243 bp). In addition, the overall GC content of the WU genome was 39&#x00025;, which is quite similar to the GC content of BK (39&#x00025;), JC (40&#x00025;), and SV40 (40&#x00025;). The genome organization included an early region coding on one strand for STAg and LTAg, and a late region coding on the opposite strand for the capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These two regions were separated by a regulatory region that contained typical polyomavirus features. The regulatory region contained an AT-rich region on the late side of the putative replication origin. Three repeats of the consensus pentanucleotide LTAg binding site GAGGC were present, as was one copy of the non-consensus LTAg binding site TAGGC. While most polyomaviruses contain four copies of the consensus, baboon polyomavirus (simian agent 12) is a primate polyomavirus that contains only three copies of the canonical binding sequence and one non-consensus binding site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Unusual features in the WU regulatory region included the presence of two partially overlapping LTAg binding sites and slightly variant spacing between the LTAg binding sites as compared to SV40, BK, and JC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030064-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>In the early region, an unspliced open reading frame of 194 amino acids was detected that possibly encodes for the STAg. As the paradigm in other polyomaviruses is that STAg is expressed from a spliced message, analysis of potential splice sites revealed the presence of a putative splice donor sequence just one nucleotide 5&#x02032; of the initially predicted stop codon. Splicing to a downstream putative splice acceptor site would excise an intron of 70 nucleotides and generate a slightly larger STAg of 217 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030064-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). While the precise carboxyl terminus of the WU STAg has not yet been experimentally verified, sequence analysis revealed the presence of a highly conserved cysteine-rich motif, CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>7&#x02013;8</sub>CXCX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>21&#x02013;22</sub>CSCX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>WF, that was present in both of the predicted isoforms of WU STAg. This motif, which is present in all STAgs, was perfectly conserved in WU virus with the exception of the initial cysteine residue.</p><p>In all polyomaviruses, the initial &#x0223c;80 amino acids of the N-terminus of the STAg and LTAg are identical; the LTAg is generated by alternative splicing of the early mRNA transcript. In WU virus, a conserved splice donor site was identified immediately after amino acid 84 of the early open reading frame. The position of the splice site is similar to that found in SV40, BK, and JC virus, which occur after amino acids 82, 81, and 81, respectively. Splicing to a conserved splice acceptor site would generate a predicted protein of 648 amino acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t001">Table 1</xref>). The predicted WU virus LTAg contained conserved features common to T antigens, including a DnaJ domain in the N terminus with the highly conserved hexapeptide motif HPDKGG; the LxCxE motif necessary for binding Rb; a canonical DNA binding domain; a zinc finger region; and conserved motifs GPXXXGKT and GXXXVNLE in the ATPase-p53 binding domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Based on comparative sequence analysis of LTAgs, the polyomaviruses are classified into two subclasses: a primate-like group exemplified by SV40, and a mouse polyoma-like group exemplified by murine polyoma virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Using these criteria, the T antigen of WU appeared to more closely resemble the mouse polyoma-like class of virus than the primate class. First, the mouse polyoma-like viruses have insertions of varying length after amino acids 66 and 113 of SV40 as compared to the primate class. In the amino terminal domain of the WU virus LTAg, multiple sequence alignment revealed the presence of a two&#x02013;amino acid and a ten&#x02013;amino acid insertion at these two loci, respectively. Furthermore, the primate-like class typically contains an extension of the carboxyl terminus termed the host range domain that is absent in the mouse polyoma-like class. In contrast to SV40, BK, JC, and baboon polyomavirus, WU virus did not appear to encode a carboxyl terminal extension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030064-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>In addition to encoding LTAg and STAg, murine and hamster polyomaviruses utilize alternative splicing to generate an intermediate-sized protein referred to as middle T antigen. The WU virus early region was scanned for splicing motifs similar to known murine and hamster polyomavirus splice donor and acceptor sequences, but no obvious combination of splice sites was detected that would yield a middle T antigen sequence in the size range of known middle T antigens. In addition, SV40, JC, BK, and baboon polyomavirus all encode a fourth late protein termed the agnoprotein. There was no open reading frame present in WU with any detectable homology to the known agnoproteins. Thus, our sequence analysis suggests that neither middle T antigen nor agnoprotein are encoded by WU virus, although it is possible that the sequences have diverged beyond our ability to recognize the appropriate splice sites or protein products.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title><p>Multiple sequence alignments of the predicted STAg, LTAg, VP1, and VP2 open reading frames revealed that WU virus was clearly a novel virus that is most closely related to KI virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Neighbor-joining analysis suggested that these two viruses appear to form a new subclass of polyomaviruses. In the early region and VP1 protein, the WU/KI branch was most closely related to the known primate polyomaviruses BK, SV40, JC, and baboon polyomavirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">2</xref>C). Finally, the VP2 open reading frame was so divergent that its evolutionary relationship to other polyomaviruses aside from KI could not be reliably established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Analysis of the VP3 amino acid sequence, which is completely contained within VP2, gave similar results as VP2 (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Prevalence of WU</title><p>PCR primers were designed to specifically amplify WU. The initial screen used primers targeting the VP2 region, which possessed less than 20&#x00025; amino acid homology to JC and BK virus to minimize the possibility of cross reactivity with the known human polyomaviruses. Empirical testing of the primers on samples known to contain BK and JC confirmed that the primers did not cross react with either of these genomes (unpublished data). Positives in the initial screen for WU virus were sequenced and then further confirmed by a second PCR reaction using primers targeting the 3&#x02032; end of the WU virus LTAg coding sequence. All 43 positive samples in the initial screen were confirmed using the second pair of PCR primers. A subset of samples that tested negative in the initial screen was also tested with the second PCR primer pair, and none of those samples were positive.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Cohort</title><p>In order to assess the prevalence of WU polyomavirus, a cohort of 1,245 respiratory specimens collected in 2003 in Brisbane was examined. Thirty-seven out of the 1,245 (3.0&#x00025;) samples tested were positive for the virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>). In this cohort, patients that tested positive ranged in age from 4 months to 53 years. The vast majority of the patients (33/37) were age 3 and under. In 12 patients with clear clinical evidence of respiratory tract infection, WU was the sole virus detected. Strikingly, in 25 of the 37 positive samples, one or more additional respiratory viruses were also detected. The most common co-infections were with rhinovirus (15 cases) and human bocavirus (ten cases). Furthermore, in one sample, a total of four viruses (WU, bocavirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were detected, and in six other samples, a total of three viruses were detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>St. Louis, Missouri, United States, Cohorts</title><p>In addition, we examined two cohorts of patients from St. Louis, Missouri, United States. In one set of upper respiratory specimens collected in 2006, five out of 410 were positive for WU virus in the PCR assay. In addition, 480 bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients (mostly adults) with severe acute respiratory illness were tested, yielding one positive. Of the positive samples, all six were co-infected with other viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>). The age range of the positive cases varied from 4 months to 51 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Strain Variants</title><p>To assess the sequence variation within different isolates, we analyzed the 250-bp region encompassed by the initial screening primers for all 43 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Several divergent strains were detected, including one sample that had five mutations (2&#x00025;) within this region. In another case, a 12-bp deletion was observed. The fact that many isolates were identical in sequence was not surprising, given the relatively short length of the amplicon and the double-stranded DNA nature of the genome. In addition, we sequenced the complete genome of five additional isolates from five independent patients. Unfortunately, efforts to completely sequence the two most divergent isolates (based on the 250-bp sequence, B2 and B3) have been unsuccessful, presumably due to low viral titers in these samples. All six complete genomes were 5,229 bp in size, and overall, there was between 0.08&#x00025; and 0.23&#x00025; sequence variation from sample to sample, well above that expected from Taq PCR, ruling out the possibility that the additional positives were artifacts of PCR contamination. Moreover, the majority of the observed mutations were synonymous substitutions or in non-coding regions, lending further support to the argument that these were authentic strain variants.

For most patients, samples were tested at three time points: prior to transplant, 1 mo post transplant, and 4 mo post transplant, although for some patients the pre-transplant specimen was not available. Zero out of 501 samples tested were positive for the WU polyomavirus. As a control, using previously validated BK primers, we were able to amplify BK virus in a subset of these urine samples, confirming the integrity of the specimens themselves (unpublished data). Similarly, from the Brisbane cohort, none of the 226 urine samples tested were positive for WU virus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used a high throughput sequencing strategy to search for novel agents that were present in respiratory tract infections of unknown etiology. The focus of this study was on individual clinical specimens that still lacked a diagnosis after analysis with an extensive panel of diagnostic assays for known respiratory viruses. In one such patient sample, novel sequences with limited homology to known polyomaviruses were detected. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new virus clearly had the genomic organization typical of polyomaviruses but was divergent from all previously described polyomaviruses. In keeping with the two-letter virus names for human polyomaviruses, we have named this novel polyomavirus WU virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Overall, the predicted amino acid sequences of WU virus proteins were most similar to the newly described KI virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t001">Table 1</xref>). Outside of KI, WU shared only &#x0223c;15&#x00025;&#x02013;49&#x00025; identity to its closest relatives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Detailed analysis of the viral DNA sequence and genomic organization confirmed the novelty of WU virus. At all loci, WU virus was most similar to KI virus, but the degree of divergence between WU and KI was greater than the divergence between SV40 and BK, indicating that WU and KI are clearly distinct viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, it appears that WU and KI define a novel branch within the Polyomaviridae family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030064-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Relative to the established polyomaviruses, some analyses suggested that the WU/KI branch might be more closely related to the primate polyomaviruses, while other features of the WU genome suggested that it might be more similar to murine polyomavirus. For example, neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis suggested that the predicted STAg, LTAg, and VP1 open reading frames of both KI and WU were most closely related to SV40, JC, BK, and baboon polyomaviruses. Analysis of the VP2/VP3 region was more equivocal, as the proteins were too divergent to reliably assess. The apparent absence of the C-terminal &#x0201c;host range&#x0201d; domain in the LTAg and the agnoprotein open reading frame, both of which are present in the known primate polyomaviruses, suggested that WU virus was more similar to murine polyomavirus than the primate polyomaviruses by these criteria. While the evolutionary history of this virus is not clear at the moment, the totality of the analysis indicates that WU is clearly a unique virus.</p><p>We detected WU in 37 out of 1,245 (3.0&#x00025;) patient specimens in Brisbane (excluding the original case) and in six out of 890 (0.7&#x00025;) patient specimens tested in St. Louis. As the positive specimens were all collected from 2003 through 2006, it appears that WU is currently circulating, and its presence in both North America and Australia suggests that the virus is geographically widespread in the human population. The age range of patients that tested positive for WU virus spanned from 4 months to 53 years. The majority (86&#x00025;) of the cases were found in children 3 years of age and under. Of the four positive specimens from adult patients (S1, S6, B1, and B3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>), three clearly had altered immune status. One patient was HIV-positive, one was immunosuppressed due to treatment for Wegener granulomatosis, and one was pregnant. The fourth adult patient (S1), while not obviously immunosuppressed, also suffered from liver cirrhosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and co-infection with herpes simplex virus, and required mechanical ventilation. In addition, there were two other positive patients older than 3 years of age: a 6-year-old child who had previously been a bone marrow transplant recipient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>, B27) and a 6-year-old child diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>, B9). While preliminary, the age distribution of the positive cases in this study combined with the established paradigms for BK and JC virus suggest a model where acute infection with WU virus may occur relatively early in life and result in a latent infection. Immunosuppression or other insults such as viral infection could then lead to reactivation of WU virus in older individuals.</p><p>The patients who yielded positive specimens suffered from a wide range of respiratory syndromes, including bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia as well as other clinical maladies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030064-t002">Table 2</xref>). Detection of WU virus sequences in these patients is merely the first step in assessing the potential etiologic role of WU virus in acute respiratory tract disease. It is not yet known whether WU is infectious or whether it is capable of replication in the respiratory tract. One possibility is that WU is not involved at all in respiratory disease, but rather is simply transmitted by the respiratory route. The human polyomaviruses BK and JC are hypothesized to be transmitted by the respiratory route before taking up residency primarily in the kidneys. Latency in the kidneys of BK and JC is believed to be the reason that both viruses are excreted in the urine of up to 20&#x00025; of asymptomatic individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, using the same PCR assays that were effective in respiratory secretions, we did not detect WU in any of the 727 urine samples we tested. The lack of detection of WU virus in the urine may reflect sensitivity issues, a bias in the cohorts tested, or simply that WU is unlike BK and JC viruses and is not secreted in the urine. A similar tissue profile to that of WU virus has been reported in initial studies of KI virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Future experiments will aim to determine the tissue tropism of WU and whether any tissue reservoirs for WU virus exist.</p><p>In the literature, there is one animal polyomavirus that has been found extensively in lung tissue. Infection of suckling mice with the mouse pneumotropic polyomavirus (MPPV) causes interstitial pneumonia and significant mortality. MPPV also differs from other polyomaviruses in that besides the kidneys, it can also be detected in the lungs, liver, spleen, and blood of suckling mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, there is precedence for an animal polyomavirus causing respiratory disease, suggesting at least the possibility that WU virus could be similarly pathogenic in humans.</p><p>One striking observation from these studies is the relatively high frequency of co-infection detected in the respiratory secretions: 72&#x00025; overall (100&#x00025; in the St. Louis cohort and 68&#x00025; in the Brisbane cohort). Although more extensive studies are necessary to confirm the generality of this observation, this raises several intriguing non-mutually exclusive possibilities to consider: 1) WU may be an opportunistic pathogen; 2) WU infection may predispose or facilitate secondary infection by other respiratory viruses; and 3) WU may be a part of the endogenous viral flora that is reactivated by inflammation or some other aspect of viral infection. Recent studies of the prevalence of the newly identified human bocavirus have also reported higher levels of co-infection than previously described for other viruses found in the respiratory tract, with co-infection rates as high as 50&#x00025; reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, five of six samples positive for KI virus were reported to be co-infected with other known respiratory viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. As detection methods improve in sensitivity and more comprehensive efforts are made to examine the diversity of viruses found in the respiratory tract, a greater appreciation for the rates of dual or multi-infection is gradually emerging. For example, the use of extensive panels of PCR assays in this study revealed that one of the positive specimens was quadruply infected; adenovirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus and WU virus were all present. Further investigations that aim to systematically define the spectrum of viruses present in the respiratory tract are clearly warranted so that the possible roles that co-infections may play in disease pathogenesis can be explored.</p><p>Extremely high sequence divergence was observed in the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 of WU virus and KI virus as compared to the other known polyomaviruses. This divergence may reflect a different &#x0201c;lifestyle&#x0201d; for the WU/KI branch as compared to known polyomaviruses. Our data demonstrating the presence of WU in respiratory secretions and its absence in urine samples suggest that the mode of transmission or the sites of persistence of WU may be distinct from the other human polyomaviruses. As such, the structure of the virion must be optimized to enable the virus to survive dramatically distinct physiological and environmental conditions. This may partially explain the observed sequence divergence in the capsid proteins.</p><p>Another question raised by this study relates to the potential antigenic cross reactivity of the WU capsid proteins. In terms of establishing the seroprevalence of WU itself and determining whether seroconversion accompanies acute infection with WU, it will be essential to conduct these studies with consideration for potential cross reactivity to KI, BK, JC, and SV40 antibodies. In addition, it is tantalizing to speculate whether serum antibodies to WU have the potential to cross react to SV40-derived antigens, and if so, whether they may at least partially account for some of the studies that report the presence of SV40 antibodies in the human population that is too young to have suffered exposure from contaminated polio vaccination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030064-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified and completely sequenced the genome of a novel polyomavirus. This virus appears to be geographically widespread in the human population as evidenced by the detection of 44 distinct cases in two continents. Based on preliminary analysis, WU and KI virus share some strikingly similar properties, including their complement of genes, phylogenetic relationship, and physical sites of detection in the human body. These data suggest that WU virus and KI virus define a novel branch within the Polyomaviridae family with unexplored biology and pathogenicity. Another implication of these results is that the diversity of viruses in this family may be far greater than currently realized. Further experimentation is now underway to determine the relative pathogenicity of WU virus in humans and to understand the molecular properties of the virus. Since the T antigen of WU is predicted to have transforming properties by analogy to other polyomavirus T antigens, one question currently under investigation is whether a subset of human tumors may be associated with WU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Clinical specimens&#x02014;Respiratory secretions.</title><p>Brisbane cohort.
