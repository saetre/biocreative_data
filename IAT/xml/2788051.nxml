Here we present evidence that RecG is a major factor influencing these processes in bacteria. We show that the extensive DnaA-independent stable DNA replication observed without RecG can lead to replication of any area of the chromosome. This replication is further elevated following irradiation with UV light and appears to be perpetuated by secondary events that continue long after the elimination of UV lesions. The resulting pathological cascade is associated with an increased number of replication forks traversing the chromosome, sometimes with extensive regional amplification of the chromosome, and with the accumulation of highly branched DNA intermediates containing few Holliday junctions. We propose that the cascade is triggered by replication fork collisions that generate 3&#x02032; single-strand DNA flaps, providing sites for PriA to initiate re-replication of the DNA and thus to generate linear duplexes that provoke recombination, allowing priming of even further replication. Our results shed light on why termination of replication in bacteria is normally limited to a single encounter of two forks and carefully orchestrated within a restricted area, and explain how a system of multiple forks and random termination can operate in eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Duplication and transmission of the genome are major challenges for dividing cells. Studies with numerous model systems have revealed how these challenges are met through interplay between DNA replication, recombination and repair and in eukaryotes, through checkpoint controls that regulate the cell cycle. It requires careful control over the initiation of replication, multiple pathways for rescuing stalled or damaged forks and various means to curb unnecessary recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lopes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Messer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mahdi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Blow and Gillespie, 2008</xref>). It must also involve means to terminate DNA synthesis when replication forks meet, although how this last step is achieved is not clear.</p><p>Bacteria have evolved systems that tend to bring replication to a halt within a restricted region of the chromosome. In <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> replication initiates at a single origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) under the control of DnaA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Messer, 2002</xref>). The two forks established proceed around the circular chromosome in opposite directions until they meet within a broad termination zone opposite the origin. This zone is flanked by polar sequences (<italic>ter</italic>) that allow forks to enter, but not to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Mulcair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Duggin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Thus, the chromosome is divided into two replichores and termination is restricted to a specialized area containing additional genetic elements that orchestrate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Reyes-Lamothe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). But the path of the two forks traversing each replichore is not always smooth. If one of the forks becomes blocked and fails to be rescued, the remaining portion of the replichore will not be duplicated in time as the second fork will be trapped in the terminus area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sharma and Hill, 1995</xref>). This constraint imposed by Tus<italic>-ter</italic> may explain why mechanisms promoting fork rescue and replication restart appear to be so important for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, the multiple origins per chromosome and lack of defined termination sites mean that such incomplete replication would be less likely. Any chromosome segment left un-replicated by a blocked fork could be duplicated by another fork coming from an adjacent origin. Even if converging forks were both blocked, replication could be completed if one of the many dormant origins present in eukaryotic chromosomes was located in between and was induced to fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Such new initiation could also provide a solution to blocked forks in bacteria. However, this possibility has received little attention despite evidence that replication can initiate at sites remote from <italic>oriC</italic> and independently of DnaA. This so-called stable DNA replication (SDR) is induced by exposure to genotoxic agents (iSDR) and elevated constitutively (cSDR) in <italic>rnhA</italic> mutants lacking RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although SDR could in theory obviate the need to rescue a stalled fork, at least in some circumstances, its initiation at various sites in the chromosome would increase the incidence of fork collisions, which may be problematic, as it would interfere with the evolved replichores. Without SDR, fork collisions are thought to be restricted to the terminus area and limited to a single event per cell cycle. Studies of DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> revealed that without Tus to curb fork movement, a replisome may displace the 3&#x02032; end of the nascent leading strand made by the fork coming in the other direction, generating a branched DNA structure that allows re-replication of the already replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hiasa and Marians, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Krabbe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Markovitz, 2005</xref>). Strand displacement is not observed with DnaB alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kaplan and O'Donnell, 2002</xref>), indicating that re-replication is a particular risk following collision between fully fledged replisomes.</p><p>Studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking either PriA or RecG protein support the idea that SDR may be a double-edged sword. PriA facilitates loading of the DnaB replicative helicase and subsequent replisome assembly at branched DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>). It is required for initiating SDR and also for restarting DNA synthesis following exposure to genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Without PriA, cells show reduced viability and increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. These phenotypes are generally attributed to a failure to rescue stalled or damaged forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>), but the failure to curb unnecessary recombination is another possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mahdi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). PriA has a DNA helicase activity that can unwind any 5&#x02032; strand at the branch point of a fork to create a landing pad for DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>). Strains expressing helicase defective PriA show reduced levels of constitutive as well as damage-induced SDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), but lack the severe defects associated with <italic>priA</italic> null strains despite the limited ability of the mutant protein to unwind stalled forks. They also show a reduced requirement for RecG protein to help survive damage to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Al-Deib <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>RecG is a dsDNA translocase that has been implicated in the processing of Holliday junction intermediates in recombination and DNA repair, and in the rescue of stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lloyd, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lloyd and Sharples, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). However, it has proven difficult to pin down what it does <italic>in vivo.</italic> In a recent study we were able to demonstrate that UV-irradiated <italic>recG</italic> cells show dramatically increased levels of DnaA-independent DNA synthesis and that this is associated with severe and persistent defects in chromosome segregation. Both the segregation defect and the induced synthesis are suppressed in the absence of PriA helicase, opening the possibility that excessive levels of SDR might be responsible for the phenotype of cells lacking RecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We suggested that UV-irradiation triggers the assembly of new replication forks, thereby increasing the likelihood of unregulated fork collisions, which in the absence of RecG trigger a pathological cascade of replication that interferes with chromosome segregation and delays cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we present evidence to support this hypothesis and propose a model to explain how RecG might act to limit such pathological replication by reducing the incidence of unscheduled replication fork collisions, thus maintaining the function of the evolved replichore arrangement of the chromosome. We also consider why the multiple fork collisions intrinsic to chromosome replication in eukaryotes do not appear to trigger a similar pathological cascade.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SDR extends DNA synthesis to all chromosomal areas</title><p>To gain further insight into the nature of the SDR induced by UV-irradiation, and that elevated constitutively in cells lacking RecG, we investigated whether it can extend DNA synthesis to any area of the chromosome. We exploited <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells expressing thermosensitive DnaA protein for this purpose. Exponential phase cells were shifted from 30&#x000b0;C to 42&#x000b0;C to eliminate further <italic>oriC</italic> firing and the rate of subsequent DNA synthesis monitored by pulse labelling with BrdU, with or without prior UV-irradiation. High-molecular-weight chromosomal DNA was prepared, digested with the rare cutter NotI and chromosomal fragments separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) before probing for BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>UV-induced <italic>dnaA</italic>-independent replication reaches all chromosomal areas.

Following irradiation, the pattern changes quite markedly. Initially, the rate of synthesis is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>, time zero), in line with our previous studies showing that all forks stall for 15&#x02013;20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, the rate then increases substantially and robust labelling occurs in all chromosomal areas for at least another 90 min after irradiation, when the experiment was terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, robust synthesis continues long after any restarted forks should have reached the terminus. These data confirm our previous results showing that damage-induced SDR is one of the major components contributing towards net DNA synthesis following UV-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Its persistence is in line with results showing that damage-induced SDR can continue for many hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Robust, DnaA-independent synthesis is detected in unirradiated <italic>recG dnaA46</italic> cells at every time point after the shift to 42&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). This is in line with previous results showing that cells lacking RecG show constitutively increased levels of SDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In every experiment with unirradiated <italic>recG dnaA46</italic> cells, we observed disproportionately high labelling of two bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>, white arrows 1 and 2). Such high labelling of these bands is not evident in UV-irradiated <italic>dna46</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), nor in logarithmically growing wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). It may reflect the activity of three reported constitutive SDR origins (<italic>oriK2, oriK4</italic> and <italic>oriK5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>).</p><p>With this exception, SDR-mediated labelling appears to occur simultaneously and proportionately in all areas of the chromosome. It is also detected at all time points sampled following irradiation. In these cases, the level of SDR is dramatically increased, especially in <italic>recG</italic> cells, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref> shows a second experiment with a lower exposure. It emphasizes the increased labelling of unirradiated cells in the absence of RecG (compare 0 and 30 min lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C and D</xref>, no UV), and allowed quantification of relative band intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The latter confirmed the disproportionate labelling described above. Overall, these data reveal no particular hotspots for the initiation of SDR following irradiation. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that hotspots do exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>), it seems likely that synthesis can be initiated at any chromosomal locations, at least on a population level. Taken together, the apparently random initiation of SDR and the dramatic increase in synthesis in <italic>dna46 recG</italic> cells over <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells, suggests that UV-irradiated cells lacking RecG may have a much-increased number of forks traversing the chromosome in different directions. If true, this would break the replichore arrangement, thus increasing the danger of fork collisions not only with transcription complexes but also with forks following the normal direction of replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Amplification of SeqA foci in UV-irradiated cells</title><p>To try to gain more information about the number of forks traversing the chromosome in <italic>recG</italic> cells following irradiation with UV light, we exploited fluorescently labelled SeqA protein (SeqA-CFP). SeqA binds with high specificity to hemi-methylated DNA, as formed transiently during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Molina and Skarstad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Waldminghaus and Skarstad, 2009</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that some four to six SeqA foci are detected on average in unirradiated wild-type and <italic>recG</italic> cells during exponential growth at 37&#x000b0;C. This fits well with the expected number of replication forks given that cells at this stage of growth have some two to three copies of the origin region on average and one copy of the terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The pattern changed drastically following irradiation. The distinct pattern of foci characteristic of exponential cells is replaced with a cloud of multiple foci formed around the mid cell position as division ceases and the cells grow into longer and longer filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Sixty minutes after irradiation the SeqA foci have spread along the filaments. The amplification of SeqA foci seems somewhat greater in <italic>recG</italic> cells and shows no sign of abating as it does after 90 min in wild-type cells. This evidence of persistent and elevated replication may contribute to the very pronounced delay in division of irradiated <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These data suggest that the high levels of SDR detected in samples of irradiated <italic>recG dnaA46</italic> cells may coincide with a large increase in hemi-methylated DNA targets for SeqA to bind, which we interpret as evidence of a large increase in the number of replication forks within each cell.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>UV-irradiation increases the number of SeqA foci in replicating cells. Strains for eCFP&#x02013;SeqA expression carried plasmid pDIM083. Expression was induced by adding arabinose 30 min before UV-irradiation and continued throughout the duration of the experiment. Combined phase contrast and fluorescence images are shown. As overexpression has been shown to cause segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Waldminghaus and Skarstad, 2009</xref>), a mock-irradiated control was run in parallel, showing that the effects observed are caused by UV-irradiation rather than SeqA overexpression. The strains used were MG1655 (wild type) and N4560 (<italic>recG</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0074-0940-f2"/></fig><p>Given that <italic>oriC</italic> is known to continue firing at the normal rate after irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), at least some of the increase in fork numbers seen in the irradiated <italic>dnaA</italic><sup>+</sup> cells may be due to such new initiations. In line with that possibility, we see less amplification of SeqA foci in irradiated <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells at 42&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, in this case it is very clear that there is a substantially greater amplification of SeqA foci in irradiated <italic>recG dnaA46</italic> cells. This observation indicates that <italic>oriC</italic> firing is not the only factor contributing to the amplification of SeqA foci seen in <italic>dnaA</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, consistent with the idea that the induction of SDR establishes new forks elsewhere. However, we note that although there are more SeqA foci in unirradiated <italic>dnaA recG</italic> cells as compared with <italic>dnaA</italic> (<italic>recG</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells, the difference is not as great as might be expected from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>. Some of the SeqA foci observed in the <italic>dnaA</italic> single mutant might reflect protein aggregates accumulated in the absence of active replication. Those observed in the irradiated <italic>dnaA</italic> cells are distributed along the filaments, and increased in number, consistent with the increased BrdU labelling detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effect of <italic>oriC</italic> firing and PriA helicase activity on the amplification of SeqA foci.

Indeed, all previous studies described SDR in cells in which <italic>oriC</italic> firing is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>). Given that replisome components are limited to around 10 DNA polymerase III holoenzymes per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kelman and O'Donnell, 1995</xref>), the absence of <italic>oriC</italic> firing might allow their recruitment by PriA instead, enabling synthesis to initiate at other sites. To investigate this possibility, we examined SeqA foci in <italic>dnaA</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in which the helicase activity of PriA was eliminated. The increase in the number of foci following irradiation should then be reduced as the absence of PriA helicase activity limits SDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This is what we observed. The number and intensity of SeqA foci are clearly reduced in both <italic>priA300</italic> and <italic>recG priA300</italic> cells compared with <italic>priA</italic><sup>+</sup> controls, while the pattern of origin and terminus replication appears largely the same at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, the reduction is not large and it is noticeable that the number of SeqA foci remains significantly higher than in unirradiated cells. This can be explained by continued <italic>oriC</italic> firing and also the fact that <italic>priA300</italic> does not eliminate SDR entirely. Much of the SDR induced by UV light has been attributed to PriA-mediated replisome assembly at D-loops generated by RecBCD- and RecA-mediated initiation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>), which may proceed to some extent without the need for PriA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Zavitz and Marians, 1992</xref>). Thus, taken together, our data indicate that SDR occurs in <italic>dnaA</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and is not just a pathological consequence of the absence of origin firing, and we conclude that its induction does indeed lead to an increase in the number of forks traversing the chromosome.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathological replication is largely independent of the UV dose</title><p>It is very noticeable from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> that the replication induced by UV light continues unabated long after the 30&#x02013;40 min needed to remove the vast majority of pyrimidine dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that DNA damage is only the initial trigger for the formation of additional replication forks and that the perpetuation of SDR is the result of secondary replication forks initiated as a result of pathological events arising from unscheduled collisions between opposing forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hiasa and Marians, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Krabbe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Markovitz, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, we considered the possibility that RecG normally limits this secondary pathology, hence explaining the much-elevated SDR and much-prolonged defects in chromosome segregation and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). If true, SDR should be able to continue over extensive periods in <italic>recG</italic> cells almost regardless of the applied UV dose, provided that enough lesions were introduced to trigger the initial events.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we examined chromosome replication using strains in which origin and terminus areas of the chromosome were tagged with <italic>lac</italic> and <italic>tet</italic> operator arrays respectively, and in which we induced fluorescent repressors in samples of these cells to decorate the arrays.

This reduction fits with our observation that the majority of wild-type cells show a single cell division following UV-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). One hundred and twenty minutes following irradiation, the number of foci per filament increased again and established filaments with high numbers of both origin and termini foci. Plotting the origin to terminus ratio for each time point in relation to the total number of origin and terminus foci per filament revealed a mild overrepresentation of origin over terminus foci in a small number of the <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells and a very mild overrepresentation of the terminus over the origin in an even smaller fraction of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>The situation proved quite different in <italic>recG dnaA46</italic> cells.

This interpretation reflected the reported redundancy between RecG and the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lloyd, 1991</xref>). However, during recent studies revisiting the <italic>recG</italic> mutant phenotype, several observations led us to question whether unresolved Holliday junctions were a major factor. We provided evidence that UV-irradiated <italic>recG</italic> cells show drastically increased levels of DnaA-independent DNA synthesis and demonstrated that inactivation of the helicase activity of PriA led to a robust suppression of the UV-induced cell filamentation and a massive reduction in DnaA-independent synthesis. These and other observations opened the possibility that the phenotype of <italic>recG</italic> mutants is due mainly to extensive PriA-mediated over-replication of the chromosome.</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that the extensive DnaA-independent SDR observed in cells lacking RecG can lead to replication of any area of the chromosome without preference. It is further elevated following UV-irradiation, but independently of the applied dose, and persists long after UV lesions have been removed, indicating that once induced, SDR is perpetuated by secondary events that are independent of these initial lesions. This pathological DNA synthesis appears to be associated with an increase in the number of replication forks traversing the chromosome, sometimes with extensive regional amplification of chromosomal sections, and generally with the accumulation of high-molecular-weight branched DNA intermediates that contain few Holliday junctions. Taken together, the data presented fit with a model in which the increased incidence of replication fork collisions arising as a consequence of damage-induced SDR leads to a pathological cascade in the absence of RecG, a cascade that impedes normal chromosomal replication and segregation, leading to the persistent cell filamentation.</p><p>SDR differs from normal vegetative replication only in its mode of initiation and ability to allow fork movement towards <italic>oriC</italic>, counter to the direction of normal fork movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>). The number of polymerase III holoenzymes is limited to about 10 per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kelman and O'Donnell, 1995</xref>), which would tend to place an upper limit on the number of additional replication forks that could be established under SDR-inducing conditions. However, cell growth continues under these conditions and we cannot rule out the possibility that additional replisome components may accumulate. Indeed, this would be consistent with the cloud of SeqA foci observed in UV-irradiated wild-type and <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). This observation, together with the fact that inactivation of PriA helicase specifically reduces SeqA foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>), indicates that SDR occurs in cells in which the <italic>oriC</italic>-dependent initiation system is fully functional. Previous studies of SDR exploited only cells in which <italic>oriC</italic> firing is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that following induction of SDR there are many additional replication forks traversing the chromosome and that these forks can extend synthesis to any region of the chromosome, even in the absence of <italic>oriC</italic> firing. The level of SDR is increased in <italic>recG</italic> cells, but it is not immediately obvious why the absence of RecG should have such a catastrophic effect on chromosome segregation and cell division as that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic> (2009</xref>), given that extra forks are also induced in wild-type cells. During normal replication, forks meet in the terminus area and although the details of how termination is achieved remain obscure, it is generally assumed that as the two forks merge and the replisomes dissociate, any remaining gaps in the DNA are filled and the nascent strands sealed by ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Ai&#x02013;iii</xref>). The additional replication forks established during induction of SDR would be expected to lead to additional fork collisions, some of which will take place outside of the normal termination zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Bi</xref>). The known ability of RecG to unwind the D-loop and R-loop structures PriA exploits to initiate SDR may explain the much-increased SDR evident in <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Vincent <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fukuoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">McGlynn <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). However, unless an increased number of collisions of forks can lead to further pathology RecG can limit, it would not be obvious why this increase in the number of forks traversing the chromosome should have such severe consequences for <italic>recG</italic> cells.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Models depicting possible outcomes of replication fork collision.

The generation of such a 3&#x02032; flap <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Bii</xref>) may provide a substrate that PriA can then exploit with the aid of its helicase activity to load DnaB and initiate re-replication of the DNA(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Ci&#x02013;iii</xref>), which may explain the over-replication seen with <italic>tus</italic> mutants <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Krabbe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Markovitz, 2005</xref>). In doing so it would generate DNA substrates with duplex DNA ends that provoke RecBCD- and RecA-mediated recombination and thus establish yet new forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Civ and v</xref>). Such a sequence of events would account for the perpetuation of SDR long after the UV lesions inducing SDR had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), and explain the dependence of SDR on RecBCD and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>).</p><p>RecG has a particularly high affinity for a 3&#x02032; flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tanaka and Masai, 2006</xref>), and in wild-type cells may limit PriA-mediated re-replication by unwinding the structure and converting it to a 5&#x02032; flap that could be subsequently eliminated by a 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7D</xref>). In cells lacking RecG, the initial level of SDR would be elevated, leading to even higher levels of unscheduled fork collisions and therefore of 3&#x02032; flaps. Without RecG to unwind them, these flaps would have a longer half-life, increasing the opportunity for their targeting by PriA. Furthermore, without RecG, any D-loops established by subsequent recombination would be stabilized, further increasing the likelihood of perpetuating cycles of fork collisions and re-replication. In the meantime, RuvABC would resolve any Holliday junctions generated during the exchanges. This pathological cascade would explain the accumulation of branched DNA intermediates containing few Holliday junctions in irradiated <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>).</p><p>The model outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref> would predict that 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonucleases might be rather vital in the absence of RecG as they might provide the only means to avoid 3&#x02032; flaps from being targeted by PriA, enabling replication to terminate normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7E</xref>). In recent studies we have shown that the viability of <italic>recG</italic> cells does indeed depend on the presence of ExoI, ExoVII or the SbcCD nuclease, all of which can digest ssDNA from 3&#x02032; ends. We have also shown that this requirement can be overcome by eliminating the helicase activity of PriA (C.J. Rudolph, A.L. Upton and R.G. Lloyd, in preparation).</p><p>The model is also in good agreement with data by Donaldson and coworkers, showing that branched DNA structures thought to reflect Holliday junctions can be detected in UV-irradiated wild-type, <italic>ruv</italic> and <italic>recG</italic> cells in a plasmid-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). They reported that while the intermediates observed in <italic>ruv</italic> cells persisted, those detected in <italic>recG</italic> cells disappeared as in wild-type cells, as our model would predict, which indicates that they are not the same intermediates that we see accumulating in <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Recent work by Wardrope and coworkers support the conclusion that Holliday junctions do not accumulate in <italic>recG</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wardrope <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We assume that some of the high-molecular-weight intermediates we detect are the result of repeated recombinational exchanges, some of which may involve the over-replicated DNA invading the sister chromosome. Thus Holliday junction resolution by RuvABC may lead to the formation of chromosomal multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7Civ and v</xref>). Further repetitions might lead to a network of multiple chromosomal copies tied together, hence the persistence of high-molecular-weight branched DNA species in our study. This interpretation is consistent with the observed synergistic phenotype of <italic>recG</italic> with <italic>xerC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Meddows <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The XerC protein is required for the site-specific recombination at <italic>dif</italic> needed to convert chromosome dimers and higher multimers to monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lesterlin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The equivalent site-specific recombination system of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is required in order to avoid chromosomal instability following elimination of the Tus analogue, RTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lemon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), indicating that uncontrolled termination of replication in this species has similar pathological consequences.</p><p>The scenario of a replication catastrophe fits well with our observation that UV doses as low as 1 J m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> suffice to induce substantial delays in cell division and that late expression of RecG can efficiently stop the extended filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ishioka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These observations together with the fact that UV doses differing by sixfold nevertheless lead to similar levels of aberrant chromosome amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>) fit well with our model as it predicts that much of the observed pathology is triggered when a fork collision triggers formation of a 3&#x02032; flap that PriA subsequently targets. Once triggered, the re-replication of the chromosome perpetuates the problem even when the initiating lesions are long gone. This explains why the expression of <italic>recG</italic> should be able to alleviate the problem at almost any time. First, it would reduce the amount of SDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Second, it would help eliminate both the 3&#x02032; flap and D-loop intermediates that trigger and perpetuate the cascade, enabling ongoing replication forks to finish multiplication of the chromosomes present, allowing subsequent division of filaments to normal viable cells, as observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The idea of a replication catastrophe also predicts that some areas of the chromosome may be re-replicated several times over if formation of multiple forks happens to be induced in close proximity. The cycle of 3&#x02032; flap formation, over-replication and formation of additional forks via recombination would then send forks repeatedly through the same area. Such events may account for the frequent asymmetric amplification of the origin and terminus areas of the chromosome apparent in the absence of RecG, which can be quite extreme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). An alternative explanation might be the repeated firing of distinct damage-inducible origins, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kogoma, 1997</xref>). However, we found no strong evidence of such origins in our analysis of DNA synthesis mediated via SDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), although we cannot dismiss the existence of such origins. Furthermore, over-initiation at <italic>oriC</italic> has been shown to result in replication fork collapse, as secondary forks are capable of catching up with primary forks, causing the formation of linear DNA fragments due to replication run-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Simmons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The same rationale should apply to rapidly firing SDR origins, thereby limiting the ability of a single origin to cause over-replication. Finally, we have shown previously that UV-induced synthesis continues after all detectable lesions have been removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). It is not obvious why firing of specific SDR origins should occur once the initial trigger is gone.</p><p>Although the data presented here as well as in our previous study are in line with the idea that pathological replication, rather than an accumulation of recombination intermediates, is primarily responsible for the phenotype of cells lacking RecG, they do not rule out the idea that RecG can also help to resolve Holliday junctions, as initially suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lloyd, 1991</xref>). However, they raise the possibility that any recombination reaction that increases the number of replication fork collisions may have pathological consequences that reduce viability and hence the ability to recover recombinant products.</p><p>The severity of the effects observed begs the question of how replication is brought to an end in eukaryotic cells. It follows from the multiple origins per chromosome that a high frequency of replication fork collisions is the norm, but there is no evidence of the pathology described here. The replicative helicase appears to have the opposite polarity to <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Tuteja and Tuteja, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Costa and Onesti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sakakibara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, it is not clear whether it encircles the (single stranded) leading strand template or whether it encircles double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sakakibara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In the latter case, the problem might never arise. However, even in the case that only the leading strand template is encircled, any strand displacement when forks merge would involve the nascent lagging strand and create a 5&#x02032; flap rather than a recombinogenic 3&#x02032; flap, and would likely be processed via the flap endonuclease, FEN-1.

One-millilitre samples were removed every 30 min and expression induced with arabinose for 30 min. A small sample of cells was transferred to a thin 1% LB agarose layer on microscopic slides and visualized with a BX-52 Olympus microscope equipped with a coolSNAP&#x02122;HQ camera (Photometrics). eCFP and eYFP foci were visualized using the JP4-CFP-YFP filterset 86002v2 (Chroma).

Cells were grown in 56/2 salts supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and 0.32% glucose to an A<sub>650</sub> of 0.2 and UV-irradiated as for fluorescence microscopy. Cells were resuspended in the sterile filtered supernatant and the first 2 ml sample removed. 5-Bromo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) was added to the rest of the culture to 20 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Two-millilitre samples were taken at the intervals indicated, pelleted and resuspended in 85 &#x003bc;l TEE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), containing 0.1% lauroyl-sarcosine and 0.5% SDS. Eighty-five microlitres of liquid 1% low-melting-point agarose was added and the mixture solidified in a disposable plug former (Bio-Rad) at 4&#x000b0;C. Plugs were treated with 10 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lysozyme in 3 ml TEE buffer containing 0.1% lauroylsarcosine and 0.5% SDS for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C and then at 52&#x000b0;C overnight with 5 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> proteinase K in 3 ml TEE containing 1% SDS. Plugs were washed in TEE for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, treated with 1 mM phenylmethane sulphonyl fluoride (freshly prepared as 100 mM stock solution in methanol) in fresh TEE for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C and washed twice in fresh TEE for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The plugs were subsequently transferred into 300 &#x003bc;l restriction enzyme buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, the buffer changed and 25 u of NotI (NEB) added. Chromosomal DNA was digested overnight and the fragments separated on a 0.8% agarose gel (Bio-Rad pulse field certified agarose) in 0.5&#x000d7; TBE using a CHEF Mapper PFGE system (Bio-Rad), using the running conditions described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rudolph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). DNA was transferred to a Hybond-N + Membrane (Amersham) by alkaline vacuum transfer and UV cross-linked (120 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). Blocking was achieved with TBS Tween (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Tween 20) containing milk powder. Due to variations in the background intensities of different membrane batches, the milk powder concentration varied between 1.5% and 5%. After blocking the membrane was incubated for 2 h in the presence of mouse anti-BrdU antibody (Santa Cruz), diluted 1:5000 in TBS Tween. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, Bio-Rad) was used at a dilution of 1:10 000 for 1.5 h.

Preparation of chromosomal DNA in agarose plugs for gel analysis and NotI digestion was essentially as described above. For treatment with additional enzymes, the plugs were transferred to fresh buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9; 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) and the required enzyme added as indicated.
