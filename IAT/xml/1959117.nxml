It was suggested that it is the damage to the microvasculature and the ensuing decrease in oxygen supply (local tissue hypoxia) that may serve as primary signals of excessive tissue damage and need to de-activate immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the hypoxia-generated signals of excessive inflammation could be the accumulation of extracellular adenosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Thiel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, while the second signal could be provided by a hypoxia-sensing molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It was proposed that the overactive T-cells in inflamed and hypoxic areas are down-regulated by A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and hypoxia inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Semenza1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> which may act in concert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Ohta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. While the genetic evidence for the critical role of A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors in down-regulation of activated immune cells <italic>in vivo</italic> has been provided using A<sub>2A</sub> receptor deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Thiel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Ohta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby confirming the overall validity of this &#x0201c;anti-inflammatory hypoxia&#x0201d; hypotheses, the anti-inflammatory role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> remained to be proven using appropriate genetic models. The hypothesis of HIF-1&#x003b1; being <italic>anti-inflammatory</italic> in T cells seems to be counter-intuitive, since the myeloid cell-targeted deletion of HIF-1&#x003b1; resulted in the <italic>loss</italic> of inflammatory response by myeloid cells leading to the impression that HIF-1&#x003b1; in myeloid cells is <italic>pro-inflammatory</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Cramer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these findings, we reasoned that T cells may be different from macrophages and neutrophils, which are known to be much more dependent on glycolysis-derived ATP and therefore on glycolysis-controlling HIF-1&#x003b1;- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Cramer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. We considered that since HIF-1&#x003b1; is not as critical for activated T cells' short term survival as it is for myeloid cells, it may play an important T cell-down regulating role in inflamed and hypoxic tissue microenvironments <italic>in vivo</italic> by acting in concert with other hypoxia-triggered mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Sitkovsky2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. To directly test this we used mice with T cell targeted deletion of HIF-1&#x003b1; gene. The present studies of bacterial sepsis show that T&#x02013;cell specific deletion of HIF-1 &#x003b1; in mice results in: i) higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; ii) stronger anti-bacterial effects of T cells and granulocytes and iii) better survival of mice from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced bacterial sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Ebong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies to clarify the possible mechanism of the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations revealed much faster cell proliferation and enhanced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in HIF-1&#x003b1; deficient T cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed higher NF-&#x003ba;B p50 subunit expression in TCR stimulated T cells upon HIF-1&#x003b1; deletion, suggesting that the HIF-1&#x003b1;-mediated pathway is at least in part responsible for the suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B dependent cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These experiments uncover the before unappreciated reserve of pro-inflammatory capacity of T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggest novel therapeutic strategies when there is a need to enhance activity of T cells in hypoxic and/or inflamed tissues. We propose to inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1; in order to relieve from inhibition the &#x0201c;anti-bacterial&#x0201d; T cells during immune response to drug-resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>T-cells are present in hypoxic inflamed peritoneum but do not seem to contribute to anti-bacterial immune response</title><p>The comparison of survival rates of WT (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) vs. T cell deficient RAG-2 knockout (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) mice revealed no differences suggesting that T cells do not contribute to an anti-sepsis immune response in our model of sepsis (data not shown).

This, in turn, would be expected to result in uninhibited production of e.g. IFN-&#x003b3; and of other pathogen-destroying cytokines by activated T cells, as well as in the overall enhancement of the anti-bacterial host response and better survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selective disruption of HIF-1 &#x003b1; in T cells rescues mice from septic death and decreases bacterial burden-associated tissue damage</title><p>The possible contribution of T cells may have been overlooked in models of sepsis with early (&#x0003c;24 hour) lethal outcomes, since T cells may require longer than 24 hrs to be recruited to and activated in inflamed environment. Therefore, we have adapted a more long-lasting model of sepsis with &#x0223c;50&#x00025; mortality after 72 hours of CLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Ebong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> to allow sufficient time for T cell recruitment and activation in inflamed peritoneum so that T cells will have an opportunity to contribute to the anti-bacterial response. Comparative studies of mice with the confirmed HIF-1 &#x003b1; deletion in their T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>) supported the view that HIF-1&#x003b1; in T cells did inhibit them during sepsis. This was reflected in a statistically significant increase in survival of mice with HIF-1&#x003b1;-deficient T cells as compared with their HIF-1 &#x003b1; expressing littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). Survival between lck-Cre (&#x0002b;) and lck-Cre (&#x02212;) control mice was not different, demonstrating that the difference in survival between lck-Cre (&#x0002b;) HIF-1 &#x003b1; loxP and lck-Cre (&#x02212;) HIF-1 &#x003b1; loxP mice was indeed due to Cre mediated HIF-1 &#x003b1; knock-down (data not shown). In another control, the sham CLP surgery did not result in any mouse mortality (data not shown).</p><p>The significantly higher survival rates of mice with T cell-targeted deletion of HIF-1 &#x003b1; gene (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;27) as compared with control HIF-1 &#x003b1; expressing mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;29) were also observed in other independent experiments in different mice facilities (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.040, log rank test; C. Caldwell, data not shown).</p><p>The HIF-1 &#x003b1; deficient mice also had much less sepsis-associated tissue damage in different organs as demonstrated by an e.g. significant decrease in levels of liver enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>). Histological analysis of livers revealed less apoptotic hepatocytes 72 hrs after CLP in HIF-1 &#x003b1; deficient mice (not shown).</p><p>The protective effects of genetic inactivation of HIF-1&#x003b1; in T cells are most likely due to the relief from the negative regulation by HIF-1&#x003b1; of pro-inflammatory, anti-bacterial functions of T cells. This is reflected in the strong attenuation of bacterial burden in spleen and liver of HIF-1 &#x003b1;-deleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). The quantitative data showing that the decrease in bacterial counts are paralleled by a dramatic decrease in the number of gas-forming bacteria in HIF-1 &#x003b1;-deficient mice. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref> shows that masses of gas-forming bacteria formed rings around gas bubbles that also contained free bacteria in the spleen of HIF-1 &#x003b1;-expressing mice. Such intensive bacterial growth was not observed in littermates with HIF-1 &#x003b1;-deficient T cells. These data provide direct microbiological and histological evidence that HIF-1 &#x003b1; inhibits anti-bacterial activities of T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A,B</bold></xref>). Inactivation of HIF-1 &#x003b1; in T cells might contribute to amplification of bactericidal functions of cells of the innate immune system. Accordingly, granulocytes isolated from septic mice with T cell specific HIF-1 &#x003b1; deficiency were much stronger activated as indicated by levels of CD11b cell surface expression and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). In agreement with the general view that IFN- &#x003b3; is a likely candidate for T cell dependent enhancement of bactericidal functions of granulocytes, the observed rescue from septic death and the decrease in the bacteria-mediated tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g002"><bold>2A,B</bold></xref>) in mice with HIF-1 &#x003b1; protein deficiency in T cells suggested to test for a possible HIF-1&#x003b1; deficiency-induced &#x0201c;de-inhibition&#x0201d; of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in TCR-activated T cells.</p><fig id="pone-0000853-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000853.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Decreased bacterial burden in mice with T-cell targeted deletion of HIF-1 &#x003b1;.</title><p><underline>A: </underline><italic>T cell lineage specific HIF-1</italic> &#x003b1; <italic>deficient mice have much less bacterial burden in liver and spleen 72 hrs after CLP</italic> &#x0002a;:p&#x0003c;0.05 vs. WT, means&#x000b1;SEM, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 per group. <underline>B:</underline><italic>Growth of gas-forming bacteria and tissue destruction during CLP-induced sepsis in mice with HIF-1</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-expressing T cells, but not in mice with HIF-1</italic> &#x003b1; <italic>gene&#x02013;deleted T cells.</italic> Masses of bacteria form rings around gas bubbles in spleens of mice with HIF-1 &#x003b1; expressing T cells.

We hypothesized that observed effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; deletion in T cells may be due to HIF-1&#x003b1; affecting T cells by acting through NF-kB. Indeed, studies of neutrophils did suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B could be hypoxia-regulated and a HIF-dependent target to increase neutrophil survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Walmsley1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we studied the effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; deletion on NF-&#x003ba;B activity in T cells. As shown by EMSA, NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity was enhanced in nuclear extracts of TCR stimulated HIF-1&#x003b1; deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>).

NF-&#x003ba;B family profiling (p65, p50, c-Rel, p52 and RelB ) of DNA binding activity of T cell nuclear extracts showed that upon TCR activation the activity of both the p50 and the p65 subunits significantly increased in HIF-1&#x003b1; deficient cells as compared to T cells with intact HIF-1&#x003b1; genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). To find out whether these findings are due to NF-&#x003ba;B transcription, we performed quantitative RT-PCR which confirmed a significant increase in NF-&#x003ba;B p50 mRNA expression in HIF-1&#x003b1; deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000853-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Thus, HIF-1&#x003b1; is likely to suppress TCR stimulated T cell responses by preventing p50 transcription and thereby inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Although HIF-1&#x003b1; is capable to directly inhibit transcription (e.g. CAD gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> or ENT gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Eltzschig1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>), we were not able to identify putative HRE sites in the promoter region of the p50 encoding gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000853-Ten1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> by analyses using a hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm.

Furthermore, we show that the observed anti-inflammatory effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; during anti-bacterial response results from suppression of T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production most likely due to inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B/p50 transcription and subsequent reduction of NF-&#x003ba;B activity.</p><p>Of potential clinical significance, these observations offer a new approach to enhance the immune response by de-inhibiting T cells from HIF-1&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated immunosuppression and thereby enhancing production of IFN-&#x003b3; by T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may-in turn-lead to a greater activation of cells of the innate immune system, which then play a key role in the early bacterial elimination. Our findings may re-invigorate the attention to the anti-bacterial effects of T cells and appeal to recruit T cells' powerful, but otherwise unavailable anti-bacterial capacity in novel anti-sepsis therapies. Moreover, our observations of T cells inhibition by HIF-1&#x003b1; in hypoxic inflamed peritoneum suggest that activated anti-tumor T cells may be also inhibited near or within hypoxic tumors by HIF-1&#x003b1;.
