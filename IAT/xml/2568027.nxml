Tomosyn inhibits SNARE complex formation and neurotransmitter release by sequestering syntaxin-1 through its C-terminal vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)&#x02013;like domain (VLD). However, in tomosyn-deficient mice, the SNARE complex formation is unexpectedly decreased. In this study, we demonstrate that the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn catalyzes the oligomerization of the SNARE complex. Microinjection of the tomosyn N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain into neurons prevented stimulated acetylcholine release. Thus, tomosyn inhibits neurotransmitter release by catalyzing oligomerization of the SNARE complex through the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain in addition to the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal VLD.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>T.

Depolarization induces Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx into the cytosol of nerve terminals through the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, and this Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx initiates the fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane, finally leading to exocytosis of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">S&#x000fc;dhof, 2000</xref>). Soluble SNAREs are essential for the synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weis and Scheller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jahn and S&#x000fc;dhof, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>). Synaptic vesicles are endowed with vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) as a vesicular SNARE, whereas the presynaptic plasma membrane is endowed with syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 as target SNAREs. VAMP-2 interacts with SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 to form a stable SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Trimble et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">S&#x000f6;llner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>). The formation of the SNARE complex brings synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane into close apposition and provides the energy that drives the mixing of the two lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Tomosyn is a syntaxin-1&#x02013;binding protein that we originally identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujita et al., 1998</xref>). Tomosyn contains a large N-terminal domain with a WD-40 repeat domain and a C-terminal domain homologous to VAMP-2. The large N-terminal region of tomosyn shares similarity to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae (Lgl), the mammalian homologues M-Lgl1 and M-Lgl2, and the yeast proteins Sro7p and Sro77p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wirtz-Peitz and Knoblich, 2006</xref>). A structural study of tomosyn indicated that the C-terminal VAMP-like domain (VLD) of tomosyn acts as a SNARE domain that competes with VAMP-2, leading to inhibition of the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pobbati et al., 2004</xref>). We previously showed that tomosyn is directly phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and that this reduces its interaction with syntaxin-1 and enhances the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Rho-associated serine/threonine kinase activated by Rho small G protein phosphorylates syntaxin-1, thereby increasing the affinity of syntaxin-1 for tomosyn and the formation of a stable complex between the two, resulting in inhibition of the formation of the SNARE complex during neurite extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sakisaka et al., 2004</xref>). Recent genetic studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> showed that TOM-1, an orthologue of vertebrate tomosyn, inhibits the priming of synaptic vesicles and that this priming is modulated by the balance between TOM-1 and UNC-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McEwen et al., 2006</xref>). The large N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn was shown to be involved in the inhibitory role of tomosyn on exocytosis of dense core granules in adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Constable et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yizhar et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, evidence is accumulating that tomosyn acts as a negative regulator for the formation of the SNARE complex, thereby inhibiting various vesicle fusion events. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of the large N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we show that tomosyn catalyzes oligomerization of the SNARE complex upon the direct interactions of the WD-40 repeat domain with SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1. Tomosyn inhibits SNARE-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion via both N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain&#x02013;mediated oligomerization of the SNARE complex and C-terminal VLD-based competitive inhibition of SNARE complex formation, resulting in potent inhibition of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of tomosyn-deficient mice</title><p>To disrupt tomosyn in embryonic stem (ES) cells, gene targeting was used to replace the first coding exon and the 5&#x02032; half of exon 2 with an MC1-neomycin resistance cassette (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The targeting vector was electroporated into RW4 ES cells, and six G418-resistant colonies heterozygous for the tomosyn gene were selected. Cells from two independent ES clones were used to generate chimeric mice and successfully contributed to germline transmission. Tomosyn heterozygotes were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant offspring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Mice homozygous for the disrupted allele expressed no intact tomosyn protein as analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The homozygous mice were born at a lower than expected frequency, but born homozygous mice appeared healthy. However, when we attempted to generate C57B/6 backcrossed homozygous mice, homozygous mice backcrossed for more than three generations were not born, possibly because of a low fertilization rate in C57B/6 heterozygous mice (unpublished data). In this study, we used hybrid mice between C57B/6 and BDF1 mice because backcrossing to the C57B/6 genetic background had been unsuccessful. First, we examined the effect of tomosyn deficiency on the expression levels of SNARE proteins, including syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, VAMP-2, and complexin. No significant changes were observed as estimated by immunoblotting of the homogenates of P20 cerebra with antibodies (Abs) against the respective proteins. These results indicate that tomosyn deficiency does not affect the expression levels of SNARE proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Properties of synaptic transmission and plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in tomosyn-deficient mice.</bold> (A) Targeted disruption of the tomosyn gene.

First, we examined the efficacy of synaptic transmission at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses by measuring input&#x02013;output relationships of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). EPSPs were increased in tomosyn-deficient mice at all stimulus intensities tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that synaptic transmission was enhanced. Next, we examined presynaptic short-term plasticity by inducing paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at mossy fiber synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). PPF of tomosyn-deficient mice was decreased at all interstimulus intervals tested, indicating that the probability of neurotransmitter release was increased in tomosyn-deficient mice. Finally, we examined long-term plasticity by inducing long-term potentiation (LTP; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). The magnitude of mossy fiber LTP in tomosyn-deficient mice was reduced only during the first 20 min. The limitation of this reduction to the early stage of LTP in tomosyn-deficient mice may indicate that mossy fiber LTP consists of two phases, only the early one of which is regulated by tomosyn. Collectively, these results indicate that the probability of neurotransmitter release in tomosyn-deficient mice is higher than that in wild-type mice, suggesting that tomosyn inhibits synaptic vesicle fusion in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced formation of the oligomerized SNARE complex in the tomosyn-deficient brain</title><p>Because the tomosyn deficiency facilitated synaptic transmission, we examined whether the formation of the SNARE complex was affected by tomosyn deficiency. For this purpose, we took advantage of the fact that the assembled SNARE complex is resistant to an SDS sample buffer at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayashi et al., 1994</xref>). Brain lysates from tomosyn-deficient and wild-type mice were solubilized in the SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti&#x02013;syntaxin-1 and anti&#x02013;SNAP-25 mAbs. Because tomosyn was known to inhibit the formation of the SNARE complex by competing with VAMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pobbati et al., 2004</xref>), we expected that the formation of the SNARE complex would be increased in tomosyn-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the amount of the assembled SNARE complex in tomosyn-deficient mice was reduced compared with wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The molecular mass of the immunoblot band was apparently larger (&#x0223c;110 kD) than that of the expected single ternary SNARE complex (&#x0223c;50 kD). Because a previous study has suggested that the single ternary SNARE complex can form an oligomeric structure and exists as a star-shaped particle with three to four bundles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickman et al., 2005</xref>), we assumed that the higher molecular mass bands might represent an oligomerized SNARE complex. Glycerol density gradient ultracentrifugation confirmed that the higher molecular mass bands sedimented in fractions with the mass of the oligomerized SNARE complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, the oligomerized SNARE complex was restored by the addition of recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)&#x02013;tomosyn to brain extracts from tomosyn-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, top). These results indicate that tomosyn enhances the oligomerization of the SNARE complex.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Tomosyn-enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complex in vivo.</bold> (A) Immunoblot analysis of the oligomerized SNARE complex from the brains of wild-type or tomosyn-deficient mice.

An aliquot of each fraction was solubilized in the SDS sample buffer at RT and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti&#x02013;syntaxin-1 mAb. (C) Localization of SNAP-25 in the hippocampal CA3 region in wild-type and tomosyn-deficient mice.

Each fraction was boiled in the SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Flotillin-2 was used as a lipid raft marker. Quantification of the amount of protein in each fraction is shown in the right panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830323f02"></graphic></fig><p>We next examined whether the tomosyn deficiency affected the cellular localization of SNARE proteins. We immunostained the hippocampi of adult wild-type and tomosyn-deficient mice with anti&#x02013;SNAP-25 mAb (SMI81), which is highly specific for SNAP-25 and recognizes the SNAP-25 molecule incorporated into the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickman et al., 2005</xref>). The immunoreactivity for SNAP-25 was prominently reduced in the tomosyn-deficient brain in comparison with the wild-type brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The most intense immunoreactivity for tomosyn was observed at the stratum lucidum of the CA3 area of the hippocampus in the wild-type brain, where the synapses between the mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells localize. Immunoreactivity for SNAP-25 was also observed at the stratum lucidum of the CA3 area in the wild-type brain. Only faint colocalization of SNAP-25 with tomosyn was observed there. We further assessed the localization of the SNARE proteins biochemically. Recent studies have revealed that a subpopulation of SNAP-25 associates with lipid raft microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sala&#x000fc;n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Puri and Roche, 2006</xref>). In wild-type mice, SNAP-25 was concentrated in both raft and nonraft fractions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), consistent with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sala&#x000fc;n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Puri and Roche, 2006</xref>). However, tomosyn was predominantly detected in the nonraft fractions. This distinct distribution supports the faint colocalization of SNAP-25 with tomosyn on the immunostained brain sections. In tomosyn-deficient mice, the concentrations of SNAP-25 in raft and nonraft fractions were weakened, and SNAP-25 was diffusely distributed throughout all fractions. The distribution of syntaxin-1 was not affected by tomosyn deficiency. These results suggest that tomosyn regulates the concentration of SNAP-25 in lipid raft microdomains. The decreased immunostaining intensity for SNAP-25 is explained by the decreased formation of the oligomerized SNARE complex and the diffuse localization of SNAP-25 on the synaptic membrane in tomosyn-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Tomosyn-enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complex in vitro</title><p>Next, we examined the ability of tomosyn to either enhance the formation of the SNARE complex or the oligomerization of the SNARE complex in a cell-free assay system using recombinant proteins. Recombinant MBP-tomosyn was incubated with syntaxin-1 lacking the transmembrane domain (referred to as syntaxin-1 hereafter), SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 lacking the transmembrane (referred to as VAMP-2 hereafter) for 12 h under reducing conditions. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the SDS sample buffer at RT, and each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The recombinant tomosyn protein shifted a 50-kD immunoreactive band to molecular masses of 90 and 130 kD in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), suggesting that tomosyn enhanced the oligomerization of the SNARE complex. An intense band for MBP-tomosyn was detected at a higher molecular mass than the oligomerized SNARE complex, indicating that tomosyn was not incorporated into the SDS-resistant oligomerized SNARE complex. Characterization of the proteins extracted from the 130-kD band suggestive of the oligomerized SNARE complex and the 50-kD band suggestive of the monomeric SNARE complex revealed that both bands were composed of syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 at a ratio of 1:1:1, suggesting that the high molecular weight reaction product represents the oligomerized SNARE complex (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Tomosyn-enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complex in vitro.</bold> (A) Reconstitution of tomosyn-induced oligomerization of the SNARE complex.

Indeed, it was reported that the SNARE complex oligomer induced by complexin, which was originally reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tokumaru et al. (2001)</xref>, was an oxidative artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>). To avoid this artificial oxidation, we reacted the SNARE proteins and tomosyn under reducing conditions (1 mM DTT) in all in vitro assays, and reaction products were solubilized with the SDS sample buffer supplemented with a high concentration of a reducing reagent (75 mM DTT) before SDS-PAGE analysis. In addition, we reacted the SNARE proteins and tomosyn in the presence of TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), a stable reducing reagent, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2007</xref>). Tomosyn enhanced the oligomerization of the SNARE complex even in the presence of 0.5 mM TCEP (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting that the oligomerization of the SNARE complex was not simply caused by artificial oxidation. Next, we compared the activity of tomosyn to enhance the oligomerization of the SNARE complex with that of complexin. Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>), complexin did not enhance the oligomerization of the SNARE complex under reducing conditions (Fig. S2 B). In contrast, tomosyn enhanced the oligomerization of the SNARE complex in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we reacted the N-terminal portion of SNAP-25 (residues 1&#x02013;95), the C-terminal portion of SNAP-25 encompassing the cysteine-rich hinge region (residues 96&#x02013;206), syntaxin-1, and VAMP-2 under reducing conditions in the presence of various amounts of MBP-tomosyn. The high molecular weight SNARE complexes indicative of the oligomerized SNARE complex were not formed in these reactions with divided SNAP-25 molecules (Fig. S2 C). These results indicate that the tomosyn-enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complexes is not an artifact caused by oxidative cross-linking of SNAP-25 and that the intact structure of SNAP-25 is essential for the oligomerization of the SNARE complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Different affinities for SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 between the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain and the C-terminal VLD</title><p>Tomosyn has at least two domains: an N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain and a C-terminal VLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujita et al., 1998</xref>).

However, this competing activity of the VLD does not explain the activity of tomosyn to enhance the oligomerization of the SNARE complex. Therefore, we further characterized the possible interaction of tomosyn with the SNARE proteins. We first made an MBP-fused VLD (MBP-VLD; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and examined the interaction between the MBP-VLD and SNARE proteins.

VAMP-2 did not bind to MBP-VLD. Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 each enhanced the binding of the other to MBP-VLD by threefold, presumably reflecting the formation of a SNARE complex&#x02013;like structure. VAMP-2 did not affect the binding of syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 to MBP-VLD. We next made a VLD-deficient mutant of tomosyn (tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD) as an MBP fusion protein and examined the interaction between MBP-tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD and the SNARE proteins.

Next, we tested whether tomosyn enhanced the oligomerization of SNARE complexes containing full-length syntaxin-1 and full-length VAMP-2. Full-length syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and full-length VAMP-2 were incubated in the presence or absence of MBP-tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD. Tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD enhanced the oligomerization of SNARE complexes composed of full-length syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805150/DC1</ext-link>). Visualization of the samples by rotary shadowing electron microscopy indicated that tomosyn enhanced the formation of star-shaped assemblies of SNARE complexes (Fig. S3 B). We also observed that the reaction of full-length syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 predominantly led to formation of oligomerized SNARE complexes by themselves, whereas the reaction of syntaxin-1&#x02013;&#x00394;TM, full-length SNAP-25, and VAMP-2&#x02013;&#x00394;TM predominantly led to formation of the monomeric SNARE complex <bold>(</bold>compare Fig. S1 A with Fig. S3 C, left). Characterization of the reaction products of full-length syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 showed that the oligomerized SNARE complex was composed of these molecules at a ratio of 1:1:1 (Fig. S3 C, right). Therefore, these results indicate that the transmembrane domains of syntaxin-1 and VAMP-2 have the ability to facilitate the oligomerization of the SNARE complexes and that the WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn enhances the oligomerization of the SNARE complex independently of the transmembrane domains of syntaxin-1 and VAMP-2. These results provide an explanation of our observation that the oligomerized SNARE complex, but not the monomeric complex, was detected in brain lysates from mouse brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), although the monomeric SNARE complex was readily detected among the in vitro reaction products of syntaxin-1&#x02013;&#x00394;TM, full-length SNAP-25, and VAMP-2&#x02013;&#x00394;TM.</p><p>We further characterized the nature of the tomosyn-enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complex.

The SNARE proteins formed the oligomerized SNARE complex in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that a higher amount of the monomeric SNARE complexes assembles as oligomers in a tomosyn-independent manner. The reactions in the presence of MBP-tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD moderately enhanced the formation of the monomeric SNARE complex and dramatically enhanced the formation of the oligomerized SNARE complex at all concentrations of the SNARE proteins tested. Next, we examined whether tomosyn oligomerizes preassembled SNARE complexes. The SNARE proteins were fully reacted in advance, and the formed SNARE complexes (preassembled SNARE complexes) were reacted with MBP-tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD (Fig. S4 B). MBP-tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD enhanced oligomerization of the SNARE complex.

First, we determined the precise binding site of tomosyn. The large N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn was divided into three fragments: fragment 1 (Frg. 1), which contained the first five WD-40 repeats, Frg. 2, which contained the second two WD-40 repeats, and Frg. 3, comprising the C-terminal region with no WD-40 repeats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>).

Frgs. 1 and 2, but not Frg. 3, enhanced the oligomerization of the SNARE complex, in agreement with their affinity to syntaxin-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

We reconstituted tomosyn-induced oligomerization of the SNARE complex in vitro and showed that the WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn has an intrinsic ability to catalyze the oligomerization of the SNARE complex. It was previously reported that the C-terminal VLD of tomosyn acts as a SNARE domain competing with VAMP-2 and thereby inhibiting the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yokoyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pobbati et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with these studies, our in vitro assay showed that the C-terminal VLD of tomosyn inhibits the formation of the SNARE complex. Therefore, we concluded that tomosyn potently inhibits SNARE-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion via both N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain&#x02013;catalyzed oligomerization of the SNARE complex and C-terminal VLD-based competitive inhibition of SNARE complex formation.</p><p>Synaptic efficacy at mossy fiber synapses was enhanced in tomosyn-deficient mice, suggesting that tomosyn inhibits synaptic transmission in normal animals, most likely through regulation of the oligomerization of the SNARE complex. We also demonstrated that PPF was significantly smaller in tomosyn-deficient mice than in littermate wild-type mice. PPF is a physiological measure of the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal; PPF increases when the probability is decreased but decreases when the probability is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Manabe et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, the enhanced synaptic efficacy in the input&#x02013;output relationship in tomosyn-deficient mice is most probably caused by increased probability of neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, there was no difference in the magnitude of mossy fiber LTP measured 50&#x02013;60 min after tetanic stimulation, whereas short-term potentiation observed for &#x0223c;20 min after tetanic stimulation in tomosyn-deficient mice is smaller than that in littermate wild-type mice. These findings indicate that mossy fiber LTP is composed of at least two phases, and only the earlier potentiation is associated with tomosyn-mediated regulation of transmitter release, whereas expression of the later phase of LTP is not mediated by tomosyn. Because basal probability of neurotransmitter release is apparently different between wild-type and tomosyn-deficient mice but the magnitude of LTP at the late phase is not, the expression of mossy fiber LTP is likely to be independent of the initial probability of neurotransmitter release. It has been reported that mossy fiber LTP is mediated by cAMP and PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weisskopf et al., 1994</xref>). In this study, the authors found that forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and membrane-permeable cAMP analogues potentiate mossy fiber EPSPs via the same mechanism underlying mossy fiber LTP induced by tetanic stimulation of mossy fibers; after potentiation by the application of these drugs, no long-lasting potentiation was induced by tetanic stimulation. However, short-term potentiation could still be observed after tetanic stimulation for &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30 min, and this resembled the short-term potentiation that is absent in the tomosyn-deficient mice. Thus, mossy fiber LTP is quite likely to be mediated by two different mechanisms, one of which is dependent on tomosyn and short lasting and the other of which is independent of tomosyn and long lasting.</p><p>The activity of the WD-40 repeat domain to catalyze the oligomerization of the SNARE complex was repressed by the C-terminal VLD, suggesting that the catalytic activity of the WD-40 repeat domain competes with C-terminal VLD-based inhibition of SNARE complex formation. Therefore, it is plausible that these two inhibitory actions of tomosyn against the SNARE complexes are properly balanced in vivo. Indeed, we showed that PKA is one possible regulator of this balance. We previously reported that PKA phosphorylates tomosyn, resulting in decreased affinity of the C-terminal VLD for syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 2005</xref>). The PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of tomosyn increases the fusion-competent readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and thereby enhances neurotransmitter release in SCG neurons. In this study, we demonstrated that the PKA-phosphorylated form of tomosyn enhances the oligomerization of the SNARE complex more efficiently than the nonphosphorylated form, indicating that PKA regulates the activity of the WD-40 repeats domain to enhance the oligomerization of the SNARE complex and inhibits neurotransmitter release. The present results are apparently inconsistent with our previous results, but the reason for this inconsistency is unknown. However, the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of tomosyn may be more important for balancing the activities of the WD-40 repeat domain and the C-terminal VLD than for altering the affinity of the C-terminal VLD for syntaxin-1. We previously showed that the major phosphorylation site of tomosyn, serine 724, is located at the linker region between the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain and the C-terminal VLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baba et al., 2005</xref>). The linker region may act as an intramolecular switch for tomosyn by balancing its two inhibitory effects on SNARE function.</p><p>The WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn shares similarity to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor suppressor D-Lgl, its mammalian homologues M-Lgl1 and M-Lgl2, and the yeast proteins Sro7p and Sro77p, which play important roles in polarized exocytosis by regulating SNARE function on the plasma membrane in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, mammalian epithelial cells, and yeast, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wirtz-Peitz and Knoblich, 2006</xref>). A recent structural study of Sro7 suggested that the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of Sro7 interacts with Sec9, a yeast counterpart of SNAP-25, and that this interaction inhibits the formation of the monomeric SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hattendorf et al., 2007</xref>). These results are inconsistent with our present finding that the interaction of the N-terminal WD-40 repeat domain of tomosyn with SNAP-25 did not inhibit the formation of the monomeric SNARE complexes. However, it remains unknown whether the WD-40 repeat domain of Sro7 catalyzes the oligomerization of the SNARE complex as tomosyn does. Further studies of the WD-40 repeat domains of M-Lgl1, M-Lgl2, Sro7, and Sro77 will be needed to understand the conserved role of Lgl family proteins in the regulation of SNARE function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Expression vectors for full-length rat medium-sized tomosyn (1&#x02013;1,116 aa) and tomosyn-&#x00394;VLD (1&#x02013;949 aa) were constructed in pFastBac1-MBP using standard molecular biology methods.
