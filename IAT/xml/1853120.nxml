In mammals, the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males creates additional sex-specific challenges, including incomplete X and Y pairing during meiotic prophase. This triggers formation of a heterochromatin domain, the XY body. The XY body disassembles after prophase, but specialized sex chromatin persists, with further modification, through meiosis. Here, we investigate the function of DMRT7, a mammal-specific protein related to the invertebrate sexual regulators Doublesex and MAB-3. We find that DMRT7 preferentially localizes to the XY body in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and is required for male meiosis. In <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutants, meiotic pairing and recombination appear normal, and a transcriptionally silenced XY body with appropriate chromatin marks is formed, but most germ cells undergo apoptosis during pachynema. A minority of mutant cells can progress to diplonema, but many of these escaping cells have abnormal sex chromatin lacking histone H3K9 di- and trimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1&#x003b2; accumulation, modifications that normally occur between pachynema and diplonema. Based on the localization of DMRT7 to the XY body and the sex chromatin defects observed in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutants, we conclude that DMRT7 plays a role in the sex chromatin transformation that occurs between pachynema and diplonema. We suggest that DMRT7 may help control the transition from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation to postmeiotic sex chromatin in males. In addition, because it is found in all branches of mammals, but not in other vertebrates, <italic>Dmrt7</italic> may shed light on evolution of meiosis and of sex chromatin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Genes related to the sexual regulator <italic>Doublesex</italic> of <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been found to control sexual development in a wide variety of animals, ranging from roundworms to mammals. In this paper, we investigate the function of the <italic>Dmrt7</italic> gene, one of seven related genes in the mouse. Female mammals are XX and males are XY, a chromosomal difference that presents specific challenges during the meiotic phase of male germ cell development. Some of these are thought to be overcome by incorporating the X and Y chromosomes into a specialized structure called the XY body. We find that DMRT7 protein is present in germ cells, localizes to the male XY body during meiosis, and is essential for male but not female fertility.

Many of these dimorphisms affect somatic cells, but the sexual dimorphisms that most directly mediate sexual reproduction are those of the gametes themselves. Gametes differ between the sexes in size and morphology, sometimes dramatically so, reflecting their very different roles in zygote formation. Indeed, the morphology of the gametes is what defines sex: females are the sex that produces the larger gametes and males produce the smaller ones.</p><p>Mammalian meiosis is regulated sex-specifically starting in embryogenesis and continuing through much of adult life (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). For example, the timing and synchrony of meiosis are very different in the two sexes. In females, germ cells synchronously initiate meiosis in the embryo and arrest during meiotic prophase I. After puberty, oocytes are selectively recruited for ovulation, when they proceed to metaphase II and then complete meiosis after fertilization occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, male meiosis occurs entirely postnatally, without the arrest periods found in females. In females, each meiosis can produce a single haploid oocyte (and two extruded polar bodies), whereas each male meiosis can produce four haploid spermatocytes.</p><p>Other meiotic processes, such as recombination and chromosome pairing (synapsis), occur in both sexes but operate somewhat differently. For example, there is a higher failure rate for meiosis in females, with human oocyte aneuploidy rates up to 25&#x00025; versus about 2&#x00025; in human sperm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, and this may indicate that the checkpoints controlling and monitoring the events of meiotic progression in males are more stringent. Consistent with this idea, genetic analysis of a number of meiotic regulatory genes in the mouse has demonstrated a much stronger requirement in males than in females &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The existence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, such as the XX/XY system of mammals, creates sex-specific challenges. One is the need for mechanisms to balance expression of sex-linked genes between the sexes, which in mammals is accomplished by X chromosome inactivation in females &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In male germ cells there is another sex-specific consideration during meiosis. In prophase I, when the homologous chromosomes synapse and homologous recombination occurs, X and Y chromosome pairing is limited to a region termed the pseudoautosomal region, leaving large portions of each chromosome unpaired. In eutherian and marsupial mammals, these unpaired chromosome regions are associated with a specialized chromatin domain termed the XY body or sex body. The function of the XY body is uncertain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, but there is evidence that it is essential for male meiotic progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several proteins are reported to localize to the XY body, including BRCA1, ATR, the histone variant H3.3, and modified histones such as ubiquitinated H2A (Ub-H2A) and phosphorylated H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In the XY body, the sex chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced in a process termed meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). The XY body disappears after pachynema; however, many sex-linked genes remain transcriptionally silent into spermiogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because this earlier work did not examine adult <italic>Dmrt7</italic> expression, we first performed reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR on mRNA from ten adult organs and detected strong <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mRNA expression in the testis and a trace of expression in heart, but not in any other tissue tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The antibody was raised against a unique region lacking the DM domain in order to avoid cross-reaction with other DM domain proteins. Immunofluorescent staining with purified DMRT7 antisera showed that DMRT7 protein is expressed predominantly in mid- to late-pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), as well as in sperm, and is not detectable in other germ cell types including spermatogonia and round spermatids. We did not detect DMRT7 protein in somatic cells such as Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells, or Leydig cells. To more precisely determine the pachytene stages of DMRT7 expression, we double-stained with an antibody to GATA1, which is expressed in Sertoli cells from stages VII to IX &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

We also confirmed XY body localization of DMRT7 by double staining for other markers including Ub-H2A and &#x003b3;H2AX (unpublished data). DMRT7 is not preferentially localized to the XY body at all stages but instead is dynamic. Based on epithelial staging, it appears that DMRT7 localizes to the XY body from mid- to late-pachynema, becomes diffusely distributed in late-pachynema, and disappears in diplonema (unpublished data). This localization was confirmed by staining of meiotic spreads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030062-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). DMRT7 also is specifically localized in sperm, with antibody staining mainly in the perinuclear ring of the sperm head manchette.

These meiotic defects are in agreement with a recent preliminary analysis of another <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. While some <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant tubules are highly vacuolated and contain primarily Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, others have abundant primary spermatocytes. In addition, some tubules contain multinucleated cells and cells with darkly stained nuclei that are typical of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>Since <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant testes lack most post-pachytene cells, we used TUNEL analysis to test whether the missing cells are eliminated by apoptosis. At 3 wk, <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant testes contain significantly more apoptotic cells than those of wild-type controls. The percentage of tubule sections with five or more apoptotic nuclei was about three times higher in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutants compared with wild-type (20&#x00025; versus 7&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). A similar elevation of apoptosis was apparent in mutant testes at 7 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). In mutants, many apoptotic cells were in the middle of the tubules, whereas the apoptotic cells in wild-type occur mainly near the seminiferous tubule periphery. The numbers of Sertoli cells were not significantly different between wild-type and mutant testes, and we observed no difference in somatic cell apoptosis in mutants (unpublished data). From these results, we conclude that loss of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> causes a block in meiotic progression, mainly in pachynema, leading to the elimination, by apoptosis, of the arrested cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Pachytene Arrest of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> Mutant Germ Cells</title><p>To better define the spermatogenic stage at which <italic>Dmrt7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> male germ cells arrest and die, we used antibodies against several stage-specific germ cell markers.

Although we did not detect DMRT7 expression in Sertoli cells by antibody staining, we nevertheless considered the possibility that Sertoli cell defects might contribute to the male-specific germ line failure of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutants. To characterize Sertoli cell differentiation, we examined expression of the Sertoli cell markers GATA4 (a marker of immature postnatal Sertoli cells) and GATA1 (a mature Sertoli cell marker).

In such tubules, nuclei of pre-meiotic germ cells and spermatocytes were packed close to the basal membrane and few germ cells were found in the adlumenal region.</p><p>The aberrant Sertoli cell organization in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant testes raised the possibility that the germ cell phenotype might indirectly result from defects in Sertoli cell function.

To better understand the basis of the meiotic arrest, we more closely examined meiotic germ cells in the mutant. We focused on the XY body, which is thought to be essential for meiotic progression and is the site of preferential DMRT7 localization. Condensation of the X and Y chromosomes begins in late-zygotene cells, and, by mid-pachynema (when homologous chromosome pairs are fully aligned) the sex chromatin forms a microscopically visible spherical structure near the nuclear periphery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We first asked whether DMRT7 is required for XY body formation by evaluating several characteristic XY body chromatin features.

H2AX is a variant of H2A that is crucial for XY body formation and MSCI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. &#x003b3;H2AX localized normally to the XY body of DMRT7 mutant cells in meiotic spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), and many &#x003b3;H2AX-positive puncta were present in germ cells of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Next, we examined SUMO-1 localization in the mutant testis. SUMO-1 expression normally increases in the XY body of early- to mid-pachytene spermatocytes at the time of sex chromosome condensation. Prior to the completion of the first meiotic division, SUMO-1 disappears from the XY body as the X and Y chromosomes desynapse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Punctate SUMO-1 localization was present in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant germ cells, again consistent with formation of a correctly marked XY body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). However, some tubules in mutants had multiple layers of cells with SUMO-1-condensed spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), rather than the normal single layer of cells. This accumulation of XY body&#x02013;containing cells also was apparent with &#x003b3;H2AX staining and is consistent with a developmental arrest of mutant cells in mid- to late-pachytene. We also examined Ub-H2A localization in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant testes. In early-pachytene, Ub-H2A is concentrated in the XY body; by mid-pachytene Ub-H2A is observed throughout the entire nucleus, but it again becomes limited to the XY body in late-pachytene spermatocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

We found that HP1&#x003b2; localization is normal in DMRT7 mutant cells in mid-pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">8</xref>D). These results suggest that XY body formation and initiation of MSCI both occur normally in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant germ cells.</p><p>We next considered the possibility that sex chromatin is established normally but is not properly modified as cells exit pachynema and begin to form PMSC. Although most <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant cells are eliminated by apoptosis prior to diplonema, we were able to examine epigenetic markers of PMSC in rare <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant spermatocytes that escaped pachytene arrest and progressed into diplonema. First, we examined nascent transcription by Cot-1 hybridization. Although heterochromatic regions generally showed lower Cot-1 signal than euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">8</xref>F), in some mutant cells the sex chromatin appeared to be incompletely silenced relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>F). We also examined three epigenetic signatures of PMSC: histone H3 dimethylated or trimethylated at lysine-9 (H3-2meK9, H3-3meK9) and spreading of HP1&#x003b2; through the XY body &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d; (S.

Although HP1&#x003b2; localization to the X chromosome centromere initially appeared normal at mid-pachynema, we observed <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant diplotene cells that failed to show spreading of HP1&#x003b2; to the entire XY body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">8</xref>H). Similarly, we found <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant diplotene cells lacking accumulation of H3-2meK9 and H3-3meK9 marks onto the sex chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>I&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">8</xref>L).</p><p>Not all <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant diplotene cells showed abnormal localization of HP1&#x003b2; to the sex chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>M). In one experiment, 11/27 mutant cells in diplonema lacked HP1&#x003b2; on the XY body, as compared with 2/22 wild-type cells. We hypothesize that the mutant cells with normal HP1&#x003b2; may be those that can complete meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g005">5</xref>).

In males, DMRT7 expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes, and the protein preferentially localizes to the XY body. Consistent with this expression, we found that most mutant male germ cells arrest in pachynema and undergo apoptosis, although a small proportion can progress to diplonema and sometimes beyond. Examination of chromatin and nascent transcription in mutant cells that progressed to diplonema revealed sex chromatin abnormalities, as discussed below.</p><p>The pachytene stage of prophase involves tremendous chromosomal changes as the homologs align, synapse, and recombine. During this period, at least one pachytene surveillance system exists to monitor key events of meiotic progression. Cells in which any of these events is anomalous are efficiently eliminated by apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Another key event of pachynema in male mammals is the packaging of the sex chromosomes into the XY body and the establishment of MSCI. Examination of male meiosis in XYY mice and mice carrying a sex-chromosome-to-autosome translocation showed that cells in which a sex chromosome escapes MSCI are eliminated prior to late-pachynema &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. This indicates that the establishment of MSCI also is subject to surveillance.</p><p>Since the arrest and apoptosis of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant spermatocytes could result from perturbation of any of the critical pachytene events mentioned above, we tested whether they occur abnormally in the mutant cells. We found that chromosomal synapsis and recombination appear normal in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant cells. We therefore focused on the XY body, the most prominent site of DMRT7 accumulation. First, we tested whether the XY body forms and MSCI is established in <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant cells. Surprisingly, we found that these cells form an XY body with normal morphology and proper accumulation of all the chromatin marks we examined. Moreover, Cot-1 hybridization and analysis of RBMY expression demonstrated that MSCI initiates normally in the XY body of mid-pachytene <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant cells.</p><p>We did, however, observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema. Normally cells accumulate H3-2meK9 and H3-3meK9 marks and HP1&#x003b2; protein on the sex chromatin as they progress to diplonema, but we observed mutant diplotene cells lacking these features. Thus, although a minority of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema, there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition. A function in male sex chromatin can reconcile the findings that DMRT7 is required for meiosis, but only in males, and is present only in mammals. A proportion of mutant diplotene cells have apparently normal sex chromatin (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030062-g008">Figure 8</xref>M); these are likely to be the cells that can progress beyond diplonema.</p><p>Because most <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects, a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects. The reciprocal situation (sex chromatin defects caused by apoptosis) is possible, but seems unlikely, because we observed mutant cells with sex chromatin defects but no indications of apoptosis. Alternatively, apoptosis and abnormal sex chromatin may be two independent consequences of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> loss. This question cannot be answered definitively until we know the detailed molecular mechanism of DMRT7.</p><p>A number of other proteins have been identified that interact with the XY body, including histone variants and modified histones, a testis-specific histone methyl transferase, chromobox proteins, an orphan receptor germ-cell nuclear factor, and recombination-related proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. A common feature of these proteins is involvement with heterochromatin and/or transcriptional repression. DMRT7 is unusual among XY body proteins in being related to highly site-specific transcriptional regulators. An attractive speculation is that DMRT7 may provide sequence specificity in recruiting other proteins, such as chromatin modifiers, to the XY body as part of the transition to PMSC. Chromatin regulation may be a common mechanism for DM domain proteins, as we find that other DM domain proteins associate with chromatin modifying complexes (M. W. Murphy, D. Zarkower, and V. J. Bardwell, unpublished data).</p><p>The finding that <italic>Dmrt7</italic> is essential for mammalian meiosis expands the known functions of this gene family. Invertebrate DM domain genes so far have only been found to function in somatic cells. Two other DM domain genes, <italic>Dmrt1</italic> and <italic>Dmrt4,</italic> do affect germ cell development in the mouse. <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is required in pre-meiotic male germ cells for differentiation of gonocytes into spermatogonia, as well as in Sertoli cells, but it is not expressed in meiotic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; (S. Kim and D. Zarkower, unpublished data). The requirement for DMRT1 in pre-meiotic germ cells and DMRT7 in meiotic germ cells demonstrates that DM domain proteins act at multiple critical points of male germ cell development. Ovaries of <italic>Dmrt4</italic> mutant females have polyovular follicles (follicles containing multiple oocytes), but it is unknown whether this reflects a defect in the germ line or the soma. It is notable that at least three mammalian DM domain genes affect gonadal development only in one sex, given the similar roles of related proteins in directing sex-specific somatic development in other phyla.</p><p>Strikingly, <italic>Dmrt7</italic> is present, not only in placental mammals, but also in marsupials and a monotreme (egg-laying mammal), the platypus, which has a clear <italic>Dmrt7</italic> ortholog &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no close <italic>Dmrt7</italic> ortholog has been reported in nonmammalian vertebrates, and our database searches did not reveal one. Thus, <italic>Dmrt7</italic> likely arose, presumably by duplication and divergence of another <italic>Dmrt</italic> gene, shortly before or coincident with the mammalian radiation. Monotremes have five X and five Y chromosomes, which form an extended pairing chain during meiosis and appear unrelated to the sex chromosomes of the other mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> in both lineages may support a common origin for either the sex chromosomes or the sex chromatin of monotremes and other mammals. A plausible model is that <italic>Dmrt7</italic> evolved during the establishment of mammalian sex determination to help cope with ancestral differences in gene dosage, chromosome pairing, recombination, or other meiotic issues arising from sex chromosome heteromorphy. In this regard, we speculate that the recruitment of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> during mammalian evolution may be analogous to the recruitment of chromatin regulatory complexes to achieve somatic dosage compensation during evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in several phyla (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;). It will be of interest to determine whether DMRT7 localizes to sex chromosomes during monotreme meiosis.</p><p>In summary, we have found that the mammal-specific DM domain protein DMRT7 is essential for meiotic prophase progression in males. DMRT7 localizes to the sex chromosomes after they are assembled into specialized heterochromatin, and many <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mutant cells have epigenetic defects in the modification of the sex chromatin between pachytene and diplotene. Although <italic>Dmrt7</italic> belongs to an ancient and conserved gene family, it is found only in mammals, and to our knowledge DMRT7 is the only example of a mammal-specific protein that is essential for meiosis. It will be important to determine the precise mechanism by which DMRT7 affects sex chromatin regulation during male meiosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> mice.</title><p>A mouse <italic>Dmrt7</italic> cDNA fragment containing sequences from exon 8 was used to screen a mouse BAC library from the 129/SvJ strain (Stratagene, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stratagene.com">http://www.stratagene.com</ext-link>), and clones containing promoter sequences were isolated and sequenced to obtain <italic>Dmrt7</italic> genomic sequence. The targeting vector pDZ169 (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030062-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) was constructed by the following scheme: The vector pDZ157 was used as a backbone vector &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030062-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. 3&#x02032; to <italic>Pgk-neo</italic> and the <italic>loxP</italic> site, we inserted, as a XmaI/XmaI DNA fragment, the third intron of <italic>Dmrt7</italic> (from 366 bp to 2,773 bp downstream of exon 3) generated by PCR. 5&#x02032; to <italic>Pgk-neo,</italic> we inserted an EcoRI/NotI PCR fragment extending from 4,107 bp to 336 bp 5&#x02032; of the <italic>Dmrt7</italic> translational start.
