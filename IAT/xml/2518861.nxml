Developmental genes often require multiple regulatory sequences that integrate discrete and overlapping functions to coordinate their expression. To identify <italic>Sox10</italic> cis-regulatory elements, we integrated multiple model systems, including cell-based screens and transposon-mediated transgensis in zebrafish, to scrutinize mammalian conserved, noncoding genomic segments at the mouse <italic>Sox10</italic> locus. We demonstrate that eight of 11 <italic>Sox10</italic> genomic elements direct reporter gene expression in transgenic zebrafish similar to patterns observed in transgenic mice, despite an absence of observable sequence conservation between mice and zebrafish. Multiple segments direct expression in overlapping populations of neural crest derivatives and glial cells, ranging from pan-<italic>Sox10</italic> and pan-neural crest regulatory control to the modulation of expression in subpopulations of <italic>Sox10-</italic>expressing cells, including developing melanocytes and Schwann cells. Several sequences demonstrate overlapping spatial control, yet direct expression in incompletely overlapping developmental intervals. We were able to partially explain neural crest expression patterns by the presence of head to head SoxE family binding sites within two of the elements. Moreover, we were able to use this transcription factor binding site signature to identify the corresponding zebrafish enhancers in the absence of overall sequence homology. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish transgenesis as a high-fidelity surrogate in the dissection of mammalian gene regulation, especially those with dynamically controlled developmental expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The neural crest is a population of embryonic migratory stem cells. They form atop the future spinal cord and migrate throughout developing embryos and form many different cells, including the epidermal pigment cells, bone cells in the head, and nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system. In this study, we studied the genome elements responsible for expression of <italic>SOX10</italic>, a dynamically expressed gene that is essential for neural crest development. We isolated candidate regulatory elements for <italic>SOX10</italic> by identifying the small percentage of genomic DNA around the gene that did not vary as avian and mammalian genomes changed though evolution. We tested these fragments for their ability to regulate gene expression in zebrafish, a model system that is highly efficient for DNA-mediated expression studies and embryology. We found that even though the genome sequences were not similar to the <italic>SOX10</italic> gene in fish, the genomic fragments were able to recapitulate the dynamic expression of <italic>SOX10</italic> during development. Through computational analysis of the sequences, we identified a transcription factor binding site signature that identified the corresponding zebrafish <italic>SOX10</italic> regulatory elements.

Although these mice present with enteric and pigmentary deficits, this deletion severely disrupts, but does not ablate, developmental expression of <italic>Sox10</italic>. These data suggested that the deletion harbors a subset of cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements necessary for <italic>Sox10</italic> expression, and our functional analyses revealed at least one highly conserved segment within the deleted region that directs reporter gene expression in cultured melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Antonellis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Comprehensive dissection of the cis-acting transcriptional regulatory sequences at <italic>SOX10</italic> will be important for understanding the dynamic control of this transcription factor in specific neural crest derivatives and in oligodendrocytes, as well as for assessing the role of non-coding mutations in disease susceptibility in which <italic>SOX10</italic> may play a role. Furthermore, these efforts will provide a significant first step in establishing the sequence substrates necessary for the development of cell-specific regulatory vocabularies.</p><p>Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of highly conserved, non-coding sequences at the mouse <italic>Sox10</italic> locus, integrating <italic>in vitro</italic> cell studies in multiple cell lines and transgenesis in developing zebrafish and mice. Our results indicate that regulatory control at this locus coordinates information from a wide array of sequences whose independent regulatory contributions range from discrete sub-populations of crest derivatives to near pan-neural crest or pan-Sox10 expression. Critically, our data highlight the power of our zebrafish transgenic assay, demonstrating that it provides a high fidelity read out for the regulatory function of conserved non-coding <italic>Sox10</italic> mouse sequences even in the absence of overt sequence conservation. Our results are largely consistent with recent preliminary analysis of a subset of <italic>Sox10</italic> sequences in mouse, including the identification of regulatory elements that direct expression in peripheral neuronal populations and non-ectomesenchymal crest derivatives. Where differences are evident, they are largely accounted for by incomplete overlap among assayed sequences or the ability of dynamic analyses in zebrafish to uncover reporter expression that is not evident in Sox10 positive populations during mammalian development. Consequently, we also provide the first report of sequences directing expression in developing melanocytes and myelinating glia, for which no previous report exists. Additionally, our data also revealed regulatory segments that function in the same cell types but within different developmental time intervals. Finally, we demonstrate that two identified regulatory sequences with pan-neural crest regulatory control harbor dimeric SoxE binding sites that account for a significant fraction of their regulatory integrity, and use this data to identify two regulatory sequences at the zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> locus that we propose to be their functional orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conserved, Non-Coding Sequences at <italic>Sox10</italic> Display Enhancer Activity in Neural Crest&#x02013;Derived Cells</title><p>Evolutionary sequence conservation is a robust metric for the identification of putatively functional sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Frazer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Nardone1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Wasserman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

The resulting constructs were injected into two-cell zebrafish embryos and evaluated for EGFP reporter expression at selected time points (1 to 5 days post-fertilization; dpf).

We thus directly assayed their necessity through independent deletion and mutation of the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences in both genomic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5G</xref>) and compared the ability of each wild-type and mutated genomic segment to direct reporter gene expression in the above cell lines. Consistent with this postulate, deletion or mutation of the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences significantly reduced the enhancer activity in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5G</xref>; p-values between 5.98&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> and 2.11&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). This effect was highly significant for both deletion and mutation of these sequences within both elements, albeit more severe for <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 (&#x02265;80&#x00025; reduction in enhancer activity, p&#x02264;5.42&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) than for <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 (50&#x02013;80&#x00025; reduction in activity, p&#x02264;2.11&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). Together these data support the hypothesis that the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences are important for the function of both genomic segments in these two cell types (see above). They further suggest that although <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 appears to be highly dependent on the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences for its function, domains in addition to this motif also contribute aspects of the biological potential demonstrated by <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.</p><p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> functional requirement for each of the <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 sequence intervals described above, including the dimeric SoxE sequences, we studied each <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 fragment (wild type and mutant) in transgenic zebrafish embryos. Once again all constructs were passed through the germline and evaluated in multiple founder lines to ensure the integrity of our analyses. <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.1 directed expression in a similar manner to that observed for <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, however with significantly reduced intensity. For example, low levels of expression were observed in Schwann cells surrounding spinal motor neurons, and almost no signal was observed in the sympathetic ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.2 directed reporter gene expression at higher levels in sympathetic chain ganglia and at reduced levels in glia surrounding spinal motor neurons when compared to <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, this observed flux in signal intensity is completely consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations. A more dramatic loss of reporter gene expression was evident upon analysis of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.3; expression was severely reduced in populations such as the cranial and sympathetic ganglia at 24 hpf (data not shown), as well as in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). This is similarly consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations and with the hypothesis that the dimeric SoxE motif is important for <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 function. Finally, injection of over 400 G0 zebrafish embryos with <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.4 failed to direct detectable reporter gene expression in any structures, indicating that all sequences necessary to direct tissue-specific reporter gene expression had been deleted. These data are also consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses and may be explained by the removal of the monomeric SoxE consensus sequence (see above).</p><p>To determine whether the observed reporter deficits in fish injected with <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.3 were the result of removing the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences, we next evaluated transgene reporter expression directed by <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 harboring a deletion of the dimeric consensus sequences alone. The resulting embryos displayed a decrease in EGFP-positive enteric ganglia (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5H and I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g002">Figure 2F</xref>); reporter gene expression was only detected in dorsally located ganglia, suggesting that the consensus sequence may be critical for a subset of cells in the enteric nervous system. Expression was also severely reduced in oligodendrocytes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5H and I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g002">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Interestingly, expression in Schwann cells was not disrupted (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5H and I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). These data were consistent upon analysis of at least two independent founder lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5H and I</xref>) and suggest that the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences in <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 play a more critical role regulating <italic>Sox10</italic> expression during oligodendrocyte and ENS development than in Schwann cell development at the evaluated time points.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Identification of the Zebrafish Functional Orthologs of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7</title><p>We have shown that highly conserved mouse sequences at <italic>Sox10</italic> direct tissue-specific reporter gene expression in developing transgenic zebrafish.

To identify the zebrafish orthologs of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, we exploited the observation that these two genomic segments harbor highly conserved dimeric SoxE consensus sequences. Briefly, we computationally identified all dimeric SoxE consensus sequences in a 100 kb window upstream of the zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> locus. These analyses identified three such consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We hypothesized that sequences encompassing these motifs would function as <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancers in a manner overlapping <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and/or <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7. Thus, we PCR amplified 500 bp surrounding each of these consensus sequences (zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E1, zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E2, and zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000174-t001">Table 1</xref>) from zebrafish genomic DNA and tested each <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as above. zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E1 displays strong enhancer activity in Schwann cells, directing reporter gene expression &#x0223c;12-fold higher than the control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, neither zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E2 nor zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E3 displays strong enhancer activity in either cell line. However, it is important to note that these cells do not fully represent the range of cell types or stages in cell maturation in which <italic>sox10</italic> is expressed during development.

However, one might expect that the simple identification of conserved dimeric SoxE consensus sequences would yield a high number of elements with <italic>in vitro</italic> enhancer activity, and that these data may reflect a high false positive rate. However, note that zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E2 did not direct reporter gene expression in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) or developing zebrafish (data not shown). To determine the frequency with which sequences encompassing a highly conserved SoxE consensus sequence will identify enhancers that function in a subset of SoxE positive tissues, we computationally identified all dimeric SoxE consensus sequences in the mouse genome. We then identified the subset of these consensus sequences that have a conservation profile consistent with <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 and that reside within intronic regions of genes expressed in melanocytes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> for details). We chose to examine intronic sequences because: (1) they provide a definable genomic element in which to search; (2) introns are known to frequently harbor enhancer sequences; and (3) functional intronic SoxE binding sites have been identified within introns of other SOX10 target genes &#x0005b;e.g., myelin protein zero (MPZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-LeBlanc1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. These analyses provided a dataset of 44 genomic segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000174.s001">Table S1</xref>), which were then tested for enhancer activity in cultured melanocytes and Schwann cells as described above. Only two of the 44 genomic segments (4.5&#x00025;) increased reporter gene expression at least 10-fold higher in either cell line; both directed reporter gene expression in cultured melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) and Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting they may be true SoxE target enhancers. Although we anticipate that some degree of the low frequency of success may arise from the amplification and assay of incomplete regulatory modules or from their assay in inappropriate crest derivatives, we anticipate that many are simply false negatives. Thus, our data suggest that implementing this approach at orthologous loci may enrich for correctly identified crest enhancers, and on a genomic scale, greater information regarding the composition and configuration of critical binding site motifs will be necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>SOX10</italic> encodes a developmentally critical transcription factor whose roles in development and disease have been well described.

We directly addressed this challenge, assaying the regulatory control exerted by highly conserved, non-coding sequences at the mouse <italic>Sox10</italic> locus in cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> through transgenesis in zebrafish and mice.</p><p>Data generated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> was highly concordant, and critically identified regulatory elements were consistent with all aspects of <italic>Sox10</italic> expression during embryogenesis, in both NC-derived and non-NC-derived structures. For example, six genomic segments (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS2, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS9) directed EGFP expression in developing melanocytes, and six genomic segments (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS2, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS8) directed EGFP expression in Schwann cells during zebrafish embryogenesis. These are the first data showing that non-coding sequences at <italic>Sox10</italic> direct expression in these NC derivatives. Furthermore, six genomic segments (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS2, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS8) directed EGFP expression in oligodendrocytes; these represent the first data showing that non-coding sequences at <italic>Sox10</italic> direct expression in this non-NC-derived cell population. Importantly, these data were generated in teleosts using mouse genomic sequence with which we detected no overt sequence conservation.</p><p>In an effort to evaluate the fidelity of our observations in zebrafish, we likewise assayed two genomic segments using transgenesis in developing mice, prioritizing sequences that displayed broad <italic>Sox10</italic>-appropriate regulatory control in teleosts (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7). The resulting data strongly suggest that zebrafish transgenesis serves as a reliable surrogate for the assayed sequences; <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 both directed reporter gene expression in nearly all endogenous sites of <italic>Sox10</italic> expression during key stages of mouse development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, one of the most striking observations is the degree of functional overlap shared among identified regulatory sequences. This appears to be an increasingly common observation at developmental genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Abbasi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Ahituv1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-delaCalleMustienes1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-McGaughey1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and suggests a degree of functional redundancy in their regulation. However, in this case, we know that this is unlikely; our recent <italic>Sox10<sup>Hry</sup></italic> mouse model of Waardenburg-Shah Syndrome demonstrated that homozygous mutant mice harboring carry a deletion that encompasses <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS8, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS9 display severe hypopigmentation and enteric aganglionosis. Data presented in this study strongly suggests that the deletion of these three regulatory elements contribute to the enteric and pigmentary phenotype of the <italic>Sox10<sup>Hry</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Antonellis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these are not the only regulatory elements contributing to expression in the affected cell types; <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, among others, are not deleted in the <italic>Sox10<sup>Hry</sup></italic> mice yet they also direct reporter gene expression in developing melanocytes and/or the enteric nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, a parsimonious explanation for the observed data is that multiple regulatory sequences are coordinately required for the proper spatial and temporal expression of <italic>Sox10</italic> during development, each contributing to expression in certain subsets of tissues in an additive or interactive manner. To fully address this issue, it will be necessary to perform cell- and tissue-specific ChIP, as well as deletion and mutation analysis of each <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS within the context of the entire gene (e.g., in BAC transgenic mice).</p><p>Consistent with our data, Werner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Werner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> made similar observations in their preliminary evaluation of a small number of overlapping fragments in mice. However, there are a number of notable discrepancies, especially when considering regulatory control in developing melanocytes, sympathetic ganglia and glial cells. First, our analyses revealed six genomic segments (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS2, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS9) that direct reporter gene expression in developing melanocytes, consistent with the known role of <italic>Sox10</italic> in these cells. Werner and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Werner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> assayed three genomic segments that partially overlap with sequences that we assayed. (Their sequences, termed U1, U2, and U3 correspond to <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 respectively). None of the &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; elements directed reporter gene expression in melanoblasts, including U1 and U3, which correspond to <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, respectively. However, our analyses of these genomic segments in developing mouse embryos revealed clear expression in melanoblasts of mice at E11, E11.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g004">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown), consistent with our observations in transgenic zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, U3 lacks 170 bp present in <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4, suggesting that the additional sequences in <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 may be important for expression in developing melanocytes. In contrast, U1 and U2 both encompass and are 38&#x00025; and 49&#x00025; larger than <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS5, respectively, yet in our assays both genomic segments directed reporter gene expression in developing melanocytes; importantly, in the case of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, this was substantiated by reporter expression in melanocyte cell lines as well as reporter expression in melanoblasts of transgenic zebrafish and mouse embryos. One possible explanation is that these U elements also harbor local repressor sequences that are active in developing melanocytes. Another possibility is that position-related effects altered the activity of U1, U2, and U3 such that expression in melanoblasts was not detectable. Importantly, our data strongly suggest that <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 are important for expression during mammalian melanocyte development, and represent the first report of transcriptional regulatory elements important for <italic>Sox10</italic> expression in melanoblasts.</p><p>Second, similarly in our evaluation of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 in transgenic zebrafish and mouse, we observed expression in the sympathetic ganglia. Once again, this contrasts with observations for U3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Werner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, U3 ceases sequence overlap with <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 at a point where our assayed deletion fragment <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.4 begins; critical motifs contained within this fragment may work in conjunction with other transcription factor binding sites found throughout the <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 sequence but are not sufficient to independently direct reporter gene expression to the sympathetic ganglia. Another possibility is that U3 harbors a local repressor within the 32 bp that it extends beyond our <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 element.</p><p>Third, <italic>Sox10</italic> expression in developing oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells of the central and peripheral nervous system, respectively, is critical for the formation of all white matter fiber tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Kuhlbrodt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Paratore1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Mollaaghababa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Stolt1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Britsch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, although U1-3 overlap <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4-7 as described above, the authors were unable to detect reporter expression in these populations because myelination is a post-natal developmental event in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Kuhlbrodt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-SouthardSmith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Stolt1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, myelination in zebrafish begins at 2&#x02013;3 days post fertilization in zebrafish and thus, the <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancer activity of genomic segments important for expression in myelinating cells can be readily detected. Our data underscore another major strength of employing zebrafish to study the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Sox10</italic>. Indeed, this is the first report of transcriptional regulatory elements important for <italic>Sox10</italic> expression in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same elements exert regulatory control in both populations.</p><p>Additionally, in a recent report of BAC-based transgenic rescue of <italic>Sox10</italic> deficient mouse phenotypes, Deal and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Deal1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> report the evaluation of a BAC transgene termed DelnA, wherein most sequence 5&#x02032; to the <italic>Sox10</italic> coding sequence has been deleted. Although, this BAC appears to retain the regulatory sequences we have termed <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS2, it directs reporter expression only in the otic canals and melanoblasts, and weakly in the superior cervical ganglia. Given our observation that when assayed independently these sequences direct expression in many neural crest derivatives, one parsimonious explanation is that, in context, these sequences must behave coordinately and/or overcome local repression in order to elicit their requisite control. Taken in combination, these observations may explain previous failures to generate effective <italic>Sox10</italic> reporter transgenes using conventional &#x0201c;promoter bashing&#x0201d; strategies. Consequently, <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS1C may perhaps be more readily considered a proximal enhancer than a regulatory promoter of <italic>Sox10</italic>.</p><p>Our computational and functional analyses of conserved, non-coding sequences at <italic>Sox10</italic> have illuminated the potentially important role of SoxE regulation of <italic>Sox10</italic>. We have previously demonstrated that deletion of a large region harboring a dimeric SoxE consensus sequence in mouse gives rise to a phenotype similar to <italic>Sox10</italic> coding mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000174-Antonellis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we also report that two genomic segments (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7) harbor highly-conserved dimeric SoxE consensus sequences that are essential for the appropriate control of reporter gene expression in relevant cells and tissues. However, while the dimeric SoxE consensus sequences analyzed in this study are likely important for <italic>Sox10</italic> expression, our data also indicate that they are not essential for all regulatory control exerted by the sequences containing them and, indeed, other sequences within these segments are likely to be similarly important. Consistent with this idea we also provide deletion of sequences upstream of the SoxE consensus sequences in <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 also significantly reduce reporter gene expression (<italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000174-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, it is likely that other sequences within the studied genomic segments also contribute to the appropriate regulatory control of <italic>Sox10</italic>. Elucidation of this underlying vocabulary will be critical for a full understanding of <italic>Sox10</italic> expression during vertebrate development.</p><p>Although we successfully implemented the zebrafish transgenic assays using mouse genomic DNA with conservation restricted to mammalian and avian species, the absence of corresponding sequence conservation between mammals and fish prevented us from directly identifying the zebrafish orthologs of each mouse <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS. We were able, however, to uncover potential zebrafish orthologs of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7 by cataloging dimeric SoxE consensus sequences upstream of the zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> gene (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). Of the three fragments that harbor these consensus sequences, two (zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E1 and zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E3) directed reporter gene expression in <italic>Sox10</italic> relevant cells and tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the likelihood of stumbling upon a <italic>Sox10</italic>-like regulatory element by chance based only on the presence of dimeric SoxE consensus sequences was very low; only two of 44 genomic segments that harbor such sequences and that reside within non-coding sequences at genes expressed in melanocytes directed reporter expression in a corresponding cell line. Thus, we propose that zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E1 and zf-<italic>sox10</italic>-E3 are the zebrafish orthologs of <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, respectively. These observations suggest that motif-based strategies may be useful for identifying the functional orthologs of cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements in the absence of overt non-coding sequence conservation.</p><p>In characterizing <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, we have described the first pan-neural crest enhancers; these genomic segments direct reporter gene expression in nearly all tissues in which <italic>Sox10</italic> is expressed, including peripheral nervous system neurons, developing melanocytes, and glial cells. As such, the constructs and transgenic zebrafish strains we have developed provide critical tools for studying the role of <italic>Sox10</italic>, and more generally, the neural crest in human development and disease. Additionally, these genomic segments will now be scrutinized for variants that may cause or convey susceptibility to disease.</p><p>The studies reported here further our knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>Sox10</italic> locus and underscore the complex regulatory control of this developmentally critical transcription factor. Specifically, we make several notable observations. First, multiple genomic segments direct reporter gene expression in overlapping neural crest derivates and glial cells. Second, at least two genomic segments direct expression in a pan-neural crest manner and SoxE consensus sequences are required for the integrity of their regulatory control. Third, genomic sequences derived from the mouse <italic>Sox10</italic> locus direct appropriate reporter gene expression in developing zebrafish, even in the absence of observable conservation and demonstrate that zebrafish provide a high fidelity surrogate for the evaluation of mammalian <italic>Sox10</italic> regulatory sequences. Finally, we provide the first report of <italic>Sox10</italic> regulatory sequences that direct expression in developing melanocytes and glia. These findings have important implications for studying neural crest development and the etiology of related diseases, and, more generally, provide a paradigm for dissecting the regulatory control of genes implicated in human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Vector Construction</title><p>Expression constructs were generated using Gateway technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Subsequently, we determined the genomic context of each identified sequence (intronic, exonic, upstream of gene, downstream of gene) using the Table Browser at the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables</ext-link>).</p><p>To identify genomic sequences similar to <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS4 and <italic>Sox10</italic>-MCS7, we examined the conservation profile of these two genomic segments at the UCSC genome browser. This revealed that each genomic segment had a PhastCons conservation score of at least 400 (genome.ucsc.edu). The Table Browser at the UCSC Genome Browser was then employed to find genomic segments that: (1) harbor dimeric SoxE consensus sequences (see above); (2) have a conservation score of at least 400; and (3) reside within an intron. The gene name and RefSeq identifier for each gene was then extracted from the Table Browser. This criteria was subsequently compared to a melanocyte expressed gene list, which was generated as defined by &#x0003e;2-fold higher expression in melan-a as compared to 3T3 on custom printed Operon (Huntsville, Al) Mv3.0 oligonucleotide probe set representing over 16,000 genes (data not shown).
