Together with their ligands, the ephrins, they fulfill multiple biological functions. Aberrant expression of Ephs/ephrins leading to increased Eph receptor to ephrin ligand ratios is a critical factor in tumorigenesis, indicating that tight regulation of Eph and ephrin expression is essential for normal cell behavior. The 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of transcripts play an important yet widely underappreciated role in the control of protein expression. Based on the assumption that paralogues of large gene families might exhibit a conserved organization of regulatory elements in their 3'UTRs we applied a novel bioinformatics/molecular biology approach to the 3'UTR sequences of Eph/ephrin transcripts. We identified clusters of motifs consisting of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs), AU-rich elements (AREs) and HuR binding sites. These clusters bind multiple RNA-stabilizing and destabilizing factors, including HuR. Surprisingly, despite its widely accepted role as an mRNA-stabilizing protein, we further show that binding of HuR to these clusters actually destabilizes Eph/ephrin transcripts in tumor cell lines. Consequently, knockdown of HuR greatly modulates expression of multiple Ephs/ephrins at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together our studies suggest that overexpression of HuR as found in many progressive tumors could be causative for disarranged Eph receptor to ephrin ligand ratios leading to a higher degree of tissue invasiveness.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs play crucial roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, for example by modulating mRNA localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Du1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Jansen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Palacios1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Bashirullah1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Kuersten1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Mazumder1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Apart from having binding sites for the recently discovered microRNAs, 3'UTRs can harbor motifs that interact with specific RNA-binding proteins. These motifs are normally short-sequence elements whose activity can be influenced by their secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Mignone1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, their identification by computer algorithms is difficult and usually produces numerous false positives.</p><p>To identify 3'UTR motifs we used a novel approach that is based on two assumptions: first, not only coding regions but also elements within the 3'UTRs that are essential to gene function might be conserved between the paralogues of large gene families; second, mRNAs encoding proteins that functionally interact or fulfill redundant functions might exhibit a conserved organization of regulatory elements in their 3'UTRs. To investigate this, we chose the families of ephrin ligands and Eph receptors. The family of Eph receptors is the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Eph receptors are divided into two subclasses based on their ligand specificities. In general, Eph class A (EphA) receptors bind to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin A ligands (ephrinA) (with the exception of EphA4), whereas Eph class B (EphB) receptors bind to transmembrane domain-containing ephrin B ligands (ephrinB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Palmer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, more recent data suggest that interactions can also occur across classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Himanen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon binding to their cognate ephrin ligands, Eph receptors autophosphorylate and activate downstream signaling cascades (forward signaling). Although they do not possess catalytic activity themselves, both classes of ephrin ligands can activate signal transduction pathways after interaction with Eph receptors (reverse signaling) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Davy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At the cellular level, signaling through Eph receptors and ephrins leads to either increased adhesion (attraction) or decreased adhesion (repulsion) of the interacting cells. These responses are important in mediating a wide range of biological activities, including angiogenesis, cell segregation, cell attachment, cell morphogenesis, and cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Surawska1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Several of these processes are out of control during tumorigenesis, highlighting a potential critical role for Eph/ephrin signaling in the development of many human cancers. In line with that pathophysiology, several Ephs and ephrins, including EphA1, EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, EphB2, EphB3, and ephrin-A1, are overexpressed in a variety of tumors, and exhibit mostly tumor-promoting properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Surawska1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Himanen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Expression patterns of Ephs and ephrins are complex, and their correct expression is essential for the proper function of many of the processes mentioned above. Therefore, a fine-tuned regulation of Eph/ephrin expression both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels would seem to be indispensable. At the transcriptional level, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands have been implicated as downstream targets of many different transcription factors, including homeodomain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Polleux1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and the p53 protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Theil1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Shim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Dohn1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Much less is known about posttranscriptional regulation. However, there is evidence of involvement of the 3'UTR: upregulation of the EphA2 receptor in axons crossing the midline is mediated by a highly conserved sequence in the transcript's 3'UTR that contains a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Brittis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we have systematically collected the 3'UTR sequences of mouse Eph receptors and ephrin ligands and screened them for <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence motifs. We have identified three different types of motifs in several of the Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs: CPEs, AU-rich elements (AREs), and HuR binding sites. Whereas some of these motifs were found to be distributed apparently randomly in the respective 3'UTRs, others were found to be arrayed in clusters which are highly conserved between different vertebrate species. Furthermore, we identified several RNA-binding proteins, including HuR, that interact with these clusters, and we show that EfnA2, EphA2, and EphA4 are direct posttranscriptional targets of HuR in cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that HuR does not act as a stabilizing factor upon expression of these Eph/ephrins, but that it destabilizes the respective messages.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The 3'untranslated regions of transcripts of mouse Eph receptors and ephrin ligands</title><p>To obtain a complete collection of full-length 3'UTR sequences of mRNAs of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands, we first extracted all available mouse Eph/ephrin sequences from the GenBank database of the NCBI.

However, posttranscriptional regulation often relies on short <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence motifs, and genes encoding proteins that functionally interact and/or genes belonging to the same gene family might be expected to contain conserved 3'UTR motifs. To detect such elements we scanned the 3'UTRs of the mouse Eph/ephrin transcripts for known <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence motifs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genereg.molgen.mpg.de/cgi-bin/regEchse/regEchse.pl">http://genereg.molgen.mpg.de/cgi-bin/regEchse/regEchse.pl</ext-link> : motifs that have been included in the search are listed under &#x0201c;select known motif; HuR binding sites were identified using Transterm <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uther.otago.ac.nz/Transterm.html">http://uther.otago.ac.nz/Transterm.html</ext-link>). Remarkably, this led to the identification of three prominent motifs&#x02014;CPEs, AREs and HuR binding sites&#x02014;in several of the Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). CPEs are translational control units that must reside in close proximity to the poly(A) site to be functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Mendez1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Figure 1</xref>, only those CPEs which fulfill this criterion &#x0005b;0&#x02013;250 bp distance from poly(A) hexamer&#x0005d; are depicted. HuR interacts with multiple AUUUA repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Brennan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and U-rich stretches with high affinity. More recently attempts have been undertaken to more specifically define an HuR binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-LopezdeSilanes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Meisner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In a series of binding experiments Meisner et al. deduced that the HuR binding site is the 9-mer NNUUNNUUU. Remarkably this motif was found to be present in all validated HuR targets, and a single point mutation within the motif is sufficient to completely destroy HuR binding. In this study the search for HuR binding sites was based on this motif. Both AREs and HuR binding sites were found in all parts of the 3'UTRs. Some of the motifs were found as isolated, non-overlapping elements. In other cases, CPEs were found to overlap with AREs or HuR binding sites, or AREs with HuR binding sites. Of note, all three types of motifs, some in multiple copies, were found together in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002780.s002">Table S2</xref>). These clusters show two distinct localization patterns: located anywhere in the 3'UTR with no obvious preference for a special region (e.g. EphA3, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) or specifically arrayed in the 3'terminal region of the 3'UTR in close proximity to the polyadenylation site (e.g. EphA2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>In orthologous 3'UTRs, <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence elements with important regulatory functions are expected to be conserved through evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Meisner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. For 18 of the 21 mouse Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs investigated in this study, sequences from human orthologues were available, and 44&#x00025;, 74&#x00025;, and 72&#x00025; of CPEs, AREs, and HuR binding sites, respectively, were found to be conserved between the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g002">2</xref>).

First, each contains clustered sequence motifs consisting of CPEs and HuR binding sites. EphA2 and EphA4, in addition, contain AREs in these clusters. Therefore, the 3'terminal parts of these 3'UTRs seemed to be good candidates for identification of proteins interacting with the motif clusters. Second, all three motif clusters show a high degree of orthologous conservation in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, the EphA2 cluster is highly conserved in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (for EfnA1 and EphA4, no sequence information was available for this species). Third, the 3'terminal region of the EphA2 3'UTR has already been shown to fulfill important regulatory functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Brittis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To test for binding of interacting proteins to these motif clusters, radioactively labeled transcripts encompassing the 3'terminal regions of the EfnA1, EphA2, and EphA4 3'UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>) were incubated with lysate from mouse brain and UV-crosslinked. Mouse brain was used in this experiment because several known ARE- and CPE-interacting proteins are highly expressed in this organ. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through SDS acrylamide gels, and the dried gels were exposed to X-ray film. Interestingly, this method not only identified several proteins that had bound to the motif clusters of all three 3'terminal regions, but also revealed an overlapping banding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>): proteins of 30&#x02013;45, 50, and 75 kD bound to all three sequences, although the affinity to the 3'terminal regions of the EphA2 and EphA4 3'UTRs seemed much higher than to that of the EfnA1 3'UTR. Proteins of &#x0223c;60 and 70 kD were exclusively detectable in the EphA2 and EphA4 lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). Identities of the interacting proteins were determined in an RNA&#x02013;protein pulldown assay with subsequent analysis of the eluted fraction by mass spectrometry. Biotin-labeled <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic>-transcribed transcripts corresponding to the 3'terminal region of the EphA2 3'UTR were incubated with lysate from mouse brain and pulled down with streptavidin magnetic beads. Transcripts in antisense orientation to the chosen region were used in a negative control experiment. Complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with colloidal Coomassie, and bands specifically enriched in the sample obtained with the sense transcripts were analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. Interestingly, in addition to several proteins that are known to be involved in transcription and mRNA splicing&#x02014;myelin expression factor 2 (MyEF-2); heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M); far upstream binding protein 1 (FUSE-binding protein 1, FBP); splicing factor, proline- and glutamine-rich (PSF)&#x02014;we identified AUF1 and KSRP, two ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs) that are known regulators of mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002780-t001">Table 1</xref>). To confirm the interaction we repeated the RNA&#x02013;protein pulldown assay. This time, however, RNA&#x02013;protein complexes were transferred to PVDF membranes and interacting proteins were detected with specific antibodies. As expected, KSRP bound to the RNA probe corresponding to the EphA2 3'UTR terminal region but not to the antisense negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Interestingly, concerning AUF1, we could only detect binding of the p45 and p42 isoforms but not the p40 and p37 isoforms. Besides ARE and CPE-motifs, the 3'terminal part of the EphA2 3'UTR harbors a HuR binding site of the consensus NNUUNNUUU. However, HuR was not identified as an interacting protein in the mass spectrometry analysis. To test directly for the binding of HuR we incubated the Western blot membrane with an antibody directed against endogenous HuR protein. As expected, HuR was found to specifically interact with the 3'terminal region of the EphA2 3'UTR.</p><fig id="pone-0002780-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002780.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Identification of proteins interacting with clustered motifs harboured in Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs.</title><p>(A) Scheme of 3'UTRs of EfnA1, EphA2 and EphA4 as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

except EphA7, but also to four transcripts that did not contain an ARE (EfnA1, EfnB2, EphA6, EphB1). For binding of HuR, presence of the consensus HuR binding site was essential but not sufficient: we could not detect binding of HuR to any of the transcripts lacking this site; however, of the eight transcripts containing this site, HuR bound to EfnA2, EfnB2, EphA2, EphA4, and EphA6 but not to EfnA1, EfnB3, and EphB1.</p><p>Because HuR binds to single-stranded RNA, it was proposed that the HuR binding site might have to assume a particular conformation to undergo high-affinity HuR binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Meisner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we used the Mfold program to predict secondary structures in the 3'UTR probes that we had used in the RNA&#x02013;protein pulldown assay. In agreement with the results of Meisner et al. (2004), we found that HuR had interacted only with those transcripts in which the HuR binding sites were predicted to be located in single-stranded loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). The HuR binding sites of the remaining transcripts were all (at least partially) located in double-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>) and therefore possibly inaccessible to HuR.</p><fig id="pone-0002780-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002780.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Secondary structures of Eph/ephrin 3'terminal parts.</title><p>Shown are the secondary structures of the probes used in UV-crosslinking and RNA-protein pulldown experiments that correspond to the 3'terminal parts of Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs as predicted by Mfold.

To gain insight into the accessibility of the HuR binding sites harbored in the Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs we used the Mfold algorithm to predict the secondary structures of the entire 3'UTRs. Interestingly, apart from EfnB3 and EphA1, all murine Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs contain at least one HuR binding site predicted to be part of a single-stranded region in or outside of the described motif clusters, suggesting a particularly important role of HuR in the regulation of Eph/ephrin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002780.s005">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>HuR regulates expression of Eph/ephrins in cancer cell lines</title><p>Abnormal expression of Eph/ephrins has been reported in various cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and advanced stages of malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Surawska1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-LopezdeSilanes2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

HuR has been reported as an mRNA stabilizing protein, suggesting that its knock-down would lead to a reduction of Eph/ephrin mRNA expression. However, whereas the amount of EphA2 mRNA did decrease after knock-down of HuR, to our surprise the EfnA2 and EphA4 mRNA levels increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>). To test whether the changes observed at the RNA level reflect the situation at the protein level we loaded equal amounts of protein lysates from HeLa and U373 cells after HuR knock-down and performed Western blot analysis with antibodies detecting EphA2 and EphA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>). In confirmation of the Real-Time PCR experiments we found that expression of EphA2 protein was drastically reduced by 10-fold in HeLa and 5-fold in U373 cells after knock-down of HuR, whereas expression of EphA4 was increased by 1.2-fold and 2-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g006">Fig. 6b</xref>). Control siRNA oligonucleotides did not have a significant effect on EphA2 or EphA4 protein expression when compared to a mock-transfected control.

After knock-down of HuR with a specific RNAi oligo this destabilizing effect could be partially rescued, which further suggests a destabilizing function for the HuR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002780-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). Knock-down of HuR with an RNAi oligo targeting a different region of the HuR mRNA showed comparable results (data not shown).

We identified HuR and several other proteins involved in mRNA stability control as interaction partners of these clusters. Switching from mice to human cancer cell lines, we also obtained evidence that expression of Eph/ephrins is posttranscriptionally regulated through interaction of the conserved sequence clusters and HuR, suggesting a link between misregulation of Eph/ephrin expression in cancer and overexpression of HuR.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The 3'untranslated regions of transcripts of mouse Eph receptors and ephrin ligands</title><p>A hallmark of members of the Eph/ephrin families is their expansion of numbers during the course of evolution, due to multiple duplication events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Drescher1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The respective coding regions and exon/intron boundaries are highly conserved among orthologues and paralogues, which is reflected by the redundant functions that Eph/ephrins can fulfill and by the ability of Eph receptors to interact with multiple ephrins. Moreover, the 3'UTRs of Eph/ephrin orthologues are highly conserved between human and mouse (up to 80&#x00025;), which indicates strong selection pressure and perhaps conservation of distinct expression profiles. In contrast, the 3'UTRs of Eph/ephrin paralogues show a high degree of structural divergence, which may have enabled Ephs/ephrins to acquire diverse expression profiles (cellular or subcellular), as has been suggested for other conserved paralogues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Jackson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite their poor overall conservation, the 3'UTRs of 7 of 8 ephrin ligands and 11 of 13 Eph receptors contain CPEs, AREs, and/or HuR binding sites. The grouping of several of these motifs into evolutionarily conserved clusters further emphasizes their functional importance. However, because neither the position nor composition nor distribution of these motifs is conserved between paralogous Eph/ephrins, the clusters may have arisen independently in evolution. Such convergent evolution has been described for regulatory elements of other genes coding for proteins that functionally interact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Cohen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Carosa1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Hariharan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Kozmik1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in line with our observation that conserved motif clusters are present in functionally interacting Eph/ephrins. For example, transcripts of the EphA2 receptor and its ligand, ephrin-A1, both contain conserved clustered motifs, as do the EphA4 receptor and its ligands, ephrin-A1 and ephrin-B2. Several clustered motifs are located close to poly(A) sites, which may reflect a function for these clusters in polyadenylation, as discussed below.</p><p>We identified the ARE-binding proteins AUF1 (p42/p45), KSRP, hnRNP A0, and HuR as interaction partners of the 3'terminal ARE/CPE/HuR clusters. However, we were not able to show binding of the CPE-interacting factor, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), even though the RNA&#x02013;protein pulldown assays were done with lysate from mouse brain, a tissue in which CPEB is strongly expressed and functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Du2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Huang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Huang2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas we cannot exclude the possibility that we could not detect binding of CPEB to Eph/ephrin CPEs for technical reasons, it might also be that either CPEB is not an interactor of these CPEs or it was outcompeted by other proteins that interacted with the AREs or HuR binding sites overlapping with or located in close proximity to the CPEs. Future studies employing direct binding assays should help answer this question.</p><p>According to their primary structure, AREs are subdivided into three different classes: class I AREs consist of several dispersed copies of the AUUUA motif, class II AREs contain at least two overlapping UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) nonamers, and class III AREs are purely U-rich regions without an AUUUA motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Brennan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Barreau1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

The binding pattern of HuR to Eph/ephrin 3'UTR probes used in our study suggests binding of HuR to a single-stranded consensus motif (NNUUNNUUU), which had been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Meisner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>HuR regulates expression of Eph/ephrins in cancer cell lines</title><p>The human ELAV-like protein HuR is a well-characterized ARE-binding protein that has been shown to stabilize a variety of mRNA targets, including cyclooxygenase-2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Brennan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is widely accepted that HuR stabilizes transcripts by hindering destabilizing factors from binding to the same or overlapping sites. In the case of Eph/ephrins, where we see a destabilizing effect of HuR, it would be interesting to investigate whether a block of polyadenylation may contribute to destabilization of Eph/ephrin mRNAs by HuR. Although speculative, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that several of the HuR binding sites found in Eph/ephrin 3'UTRs are located in conserved clusters near the poly(A) site. Moreover, the blocking effect observed by Zhu et al. (2007) was mediated by binding of HuR to U-rich sequences located immediately upstream of the cleavage site. It seems reasonable to assume that blocking polyadenylation has consequences for the stability of the respective transcripts because polyadenylation can enhance RNA stability. In this context it is plausible that the position of HuR binding sites in a given 3'UTR has a significant influence on the functional outcome.</p><p>Whereas the destabilizing function HuR exerts on the EfnA2, EphA2, and EphA4 transcripts was in accordance with an increase in the RNA level for two of these messages after HuR knock-down, EphA2 showed an unexpected decrease. This may be due to secondary transcriptional effects, which could be mediated by binding of HuR to the mRNAs encoding transcription factors that regulate EphA2 expression. Good candidates would be p53 or c-myc, which both (i) regulate EphA2 transcription (p53 positively and c-myc negatively), and (ii) are targets of HuR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Dohn1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Zelinski1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that the potential use of alternative poly(A) sites that, although as yet undetected, might be harboured in one or the other Eph/ephrin 3'UTR could have contributed to the observed differences in Eph/ephrin expression after HuR knockdown. The use of recently developed HuR inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Meisner2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> should help to clarify this issue and make it possible to separate short-term effects directly related to the stability of the target mRNA from long-term secondary effects.</p><p>Overexpression of Eph/ephrins has been shown in several tumor types and seems to be a prognostic marker that correlates with tumor malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-Surawska1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The highest levels of EphA2, for example, are present on the most invasive tumor cells. It has been suggested that not only overexpression of single Eph receptors contribute to tissue invasiveness but also a disturbed receptor/ligand density ratio. Also HuR was shown to have oncogenic potential and its overexpression seems to correlate with advanced stages of tumor malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002780-LopezdeSilanes2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As we show here HuR heavily influences the expression of many Ephs and ephrins either by direct effects on the stability of the respective transcripts and/or by secondary effects on the transcriptional levels. Therefore, it seems plausible that overexpression of HuR in tumors completely disarranges the expression patterns of multiple Ephs/ephrins leading to a disequilibrium of receptor to ligand ratios and consequently to enhanced invasiveness. In the future it will be interesting to analyze a set of different tumor tissues for the expression of both Eph/ephrins and HuR and correlate these data with tumor phenotype and patient outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and siRNAs</title><p>Anti-KSRP antibody was a kind gift of Douglas Black.
