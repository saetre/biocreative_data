Using a combination of ChIP&#x02013;chip, knockdown and expression profiling experiments, we show that upon gene induction, human H2A.Z associates with gene promoters and helps in recruiting the transcriptional machinery. Surprisingly, we also found that H2A.Z is randomly incorporated in the genome at low levels and that active transcription antagonizes this incorporation in transcribed regions. After cessation of transcription, random H2A.Z quickly reappears on genes, demonstrating that this incorporation utilizes an active mechanism. Within facultative heterochromatin, we observe a hyper accumulation of the variant histone, which might be due to the lack of transcription in these regions. These results show how chromatin structure and transcription can antagonize each other, therefore shaping chromatin and controlling gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA in living cells is packaged into chromatin by histones and non-histone proteins. This packaging is very dynamic, allowing the controlled access of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors to DNA. Most chromatin is packaged with so-called canonical histones; namely H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. In some regions, however, variant histones replace canonical histones, creating special chromatin regions. Here we show that the variant histone H2A.Z is dynamically recruited to promoter regions where it helps in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II, the enzyme responsible for the first step of gene expression. In addition, we show that H2A.Z also associates randomly in the genome, but these molecules are removed during the passage of RNA polymerase II. In non-transcribed regions, H2A.Z accumulates in large domains called heterochromatin. We propose that a battle between random H2A.Z deposition and RNAPII-dependent H2A.Z eviction shapes the chromatin landscape.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin dynamics is now well recognized as key in the regulation of nuclear processes such as gene expression, DNA replication and DNA repair, therefore impinging on biological phenomena such as cellular differentiation as well as normal and cancer development.

Consequently, the level of RNAPII at promoters does not strictly correlate with transcription in mammalian cells. We used two independent strategies to separate active genes from genes poised by the presence of paused RNAPII. First, we binned the genes with high levels of RNAPII at promoters into four groups based on their level of histone H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000687.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

Second, we profiles RNAPII phosphorylated on Ser2. Because phosphorylation of Ser2 is occurring during elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000687-Egloff1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, the level of P-Ser2 RNAPII on genes should be a better indication of transcription rate than that of total RNAPII at promoters. As expected P-Ser2 RNAPII correlates better with levels of H3K36me3 (Pearson, r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0,53) than with levels of RNAPII (Pearson, r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.34). Interestingly, H2A.Z is present at similar levels on transcribed genes and on genes poised for activation by the presence of paused RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000687-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000687.s005">Figure S5</xref>, using P-Ser2 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000687.s004">Figure S4</xref>, using H3K36me3). This data demonstrates that H2A.Z incorporation at promoters does not require fully processive transcription.

Interestingly, at <italic>CCL2</italic>, RNAPII is present in a paused state at the promoter prior to dauno treatment. Upon activation, RNAPII is first released from the promoter; an event that is coupled to an increase in H2A.Z occupancy and followed by re-loading of RNAPII. Note that these variations in H2A.Z levels at promoters cannot be explained simply by fluctuations in nucleosome density since our data are normalized for nucleosome occupancy. Taken together our data suggests that H2A.Z associates with promoters prior to RNAPII and may therefore affect early steps in transcription such as RNAPII recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>H2A.Z potentiates the recruitment of RNAPII to promoters</title><p>In order to test for a role of H2A.Z in RNAPII recruitment, we made use of small hairpin-mediated RNA (shRNA) interference.

This data shows that H2A.Z accumulates randomly in the genome at low levels and suggests that transcription may &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; genes from these &#x0201c;miss-incorporated&#x0201d; histone variant molecules. Because our H2A.Z profiles are normalized for H2B occupancy, it seems unlikely that this result is solely due to nucleosome loss during transcription but we nevertheless investigated that possibility in more details. First, we looked at nucleosome occupancy by profiling histone H4 normalized for total genomic DNA. Histone H4 occupancy is not affected by transcription in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000687-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), ruling out the possibility that transcription results in a depletion of H3/H4 tetramer. H2B occupancy, when normalized for histone H4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000687-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) or for total genomic DNA (not shown), is not dramatically affected by transcription either, suggesting that H2A/H2B dimers are not depleted by transcription. Since it is well known that transcription disrupts and reassembles H2A/H2B dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000687-Belotserkovskaya1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, we conclude that H2A.Z depletion likely results from a preferable re-association of H2A-containing dimers over H2A.Z-containing dimers in the wake of RNAPII (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Interestingly, revisiting our previously published ChIP-chip data on yeast H2A.Z suggested that this phenomenon is conserved throughout eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000687.s010">Figure S10</xref>). We therefore took advantage of the tractable yeast system to investigate H2A.Z eviction in a dynamic fashion. Yeast cells were submitted to a heat shock and H2A.Z occupancy was measured by ChIP-chip over time. H2A was also profiled as a control. Heat shock was chosen because it strongly induces a significant number of genes in a transient manner, allowing us to look at both activation (between 0 and 15 minutes) and repression (between 15 minutes and 2 hours). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000687-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, H2A.Z levels (normalized to H2B) are reduced in the transcribed regions of heat shock-induced genes (compare 0 minutes with 15 minutes). This data clearly shows that transcription directly or indirectly depletes H2A.Z molecules during elongation. In addition, the figure shows that the H2A/H2B ratio slightly increases as H2A.Z decreases. This clearly shows that the depletion is specific for H2A.Z.

Euchromatic genes that are not transcribed (OFF) do not carry H2A.Z on their promoter. Like for any genomic region, some random nucleosomes may be decorated by the presence of H2A.Z (red). At euchromatic genes that are transcribed, a cycle of H2A.Z recruitment followed by H2A.Z-enhanced RNAPII recruitment is observed at the promoter. In the transcribed region, transcription promotes the depletion of randomly incorporated H2A.Z. The exact mechanism by which this depletion occurs remains unknown but we have depicted what we currently consider to be the most likely option, that is: dimers are removed in the front of the elongating polymerase and reassembled in the wake of RNAPII as previously established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000687-Belotserkovskaya1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

In heterochromatin, H2A.Z covers large regions encompassing several genes. Several H2A.Z molecules are therefore associated with heterochromatic genes. It is possible that the absence of transcription in these regions leads to this accumulation of H2A.Z via the random incorporation pathway. Alternatively a mechanism that specifically targets H2A.Z to heterochromatin may exist.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000687.g005"/></fig><sec id="s3a"><title>Human H2A.Z is recruited to promoters &#x0201c;as needed&#x0201d;</title><p>Our genomic data shows that human H2A.Z associates with promoters occupied by RNAPII. Time course experiments, however, showed that H2A.Z and RNAPII do not co-occupy the promoter since H2A.Z is recruited prior to RNAPII and is evicted as the polymerase is loaded. Human H2A.Z is therefore recruited to promoters as part of the activation process; which is different from what is observed in yeast, where the association of Htz1 to promoters does not require any activation cues. Htz1 is rather pre-bound to most promoters and it has been proposed that its loading actually occurs during transcriptional repression in order to prime the promoter for the next activation cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000687-Gligoris1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The reason why mammalian cells have evolved ways to recruit H2A.Z &#x0201c;on demand&#x0201d; may reflect the fact that a small fraction of mammalian genes are actively transcribed at a given time. Yeasts, on the other hand, express a large fraction of their genome at any time and may therefore benefit from having most of their genes primed with Htz1 at all time. Human enhancers, however, are more like yeast core promoters in that they are occupied by H2A.Z regardless of the transcriptional statue of their associated gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000687.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>H2A.Z contributes to gene poising by recruiting RNAPII</title><p>While we see transient recruitment of H2A.Z upon activation of inducible genes such as <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>CCL2</italic>, we also observe large amount of H2A.Z on promoters carrying paused RNAPII but no evidence for transcription. At these promoters, the ultimate activation cue (the one that would stimulate the release RNAPII from the pause site and its entry into elongation) is not present. Hence, the presence of H2A.Z at promoters does not require full transcriptional activity. We rather propose that H2A.Z is recruited upon transacting signals that triggers RNAPII recruitment. At some promoters, such a signal is sufficient to activate transcription. This is the case at <italic>IL8</italic>, where we observe H2A.Z-dependent recruitment of RNAPII and active transcription upon dauno treatment. At <italic>CCL2</italic>, however, a significant amount of RNAPII is pre-bound to the promoter in the absence of dauno. Upon dauno treatment, we observe release of RNAPII into elongation and subsequent association of H2A.Z followed by re-association of RNAPII to the promoter. We therefore conclude that transient association of H2A.Z with promoters always precedes (and favors) RNAPII recruitment; and that this may lead to transactivation or promoter poising depending on the promoter context. Interestingly, H2A.Z reappears on the promoter after the first wave of RNAPII has left the promoter, suggesting that H2A.Z is not only recruited during the initial round of transcription but is reloaded prior to each new round. This suggests that the presence of H2A.Z on the promoter may play an active role beyond that of creating unstable promoter chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Recruitment of RNAPII: a universal function of H2A.Z</title><p>Our data show that the transient association of H2A.Z with human promoters helps with the recruitment of RNAPII.

Transcriptional elongation was known to perturb chromatin structure but, to our knowledge, this study represents the first evidence that the elongation complex can discriminate between canonical histones and their variants. Most likely, elongation disrupts both H2A- and H2A.Z-containing dimers but a transcription-coupled mechanism would prevent H2A.Z-dimers to re-associate in the wake of RNAPII. What allows elongation complexes to discriminate between histone molecules is unknown but may be linked to chromatin assembly/disassembly complexes as well as the various histone chaperones that interact with the elongating polymerase.

A preference of those machines for canonical H2A would make the transcription-dependent H2A.Z depletion possible.
