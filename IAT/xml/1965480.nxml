The deduced amino acid sequences of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 are identical except for their C-terminal domains. The C-terminus of Scn1ba_tv1 contains a tyrosine residue similar to that found to be critical for ankyrin association and Na<sup>+ </sup>channel modulation in mammalian &#x003b2;1. In contrast, Scn1ba_tv2 contains a unique, species-specific C-terminal domain that does not contain a tyrosine. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that, while the expression patterns of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 overlap in some areas of the brain, retina, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle, only Scn1ba_tv1 is expressed in optic nerve where its staining pattern suggests nodal expression. Both <italic>scn1ba </italic>splice forms modulate Na<sup>+ </sup>currents expressed by zebrafish <italic>scn8aa</italic>, resulting in shifts in channel gating mode, increased current amplitude, negative shifts in the voltage dependence of current activation and inactivation, and increases in the rate of recovery from inactivation, similar to the function of mammalian &#x003b2;1 subunits. In contrast to mammalian &#x003b2;1, however, neither zebrafish subunit produces a complete shift to the fast gating mode and neither subunit produces complete channel inactivation or recovery from inactivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data add to our understanding of structure-function relationships in Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2;1 subunits and establish zebrafish as an ideal system in which to determine the contribution of <italic>scn1ba </italic>to electrical excitability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Voltage gated Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2;1 (<italic>Scn1b</italic>) subunits are multi-functional proteins that participate in inter- and intra-cellular communication on multiple time scales via modulation of electrical signal transduction and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. &#x003b2;1 subunits modulate Na<sup>+ </sup>currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], regulate the level of Na<sup>+ </sup>channel cell surface expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and participate in cell adhesive interactions that lead to changes in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], cellular aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], cytoskeletal recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and/or neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Mice lacking &#x003b2;1 subunits exhibit seizure activity, ataxia, slowed action potential conduction, decreased numbers of mature nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons, alterations in nodal architecture, and differences in Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1; subunit localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, &#x003b2;1 subunits play critical roles in electrical excitability <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, while <italic>Scn1b </italic>null mice are interesting, their early death at postnatal day 19 and complex phenotype make them a challenging model system.</p><p>As a first step toward development of an alternative model system in which to study the physiological roles of Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2;1 subunits <italic>in vivo </italic>we chose <italic>D. rerio</italic>. This is an attractive model system with a number of advantages over mice, including the production of large numbers of embryos per single pair mating, external fertilization with transparent larvae allowing for genetic manipulation from the one cell stage, and rapid development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Embryos contain most of their adult structures by 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and the majority of external and internal organs reach maturity by 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Other commonly studied genetic model systems such as <italic>Drosophila </italic>or <italic>C. elegans </italic>were not appropriate for an <italic>in vivo </italic>investigation of Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2; subunits. There are no obvious candidates for voltage-gated Na<sup>+ </sup>channel gene orthologs in the genome of <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genome encodes two Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1; subunit genes, orthologs of Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2; subunits appear to be lacking, suggesting that these subunits arose in evolution after the appearance of invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1; subunit genes have been extensively studied in zebrafish, where eight different <italic>SCNA </italic>orthologs have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is the first description of the structure and localization of a zebrafish Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2; subunit ortholog, although sequences of <italic>SCN2B</italic>, <italic>SCN3B</italic>, and <italic>SCN4B </italic>orthologs have recently been reported in GenBank. In the present study we report the cloning and expression of zebrafish <italic>scn1ba</italic>. Two alternate splice forms of <italic>scn1ba </italic>with distinct C-terminal domains, <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2</italic>, are expressed in zebrafish mRNA. Both modulate Na<sup>+ </sup>currents expressed by zebrafish <italic>scn8aa </italic>&#x003b1; subunits. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemical experiments show localization of zebrafish &#x003b2;1 subunits in brain, spinal cord, sensory neurons, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, one of the splice variants, Scn1ba_tv1, is expressed in optic nerve while the other splice variant, Scn1ba_tv2, is not detectable in this tissue. Zebrafish are an ideal system in which to determine the contribution of Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b2;1 subunits to neuronal development and to the establishment and maintenance of electrical excitability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Zebrafish scn1ba is expressed as two splice variants</title><p>The Sanger zebrafish database was searched for translated ESTs with homology to the rat Scn1b peptide sequence (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAH94523">AAH94523</ext-link>), which shares 96% to 99% identity with the mouse, rabbit, and human &#x003b2;1 homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Short regions of homology were identified and several ESTs were aligned. Portions of these sequences were used to design forward and reverse oligonucleotide PCR primers that were then used to amplify a 102 base pair product from a zebrafish retinal library as described in <italic>Methods</italic>. This product encoded a cDNA with a predicted peptide sequence containing high homology to rat Scn1b. We then performed RACE followed by an additional round of PCR using nested primers to generate a full-length cDNA. This reaction resulted in the amplification of two clones, each encoding peptides with significant homology to Scn1b: <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2</italic>, respectively.</p><p>Alignment of the Scn1b, Scn1ba_tv1, and Scn1ba_tv2 peptide sequences is presented in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. Overall, Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1b share 53.15% identity, with 14.86% of residues strongly similar, and 12.16% of residues weakly similar. Zebrafish Scn1ba_tv2 shares 47.3% identity with Scn1b, with 13.96% of residues strongly similar, and 12.61% of residues weakly similar. Zebrafish Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 are identical except for their C-termini. Both zebrafish subunits contain a predicted N-terminal signal peptide followed by the start of the mature protein at residue alanine-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) corresponding to the experimentally confirmed site in Scn1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both subunits contain conserved cysteines predicted to form the extracellular &#x003b2;1 immunoglobulin (Ig) loop domain in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Residues forming the A/A' face of the Ig domain are conserved. This region has been shown to contain important sites of &#x003b1;-&#x003b2;1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The zebrafish &#x003b2; subunits contain four predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. Three of the four correspond to those predicted in <italic>Scn1b </italic>(corresponding to the predicted zebrafish asparagine residues N-73, N-90, and N-94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The fourth site (zebrafish N-111), is not conserved in <italic>Scn1b</italic>. The fourth glycosylation site predicted in <italic>Scn1b </italic>corresponds to the predicted zebrafish residue histidine-114. Interestingly, this glycosylation site present in <italic>Scn1b </italic>is absent in <italic>Scn3b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Comparing the Ig domain &#x003b2; sheets of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 with Scn1b reveals significant differences in the C, C", F, and G strands, with the most significant differences in the C" region. The C-terminal domain of Scn1ba_tv2 is 12 amino acids shorter than that of Scn1ba_tv1 and lacks the C-terminal tyrosine corresponding to tyrosine-181 in Scn1b which has been demonstrated to be important for the recruitment of ankyrin, subcellular localization, and channel modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Zebrafish Scn1ba_tv2 contains a lysine in the position corresponding to rat tyrosine-181, but within a novel C-terminal tail.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Zebrafish <italic>scn1ba_tv1 and scn1ba_tv2 are </italic>splice variants</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Conserved synteny was found for the region of LG16 containing <italic>scn1ba </italic>and regions surrounding <italic>SCN1B </italic>on human chromosome 19 and <italic>Scn1b </italic>on mouse chromosome 7. Genes closely linked to <italic>Scn1b </italic>on the mouse chromosome were compared to this region of the zebrafish genome using the Blast program. Predicted genes for zebrafish orthologs were then mapped against the zebrafish Zv6 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] to determine their linkage group designations. Located in close apposition to <italic>scn1ba </italic>are <italic>hepsin</italic>, <italic>gramd1a</italic>, and <italic>fxyd</italic>, genes that are also closely linked with <italic>Scn1b </italic>in the mouse and <italic>SCN1B </italic>in human genomes, confirming that <italic>scn1ba </italic>is orthologous to the mammalian genes. Analysis of <italic>scn1ba </italic>showed exon-intron boundaries in agreement with the published sites for mammalian <italic>SCN1B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The alternative C-terminal coding sequences contained in <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>were both found within exon 5 of <italic>scn1ba</italic>. Two alternative 3' splice acceptor sites, located at the beginning of exon 5 and internal to exon 5 respectively, separated by 97 base pairs, were identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The internal acceptor site, initiating the <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>C-terminus, is a weak, non-consensus sequence containing a rare thymidine as the first base of the internal exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, red arrow) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To confirm the expression of each of these splice variants in the zebrafish mRNA pool, we performed a single RT-PCR reaction using whole fish RNA as template with a forward primer encoding the region corresponding to the A strand of the Ig domain shared by <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>and a reverse primer encoding the 3' end of the putative alternative C-terminal sequence of <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>and found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, "primer 1" and "primer 2", respectively). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, this reaction amplified two bands of 633 and 847 base pairs, respectively. These products were subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing to be identical to the zebrafish <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>cDNAs cloned in the original reactions. Thus, <italic>scn1ba </italic>is expressed in zebrafish as two alternatively spliced products.</p><p>Mammalian <italic>Scn1b </italic>alternate splice products have been identified previously and this <italic>Scn1b </italic>alternate splicing appears to be species-specific. A <italic>Scn1b </italic>alternate splice product has been described in rat, &#x003b2;1.2, arising from retention of intron 5 and resulting in a novel 3' UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Rat &#x003b2;1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (corresponding to human &#x003b2;1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) is encoded via retention of intron 3, generating &#x003b2;1 polypeptides with novel transmembrane and intracellular domains that are species-specific. Translation of <italic>scn1ba </italic>intron 3 in frame with exon 3 predicts a short peptide extension beyond exon 3 containing 11 amino acids (GRSIFTFIHFP) that would produce a truncated, soluble protein. We have not yet found evidence for expression of these alternatively spliced mRNAs in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>In Situ Hybridization analysis</title><p>We used <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis to investigate the expression of <italic>scn1ba </italic>mRNA at 24 hpf, 48 hpf, and 3 dpf. An anti-sense cRNA probe corresponding to both the 3' UTR and coding region of <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>and <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>was used. A sense probe was used as a control and resulted in no specific staining (data not shown). Because the alternative C-terminus expressed in <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>is contained within the 3' UTR of <italic>scn1ba_tv1</italic>, these probes did not distinguish between the two subunits. Thus, these results represent the combined expression of the two mRNA species. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>, we observed CNS expression beginning at 24 hpf in the olfactory placode (OP), midbrain (Mb) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), hindbrain (Hb), and trigeminal neurons (Tg) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Extensive staining was also observed in the skeletal muscle cells (sm) of the trunk at 24 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition to staining in skeletal muscle, staining was observed in the Rohon Beard neurons (RB) in the spinal cord (RB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). At 48 hpf, expression patterns were not changed, although the overall intensity of staining in the brain had increased (data not shown). At 3 dpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) robust expression was visible in the spinal cord (SC), and expression was evident in the olfactory pit (OP) and the retina, as well as in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and trigeminal ganglia (Tg) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Na<sup>+ </sup>currents have been recorded in zebrafish Rohon Beard neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>.

These results are consistent with expression of a &#x003b2;1 subunit that increases with development, promoting cell surface channel expression, and modulating Na<sup>+ </sup>current, and are supported by our <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization results.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization</bold>. <bold>A &#x02013; D</bold>: Fish stained at 24 hpf. <bold>A</bold>.

Chinese hamster lung 1610 cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding <italic>scn1ba_tv1</italic>, <italic>scn1ba_tv2</italic>, or empty vector ("mock") were tested, as well as rat brain and zebrafish brain membranes.

Most notably, Scn1ba_tv1 is strongly expressed in optic nerve where punctate staining is suggestive of clustering at nodes of Ranvier, similar to mammalian &#x003b2;1 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although we were not able to confirm this at high resolution. In contrast, we found no evidence for expression of Scn1ba_tv2 in optic nerve. Zebrafish Scn1ba_tv1 is also localized in peripheral, acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin positive fiber tracts of the spinal cord and at the surface of skeletal muscle myocytes. No staining for anti-Scn1ba_tv2 was observed in these areas. Thus, Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 are differentially localized in some tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, including brain, optic nerve, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle.</p><p>Clustering of Na<sup>+ </sup>channels at mammalian axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier is dependent on the expression of ankyrin and key L1 family cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Previous results from our group have shown that mammalian &#x003b2;1-ankyrin association <italic>in vitro </italic>is dependent on the presence of a non-phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the &#x003b2;1 C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Similar to &#x003b2;1, tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of L1 family cell adhesion molecules, such as neurofascin, at the FIGQY motif abolishes their ability to interact with ankyrin, establishing specialized ankyrin-dependent and ankyrin-independent microdomains in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Non-phosphorylated neurofascin interacts with ankyrin<sub>G </sub>at nodes of Ranvier while tyrosine-phosphorylated L1 family cell adhesion molecules are found at other specialized sites of cell-cell contact such as paranodes of sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junctions, adherens junctions, and regions of neuronal migration and axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The FIGQY/H mutation in human L1 results in clinical disease, demonstrating that this tyrosine residue is critical for normal development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We propose that &#x003b2;1 polypeptides containing a non-phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine residue are localized with ankyrin<sub>G </sub>at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons. Tyrosine-phosphorylated &#x003b2;1 or &#x003b2;1-like subunits containing an alternate C-terminus, e.g. Scn1ba_tv2, are proposed to be localized to non-ankyrin-dependent domains where they are available to interact with other structural and signaling molecules, including different Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1; subunits. We have demonstrated that mammalian &#x003b2;1 retains its ability to associate with &#x003b1; subunits, but loses its ability to modulate Na<sup>+ </sup>currents, when tyrosine-181 is mutated to glutamate to mimic phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, we propose that differential localization of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 in zebrafish may result in differential Na<sup>+ </sup>current modulation and altered electrical excitability, depending on the specific association of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;1-like subunits in different neuronal subpopulations. We have also shown that mammalian &#x003b2;1 promotes neurite outgrowth as a result of &#x003b2;1-&#x003b2;1 homophilic cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our results suggest that extracellular &#x003b2;1-mediated homophilic adhesion activates an intracellular signal transduction cascade in the neuron. While the extracellular domains of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 are identical, their intracellular domains are significantly different. Thus, while both &#x003b2;1-like subunits may function similarly in homophilic adhesion, their subsequent activation of intracellular signaling cascades is likely to be different and reflected in the resultant neuronal response. For example, we have shown that while &#x003b2;1 promotes neurite extension in cerebellar granule neurons, &#x003b2;2, which lacks an intracellular tyrosine residue, inhibits neurite extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is possible that Scn1ba_tv1, which contains an intracellular tyrosine, promotes neurite outgrowth through a similar mechanism to &#x003b2;1, while Scn1ba_tv2, which does not contain an intracellular tyrosine, inhibits neurite outgrowth, similar to &#x003b2;2.</p><p>Interestingly, zebrafish neurons express two L1-related genes, <italic>L1.1 </italic>and <italic>L1.2</italic>, that have different C-terminal domains.

Immunohistochemical analysis shows that, while the expression patterns of Scn1ba_tv1 and Scn1ba_tv2 overlap in some areas of the brain, retina, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle, only Scn1ba_tv1 is expressed in optic nerve. Both <italic>scn1ba </italic>splice forms modulate Na<sup>+ </sup>currents expressed by <italic>scn8aa</italic>, resulting in shifts in channel gating mode from slow to fast, increased current amplitude, negative shifts in the voltage dependence of current activation and inactivation, and increases in the rate of recovery from inactivation, similar to the functioning of mammalian &#x003b2;1 subunits.

These methods are described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>cDNAs encoding <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>or <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 hygro (Invitrogen) and used to transiently transfect Chinese hamster lung 1610 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cells plated in 25 mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 8 &#x003bc;g of cDNA using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection. Rat brain or zebrafish brain membranes were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 500 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and heated to 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min before loading. Protein samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then probed with antibodies to Scn1ba_tv1 or Scn1ba_tv2 at a concentration of 1:500 or with antibodies that had been preadsorbed to their corresponding immunizing peptide, as indicated in the figure legends, to demonstrate specificity. Preadsorption was performed by incubation of the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature with an equal volume of the corresponding peptide diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Blots were then probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and detected with West Dura chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described for whole mount embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Briefly, embryos were fixed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Embryos were blocked in 10% heat inactivated goat serum, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS-T (containing 0.1% Tween) and stained overnight with anti-Scn1ba_tv1 or anti-Scn1ba_tv2 diluted 1:500 and co-stained with anti-acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma) diluted 1:2000. &#x003b2; subunit staining was detected using Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin staining was detected using Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiophot-2 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam CCD digital camera and Axio Vision software and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was also preformed on fish cryosections as previously described. Briefly, fish were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4&#x000b0;C before mounting in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT). Once placed in OCT, fish were rapidly frozen on dry ice and stored at -80&#x000b0;C or used for immediate slicing. 10 &#x003bc;m sections were produced and used for subsequent staining. Embryos were blocked in phosphate buffer (0.02 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.08 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) containing 0.3% triton X-100, and 10% goat serum. Embryos were incubated overnight with anti-Scn1ba_tv1 or anti-Scn1ba_tv2 antibodies diluted 1:500 or with antibodies preadsorbed to an equal volume of corresponding antigenic peptide resuspended to a concentration of 1mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Anti-acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma) was used as a positive control to stain neurons. &#x003b2; subunit staining was detected using Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin staining was detected using Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. For detection of neuromuscular junctions, slices were incubated with &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa 594 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiophot-2 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam CCD digital camera and Axio Vision software and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop.

The resultant cRNAs were resuspended in RNA resuspension buffer (5 mM Hepes, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and samples of each preparation were analyzed by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Total mRNA yields for each preparation were estimated by comparing the intensity of ethidium bromide stained bands on agarose gels with the intensities of bands corresponding to RNA standards of known concentration.</p><p><italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes were harvested, defolliculated with collagenase and maintained as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Briefly, pieces of ovary were surgically removed from female <italic>Xenopus </italic>frogs (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Oocytes were separated and defolliculated by shaking in 1.5 mg/ml collagenase in OR2 (82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). Healthy stage V-VI oocytes were selected and incubated overnight at 18&#x000b0;C in Barth's medium (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.82 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.33 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 0.41 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin. On the day following isolation, oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of RNA. The concentration of injected cRNA ranged from 50&#x02013;300 ng/&#x003bc;l. We used approximately 5-fold greater concentrations of <italic>scn8aa </italic>cRNA to <italic>Scn1b </italic>cRNA, and 20-fold greater concentrations of <italic>scn8aa </italic>cRNA to <italic>scn1ba_tv1 </italic>or <italic>scn1ba_tv2 </italic>cRNA.</p><p>After incubation at 18&#x000b0;C for 48 h, expression of Na<sup>+ </sup>currents was examined at room temperature by two-electrode voltage clamp using a TEV-200A amplifier (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Voltage pulses were applied and data recorded on an IBM PC using the Clampex data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Residual linear currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Signals were low pass filtered at 2 kHz using internal voltage clamp circuitry and data sampled at 20 kHz. The bath was perfused continuously with Frog Ringer solution containing 115 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.2. Intracellular pipette solutions contained 3 M KCl.</p><p>Following break-in to the cell, a period of 5 min was allowed for peak current levels to stabilize before initiating the electrophysiological recording. The voltage dependence of channel activation was determined from peak currents recorded during 90 msec-long test pulses to potentials ranging from -100 mV to 55 mV in 5-mV increments from a holding potential of -80 mV. Conductance (G) was calculated from peak current amplitude (I) according to <italic>G </italic>= <italic>I</italic>/(<italic>V</italic>-<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rev</italic></sub>) where <italic>V </italic>is the test potential and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>rev </italic></sub>is the measured reversal potential. The voltage-dependence of channel inactivation was measured using a 90 msec-long prepulse to potentials ranging from -100 mV to 55 mV followed by a test pulse to 0 mV. Conductance-voltage curves and inactivation curves were fit with the Boltzmann relationship, <italic>G </italic>= 1/(1 + exp((V-V<sub>1/2</sub>)/<italic>k</italic>)) where V<sub>1/2 </sub>is the midpoint of the curve, and <italic>k </italic>is a slope factor. The time constant, &#x003c4;, of current inactivation was obtained by applying the sum of either one or two exponentials to the decay phase of currents obtained during investigation of the voltage dependence of activation. To determine the time course of recovery from inactivation, Na<sup>+ </sup>currents were inactivated with a 100 msec-long pulse to 0 mV, which was followed by a recovery prepulse of variable duration to -80 mV, and a subsequent test pulse to 0 mV to determine the fraction of recovered channels. Recovery data were fit with either a single or double exponential to determine the time constant(s) for recovery from inactivation. Statistical significance between groups was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey analysis. Differences were considered to be significant when p &#x0003c; 0.05. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and plotted with Origin (Micrococal, Northampton, MA) or SigmaPlot (Jandel, San Rafael, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALL anterior lateral line</p><p>BAC bacterial artificial chromosome</p><p>BTX &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin</p><p>dpf days post-fertilization</p><p>EST expressed sequence tag</p><p>GCL ganglion cell layer</p><p>Hb hindbrain</p><p>hpf hours post-fertilization</p><p>INL inner nuclear layer</p><p>IPL inner plexiform layer</p><p>LG linkage group</p><p>Mb midbrain</p><p>OCT optimal temperature cutting compound</p><p>OLM outer limiting membrane</p><p>on optic nerve</p><p>OP olfactory placode</p><p>OPL outer plexiform layer</p><p>PLL posterior lateral line</p><p>PR photoreceptor layer</p><p>RB Rohan Beard</p><p>sc spinal cord</p><p>sm skeletal muscle</p><p>Tg trigeminal</p><p>UTR untranslated region</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJF carried out the <italic>scn1ba </italic>molecular cloning studies, the electrophysiology studies, the immunohistochemical studies, characterized the antibodies, generated the sequence alignment, generated all of the figures, and helped to draft the manuscript.
