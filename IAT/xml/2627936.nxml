We hypothesize that inheritable aberrant chromatin states in cancer and aging are caused by genetic/environmental factors. In previous studies we demonstrated that either genetic mutations, or loss, of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#x003b1;), can impair the integration of the retinoic acid (RA) signal at the chromatin of RA-responsive genes downstream of RAR&#x003b1;, and can lead to aberrant repressive chromatin states marked by epigenetic modifications. In this study we tested whether the mere interference with the availability of RA signal at RAR&#x003b1;, in cells with an otherwise functional RAR&#x003b1;, can also induce epigenetic repression at RA-responsive genes downstream of RAR&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To hamper the availability of RA at RAR&#x003b1; in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells, we targeted the cellular RA-binding protein 2 (CRABP2), which transports RA from the cytoplasm onto the nuclear RARs. Stable ectopic expression of a CRABP2 mutant unable to enter the nucleus, as well as stable knock down of endogenous CRABP2, led to the coordinated transcriptional repression of a few RA-responsive genes downstream of RAR&#x003b1;. The chromatin at these genes acquired an exacerbated repressed state, or state &#x0201c;of no return&#x0201d;. This aberrant state is unresponsive to RA, and therefore differs from the physiologically repressed, yet &#x0201c;poised&#x0201d; state, which is responsive to RA. Consistent with development of homozygosis for epigenetically repressed loci, a significant proportion of cells with a defective CRABP2-mediated RA transport developed heritable phenotypes indicative of loss of function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Derangement/lack of a critical factor necessary for RAR&#x003b1; function induces epigenetic repression of a RA-regulated gene network downstream of RAR&#x003b1;, with major pleiotropic biological outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinoic acid (RA), the bioactive derivative of retinol, is a signal fundamental for developmental and cellular processes, whose intracellular physiological level is tightly regulated by a complex metabolic pathway involving both RA synthesis and RA catabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004305-Blomhoff1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004305-Napoli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Specifically, we demonstrated that the homozygous epigenotypes for these repressed genes are heritable based on the analysis of biological and morphological phenotypes in HME1 cells either carrying the dominant negative mutant CRABP2 protein, or knocked down for <italic>CRABP2</italic>. Even when RAR&#x003b1; was still expressed, we observed in a significant fraction of cells both RA resistance, indicative of loss of RAR&#x003b2;2 function, and aberrant acinar morphogenesis, indicative of loss of CRBP1 function. The RA-resistant phenotype and the aberrant acinar morphology is expected to reflect only epigenotypes homozygous for repressed, non-permissive <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic> and <italic>CRBP1</italic> alleles, respectively. Consistently, in the same cells, we found evidence of aberrant CpG methylation, an epigenetic hallmark of repressed chromatin, at both <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic> and <italic>CRBP1</italic>. The repressive repercussion due to derangement of CRABP2 function affects also the chromatin of <italic>CYP26A1</italic>, another RA-responsive gene downstream of both RAR&#x003b1; and RAR&#x003b2;2.

This RAR&#x003b1;-regulated gene network is clearly implicated also in cell growth and cell morphogenesis.
