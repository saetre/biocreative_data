Several human and murine loci contributing to disease have been defined. The present study asks whether the proinflammatory purinergic receptor P2X<sub>7</sub>, an initiator of a form of programmed cell death known as aponecrosis, is a candidate product of murine and human lupus susceptibility loci. One such locus in (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice is <italic>lbw3</italic>, which is situated at the distal end of NZW chromosome 5. We first assess whether NZB mice and NZW mice carry distinct alleles of the <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>gene as expressed by common laboratory strains, which differ in sensitivity to ATP stimulation. We then compare the responses of NZB lymphocytes, NZW lymphocytes and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>lymphocytes to P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation. NZB and NZW parental strains express the distinct P2X<sub>7</sub>-L and P2X<sub>7</sub>-P alleles of <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7</sub>, respectively, while lymphocytes from these and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice differ markedly in their responses to P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor stimulation. NZB mice and NZW mice express functionally distinct alleles of the proinflammatory receptor, P2X<sub>7</sub>. We show that current mapping suggests that murine and human <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>receptor genes lie within lupus susceptibility loci <italic>lbw3 </italic>and SLEB4, and we argue that these encode a product with the functional characteristics consistent with a role in lupus. Furthermore, we argue that aponecrosis as induced by P2X<sub>7 </sub>is a cell death mechanism with characteristics that potentially have particular relevance to disease pathogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a polygenic disease, although the genes contributing towards the disease are unknown. Several human susceptibility loci have been identified, with eight of the strongest candidates mapping to 1q23, 1q25-31, 1q41-42, 2q35-37, 4p16-15.2, 6p11-21, 12q24 and 16q12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Of the murine models, the New Zealand Black and New Zealand White (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid strain is widely studied due to its similarity to human disease and its female preponderance. As with human SLE, the disorder of (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice is polygenic with a contribution from both parents. In a study of (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>2 </sub>mice, eight susceptibility loci were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the case of the locus <italic>lbw3</italic>, at the distal region of chromosome 5, homozygosity for the NZW-derived locus was associated with increased mortality at 12 months. Although originally mapped to 88 cM on murine chromosome 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], more recent data locate the microsatellite used to define <italic>lbw3 </italic>at 81 cM (discussed later).</p><p>We have studied the properties of the proinflammatory purinergic receptor P2X<sub>7</sub>, encoded by a gene within the human SLE locus SLEB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] at 12q24 (Ensembl Genome Browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/contigview?chr=12&#x00026;vc_start=119982631&#x00026;vc_end=1200highlight=ENSG00000089041"/>) and by the murine <italic>lbw3 </italic>region (Ensembl Genome Browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://http:www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/contigview?&#x00026;chr=5&#x00026;vc_start=119870152&#x00026;vc_end=11987"/>), and discuss its potential role in disease. The P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor belongs to a family of ion channels gated by extracellular ATP, but unlike other P2X receptors it is largely restricted to haematopoietic cells. The P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor has been proposed to play a role in a variety of immune functions including the secretion of leaderless cytokines and the shedding of the lymphocyte homing receptor CD62L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice exhibit resistance to antibody-induced arthritis and impaired CD62L shedding and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], stimulation of this receptor is proinflammatory &#x02013; suggesting a potential role in autoimmune disease.</p><p>In this respect, SLE is of particular interest. Not only is SLE an inflammatory disorder, but it probably reflects, at least in part, an immune response to debris of cells undergoing programmed cell death (PCD). As P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation is proinflammatory and induces PCD, functional polymorphisms in this gene would be predicted to affect lupus susceptibility. Moreover, PCD stimulated through the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor belongs to a category that bears many of the hallmarks of 'classic' caspase-dependent apoptosis, but also to other categories such as cytoplasmic vacuolization more often associated with necrosis. Such cell death has sometimes been termed 'aponecrosis' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whereas removal of 'classic' apoptotic cells is believed to be immunologically silent, necrotic cell debris is proinflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The effect of intermediate forms of PCD such as aponecrosis, for which clearance mechanisms have not been defined, is unknown, yet such material potentially plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SLE (discussed later). Finally, P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation results in rapid translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which is reversible if stimulation is brief (and thus independent of cell death). As PS and associated proteins are major targets of autoantibodies in SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], cells stimulated via the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor may be a significant source of autoantigen in this disease.</p><p>An allelic variation (P451L) of the cytoplasmic domain of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in commonly used mouse strains is associated with significant differences in its sensitivity to the ATP ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These allelic forms with proline (P2X<sub>7</sub>-P) and leucine (P2X<sub>7</sub>-L) at position 451 confer high sensitivity and low sensitivity to stimulation by ATP, respectively. While the NZW strain has been shown to express the more responsive allele of P2X<sub>7 </sub>(P2X-P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], that expressed by the NZB strain is unknown. We show in the present article that NZB mice and NZW mice express different alleles of the proinflammatory receptor P2X<sub>7</sub>, and furthermore that NZW lymphocytes are markedly more responsive to P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation than those from NZB mice. Lymphocytes from (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice exhibited intermediate sensitivities to P2X<sub>7</sub>-induced PS translocation and to PCD, but were as sensitive to induction of CD62L shedding as those from NZW mice, indicating a comparatively complex phenotypic penetration. The results indicate that P2X<sub>7 </sub>is a strong candidate for being the product of the murine <italic>lbw3 </italic>locus. As the human <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>gene maps close to SLEB4, we hypothesize that similar polymorphisms may also contribute towards human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Male mice were purchased from Harlan-Olac (Bicester, UK) and used at between 8 and 14 weeks.

These forms differ at a single amino acid (451). P2X<sub>7 </sub>activation, stimulated by BzATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), results in rapid externalization of PS and shedding of CD62L. We therefore developed real-time flow cytometric assays to directly compare the responses to P2X<sub>7 </sub>simulation of NZB lymphocytes, NZW lymphocytes and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>lymphocytes.</p><sec><title>PS translocation</title><p>PS is largely confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in healthy cells. Loss of lipid asymmetry, as evidenced by surface exposure of PS occurring prior to membrane breakdown, is generally assumed to be a marker of PCD. To enable the direct comparison of responses of cells from NZB mice, NZW mice and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice in a single tube, lymphocytes from these three strains were stained with anti-CD4<sup>CYCHROME</sup>, anti-CD4<sup>PE </sup>and anti-CD4<sup>APC</sup>, respectively, mixed and equilibrated with annexin V<sup>FITC </sup>(to detect exposed PS). Labelled cells could thus subsequently be distinguished by flow cytometric gating. The rates of P2X<sub>7</sub>-stimulated PS exposure by lymphocyte subsets derived from the three mouse strains were directly compared by real-time flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Baseline fluorescence was established, and cells were stimulated with the P2X<sub>7 </sub>agonist BzATP at the time indicated. The order of responsiveness to P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation, as evidenced by the percentage of cells translocating PS, was consistently NZW &#x0003e; (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003e; NZB. Therefore, consistent with the greater sensitivity of P2X<sub>7</sub>-P, lymphocytes from NZW mice show greater sensitivity to P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation, and show co-dominance with the NZB-derived allele (P2X<sub>7</sub>-L) in F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid mice.</p></sec><sec><title>CD62L shedding</title><p>Shedding of CD62L from T cells is a key event in lymphocyte migration to inflammatory sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and is known to be induced by P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation. Lymphocytes from NZB mice, NZW mice and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>mice were differentially stained as already stated but were labelled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L in place of annexin V<sup>FITC </sup>to allow direct comparison of the rate of CD62L shedding in a single tube. P2X<sub>7</sub>-stimulated CD62L shedding was apparent as a decrease in fluorescence in the FL-1 channel. While the rates of P2X<sub>7</sub>-stimulated CD62L shedding were high and low in NZW lymphocytes and NZB lymphocytes, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), interestingly the rate of CD62L shedding by (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>lymphocytes was indistinguishable from that by NZW cells. The high NZW response of P2X<sub>7 </sub>thus appears dominant with respect to CD62L shedding, indicating that factors downstream of P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation contribute to this phenotype. That loss of CD62L reflects shedding and not decreased cell surface expression through other mechanisms is evidenced by its blockade by an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>P2X<sub>7</sub>-induced secretion of IL-1&#x003b2;</title><p>Stimulation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes and macrophages promotes secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which may therefore be expected to differ between mice bearing P2X<sub>7</sub>-L or P2X<sub>7</sub>-P receptors. Indeed IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by NZW splenocytes stimulated <italic>in vitro </italic>with lipopolysaccharide and BzATP exceeded that by cells from NZB mice (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 at 50, 100 and 150 &#x003bc;M BzATP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Elevated IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by NZW splenocytes was apparent even in the absence of BzATP (although slightly below statistical significance), suggesting that inadvertent stimulation of the high (but not low) sensitivity P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor may have occurred through cell death and the consequent release of ATP during cell preparation (spleen disaggregation and erythrocyte lysis). In one NZW splenocyte preparation exhibiting particularly high IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, cells were refractory to further stimulation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>P2X<sub>7</sub>-induced PCD of NZW and NZB lymphocytes</title><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that lupus reflects an autoimmune response to debris from cells undergoing PCD. Although stimulation of P2X<sub>7 </sub>results in rapid PS translocation, the effects are reversible if exposure to the agonist is brief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Only prolonged treatment with agonist results in PCD. Translocation of PS following P2X<sub>7 </sub>activation cannot therefore be used as a direct measure of irreversible commitment to PCD. To measure PCD following prolonged P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation, we therefore compared the rate of terminal membrane breakdown (indicated by propidium iodide uptake) following BzATP treatment of NZW lymphocytes, NZB lymphocytes and (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>lymphocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation resulted in significant PCD in all populations tested, with the order of sensitivity NZW &#x0003e; (NZB &#x000d7; NZW)F<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003e; NZB, consistent with the high responder status of the NZW cells and the dominance of the NZW-derived <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>allele in this response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Stimulation of the proinflammatory haematopoietic P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] results in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, in high rates of PCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and in CD62L shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], each of which is associated with human SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor therefore has the characteristics of a candidate lupus susceptibility gene product. Moreover, the gene encoding human P2X<sub>7 </sub>is located within a region (12q24; Ensembl Genome Browser: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/contigview?chr=12&#x00026;vc_start=119982631&#x00026;vc_end=1200highlight=ENSG00000089041"/>) recently identified and confirmed in Hispanic and European-American Families as a lupus susceptibility locus, designated SLEB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A polymorphism in the cytoplasmic domain of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor of common mouse strains is associated with differential responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While most strains, including NZW mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], possess proline in amino acid position 451, we showed that NZB mice express P2X<sub>7 </sub>with lysine at this position and that the variant confers markedly decreased sensitivity to P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation. Notably, the murine <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>gene is encoded by a gene on chromosome 5 within a region designated <italic>lbw3 </italic>due to the identification of a NZW-derived susceptibility locus conferring increased mortality at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While susceptibility regions are broad, the microsatellite marker <italic>D5Mit101 </italic>(defining <italic>lbw3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]) was in the original study mapped to 88 cM on chromosome 5, which may have discouraged identification of <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>as a candidate susceptibility gene. Current mapping data, however, show this marker located at 81 cM &#x02013; Mouse Genome Informatics <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2/servlet/WIFetch?page=markerDetail&#x00026;key=6077a"/> and Ensembl Genome Browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/markerview?marker=D5Mit101"/>.

However, other candidates might include those encoding: lnk, an adaptor protein in T-cell signalling (65.0 cM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; P2X<sub>4</sub>, a purinergic receptor (65.0 cM) whose activity is assumed primarily to be neuronal, but which is also expressed (at least at the level of mRNA) in lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; shp2, a tyrosine phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (~66 cM [118.6 Mb]); and FLT3 (CD135, 82.0 cM), a tyrosine kinase expressed in haemaotopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. None of these has been reported to be polymorphic between NZB mice and NZW mice.</p><p>It is widely thought that lupus reflects an autoimmune response to cells undergoing PCD. Aberrant responses to such debris may reflect qualitative or quantitative abnormalities; for example, if its handling is defective and/or following exposure to increased levels of 'apoptotic' material. Both have been reported to contribute to human SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. That prolonged stimulation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor induces PCD is therefore of particular note. However, multiple pathways of PCD exist. While 'apoptosis' and 'PCD' are frequently used as synonyms, 'apoptosis' is often used to imply caspase-dependent cell death. Nevertheless, caspase involvement is not a good indicator of the physiologic importance, or 'programming', of a cell death pathway, and consequently classic 'apoptosis' may describe one end of a continuum of active PCD mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Hence, in principle, a defect in one of many PCD pathways, rather than increased susceptibility to PCD <italic>per se</italic>, may be sufficient to increased the burden of cellular debris and hence the susceptibility to lupus. Indeed, that SLE may reflect an autoimmune response to debris from 'apoptotic' cells, despite clearance of such material being thought generally immunologically silent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], has been a conundrum.</p><p>To reconcile these findings it has been suggested that, in SLE, mechanisms for removing apoptotic debris are overloaded, with remaining cells undergoing secondary necrosis, and/or that apoptotic cells have some immunostimulatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We suggest the additional possibility that different forms of PCD may give rise to debris with different degrees of immunogenicity. It is therefore necessary to dissect distinct PCD pathways to assess the potential effects that defects have on the disease process. It is attractive to speculate that P2X<sub>7</sub>-induced aponecrotic debris, perhaps due to the catastrophic nature of its generation or the apparent differences in cell dismantling, may be more necrotic than apoptotic in character and thus be immunostimulatory. Such material may either promote responses to surrounding 'apoptotic' cells and/or directly stimulate autoimmune responses to itself (if lupus autoantigens are appropriately packaged in P2X<sub>7</sub>-induced PCD). P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor-induced PCD is therefore potentially a source of lupus autoantigens or may represent a catastrophic form of cell death that overwhelms the host's ability to clear such material.</p><p>We therefore suggest the following involvement of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in SLE. ATP exists at very high concentrations in normal cells (5&#x02013;10 mM), and is released upon cell death before its rapid breakdown by ATPases. Consequently, extracellular concentrations of ATP, although normally low, are transiently increased at sites of tissue damage. Stimulation of P2X<sub>7 </sub>occurs at sufficient concentrations of ATP, resulting in secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; and in CD62L shedding within minutes. P2X<sub>7 </sub>stimulation thus acts to promote the inflammatory response. The resulting lymphoid infiltration leads to additional lymphocyte-mediated cell death, and to consequent ATP release, exacerbating the P2X<sub>7</sub>-driven inflammatory cycle. Indeed, given sufficient tissue damage, prolonged stimulation of P2X<sub>7 </sub>itself induces PCD, further adding to the cycle of ATP release and destruction. Release of autoantigens within P2X<sub>7</sub>-stimulated aponecrotic debris may also contribute to a breakdown in self-tolerance and initiation of autoimmunity.</p><p>While one must make the proviso that little is known at the moment about the level of ATP released at sites of tissue damage, its rate of decay and how these may vary between pathological conditions including SLE, we suggest it is reasonable to hypothesize that polymorphisms within P2X<sub>7 </sub>can influence the pathogenesis of lupus. Importantly, there are a number of polymorphisms within P2X<sub>7 </sub>that affect its activity. The Ile-568 to Asn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Arg307 to Gln [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and Glu496 to Ala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] polymorphisms therefore all result in reduced function of human P2X<sub>7</sub>, and might each be hypothesized to result in decreased severity of SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have shown that polymorphism of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor between NZW and NZB strains is associated with marked differences in P2X<sub>7</sub>-stimulated proinflammatory responses, consistent with high responsiveness and low responsiveness previously reported for the two alleles. We also show that current genetic mapping indicates that the <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>gene is located within the region defined as <italic>lbw3 </italic>and is a therefore a strong candidate for being the product of this lupus susceptibility locus. Furthermore, as the human gene maps very close to SLEB4, we hypothesize that polymorphisms within <italic>P2RX</italic><sub>7 </sub>may also contribute to human disease. Stimulation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor is proinflammatory and induces a form of cell death known as aponecrosis, which exhibits several characteristics of apoptosis. We therefore suggest that the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor and gene have the functional and positional characteristics suggestive of a role in the pathogenesis in SLE, and that the potential of the cell death mechanism aponecrosis to contribute to disease warrants study.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BzATP = 2'-3'-<italic>O</italic>-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FCS = foetal calf serum; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; IL = interleukin; NZB = New Zealand Black; NZW = New Zealand White; PCD = programmed cell death; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PS = phosphatidylserine; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JIE conceived the study, carried out the flow cytometric and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion experiments, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
