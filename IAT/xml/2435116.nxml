The HTLV-1 Tax protein plays an important role in the transformation of T-cells although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) that occurs in the majority of ATLL patients. However, PTHrP is also up-regulated in HTLV-1-carriers and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients without hypercalcemia, indicating that PTHrP is expressed before transformation of T-cells. The expression of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor during immortalization or transformation of lymphocytes by HTLV-1 has not been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that PTHrP was up-regulated during immortalization of lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by HTLV-1 infection in long-term co-culture assays. There was preferential utilization of the PTHrP-P2 promoter in the immortalized cells compared to the HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells. PTHrP expression did not correlate temporally with expression of HTLV-1 tax. HTLV-1 infection up-regulated the PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) in lymphocytes indicating a potential autocrine role for PTHrP. Furthermore, co-transfection of HTLV-1 expression plasmids and PTHrP P2/P3-promoter luciferase reporter plasmids demonstrated that HTLV-1 up-regulated PTHrP expression only mildly, indicating that other cellular factors and/or events are required for the very high PTHrP expression observed in ATLL cells. We also report that macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#x003b1; (MIP-1&#x003b1;), a cellular gene known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HHM in ATLL patients, was highly expressed during early HTLV-1 infection indicating that, unlike PTHrP, its expression was enhanced due to activation of lymphocytes by HTLV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data demonstrate that PTHrP and its receptor are up-regulated specifically during immortalization of T-lymphocytes by HTLV-1 infection and may facilitate the transformation process.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and a variety of other disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. ATLL is an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T cells that occurs in approximately 5% of infected individuals after a long latency period of 20&#x02013;40 years. The long latency period and the relatively low proportion of HTLV-1-infected people that develop ATLL reflect the inefficiency of the virus to transform cells and the need for multiple cooperative changes in growth control mechanisms to induce leukemogenesis.</p><p>HTLV-1 is a complex deltaretrovirus and its genome not only encodes for the essential viral genes gag, pol, and env, but also additional HTLV-1-specific regulatory proteins Tax and Rex, several accessory proteins p12, p13, p30 and a minus-strand encoded protein, HTLV-1 bZIP-factor (HBZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although the precise mechanisms underlying transformation are not completely understood, the 40-kDa transcriptional transactivator, Tax, is thought to be principally responsible for tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The ability to activate cellular genes, including proto-oncogenes, is a key mechanism leading to immortalization and transformation of HTLV-1-infected cells. Rex regulates the expression of incompletely spliced viral RNAs by interacting with the Rex response element in the viral RNA and cellular proteins used by CRM-dependent nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although Rex is not required for immortalization of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is required for infectivity and persistence <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

ATLL cells express factors such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor &#x003b2;, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#x003b1; (MIP-1&#x003b1;) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL) that directly and/or indirectly stimulate osteoclast differentiation and activity, resulting in hypercalcemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. PTHrP has been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of HHM in ATLL patients, but likely has additive or synergistic effects with other tumor-associated cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although PTHrP was discovered based on its role in the pathogenesis of HHM, PTHrP is now known to be a complex factor with a broad range of physiologic and/or pathophysiologic actions in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. PTHrP has been shown to be an auto/paracrine cell growth regulator that increases proliferation of several cell types including chondrocytes and renal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. PTHrP stimulates proliferation through the PTH1R by mechanisms involving both PKA and PKC signaling pathways.</p><p>Watanabe et al have shown that PTHrP was constitutively expressed in HTLV-1-carriers and ATLL patients with or without hypercalcemia which suggests that PTHrP is expressed before transformation of lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. ATLL cell adhesion up-regulated PTHrP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] indicating additional roles for PTHrP besides its central role in the pathogenesis of HHM. Moreover, PTHrP gene expression was induced during transformation of normal rat embryo fibroblasts by co-transfection with an activated <italic>ras </italic>gene and a mutated p53 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Insogna et al have shown that PTHrP induced transformation of rat fibroblasts with epidermal growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, co-transfection of rat embryonic fibroblasts with Tax and ras transformed the fibroblasts and they were highly tumorigenic <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Based on these findings, it is possible that PTHrP functions as a transforming factor in conjunction with other oncogenes.</p><p>The goal of this study was to investigate the expression of PTHrP, its receptor, and MIP-1&#x003b1; during the early stages of immortalization of human lymphocytes by HTLV-1. Using long-term liquid culture immortalization assays, we showed that PTHrP and PTH1R were markedly up-regulated during immortalization of T-lymphocytes. PTHrP expression did not correlate temporally with HTLV-1 tax expression and IL-2 stimulation.

In this study, we analyzed the temporal PTHrP gene expression during virus-mediated immortalization of lymphocytes to characterize its role in the transformation process. We present data to show that PTHrP is markedly up-regulated during the immortalization process.</p><p>An important step in HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis is the induction of abnormal T-cell growth. Long-term immortalization assays have been used to study the kinetics of HTLV-1 infection and abnormal T-cell growth that lead to transformation. The growth curves in our study are similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Human PBMCs that were cultured in the presence of IL-2, but not exposed to the virus, survived <italic>in vitro </italic>only for a few weeks. Following exposure to HTLV-1, PBMCs initially underwent a proliferative response due to HTLV-1 infection after which the cells entered a "growth crisis" between weeks 5&#x02013;7 followed by expansion of immortalized cells. The high level of HTLV-1 p19 antigen expression in the first few weeks of co-culture was due to the live residual irradiated SLB-1 cells. However, the p19 expression after three weeks in culture was from the newly infected PBMCs and demonstrated active HTLV-1 viral infection (data not shown).</p><p>Our data showed that PTHrP mRNA expression was gradually up-regulated in PBMCs following HTLV-1 infection; however, marked expression of PTHrP protein occurred at the time when the PBMCs were undergoing immortalization. This supports an important role for PTHrP during immortalization and the subsequent transformation process. The differences between the levels of PTHrP mRNA and protein expression were likely due to differences in translation efficiency, processing of the mature protein, and/or its secretion from the cells. Regulation of PTHrP secretion is a complex process and it has been shown that some PTHrP may not be secreted but targeted directly to the nucleus and function in an intracrine fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Abundant expression of PTH1R is normally found in the target organs that regulate calcium ion homeostasis, such as the kidney and bone, with restricted expression in other tissues. This contrasts with the widespread expression of PTHrP. In our investigation, the marked induction of both PTHrP and PTH1R by HTLV-1 suggests that PTHrP functioned as an autocrine growth regulator in the transformation process.</p><p>PTHrP is a complex gene that is regulated by three distinct promoters, P1, P2 and P3, and is transactivated by diverse cellular signal transduction pathways. We and others have shown that the P3 promoter in ATLL cells is regulated by the ETS signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and, recently, we have shown that the P2 promoter is regulated by the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our data in this investigation demonstrated that PTHrP was up-regulated during immortalization through both the P2 and P3 promoters. The ratio of the P2/P3 promoter-initiated transcripts during the immortalization phase was higher (1:2) than in human HTLV-1-transformed T-cells (MT-2; 1:4) or ATLL cells (data not presented) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is known to play an important role during the immortalization process and our data showed that the P2 promoter was highly expressed during immortalization. This suggests that NF-&#x003ba;B activity was responsible for transactivating the PTHrP P2 promoter during immortalization.</p><p>HTLV-1 tax has been shown to transactivate PTHrP. However, ATLL cells with no significant Tax expression have very high levels of PTHrP. Recently, we have shown that Tax mRNA expression was inversely proportional to PTHrP mRNA expression and PTHrP can be regulated in a Tax-independent manner in ATLL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To investigate possible mechanisms for up-regulation of PTHrP in our co-culture assays, we measured the expression of Tax/Rex mRNA. Our data showed that there was no correlation between PTHrP and Tax/Rex mRNA expression. Therefore, induction of PTHrP could either be due to an indirect effect of Tax or possibly a Tax-independent mechanism.</p><p>Data from the transfection experiments showed that HTLV-1 infection up-regulated PTHrP expression mildly and suggested that additional cellular events were required to induce the high level PTHrP expression seen in ATLL cells. Alternatively, PTHrP expression might be dependent on cell-type and require lymphocyte-specific factors for marked up-regulation. Over-expression of Rex alone resulted in the up-regulation of PTHrP. Interestingly, Rex and PTHrP have a similar nuclear transport signal and can bind to CRM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, the increased expression of PTHrP in the presence of Rex may have been due to increased nuclear export of PTHrP or alternatively due to increased PTHrP mRNA stability since Rex increases the mRNA stability of some genes, such as IL-2R&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>We analyzed the expression of MIP-1&#x003b1;, a second cellular gene that is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HHM, in the co-cultures. The data showed that MIP-1&#x003b1; was markedly up-regulated as early as 1 week following HTLV-1 infection of PBMCs. These data are in agreement with reports that showed MIP-1&#x003b1; was up-regulated during activation of T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that MIP-1&#x003b1; was up-regulated early in the co-cultures with HTLV-1 infection due to activation of T-lymphocytes. In contrast, up-regulation of PTHrP occurred later during the immortalization, which supported a specific role for PTHrP in the transformation process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data demonstrated that PTHrP was dramatically and specifically up-regulated during the immortalization of PBMCs with HTLV-1 in a Tax-independent manner. PTHrP likely functioned in an autocrine manner with the PTH1R facilitating the transformation process. Although further investigations are required to understand the role of PTHrP in the transformation process, it is apparent that PTHrP is up-regulated not only during HHM but also during early HTLV-1 infection implicating an important dual role for PTHrP in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Novel therapies directed against PTHrP will be an important strategy to prevent ATLL in HTLV-1-infected patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/mL).

Dunnett's method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons versus the control group. In some treatments (PBMC, PBMC+IL2, PBMC+PHA), cell numbers and protein level were zero after 6 weeks.
