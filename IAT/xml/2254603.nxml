A very thin corpus callosum found in MRI scans of the brain of patients indicates a deficit in embryonic brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A neurodegenerative process that causes optical nerve atrophy and loss of vision occurs in all patients in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Patients suffer severe psychomotor retardation and most do not learn how to walk and speak. MLIV patients also have achlorhydria, or the inability to secrete gastric acid by parietal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Cells in MLIV patients exhibit a number of defects. Many tissues, including the cornea, stomach parietal cells, and pancreas have large vacuoles containing fibrinogranular inclusions, multilamellar membranes and vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. MLIV cells show a delay in the degradation and/or transport of endocytosed lipids that accumulate in these large vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. MLIV fibroblasts also show a defect in the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane in response to treatment with the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore ionomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The gene mutated in MLIV is <italic>MCOLN1</italic>, which encodes mucolipin-1 (ML1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. ML1 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains and is a group 2 Transient Receptor Potential (TRP)-related cation channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ML1 is a non-selective, pH-regulated cation channel with a preference for monovalent cations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. One possible cell biological function for ML1 in skin fibroblasts is as a proton leak channel that regulates the rate at which endosomes/lysosomes acidify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. ML1 localizes to late endocytic compartments and its overexpression results in abnormalities in these structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>ML1 is first transported to the plasma membrane and is subsequently endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the transport of ML1 is also dependent on the AP-1 adaptor complex, but not the AP-2 or the AP-3 adaptor complexes, suggesting a second direct transport route from the Trans-Golgi Network to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. ML1 can be cleaved within the first intracellular loop and the two resulting portions remain associated. It is not clear whether this cleavage occurs in endosomes/lysosomes or at the Trans-Golgi Network, and whether it is required for the inactivation of the protein or is part of its normal processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>There are two other mucolipins in mammals. Mucolipin-1, mucolipin-2, and mucolipin-3 interact to form homo- and hetero-multimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All three proteins localize to late endosomes/lysosomes, though the localization of mucolipin-3 requires an interaction with either of the other two homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is therefore not known whether some of the symptoms in MLIV patients are due to the mislocalization of mucolipin-3 due to the absence of ML1. While there are no known existing mutations in mucolipin-2, <italic>varitint-waddler </italic>(<italic>Va</italic>) mice have mutations in mouse mucolipin-3 resulting in deafness and pigmentation defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. There is likely some redundancy in function between the mucolipins since DT40 B-lymphocytes lacking ML1 do not show a pronounced lysosomal defect, while in contrast, overexpression of dominant negative forms of ML1 or of mucolipin-2 results in the large vacuole defect characteristic of MLIV cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>CUP-5 is the sole <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>mucolipin and is required for the biogenesis of lysosomes from late endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Analogous to the cellular abnormalities in MLIV, mutations in <italic>cup-5 </italic>result in the accumulation of large vacuoles in some cells and in embryonic lethality, mostly due to developmental/tissue degeneration defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Mucolipin function is conserved since expression of human ML1 or mucolipin-3 rescues both of these defects. Mucolipin-2 has not yet been tested.</p><p>In this study, we sought to define more accurately the sites at which ML1 functions and to identify primary defects in cells with reduced ML1 levels. We used RAW264.7 cells because, like coelomocytes of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, macrophages have elaborate lysosomal transport pathways that allow us to visualize intermediate steps in lysosomal transport. Here, we show that ML1 is required for dynamic late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking events in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Co-localization of ML1 with markers for various endocytic compartments</title><p>We made a stable RAW264.7 clone in which GFP-ML1 is expressed under the control of the CMV promoter. In these stable clones, approximately 70% of the cells express GFP-ML1. A similar GFP fusion to CUP-5 is fully functional and rescues all defects of <italic>cup-5(null) </italic>worms, while a similar fusion to human ML1 rescues the MLIV defects in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>To determine the subcellular localization of GFP-ML1, we immuno-stained these cells using antibodies against the early endosomal protein HRS, M6PR that cycles between late endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, the late endosomal/lysosomal lipid LBPA, and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies that localized ML1 to late endocytic compartments in other cell types, we saw more extensive co-localization of GFP-ML1 with late endocytic markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The high incidence of co-localization of GFP-ML1 with LBPA is a novel result and indicates that ML1 localizes primarily to compartments that contain internal vesicles and lamellae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Co-localization of ML1 with markers for various compartments</bold>.

Consistent with the Lamp1 immunofluorescence staining, mCherry-ML1 co-localized strongly with YFP-Lamp1 and with GFP-ML1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). We then co-transfected cells with mCherry-ML1 and GFP-Rab7 (late endosome/lysosome) expressing plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We saw significant co-localization of mCherry-ML1 with GFP-Rab7.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-localization of GFP-ML1 with endocytosed substrates</title><p>To further define the localization and behavior of ML1 in lysosomal compartments, we examined the localization of GFP-ML1 relative to endocytosed soluble solutes. We pulsed stable GFP-ML1 clones with BSA-AlexaFluor 594 for 1 minute and then fixed the cells after various chase times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). There are four main conclusions from this analysis. First, we saw progressively increased co-localization between BSA-AlexaFluor 594 and GFP-ML1 that peaked at around 15 minutes and remained the same for 24 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Second, there were always some compartments that contained BSA-AlexaFluor 594 but that were not labeled with GFP-ML1, even at the 24-hour time point when all of the BSA-AlexaFluor 594 is in terminal compartments. Third, we saw many tubules emanating from GFP-ML1-labeled compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Fourth, we saw BSA-AlexaFluor 594 concentrations in substructures that were 300&#x02013;500 nm in diameter and that were attached by tubules to endocytic compartments. GFP-ML1 localizes to these endocytic compartments, including the tubules and attached substructures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, 15 min zoom). The number of these GFP-ML1-labeled compartments that showed a polarized distribution of BSA-AlexaFluor 594 increased over the time course of the experiment, peaked to about 15 +/- 2 per cell at the 15-minute time point, and remained the same at later time points. These structures were not a consequence of the overexpression of GFP-ML1 since they were apparent in untransfected RAW264.7 cells (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Co-localization of GFP-ML1 with soluble endocytosed molecules</bold>.

This was determined either by staining of cells with the pH-sensitive dye Acridine Orange or after loading the terminal compartments with the pH-sensitive endocytic substrate dextran-Oregon Green 488 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>).

The lack of hyperacidification of terminal compartments in our RAW264.7 RNAi lines may be due to residual ML1 activity, to redundancy with mucolipin-2, and/or the presumed pH regulatory function of ML1 may be tissue-specific.</p><p>MLIV fibroblasts also show a delay in the transport of the fluorescent lipid analogue Bodipy-LacCer from endocytic compartments to the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To determine whether RAW264.7 cells had a similar defect, we pre-labeled the terminal compartments of RAW264.7, LS9, and LS10 cells with dextran-Cascade Blue, pulsed cells with Bodipy-LacCer for 30 minutes, and chased for 45 minutes or 90 minutes. By 45 minutes, all of the Bodipy-LacCer reached the peri-nuclear Golgi apparatus of RAW264.7 and did not co-localize with the dextran-Cascade Blue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In contrast, while some of the Bodipy-LacCer reaches the peri-nuclear Golgi apparatus in LS9 and LS10 cells, there is still significant co-localization of the Bodipy-LacCer with dextran-Cascade Blue-labeled compartments indicating a delay in the exit of Bodipy-LacCer from these compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of ML1 levels results in a delay in the transport of endocytosed proteins to lysosomes</title><p>Previous results had shown that CUP-5 in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is required for the transport of endocytosed BSA from late endosomes to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To determine whether ML1 is also required for lysosomal transport, we loaded the terminal compartments of RAW264.7, LS9 or LS10 cells with BSA-AlexaFluor 594 by incubating cells with the fluorescent marker the first day for 4 hours followed by a 24-hour incubation in the absence of the marker. Approximately 5% of LS9 and LS10 cells showed a significantly enlarged terminal compartment that contained the fluorescent endocytosed marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In the absence of ML1-specific antibodies, we cannot determine whether these represent cells with the most reduction in ML1 levels or whether loss of ML1 in all cells would give a similarly low penetrant phenotype.

After a 10-minute pulse, most of the BSA-AlexaFluor 488 has reached the BSA-AlexaFluor 594-stained terminal compartments in RAW264.7 cells. This co-localization in wild type cells remains the same after 15 or 30 minutes chase times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In contrast, in LS9 and LS10 cells, there is no co-localization of the BSA-AlexaFluor-488 and the BSA-AlexaFluor 594-stained compartments, either normal-sized ones or enlarged ones, after the 10-minute pulse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), By 15 minutes of chase, some of the BSA-AlexaFluor 488 has reached the terminal compartments, and this co-localization is complete by 30 minutes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><p>Having observed a delay in lysosomal transport, we asked whether there was a delay in the degradation of endocytosed proteins.

To determine whether ML1 is required for this transport step, we first determined whether MHCII co-localizes with GFP-ML1 in normally growing cells or after addition of LPS at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml for one day to the cells. This LPS treatment has been previously shown to induce the differentiation of RAW264.7 macrophages into dendritic-like cells while upregulating plasma membrane levels of MHCII and of other dendritic cell surface markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of LPS, we saw some MHCII expression in GFP-ML1-positive vesicles in RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The addition of LPS to these cells resulted in the described increase in cell size and morphology and a dramatic enhancement of MHCII expression. In these LPS treated cells, MHCII co-localized with GFP-ML1 on tubulovesicular compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Because of the substantial amount of MHCII that remained in the cytoplasm of cells, we could not unambiguously visualize MHCII that had been transported to the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Co-localization of GFP-ML1 with MHCII and MHCII transport to the plasma membrane</bold>.

In the absence of LPS, none of the three lines showed any surface staining. In the presence of LPS, RAW264.7, LS9, and LS10 showed plasma membrane staining, indicating that MHCII is transported to the plasma membrane in all three lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). However, the levels of MHCII at the plasma membrane of LS9 and LS10 cells were approximately four-fold lower than those of RAW264.7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, C</xref>). We saw the same result using two different anti-MHCII antibodies and in the presence or in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; that elevates total MHCII levels (unpublished data). RAW264.7, LS9 and LS10 cells express similar levels of intracellular MHCII as assayed by immunofluorescence staining following permeabilization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In all three lines, MHCII localizes to LBPA-positive intracellular compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). These results indicate that in the absence of ML1, there is a reduction in the efficiency of the transport of MHCII to the plasma membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Macrophages, like <italic>C. elegans </italic>coelomocytes, are highly endocytic cells. Because of the dynamic nature of lysosomal pathways in these cells, it is technically easier to characterize intermediates steps in lysosomal transport. In this study, we show that ML1 localizes primarily to LBPA-positive lysosomal compartments and is required for the efficient transport of at least two kinds of molecules from these compartments.</p><sec><title>ML1 localization in RAW264.7 macrophages</title><p>ML1 localizes primarily to LBPA-positive, Lamp1-positive, and Rab7-positive compartments. The limited co-localization of overexpressed GFP-ML1 with early (HRS-positive) and with late (M6PR-positive) endosomal markers is consistent with ML1 being transported to the surface and subsequently being endocytosed and transported through various endosomes before accumulating in these LBPA-positive compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is not known whether ML1 has separate functions in earlier steps, for example, in HRS-positive or in M6PR-positive endosomes. We think that this is unlikely because if there is a delay in trafficking from one compartment to another, then we would expect that the resulting enlarged structure would be a hybrid of these two compartments. Reducing ML1 levels results in expanded compartments that do not stain for either HRS or M6PR but that do stain for LBPA, Lamp1, and Rab7.</p></sec><sec><title>Transport of endocytosed solutes in RAW264.7 macrophages</title><p>During their transport to lysosomes, endocytosed BSA and dextran are found in intermediate structures where BSA and dextran concentrate in substructures that are attached by tubules to parent compartments. GFP-ML1 localizes to all of these structures. This is strikingly similar to what has been previously observed in coelomocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The substructures have a diameter of 300 to 500 nm, and given the time course of the experiments, likely are subcompartments that contain concentrations of lumenal proteins that are destined for lysosomes. The scission of these "buds" would segregate lysosomally-destined proteins from the rest of the LBPA-positive compartments. This is, or is analogous to, the reformation of lysosomes from hybrid organelles that has been observed both in vitro and in live cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>While it is not yet known how BSA, dextran, and very likely other molecules are concentrated in substructures, these substructures, are topologically similar to endocytic invaginations at the plasma membrane. A possible mechanism for the concentration of endocytosed solutes in these substructures is the use of scavenger receptors that would bind lumenal molecules and cytoplasmic adaptors to concentrate these receptors in the substructures. ML1 is unlikely to have such a function since the absence of CUP-5 in worm coelomocytes does not block the concentration of BSA in substructures though it does block the scission of these from the parent compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>If GFP-ML1 is found primarily in a pre-terminal compartment, then why do we always detect a high co-incidence of localization of endocytosed molecules with GFP-ML1, even at late chase times. We think this is because terminal lysosomal compartments continuously fuse with, and deliver their content to, late endosomal compartments forming what has been termed hybrid organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. As mentioned above, a budding and fission reaction is used for the reformation of lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Even at 24 hours of chase time after the uptake of fluorescent BSA, there are always some terminal compartments that contain endocytic tracers and that do not stain for GFP-ML1. We think these represent dense core lysosomes in which GFP-ML1 has been inactivated, possibly by Cathepsin B-mediated cleavage as has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These dense core lysosomes continuously fuse with earlier GFP-ML1-positive compartments.</p></sec><sec><title>ML1 requirement in lysosomal transport pathways</title><p>We show that reducing ML1 levels results in the delay in the transport of Bodipy-LacCer to the Golgi apparatus, of endocytosed proteins to the terminal compartments, and of MHCII to the plasma membrane. As has been previously shown, the Bodipy-LacCer co-localizes with endocytosed dextran during its transit to the Golgi apparatus, and given the high incidence of localization of dextran with GFP-ML1, very likely with GFP-ML1. Similarly, MHCII and GFP-ML1 co-localize extensively.</p><p>In our model we suggest that ML1 localizes primarily to a pre-lysosomal M6PR-negative, LBPA-positive compartment that serves as a hub for the transport of molecules to various destinations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Soluble molecules like BSA and dextran are concentrated in substructures that emanate and separate from these compartments. Following the fission reaction, these substructures fuse with lysosomes, during which time ML1 is inactivated, possibly due to a reduction in pH and the activation of proteases. Previous results have implicated Cathepsin B in the proteolytic cleavage and the inhibition of ML1 channel activity in lysosomal compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is an iterative process in which ML1-negative lysosomes continuously fuse with GFP-ML1-labeled compartments, thus delivering partially digested peptide fragments for loading on MHCII. The transport of MHCII to the plasma membrane also involves tubulovesicular intermediates, and thus may also require ML1 for their formation or for the scission of tubules before they fuse with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Model of ML1 functions</bold>.

In the case of BSA transport, the assays we used would only detect a delay in transport and not a complete bloc if for example ML1 is required for the formation or scission of substructures but is not required for the fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes. In addition, mucolipin-2 likely has redundant functions with ML1 since while a genomic knockout of <italic>MCOLN1 </italic>in DT40 B-lymphocytes does not result in expanded terminal compartments, the overexpression of dominant-negative carboxyl-terminal GFP fusions of ML1 or of mucolipin-2 both show this phenotype.</p><p>Finally, we do not know whether ML1 directly functions in Bodipy-LacCer trafficking, in BSA transport, and/or in MHCII transport. One possibility is that ML1 performs a similar function in all of these transport steps, for example, in the formation and/or scission of tubulovesicular extensions. Alternatively, ML1 may be required in one transport step such that the loss/reduction of ML1 levels retards this step leading to the accumulation of substrates in the hub compartment, and this accumulation indirectly interferes with other transport pathways. Future studies will identify specific requirements of ML1 in these transport pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mucolipin-1 localizes to dynamic compartments in murine macrophages.
