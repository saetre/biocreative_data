Here we show that the C-terminal &#x0223c;300 amino acids of E1, that share homology with members of helicase superfamily 3 (SF3), can act as an autonomous helicase. E1 is monomeric in the absence of ATP but assembles into hexamers in the presence of ATP, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or both. A 16 base sequence is the minimum for efficient hexamerization, although the complex protects &#x0223c;30 bases from nuclease digestion, supporting the notion that the DNA is bound within the protein complex. In the absence of ATP, or in the presence of ADP or the non&#x02013;hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP&#x02013;PNP, the interaction with short ssDNA oligonucleotides is exceptionally tight (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003e; 6 h). However, in the presence of ATP, the interaction with DNA is destabilized (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0223c;60 s). These results suggest that during the ATP hydrolysis cycle an internal DNA-binding site oscillates from a high to a low-affinity state, while protein&#x02013;protein interactions switch from low to high affinity. This reciprocal change in protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA affinities could be part of a mechanism for tethering the protein to its substrate while unidirectional movement along DNA proceeds.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases couple the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids. Many of these enzymes function as oligomers including the viral helicases T-antigen and E1, the replicative helicases of SV40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and papillomavirus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). These proteins are also the initiator proteins that first melt the origin DNA (<italic>ori</italic>) where they then assemble as helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The melting of duplex DNA and processive unwinding are distinct processes, but there are indications of mechanistic similarities. This is based largely on a shared requirement for amino acids in the helicase domains (HDs) of SV40 and E1 that form a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). DNA melting occurs at specific sites defined by the origin-recognition sequence (<italic>ori</italic>) and the sequence-specific-origin binding domains (OBDs) of these initiators. In bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) the E1 protein assembles in a stepwise fashion on <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The initial binding of E1 as a dimer requires the assistance of the transcription factor E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), which orientates subsequent oligomeric complexes in a head to tail array. In the presence of ATP, oligomers from tetramer through to double hexamers have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In the absence of ATP, the E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complexes that form are relatively unstable. Two E1 trimers melt the DNA either side of the E1-binding site. This event is ATP dependent and requires the cooperation of the OBD and an ssDNA-binding site in the E1HD. The final transition to the putative double hexameric replicative helicase is not understood. However, the predicted rearrangement to two protein rings is likely to require the ongoing involvement of the ATP-modulated ssDNA-binding site in the E1 helicase domain (E1HD). In SV40, T-antigen also assembles on <italic>ori</italic> in various oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), but the <italic>ori</italic> melting complex structure has not been defined.</p><p>The hexameric helicases studied to date bind both ssDNA and dsDNA as ring-shaped structures. In most cases ssDNA is the preferred substrate for DNA binding. As described above, the high affinity of T-antigen and E1 for dsDNA is primarily a manifestation of the presence of the OBD, and related to the assembly process for concentrating the proteins at <italic>ori</italic>. For T7 gp4, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DnaB helicase and other members of the DnaB family, ssDNA binds in a central cavity generated by oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Binding appears unidirectional, consistent with the defined unwinding polarity of helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Binding to replication forks, which is likely to reveal important features of the helicase mechanism, has been studied less extensively. However, DNA footprinting studies suggest that T-antigen encircle one DNA strand at a replication fork structure with interactions extending into the duplex region ahead of the fork. The other DNA strand is excluded from the protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Quantitative fluorescence titration studies with synthetic replication forks demonstrate that DnaB also excludes one strand of DNA when the substrate is engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The requirements for oligomerization of hexameric helicases differ, although in most cases a nucleotide is required. T-antigen forms hexamers with ADP, ATP and non-hydrolysable analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). For bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E1 it has been reported that the enzyme purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> requires DNA for hexamerization, with or without ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), but the enzyme purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells exists in a number of oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Similar results have been reported for HPV 11 E1 from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The helicase mechanism can be viewed as a DNA translocase activity coupled to a base pair separation process. However, how these processes proceed mechanistically and are coupled to each other and NTPase activity are largely unknown. Mechanisms based on active and passive unwinding have been proposed but differentiating between them is problematic since they share common features, principally the modulation of protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in a nucleotide hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Here we report the characterization of the enzymatic, oligomerization and DNA-binding properties of a helicase protein derived from the C-terminal domain of BPV E1. The E1HD is monomeric but assembles into hexamers with ssDNA or ATP but not ADP or AMP&#x02013;PNP. The minimal DNA-binding site sizefor efficient oligomerization is &#x0223c;16 bases. With ADP, AMP&#x02013;PNP or without a cofactor hexamers form an exceptionally tight complex with ssDNA. However, in the presence of ATP the half-life of the protein&#x02013;ssDNA interaction is, comparatively, exceptionally short. These results suggest that during the ATP hydrolysis cycle an ssDNA-binding site ocillates from a high to a low-affinity state whereas protein&#x02013;protein interactions change from a low- to high-affinity state. These features are indicative of an ssDNA translocase activity, thus defining a component of the helicase mechanism for this important viral protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression, purification and quantification</title><p>DNA encoding the C-terminal 308 codons of BPV E1 was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET11c for expression in <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3), induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20&#x000b0;C for 6 h.

The start point of this construct was defined by the end point of the sequence-specific E1 OBD, and is &#x0223c;30 amino acids upstream of the sequence alignment with SV40 and polyoma virus T-antigens. We first asked if E1HD retained the polarity of DNA unwinding of full-length E1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Helicase substrates with 64 bp of double-stranded DNA and either a 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; 48 base overhang were generated, with the 64 base fragment <sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled. Lanes 1 and 2 show the native and denatured substrate. Recombinant E1HD (lanes 3&#x02013;7) and E1 (lanes 8&#x02013;10) both displaced the labelled oligonucleotide from the substrate with the 3&#x02032; overhang, but not the 5&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left and right, respectively). DNA substrates of pure duplex character were not unwound by the enzyme (data not shown). We note also that high-protein concentrations appeared inhibitory for unwinding. Next, we asked if E1HD was capable of unwinding long DNA substrates. An end-labelled primer was annealed to single-stranded M13 DNA and extended with all four dNTP and a pre-defined ratio of ddCTP to dCTP, generating a series of extension products. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, lanes 1 and 2 are size markers. Lane 3 is the labelled primer, and lane 4 the extension ladder displaced from M13 DNA by heating. Without protein, there is minimal spontaneous displacement of DNA strands &#x0223c;&#x0003c;40 bases from the substrate (lane 5), but E1HD is capable of dissociating DNA strands approaching 1000 bases, at the limits of the extension ladder (lanes 6&#x02013;9). Again, we noted inhibition of unwinding at high-protein concentrations (lane 9). In the presence of the single-stranded binding protein RPA, unwinding by E1HD was more efficient and uninhibited at high-protein concentrations (lanes 11&#x02013;14). We conclude from these experiments that recombinant E1HD is a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; helicase capable of displacing long ssDNA strands from duplex DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>ssDNA-binding by E1HD</title><p>E1HD bound readily to ssDNA, with no apparent sequence preference (data not shown). The length-dependence of the E1HD interaction with ssDNA was investigated by gel-shift assays using <sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled poly-dT oligonucleotides of varying length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For the 30, 20, 18 and 16base oligonucleotides (T30, T20, T18 and T16) we observed only a small difference in the extent of binding when incubated with an increasing concentration of protein (upper and middle panel). For the T14 and T12 oligonucleotides, binding was progressively impaired but detectable for the 12-base oligonucleotide (middle panel). Minimal complex formation with the poly(dT) oligonucleotides T10 and T8 was detectable upon prolonged exposure of the gel-shift gel, but no complex formed at all with oligonucleotide T6. The minimal binding site requirement for efficient ssDNA-binding by the E1HD is therefore &#x0223c;16 bases. We also note that all complexes migrated similarly in the native gel system, suggesting that the same complex forms regardless of ssDNA size.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows a comparison of E1HD binding to labelled T42, T30 and T18 oligonucleotides at high-protein concentrations. The small difference in binding affinity observed between the 18 compared with the 30 and 42 base oligonucleotides is evident as a complex instability in the gel, judged by the appearance of partially retarded probe in the image shown [compare lanes 2&#x02013;4 (T18) with lanes 6&#x02013;8 and 10&#x02013;12 (T30 and T42)].

When the E1HD protein alone was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column at concentrations up to the 9 mg/ml tested, the protein eluted as a low molecular weight species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, upper panel, 6 mg/ml E1HD).

When E1HD was pre-incubated with the oligonucleotide T18 and applied to the gel filtration column, a high molecular weight complex formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, middle panel), that did not form with oligonucleotide alone (lower panel). For this complex, the Stokes' radius was found to be 56 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x0212b; and the sedimentation coefficient 9.4 &#x000b1; 0.4 S, corresponding to a molecular weight of 217 &#x000b1; 14 kDa. To determine the stoichiometry of protein to DNA in the complex the protein and DNA content of the peak fraction were determined. These results gave a ratio of 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.03 protein molecules per oligonucleotide. The predicted molecular weight of a hexameric E1HD complex bound to a T18 oligonucleotide is 214.8 kDa. These data are therefore consistent with a hexameric complex of E1 bound to a single molecule of T18 DNA, (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;T18.</p><p>We have previously reported that E1HD forms an oligomeric complex with ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The elution volume of this complex by gel filtration (Superdex 200) was similar to the (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;T18 complex, indicating that it is also a hexamer. When E1HD was pre-incubated with ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> over a range of concentrations and applied to the gel filtration column, hexamer formation was highly cooperative between 10 and 30 &#x000b5;M protein (0.35&#x02013;1 mg/ml), but never reached 100% (data not shown). There was no indication of intermediate species, corresponding to dimers to pentamers, or species larger than hexamer, at any protein concentration tested. However, in glycerol gradients we failed to obtain a single discrete protein peak corresponding to hexamer, but observed protein from monomer through to hexamer (data not shown). With ADP/Mg<sup>2</sup> the protein was entirely monomeric at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml tested (data not shown). Similarly, the sedimentation profile of the protein in glycerol gradients containing AMP&#x02013;PNP (adenylyl-imidodiphosphate) was indistinguishable from gradients containing no cofactor or ADP, indicating that the protein is also monomeric in the presence of the non-hydrolysable cofactor (data not shown).</p><p>The gel-shift assay provides a simple means of analysing binding, but information on protein&#x02013;DNA stoichiometries are difficult to obtain. However, when the peak gel filtration fractions of (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;T18 formed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled oligonucleotide were analysed on a native gel, the complex co-migrated with the products of a independent <italic>de novo</italic> binding reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In both the gel-shift analysis and hydrodynamic analysis of E1HD&#x02013;ssDNA complexes there was little or no indication of multiple species. These results strongly suggest therefore that the complex we observe by gel-shift is also a hexameric E1HD complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide cofactors and E1HD complex formation with ssDNA and dsDNA</title><p>The apparent binding affinity of E1HD for ssDNA (oligo T30 shown) is enhanced in the presence of ATP compared with its absence, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5 compared with 6&#x02013;10.

Binding extents in the presence of ADP (lanes 16&#x02013;20) were similar to those observed without cofactor.

Multiple protein&#x02013;DNA complexes formed, up to five distinct bands without cofactor, some of which were common to all binding reactions. With ATP two distinct complexes formed that were common to all reactions with and without cofactors.

E1HD bound ssDNA in the presence or absence of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. On this long probe, two shifted complexes were observed, and we note a mobility difference between complexes formed with and without ATP that was not observed on short probes. Products of the nuclease protection assay were analysed on denaturing sequencing gels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. Lane 2 is the 84 base ssDNA probe. When E1HD was pre-incubated with ssDNA and ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> and then treated with nuclease P1 and micrococcal nuclease for increasing time (lanes 3&#x02013;5, 5, 15 and 30 min) the resulting cleavage products were not significantly different to reactions containing no E1HD (lanes 6&#x02013;8). Only one weak product band of &#x0223c;35 nt increased in intensity with digestion time (1<sup>*</sup>). However, for reactions performed without ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>, lanes 9&#x02013;14, the presence of E1HD resulted in a significant product of &#x0223c;33 nt that was resistant to nuclease digestion (2<sup>*</sup>). Some products up to &#x0223c;8 bases smaller also appeared (indicated with the bracket), as did a minor product of approximately twice the size (62&#x02013;63 bases, 3*).</p></sec><sec><title>Cofactor modulation of the E1 hexamer ssDNA-binding site</title><p>The ability to observe discrete nuclease protection products, in the assay described above, only in the absence of ATP was surprising since ATP appears to promote complex formation. We investigated the stability of (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ssDNA complexes by first pre-forming the complex with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled ssDNA without cofactor, then diluting the reaction in to buffer containing excess cold competitor and either ATP, ADP AMP&#x02013;PNP or no cofactor. Reaction products were then cross-linked with glutaraldehyde before running on polyacrylamide gels. This measure was necessary since complex instability in the gel system was observed for short oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and particularly apparent over long running times. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking did not alter the binding extents observed without cross-linking (data not shown). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> the gel was run continuously over a period of 4 h. Lane 1 is free probe, lane 2 is a control reaction where competitor and radiolabelled T18 DNA were mixed before adding protein, and lane 3 shows the products of the initial binding reaction. Without cofactor (lanes 4&#x02013;7), with ADP (lanes 8&#x02013;11), or AMP&#x02013;PNP the (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;T18 complex was exceptionally stable. For all reactions we were unable to determine any appreciable decay of the complex over the 4 h time course shown, and even up to 6 h also (data not shown). However, in the presence of ATP we observed remarkably different kinetics, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, where the time course was &#x0003e;6 min. Within the first 30 s after the addition of ATP 70&#x02013;75% of the T18 complex dissociates, then the rate of complex dissociation steadily declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>). With the T30 and T42 oligonucleotide similar results were obtained except that &#x0223c;50% of the complex dissociated in 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The dissociation kinetics did not fit simple single- or biphasic decay models.</p></sec><sec><title>Oligomerization assembles a catalytically robust protein complex</title><p>We next asked if the protein concentration dependence of oligomerization in the presence of ATP observed by gel filtration and described above was reflected in the ATPase activity of E1HD. Initial rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured over a range of protein concentrations and ATP hydrolysed per nmol of protein per second plotted against protein concentration as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> (dashed line). There was a sigmoidal dependence of ATPase activity on protein concentration, where the ATP hydrolysed per protein molecule increases up to &#x0223c;50 &#x000b5;M E1HD. At 50 &#x000b5;M protein, 0.264&#x02013;0.294 mol of ATP are hydrolysed per mol of protein per second (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 0.28/s). In the presence of ssDNA, ATP hydrolysis was stimulated at low protein concentrations (solid line), and no further increase in the catalytic constant was observed &#x0223c;&#x0003e;30 &#x000b5;M protein. However, the catalytic constant was lower than that observed in the absence of ssDNA (0.16 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). We addressed the mechanism of ssDNA stimulation of ATPase activity by analysing hexamerization of E1HD at low protein concentrations in the presence of oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). At 17.4 &#x000b5;M E1HD &#x0223c;40% of the protein incubated in the presence of ATP and applied to a gel filtration column is oligomeric. However, in the presence of ssDNA, formation of the oligomeric complex was stimulated. In similar reactions without ATP, none of the protein was in the hexameric form at this protein concentration, with or without oligonucleotide (data not shown). The results of the gel filtration analysis are thus in accord with the gel-shift analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Together, these results indicate that ATP is required to assemble a hexameric E1HD complex with high catalytic activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The C-terminal 307 residue domain of BPV E1 (E1HD) functions as a helicase with the unwinding polarity of native E1. E1HD was capable of displacing long DNA strands from duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and based on our studies we propose below a mechanism for transclocase activity and processive unwinding by a hexameric protein complex. The enzyme is monomeric at high-protein concentrations without cofactor or with ADP. In the presence of ATP oligomerization is highly cooperative. Consistent with the properties of other members of the same helicase family the complex appears to be hexameric, as its elution volume in gel filtration was similar to the hexameric complex with ssDNA whose size we determined accurately. The nucleotide requirements for oligomerization therefore resemble those for full-length E1 binding to double-stranded <italic>ori</italic> DNA, where the complexes that form in the absence of hydrolysable ATP are relatively unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). It is curious however that hexamerization of full-length E1 itself has not been observed with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). It is possible that the protein concentrations required for hexamerization were not achieved in previous studies or that the experimental conditions did not favour complex stabilization. Hydrolysis of available ATP is a likely explanation for our inability to observe discrete peaks in glycerol gradients (data not shown), performed over hours rather than minutes in the case of gel filtration. We have also shown that oligomerization in the presence of ATP is required to assemble a catalytically robust ATPase. Many AAA+ helicases proteins possess an &#x02018;arginine finger&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), first identified in GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In some multimeric ATPase complexes the finger from one subunit extends into another to interact with the ATP tri-phosphate during hydrolysis. T-antigen has an unusual finger motif in that a lysine as well as two arginines contact the phosphate directly or indirectly through a water molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). A conserved arginine in HPV 18 E1 is required for robust ATPase activity and is possibly an arginine finger residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The cooperative ATPase activity we observe therefore supports the notion that the papillomavirus helicase is an arginine finger ATPase. Furthermore, since E1&#x02013;E2 interactions are conserved between BPV and HPV, the ATP-driven oligomerization of BPV E1HD we describe could serve as a molecular mechanism for the displacement of E2 from E1 during initiator complex assembly, as in HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). It is also noteworthy that SV40 T-antigen hexamerizes with ATP, ADP and non-hydrolysable ATP analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and that HPV 11 E1 apparently forms stable hexamers without cofactors or DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Despite the sequence conservation and predicted structural similarity between T-antigen and E1, subtle differences may exist in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of these two viral helicases. Within the papillomaviruses E1 proteins there may also be differences in the enzyme mechanism.</p><p>E1HD binds ssDNA as a hexamer with only one molecule of an 18 base oligonucleotide (T18) per complex. Thirty-three bases of ssDNA were protected from nuclease digestion by the helicase and only small differences in the binding affinity of poly(dT) oligonucleotides from 16 to 30 bases were observed. Formation of the hexameric complex was significantly impaired for oligonucleotides of &#x02264;14 bp. The 16 base DNA sequence therefore defines the extent of the ssDNA required for hexamerization, whereas the length of protected DNA indicates passage of DNA through a protein complex larger than the minimal ssDNA-binding site. Very stable hexameric complexes formed with an 18 base oligonucleotide (T18) but these were unstable under electrophoresis conditions compared with hexamers with a T30 oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Together with the results of the protection assay, this suggests that stabilizing contacts with nucleic acid may also occur outside an essential DNA-binding site. These results are similar to those of other well-studied hexameric helicases such, as T7 gp4, that protect 25&#x02013;30 bases of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). T7 gp4 and DnaB bind short oligonucleotides (10&#x02013;30 bases) in the presence of non-hydrolysable ATP analogues with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s of 10 and 60 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Both these helicases also bind a second DNA strand with a weaker <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, &#x0223c;40 &#x000b5;M in the case of DnaB. The binding constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) that we have obtained for E1, with or without ATP, are significantly higher, between those of the primary and secondary binding sites of DnaB. However, the mechanism of helicase loading on DNA is different for these enzymes. E1 and T-antigen bind and assemble on DNA via the sequence-specific OBD, while specific proteins load DnaB and T7 gp4 on to ssDNA. The E1HD binding to dsDNA that we observe is complex, with no clear indication of the efficient and stable hexamerization seen with ssDNA. Although T-antigen and E1 encircle their respective <italic>ori</italic> dsDNAs as hexamers, this is performed in conjunction with the OBD. T7 gp4, DnaB and T-antigen both exclude one ssDNA strand during helicase unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), and E1 is likely to function similarly. Together with the inability of E1HD to unwind DNA of pure duplex character, our dsDNA-binding data suggest that E1 is unlikely to translocate on dsDNA as a base pair separation machine.</p><p>E1HD forms an exceptionally stable complex with ssDNA oligonucleotides without cofactor, with ADP or with AMP&#x02013;PNP. However, upon ATP addition the affinity for ssDNA is significantly reduced. The ATP-dependent kinetics of (E1HD)<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ssDNA complex dissociation we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) showed an immediate phase of rapid dissociation followed by a slower rate of decay. These observations are notable since ATP stimulates formation of the hexameric protein&#x02013;DNA complex. With NTP compared with NDP or no cofactor T7 gp4 and DnaB also bind ssDNA more tightly, by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), and in the case of DnaB, nucleotide is not required for hexamerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The immediate questions that arise are how is ssDNA affinity modulated and can these results be rationalized in terms of current models for DNA unwinding? ssDNA complex dissociation could occur if the hexameric ring were to open or disassemble. We consider these possibilities unlikely since we show that ATP promotes protein complex assembly. Furthermore, the mechanism of E1 helicase loading occurs by stepwise binding to <italic>ori</italic> rather than loading of a preformed hexamer requiring a ring-opening step. Our favoured interpretation is that we have observed the ATP-dependent modulation of ssDNA-binding site affinity that is a component of the helicase transloction mechanism. The recent structures of T-antigen hexamers with and without bound nucleotide have shown large longitudinal ATP-dependent movements of a &#x003b2;-hairpin structure (the pre-sensor 1 &#x003b2; hairpin, PS1&#x003b2;H) within the central channel of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). This structure is critical for ssDNA binding in both T-antigen and E1 hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and along with an aromatic loop constitutes the primary ssDNA-binding site. PS1&#x003b2;H movement is accompanied by changes in the dimensions of the hexameric channel, rotation of the two tiers of the hexamer relative to each other, and a large increase in the buried surface area between protomers with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). These data also suggested that the ATP hydrolysis cycle was all-or-none, with all protomers transducing the energy of ATP hydrolysis in a concerted step. The initial rapid dissociation of ssDNA, we observed, upon ATP addition may represent PS1&#x003b2;H movement, ssDNA translocation, and its consequential release from the binding site at the end of the hydrolysis cycle. Changes in the DNA-binding site from high to low affinity must occur or the helicase would not move. The subsequent decrease in the ssDNA complex dissociation rate is not consistent with the rapid turnover of ATP by E1HD that we measured, albeit that ATPase activity is reduced in the prersence of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, this may be the result of accumulating ADP, or a slow rate of ADP release from the helicase&#x02013;ssDNA complex, suggesting that translocase activity itself cannot be effectively reconstituted on ssDNA alone. With T-antigen, the excluded ssDNA and a small region of dsDNA ahead of a replication fork also interact with the helicase, and all ATP modulated interactions may require coupling for efficient use of ATP and unwinding/translocation. With T-antigen, the excluded ssDNA has been shown to load on the outside of the helicase at high ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Our observation that a small mobility difference in gel-shifts is seen for E1HD complexes loaded onto large ssDNA probes with or without ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), may indicate that ssDNA can also interact with the exterior of the E1 hexamer in a cofactor dependent manner.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that during the ATP-hydrolysis cycle an internal ssDNA-binding site in an E1 hexamer oscillates from a high to a low-affinity state while protein&#x02013;protein interactions change from a low- to high-affinity state. This mechanism would ensure that the complex remains tethered to DNA while processive movement along DNA proceeds. A complete evaluation of this proposal awaits the determination of the crystal structures of E1 or T-antigen with DNA. These data would also provide an answer to the intriguing question of how the path of DNA through the complex impacts on the assembly of stable hexameric structures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jon Sayers and James Chong for critical reading of the manuscript.
