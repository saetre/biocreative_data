We have studied the structure of this DNA region in a supercoiled state using a number of chemical probes for non-B DNA conformations including diethyl pyrocarbonate, osmium tetroxide, chloroacetaldehyde, and dimethyl sulfate. The results demonstrate that two types of unusual DNA structures formed under different environmental conditions. A 27-bp homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror repeat adopts a triple-helical H-DNA conformation under mildly acidic conditions. This H-DNA seems to account for the S1 hypersensitivity of the promoter in vitro, since the observed pattern of S1 hypersensitivity at a single base level fits well with the H-DNA formation. Under conditions of neutral pH we have detected Z-DNA created by a (CG)5-stretch, located adjacent to the homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror repeat. The ability of the promoter DNA segment to form non-B structures has implications for models of gene regulation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0168-a" xlink:role="6529"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0169-a" xlink:role="6530"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0169-b" xlink:role="6530"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6530"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6531"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6532"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
