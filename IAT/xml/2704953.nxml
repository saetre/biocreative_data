Thus, activation of EGFR, GPCRs or PI3K pathway leads to BAD phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis. Increased levels of BAD in prostate carcinomas have also been reported. It appears contradictory that instead of limiting expression of pro-apoptotic protein, prostate cancer cells choose to increase BAD levels while keeping it under tight phosphorylation control. Analysis of the effect of BAD on prostate cancer xenografts has shown that increased BAD expression enhances tumor growth, while knockdown of BAD expression by shRNA inhibits tumor growth. Tissue culture experiments demonstrated that increased BAD expression stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that increased expression of BAD provides a proliferative advantage to prostate tumors, while BAD dephosphorylation increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis. Combination of proliferative and apoptotic properties prompts prostate cancer cells to be &#x0201c;addicted&#x0201d; to increased levels of phosphorylated BAD. Thus, kinases that phosphorylate BAD are plausible therapeutic targets; while monitoring BAD phosphorylation could be used to predict tumor response to treatments.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

This connection between BAD expression and proliferation provides a possible explanation for an increase in expression of phosphorylated BAD protein in prostate tumors.</p><p>Recently, several studies have shown that functions of BAD may extend beyond sensitizing cells to apoptosis.

Thus, fibroblasts with increased expression of Bcl-2/BclXL are characterized by reduced apoptosis and also by decreased proliferation. However, when Bcl-2 or BclXL forms a heterodimeric complex with BAD, cells can overcome the G0/G1 growth arrest and enter into S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Chattopadhyay1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Janumyan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although both increased proliferation and glycolysis are hallmarks of tumor growth, the experimental evidence that connects BAD expression with tumor growth has been lacking.</p><sec id="s4a1"><title>Could BAD play a dual role in prostate cancer cells?</title><p>Several reports have shown that cells that express BAD proliferate faster; however, mechanistic details on how BAD promotes proliferation diverge. One possibility is that BAD provides a counterbalance for increased levels of BclXL and Bcl-2 that are known to slow proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Zinkel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. If this scenario is correct, any pro-apoptotic Bcl2/BclXL antagonist would be expected to have a BAD-like effect. However, if expression of such an antagonist is constitutive, it would defeat the purpose of increased Bcl-2/BclXL expression by increasing apoptosis sensitivity. Since the proportion of BAD that could form heterodimers with anti-apoptotic counterparts depend on phosphorylation status, BAD may be uniquely suited for the role of modulator of BCl2/BClXL, availability of which is fine tuned by protein kinases. It is also possible that by increasing rate of glucose utilization, BAD expression provides competitive advantage to the cells in hypoxic tumors that switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Warburg1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The precise mechanism of how Bcl proteins regulate proliferation is obscure. It remains to be determined whether a single mechanism plays a dominant role or BAD-dependent stimulation of proliferation is mediated via several mechanisms simultaneously, and whether BAD localization to a specific organelle (e.g. mitochondria, ER, nuclear envelope) is important. Also, this positive effect on cell division may not be uniformly manifested in all cancer cells. Thus, BAD reportedly inhibits G1 to S transition in MCF7 breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006224-Fernando1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Until the effects of BAD on proliferation are dissected on a molecular level, we remain with the notion that effects of BAD expression on proliferation are cell type-dependent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Regardless of the exact mechanism that permits BAD to stimulate tumor growth, this capacity may provide selective pressure to increase BAD expression in tumors. Activation of protein kinases that phosphorylate BAD creates a permissive condition to increased expression of BAD. It is tempting to speculate that that high BAD expression should make these tumors increasingly sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways that control BAD. If so, high levels of phosphorylated BAD could be used to identify patients who will benefit from therapy with such inhibitors. Future studies in animal models and analysis of clinical trials data with regard to BAD expression/phosphorylation are needed to determine the translational value of extensive efforts spent studying protein kinases that phosphorylate BAD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to James Wood for FACS analysis, and to Karen Klein for
