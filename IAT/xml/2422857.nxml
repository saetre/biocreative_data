Two different models of Bcl-XL function have been proposed. In one, Bcl-XL binds to an activator, thereby preventing Bax activation. In the other, Bcl-XL binds directly to activated Bax. It has been difficult to sort out which interaction is important in cells, as all three proteins are present simultaneously. We examined the mechanism of Bax activation by tBid and its inhibition by Bcl-XL using full-length recombinant proteins and measuring permeabilization of liposomes and mitochondria in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-XL and Bax are functionally similar. Neither protein bound to membranes alone. However, the addition of tBid recruited molar excesses of either protein to membranes, indicating that tBid activates both pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-XL competes with Bax for the activation of soluble, monomeric Bax through interaction with membranes, tBid, or t-Bid-activated Bax, thereby inhibiting Bax binding to membranes, oligomerization, and membrane permeabilization. Experiments in which individual interactions were abolished by mutagenesis indicate that both Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid and Bcl-XL&#x02013;Bax binding contribute to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. By out-competing Bax for the interactions leading to membrane permeabilization, Bcl-XL ties up both tBid and Bax in nonproductive interactions and inhibits Bax binding to membranes.

In most cases, the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane is a key component of this commitment. The membrane permeablization step is both positively and negatively regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. One member of this protein family with only a BH3 region, such as tBid, activates another family member, Bax, causing it to form large complexes that generate membrane-spanning pores, hence making the membrane permeable. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-XL, are structurally similar to Bax but inhibit the membrane permeabilization process by an unknown mechanism. Two mutually exclusive models have been proposed to explain how the Bcl-2 family is operating: one states that Bcl-XL binds to tBid, thereby preventing Bax activation, while the second suggests that Bcl-XL binds directly to activated Bax. It has been difficult to sort out which interaction is important in cells, where multiple members of all three protein families are present simultaneously. Here, we describe an in vitro system containing the three recombinant proteins and the use of mutagenesis to selectively remove individual interactions.

Apoptosis may be initiated by a developmental program and by many diverse forms of cell stress. A critical feature of metazoan apoptosis is the permeabilization of intracellular organellar membranes that leads to the egress of intraorganellar components that activate the proteases responsible for cell death. Bcl-2 is the founding member of a family that includes members that either prevent (e.g., Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL) or promote (e.g., Bax or Bak) the membrane permeabilization that leads to apoptosis. Another large subgroup of the Bcl-2 family (BH3-only proteins; e.g., tBid) initiates apoptosis through binding to Bax and/or Bcl-XL. Even though Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar, experiments with protein fragments and peptides or full-length protein in the absence of membranes has led to the elaboration of models in which the functional relevance of binding partners for Bcl-XL differ. The direct activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; or hierarchical model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; states that Bcl-XL and other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit apoptosis primarily through interactions with a subclass of BH3-only proteins termed &#x0201c;activators&#x0201d;, preventing them from activating Bax and Bak. The indirect activation model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; proposes that the function of all BH3-only proteins is to displace the inhibitory Bcl-XL from inherently active Bax or Bak. Thus, these two models differ primarily in whether Bax/Bak is constituively active or requires activation and which interactions are crucial to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. However, there is also considerable overlap between these two competing models: both models recognize that Bcl-XL directly binds to and inhibits a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is directly involved in membrane permeabilization, while other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins indirectly induce apoptosis by binding to Bcl-XL and preventing this function. Moreover, some authors postulate that both models may be relevant in different cell types or in the same cell type under different circumstances (e.g., normal versus cancerous) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

On the basis of these data and evidence from the literature, we have proposed a model termed &#x0201c;embedded together&#x0201d;, in which interaction of these proteins with each other changes after binding to the membrane as this causes conformational changes that alter and/or expose new binding surfaces &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, a key feature for resolving differences in the components and mechanisms of physiologically relevant interactions between Bcl-2 family members is to examine these interactions in membranes.</p><p>To examine the molecular mechanism of membrane permeabilization for full-length Bcl-XL and Bax, we used recombinant proteins and measured permeabilization of both liposomes and mitochondrial outer membranes in vitro. Recombinant tBid was used as an activator protein. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-XL and Bax, despite having opposite effects on apoptosis, share many functionally similar features: in the absence of an activator, neither protein bound tightly to membranes, whereas the addition of membrane-bound tBid to Bax or Bcl-XL recruited a similar molar excess of the soluble protein to membranes. However, after binding to membranes, only Bax formed large oligomers and permeabilized the membrane. Bcl-XL competes with Bax for binding to both tBid and membrane-bound Bax as well as for binding to membranes. In all cases, interaction of Bax with Bcl-XL is nonproductive for membrane permeabilization, presumably because Bcl-XL does not oligomerize. Thus, we propose that Bcl-XL functions similarly to a dominant-negative Bax in tBid-initiated membrane permeabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To inhibit membrane permeabilization, Bcl-XL might inhibit any or all of the interactions of Bax and its activator with each other or with membranes. There are many potential activators of Bax, including but not limited to the BH3-only proteins Bid, Bim, and Puma as well as other non-Bcl-2 family proteins such as p53 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; and Bif-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. While studies using cells or animals in which specific components of the apoptotic pathway have been eliminated have contributed substantially to our understanding, it would be technically difficult if not impossible to create mouse stains with all of the relevant genes knocked out. Hence, precisely which step(s) in the process are inhibited by Bcl-XL as well as the molecular mechanism of inhibition can be best determined by using a cell-free system in which each step can be examined individually. To eliminate complications from all other known and unknown proteins, metabolites, and post-translational modifications that may contribute additional levels of regulation, we used a cell-free system composed of highly purified full-length recombinant proteins, without N- or C-terminal tags, and as a source of membranes either liposomes with mitochondria-like composition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; or subcellular fractions containing mitochondria.

Rather, Bcl-XL out-competed Bax for binding to both tBid and membranes. In these incubations, Bcl-XL may not bind Bax because they are not in the same compartment; Bcl-XL is almost completely membrane-bound while Bax is soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Therefore, the same experiment was performed using 20 nM Bcl-XL, a concentration at which Bcl-XL competes less efficiently with Bax for binding to tBid, allowing some Bax to become membrane-bound. Under these conditions, Bcl-XL marginally inhibited membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and coprecipitated with Bax in CHAPS buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel, lane 2). The addition of Bax also reduced the amount of tBid bound to Bcl-XL (compare lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that under conditions where Bcl-XL cannot fully out-compete Bax for access to tBid the presence of membrane-bound Bax provides a second target for binding by Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, step 5).</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that Bcl-XL and Bax compete for binding to tBid and that Bcl-XL prevents membrane permeabilization by forming stable heterodimers with the membrane-bound forms of both tBid and Bax.

A tBid mutant with substitution of two residues within the BH3 domain (M97A/D98A of murine Bid, denoted tBid-mt1) does not bind stably to Bcl-XL but binds to Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, tBid-mt1 allows the selective removal of the Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid interaction. Conversely, a mutation within the BH3 binding pocket of Bcl-XL (Y101K) prevents stable binding to Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. As expected, Bcl-XL Y101K bound tBid but did not bind to activated Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), even in the presence of NP-40 detergent. Therefore, using Bcl-XL Y101K allows the selective removal of Bcl-XL&#x02013;Bax binding. Combining these two mutants creates a situation where Bcl-XL does not bind stably to either tBid or Bax (unpublished data). As a negative control, we used Bcl-XL with a deletion of the BH4 domain (amino acids 4&#x02013;24) that has been reported to remove binding to both Bax and the BH3-only protein Bad &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In our assay, &#x00394;BH4 Bcl-XL did not coprecipitate tBid and bound very inefficiently to activated Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Addition of the Y101K point mutation to &#x00394;BH4 Bcl-XL to further remove Bax binding did not reduce this residual interaction (unpublished data), indicating that it is nonspecific. Therefore, these mutants behave similarly in live cells and in our cell-free system.</p><p>By assay of ANTS/DPX release from liposomes for different combinations of these proteins, the residual function of Bcl-XL can be measured in the absence of stable interaction with tBid, Bax, or both. The relative effects of each mutant were tested by examining the concentration-dependent inhibition of tBid/Bax-mediated liposome permeabilization by Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). When tBid was replaced by tBid-mt1, Bcl-XL continued to inhibit membrane permeabilization and bound Bax activated by tBid-mt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This indicates that a significant amount of Bcl-XL activity does not require Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid binding, as has been suggested previously by some &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; but not other models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Removal of the Bcl-XL&#x02013;Bax interaction by using Bcl-XL Y101K decreased the activity of Bcl-XL somewhat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), consistent with previously published results &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, the protein offered significant protection from tBid/Bax-induced dye release from liposomes. Thus, the loss of tBid or Bax binding to Bcl-XL can be compensated by the other binding interaction. The combination of tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K or &#x00394;BH4 Bcl-XL (situations in which Bcl-XL binds stably to neither tBid nor Bax) greatly reduced the activity of Bcl-XL but did not eliminate it completely. To address the possibility that this remaining activity was the result of residual Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid or Bcl-XL&#x02013;Bax interactions at elevated concentrations of Bcl-XL, we examined the effects of the tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K mutations on Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid and Bcl-XL&#x02013;Bax interactions by co-immonoprecipitation at Bcl-XL concentrations higher than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g002">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). To detect the interactions of Bcl-XL with tBid-mt1 as well as Bcl-XL Y101K with Bax required elevated concentrations of Bcl-XL and/or prolonged immunoblot exposures compared to the wild-type proteins, suggesting that these residual interactions either are nonspecific or contribute very little to the remaining antiapoptotic activity seen with the tBid-mt1/Bcl-XL Y101K combination. To test this possibility further, we combined the tBid-mt1/Bcl-XL Y101K and &#x00394;BH4 Bcl-XL mutations. This combination of mutations (tBid-mt1 with &#x00394;BH4 Bcl-XL Y101K) did not further diminish Bcl-XL function (unpublished data), suggesting that this remaining activity does not involve stable protein&#x02013;protein interactions. This residual function of Bcl-XL is addressed below.</p><p>The effects of these proteins also were assessed for the regulation of cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;D). By the use of <italic>bak</italic> &#x02013;/&#x02013; MLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), Bcl-XL inhibited tBid/Bax-induced membrane permeabilization in a dose-dependent manner, as was seen in liposomes. Substitution of tBid-mt1 or Bcl-XL Y101K for the respective wild-type proteins only slightly reduced the prevention of cytochrome c release by Bcl-XL. Using these two mutants together markedly reduced but did not eliminate the inhibition of cytochrome c release by Bcl-XL, similar to the residual activity noted with liposome permeabilization. When wild-type MLM that contained BAK were used, it was necessary to reduce the concentration of tBid 10-fold to 25 pM to prevent it from activating sufficient Bak to cause OMM permeabilization. At this concentration of tBid, cytochrome c release required the addition of Bax (unpublished data), and the activity of Bcl-XL was similar to that seen with <italic>bak</italic> &#x02013;/&#x02013; MLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In these incubations, substitution of the wild-type proteins with tBid-mt1, Bcl-XL Y101K, or both showed similar effects to those seen in <italic>bak</italic> &#x02013;/&#x02013; MLM and liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Thus, in contrast to widely promulgated models for the antiapoptotic mechanism of Bcl-XL, our results with purified proteins in the presence of relevant membrane targets indicate that Bcl-XL binding to Bax and tBid are both functionally relevant, but neither is paramount.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Membrane-Bound Bcl-XL Inhibits Bax Binding to Membranes Via Multiple Mechanisms</title><p>Although our results indicate that Bcl-XL inhibits tBid-mediated activation of Bax by sequestering tBid in a stable complex, it is unclear how Bcl-XL inhibits Bax binding to membranes. For example, Bcl-XL might inhibit Bax binding to membranes by preventing it from interacting with tBid. Alternatively or in addition, Bcl-XL might directly inhibit Bax binding to membranes. To determine the mechanism(s) involved, we measured Bax liposome binding by gel filtration chromatography for reactions containing the different mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).</p><p>The absence of a stable interaction between tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL significantly decreased Bcl-XL-mediated inhibition of Bax binding to membranes at all tBid concentrations assayed.

However, contrary to the prediction of some models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, Bcl-XL sequestering of tBid is only a contributing factor, as in the absence of tBid binding Bcl-XL still dramatically reduced Bax binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, compare lanes 5&#x02013;8).</p><p>It has been suggested that the multi-BH-region proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak autoactivate after tBid (or another BH3-only protein) initiates the process and that autoactivation is inhibited by Bcl-2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In our system, one consequence of Bax autoactivation would be recruitment of soluble Bax to membranes. Therefore, in the absence of Bcl-XL/tBid heterodimerization, Bcl-XL may inhibit recruitment of Bax by binding to membrane-bound Bax and inhibiting Bax autoactivation. To address this possibility, we substituted Bcl-XL with the Bax-binding-deficient Bcl-XL Y101K and assayed Bax binding to liposomes in the presence of tBid-mt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;12). In reactions containing Bcl-XL Y101K, significantly more Bax bound membranes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 for 100 nM Bcl-XL, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for 40 nM Bcl-XL, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.1 for 20 nM Bcl-XL), indicating that the interaction of Bcl-XL and Bax inhibits further Bax binding to membranes. To determine whether the Bcl-XL/Bax heterodimer also prevented the subsequent oligomerization of Bax, we examined oligomerization by cross-linking. In these experiments, the cross-linker was added to reactions containing an equal amount of membrane-bound Bax in the absence or presence of Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). In these reactions, membrane-bound Bcl-XL inhibited Bax oligomerization, as detected by cross-linking concomitant with inhibition of dye release from liposomes. Taken together, these results suggest that, when bound to Bcl-XL, Bax function is neutralized, both in recruitment of other Bax molecules through autoactivation and in oligomerization to permeabilize membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, step 6).</p><p>Similar to results obtained by examining liposome permeabilization, there is a residual activity of the tBid-mt1/Bcl-XL Y101K combination that prevented Bax binding to membranes even in the absence of a stable interaction of Bcl-XL Y101K with either tBid or Bax. This activity also was observed for a &#x00394;BH4 mutant of Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 13, 14).</p><p>At the onset of apoptosis in cells, Bcl-XL binds to membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The addition of tBid is sufficient to trigger Bcl-XL to bind to membranes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Because the membrane appears to be the active locus, we used the mutant versions of Bcl-XL and tBid to examine the importance of stable binding to tBid or Bax for Bcl-XL to bind tightly to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In a negative control experiment without other added proteins, less than 10 nM of the added Bcl-XL (100 nM) bound to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 1). Addition of Bax to the incubation did not increase membrane binding by Bcl-XL (lane 2). As noted above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), a substoichiometric amount of tBid (lane 3) caused &#x0223c;80 nM Bcl-XL to bind to membranes, suggesting that each tBid molecule recruited three to four Bcl-XL molecules. Membrane binding by Bcl-XL was reduced greatly when tBid was substituted by tBid-mt1, indicating that stable Bcl-XL&#x02013;tBid binding can recruit Bcl-XL (lane 5). However, the addition of Bax and tBid-mt1 (lane 6) caused the near complete recruitment of Bcl-XL (&#x0223c;85 nM membrane-bound). Under these conditions, the concentration of membrane-bound, activated Bax is only &#x0223c;15 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 8), yet the concentration of membrane-bound Bcl-XL increases by &#x0223c;60 nM above that seen with tBid-mt1, indicating that similar to tBid each activated Bax molecule recruits about four Bcl-XL molecules. Thus, like tBid, tBid-activated Bax recruits both soluble Bax and Bcl-XL. Surprisingly, when both soluble Bax and Bcl-XL are present, it appears that activated Bax recruits Bcl-XL more efficiently than it recruits Bax. Therefore, another way that Bcl-XL inhibits recruitment of Bax is by competing with it for activated Bax on the membrane.</p><p>The Bax-binding-deficient mutant Bcl-XL Y101K directly and efficiently binds liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;9). This is presumably due to the location of this mutated residue in the BH3 binding pocket suggested to house the C-terminal membrane anchor of soluble Bcl-XL based on structural similarity with Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; or to bind the C-terminal membrane anchor of an another Bcl-XL molecule as a cytoplasmic homodimer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In either case, spontaneous binding of Bcl-XL Y101K to membranes may be due to displacement of the C-terminal membrane anchor as a result of the Y101K mutation.</p><p>The functional importance of membrane binding by Bcl-XL is supported further by our observations that when Bcl-XL inhibits membrane permeability in assays containing tBid and Bax almost all of the Bcl-XL is membrane-bound and is in stoichiometric excess over membrane-bound tBid and Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g004">4</xref>B, black bars), even when using mutants that prevent heterodimerization with one or both of the binding partners. Consistent with a role for membrane binding, removing the C-terminal tail that mediates membrane binding impaired but did not abolish Bcl-XL function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), similar to the results obtained in cells using the same mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, removal of the C-terminal tail in the context of the tBid-mt1 and Bcl-XL Y101K mutations completely abolishes the remaining activity of Bcl-XL. It is possible therefore that the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL that is independent of stable interactions with tBid and Bax requires that Bcl-XL is membrane-bound. In that case, the excess Bcl-XL bound to membranes in the presence of tBid or activated Bax could contribute to this function of Bcl-XL (see below).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that Bcl-XL prevents recruitment of Bax to membranes by multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). These include: competition with Bax for binding to and thereby sequestering tBid, inhibition of Bax autoactivation by competing with soluble Bax for binding membrane-bound Bax, and an unidentified mechanism requiring membrane-bound Bcl-XL.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Membrane-Bound Bcl-XL Prevents a Membrane-Induced Reversible Bax Conformational Change</title><p>We hypothesized that the residual antiapoptotic function of membrane-bound Bcl-XL that does not require stable heterodimerization with tBid or Bax involves inhibiting the transient Bax conformational change that occurs when Bax interacts with the membrane surface and exposes an epitope bound by the 6A7 monoclonal antibody &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, under these conditions the soluble Bax does not undergo the liposome-induced conformation change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting that the presence of membrane-bound Bcl-XL either inhibits this conformational change or shifts the equilibrium of Bax molecules interconverting between the two forms sufficiently towards the 6A7-negative conformer that the antibody no longer has sufficient access to the epitope. As previously described, soluble Bcl-XL had little effect on the liposome-induced conformational change of Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, top panel) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, the spontaneous membrane binding Bcl-XL Y101K mutant inhibits this conformational change in Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, bottom panel).</p><p>To investigate further the effects of the membrane surface on Bax and the inhibition of these effects by Bcl-XL, cross-linking experiments using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were performed. Cross-linking of Bax into higher-order structures after Bax binds to membranes has been observed previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The incubation of Bax with liposomes alone does not cause sufficiently tight membrane binding by Bax to survive gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Nevertheless, incubation with liposomes did result in the cross-linking of Bax into higher-order complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, left panel). As expected from previous results &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, the interactions between Bax monomers induced by incubation with membranes were not resistant to detergent solubilization prior to cross-linking. The Bax&#x02013;Bax cross-links were reduced in the absence of liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>E), suggesting that, similar to binding by the 6A7 antibody, they result from a liposome-induced conformational change in Bax. Addition of tBid to Bax and liposomes resulted in a similar cross-linking pattern, but these Bax oligomers were resistant to solubilization of the membrane with detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, middle panel). Membrane-bound Bcl-XL not only prevented the formation of detergent-resistant Bax cross-links but also prevented the cross-linking of Bax that resulted when Bax contacted the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, right panel). These results further demonstrate that Bcl-XL in the membrane prevents or reverses the conformational change in soluble Bax that occurs upon exposure to a membrane surface.</p><p>To determine whether the effect of membrane-bound Bcl-XL on this transient, liposome-induced conformational change in Bax could be regulated, BH3 peptides were used to induce selectively Bcl-XL binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-se001">Text S1</xref>). On the basis of the effects previously published for mutations in BH3 domains of proapoptotic proteins and peptides, we selected two peptides that both caused membrane binding by Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A) but differed in their functional effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). One peptide, designated m1Bid BH3, containing a single mutation for a conserved and critical leucine residue, did not interfere with the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. The other peptide, Bak BH3, effectively eliminated the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-XL as assayed by liposome permeabilization assays. The effects of these peptides indicate that membrane-bound Bcl-XL can exist in both functional and nonfunctional states.</p><p>To determine whether the functional state of membrane-bound Bcl-XL affected the inhibition of the liposome-induced conformational change in Bax, the m1Bid BH3 and Bak BH3 peptides were used to trigger membrane binding by Bcl-XL in the presence of soluble Bax. In the absence of Bcl-XL, neither peptide induced Bax membrane binding or Bax-dependent membrane permeabilization (unpublished data). When the m1Bid BH3 peptide triggered Bcl-XL binding to membranes, the Bcl-XL still inhibited the liposome-induced Bax conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>F, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, when the Bak BH3 peptide was added, membrane-bound Bcl-XL did not prevent the liposome-induced Bax conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g005">Figure 5</xref>F, bottom panel, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, inhibition of the liposome-induced conformational change in soluble Bax by membrane-bound Bcl-XL correlates with the functional status of Bcl-XL on the membrane. Taken together, these results indicate that this activity is a regulatable function of membrane-bound Bcl-XL and is not merely the result of changes in the biophysical properties of liposomes after Bcl-XL binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, it has been a paradox that Bcl-XL and Bax have very similar structures, yet proposed models for their function all suggest that they behave very differently. Taken together, our results suggest that they actually function similarly to the extent that they compete with each other at most steps of the process but with the major difference being that Bcl-XL is defective for membrane permeabilization. Thus, for most functions Bcl-XL behaves in a manner conceptually similar to a dominant-negative Bax. Bcl-XL inhibited membrane binding by Bax by competing with soluble Bax for recruitment to membranes by either tBid or membrane-bound Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, similar to Bax, Bcl-XL binds to both activated, membrane-bound Bax and membrane-bound tBid. Furthermore, Bcl-XL binding to Bax inhibits the subsequent oligomerization of membrane-bound Bax. Our results with mutations that disable either of these interactions individually indicate that in membranes both are functionally important.</p><p>Pioneering experiments to identify relevant binding partners for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL using immunoprecipitation in transfected cells suggested a lack of correlation between Bax binding and inhibition of apoptosis, as only certain Bcl-XL point mutants that could no longer bind to Bax lost function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Further analysis of two of these Bcl-XL mutants that did not bind to Bax (the F131V/D133A mutant that remained functional and the inactive G138E/R139L/I140N mutant) suggested that prevention of apoptosis required binding to the BH3-only proteins tBid, Bim, and Bad, a function that was specifically lost in the latter mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as these experiments were conducted on whole cells where Bax was also present, it is possible that the lack of function of this mutant is caused by the loss of binding to both BH3-only proteins (e.g., tBid) and Bax , a result entirely consistent with our observations. Conversely, early work with the M97A/D98A Bid mutant that does not bind to Bcl-XL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; that we have used in our study (tBid mt1) indicated that Bcl-XL inhibited the apoptosis caused by this Bid mutant, in cells and in purified mitochondria, implying that the interaction with activated Bax rather than Bid was critical to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL in this context. Our model reconciles these disparate results by postulating that only after loss of both interactions does the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL become severely diminished. While Bcl-XL may inhibit OMM permeabilization initiated by the BH3-only proteins Bid, Bim, and Puma by sequestering these proteins, a variety of evidence now exists for alternate Bax activation pathways (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;) that do not rely on these BH3-only proteins. For many of these known and potentially unknown pathways, Bcl-XL may not directly sequester the initial activators of Bax, and hence inhibition of membrane permeabilization may rely on the sequestration of activated Bax to inhibit Bax autoactivation, oligomerization, and membrane permeabilization.</p><p>Our results clearly show that the major functional interactions of Bcl-XL occur after the protein has migrated to the membrane, a process initiated in our in vitro system by binding to either membrane-localized tBid or membrane-localized (activated) Bax. Membrane insertion of both tBid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; and Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; exposes the proapoptotic BH3 region of each protein, an event that is critical for interaction with Bcl-XL and likely initiates a conformational change in the antiapoptotic protein that is required for membrane insertion. Bcl-XL is found in both the cytoplasm as well as attached to (but not inserted into) the mitochondrial membrane in healthy cells.

Although a structure has not been reported for Bcl-XL containing the C-terminal insertion sequence, the structure of the truncated protein is sufficiently similar to that of Bcl-w &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; and proapoptotic Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; to suggest displacement of the insertion sequence of Bcl-XL as a mechanism that drives Bcl-XL into the membrane. In vitro binding assays using protein lacking the C-terminal insertion sequence have shown that Bcl-XL binds a variety of BH3 peptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. For several of the peptides, structural studies have confirmed that the peptides bind in the hydrophobic pocket that is also believed to bind the Bcl-XL insertion sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b047">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, it has been reported previously that overexpression of Bad caused the membrane insertion of Bcl-XL in HeLa cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore determined whether peptides from the BH3 regions of Bid, Bim, Bad, Bax, and Bak caused insertion of Bcl-XL into liposomes, assayed by flotation on a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). All five peptides caused Bcl-XL to insert into membranes, while a mutant Bid peptide that fails to bind Bcl-XL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; did not.</p><p>In cells, it is likely that other BH3-only proteins will substitute in many cases for tBid, and unlike Bid some of these proteins may not be required themselves to bind to membranes to expose the BH3 sequence. Nevertheless, whether initiated in the cytoplasm or at the surface of the membrane, interaction of Bcl-XL with a proapoptotic BH3 sequence is likely to be at least one of the factors that contributes to the insertion of Bcl-XL into membranes.</p><p>Previous reports using transfected cells have indicated that the removal of the C-terminal insertion sequence of Bcl-XL severely impairs membrane insertion but has varying effects on Bcl-XL function, from moderate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; to severe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d; reduction in function. Consistent with this variability, we have shown previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; that the function of &#x00394;TM Bcl-XL compared to that of wild type is heavily dependent on the stimulus used to initiate apoptosis (and therefore possibly the BH3 protein(s) involved). In our in vitro system, &#x00394;TM Bcl-XL showed a severe loss of function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060147-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) as the relevant interactions here occur on membranes. However, in certain circumstances in cells &#x00394;TM Bcl-XL may retain at least part of its antiapoptotic function in the cytoplasm depending on the location of relevant binding partners at the onset of apoptosis.</p><p>While we have focused our experiments on examining tBid and its interactions with Bax and Bcl-XL, our studies do not imply that tBid is an essential component of the membrane permeabilization process. Instead, we predict that various aspects of the functions of Bcl-XL and Bax revealed here can be triggered differentially by the different BH3 proteins that have been identified. Moreover, different BH3-only proteins would be expected to exhibit differences in the relative affinities for and activities on Bax and Bcl-XL, as we have described in our &#x0201c;embedded together&#x0201d; model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the previously reported binding affinities between BH3 peptides and other Bcl-2 family members are unlikely to accurately reflect binding affinities at the physiologically relevant locus of membranes. Clearly, it will be important to determine more appropriate quantitative estimates for the interactions of Bcl-2 family proteins in membranes.</p><p>Inhibition of the transient conformation change in Bax that occurs at the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060147-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) is the only step in which inhibition of Bax activation is not due to Bcl-XL functioning similar to a defective version of Bax. It is likely that the conformational change in Bax at the membrane surface enhances its activation by membrane-bound tBid. Consistent with this interpretation, tethering of the soluble Bid BH3 peptide to liposomes increased its potency by several orders of magnitude &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. It is not known how membrane-bound Bcl-XL prevents a transient change in the conformation of Bax. However, it is not unreasonable to speculate that it might do so by interacting transiently with Bax to shift the equilibrium in Bax conformers sufficiently toward the 6A7-negative conformation that the antibody does not have sufficient access to the epitope to bind it.</p><p>Our in vitro system recapitulates the core features of organelle permeabilization by activated Bax and its inhibition by Bcl-XL and has allowed us to identify and examine many of the individual steps. The liposomes that we used to model physiologic membranes have a high intrinsic curvature and lipid composition that facilitate membrane binding of the recombinant proteins and induction of the 6A7 conformational change in Bax. In cells, these feature are likely represented by complex and dynamic physiologic processes such as mitochondrial membrane fission and fusion shown to be important in apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b052">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; and the interaction of mitochondria with other membrane systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060147-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;.
