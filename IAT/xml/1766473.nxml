Understanding the interplay between GABAergic transmission and excitatory circuits in the amygdala is, therefore, critical for understanding the neurobiological basis of anxiety. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to demonstrate that GluR5-containing kainate receptors regulate local inhibitory circuits, modulate the excitatory transmission from the basolateral amygdala to the central amygdala, and control behavioral anxiety. Genetic deletion of GluR5 or local injection of a GluR5 antagonist into the basolateral amygdala increases anxiety-like behavior. Activation of GluR5 selectively depolarized inhibitory neurons, thereby increasing GABA release and contributing to tonic GABA current in the basolateral amygdala. The enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to reduced excitatory inputs in the central amygdala. Our results suggest that GluR5 is a key regulator of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala and highlight the potential use of GluR5-specific drugs in the treatment of pathological anxiety.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anxiety is thought to be a way of controlling an animal's response to threatening or potentially threatening stimuli, whereas excessive levels of anxiety, or pathological anxiety, cause distress and suffering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Sandford1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Rosen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, a role for GluR5 in anxiety, an emotional behavior related to amygdala function, has not been reported. In the present study, our results clearly demonstrate a role for GluR5 in anxiety. GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior in both the elevated plus maze and light/dark test. These changes are unlikely due to a reduction in general locomotion since performances in the open field and on the RotaRod were similar between knockout and wild-type mice. As further demonstrations of the role of GluR5 in anxiety, we found that wild-type mice displayed less anxious behavior when receiving ATPA whereas they showed more anxiety by local GluR5 antagonism in the BLA. We were not able to collect data after microinjection of ATPA into the amygdala due to the occurrence of side effects. These novel findings raise the possibility that GluR5 in the BLA may underlie the behavioral expression of anxiety. Although our microinjection results clearly showed that GluR5 in the BLA is involved in the expression of anxiety, we cannot exclude the possibility that other brain regions may also contribute to the increased anxiety phenotype in GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In addition, the evidence that EPM involves the amygdaloid complex is weak, despite that recent studies do show that amydala is important for the anxious behaviors. For example, intra-amygdala injection of different metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists decreased anxious behavior in the EPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Wieronska1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and anxiogenic drugs lead to an increase in immediate early gene expression within the amygdale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Singewald1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous reports show that GluR5 is expressed in the BLA where it participates in synaptic transmission, modulation and plasticity in young rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Li1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Braga1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study provides direct evidence for the important role of GluR5-containg KA receptors in inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, the current density of GluR5 activation was larger in interneurons as compared to pyramidal neurons. In agreement with these results we found that ATPA induced interneuronal depolarization and spiking behavior, in contrast to pyramidal neurons where ATPA triggers hyperpolarization. We also showed that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin blocked hyperpolarization in pyramidal neurons, but not the depolarization in interneurons. Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that: (1) GluR5 is predominant and highly functional in interneurons; activation of GluR5 in this cell type triggers neuronal firing and subsequent release of GABA; (2) Significantly less GluR5 activity (or expression) is found in pyramidal neurons as compared to levels in interneurons; (3) GluR5 activation in pyramidal neurons may be counteracted by the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, resulting from the bulk release of GABA from interneurons which were fired by GluR5 activation. Therefore, activation of GluR5 reduces the excitability of pyramidal cells in the BLA.</p><p>Our result showed that GluR5 is selectively acting on inhibitory but not excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA. Bidirectional modulation of GABA release by presynaptic GluR5 (measured by both mIPSCs and eIPSCs) was reported in the young rat BLA, in which different types of GluR5-containing KA receptors, with different agonist affinities, were proposed to mediate the biphasic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Braga1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results, using adult mice, suggest a different mechanism. We first showed that, ATPA did not affect the frequency or amplitude of mIPSCs. Three different concentrations of ATPA were tested and none of them had modulatory effects on mIPSCs, although highly visible impacts on sIPSCs were observed. Our results suggest that GluR5 may be located on somatodendrites rather than on presynaptic terminals. At present, no clear explanations exist for these differences. However, it may be possible that the age (young vs. adult animals) and the species used (mouse vs. rat) may contribute to these differences.</p><p>Two lines of evidence in the present study directly showed that GluR5 is endogenously activated. First, the frequency of sIPSCs and mIPSCs was significantly lower in GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. Second, the selective GluR5 antagonist, LY293558 reduced sIPSC frequency. Therefore, we believe that GluR5 is tonically activated by endogenous glutamate in the extracellular fluid. In addition to synaptic currents (phase current), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors also mediate a persistent tonic current, which reflects the activation of high-affinity GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by low ambient GABA concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Farrant1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, no report is available concerning the tonic inhibitory currents in amygdala neurons. This is the first study to report that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated tonic inhibition exists in pyramidal neurons in the amygdala of adult mice. Furthermore, we showed that this inhibition is under the tonic regulation of GluR5-containing KA receptors on BLA interneurons. Genetic deletion of GluR5 or pharmacological blockade of GluR5 could significantly reduce the tonic GABA current. Our results showed that TTX itself induced tonic GABA current in WT mice but significant smaller tonic current in GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, while subsequent application of bicuculline caused similar tonic current in both. These results suggest that the source of GABA for tonic GABA current partially involves the action potential-dependent GABA release, which may spill over to activate the extrasyanptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p><p>Tonic inhibition is thought to contribute to the control of neuronal excitability by reducing neuronal input-output functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000167-Farrant1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, we found a reduced input-output relationship of synaptic transmission from the BLA to the CeM in GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The increased synaptic efficacy observed at low, but not high, intensities of stimulation suggests that GluR5 finely modulates synaptic transmission by tonic inhibition. Local application of selective GluR5 antagonist, LY382884 in the BLA mimicked the phenoma found in GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that endogenous activation of GluR5 in the BLA may modulate the functional output to the CeM. Local application of ATPA (3 &#x000b5;M) in the BLA still decreased strong stimulation-induced eEPSCs recorded from the CeM (control, 81.2&#x000b1;12.1 pA; ATPA, 44.0&#x000b1;6.6 pA, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6, P&#x0003c;0.05). These results suggest that exogenous activation of GluR5 in the BLA has robust inhibitory effect while endogenous activation of GluR5 exert defined modulatory effect on projection from BLA to CeM. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the evoked responses may partially contain that from the passing fibers.</p><p>In summary, we report here that GluR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and the mechanisms for GluR5's role in anxiety may involve impaired GABA release, tonic inhibition, network excitability and the excitatory output from BLA to CeM. However, it should be noted that the anxiety phenotype detailed here was obtained in a global knockout for GluR5, which lacks regional specificity. It is therefore not possible to discount potential roles for GluR5 in other brain regions related to emotional behavior. Our results using local administration of a selective GluR5 antagonist to show the same increase in anxious behavior partially addresses this concern. However, further studies, using temporally and spatially selective gene targeting techniques, are needed to demonstrate the role of amygdalar GluR5 in anxiety in a region specific manner void of possible developmental compensations. Despite this limitation, our results clearly show that GluR5-containing KA receptors are involved in regulating anxious behavior and may serve as a target for novel anxiolytics in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River (6&#x02013;10 weeks old).

After a one-hour recovery period, slices were placed in a recording chamber on the stage of an Axioskop 2FS microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with infrared DIC optics for patch clamp recordings. Postsynaptic currents were recorded with an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Stimulations were delivered using a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode locally placed in the BLA. Electric square-wave voltage pulse (200 &#x000b5;s, 4&#x02013;14 V) was generated using a Grass S88 stimulator (Grass instrument Co., Quincy, MA) attached to a Grass SIU5D isolator unit.

A representative interneuron is shown in the inset (scale bar, 20 &#x000b5;M). When injected with current steps that ranged from &#x02212;100 pA to 100 pA within 400 ms, interneurons showed fast spiking properties (top trace). In the same neuron, bath application of ATPA (3 &#x000b5;M) induced neuronal depolarization and firing of the interneuron (lower trace).

In the same neuron, bath-application of ATPA (3 &#x000b5;M) induced hyperpolarization and reduced the neuronal firing (lower trace). Resting membrane potential for this neuron was &#x02212;66.6 mV and the holding current was 66.9 pA.
