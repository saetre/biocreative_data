Although CD4 and CD8 single positive (SP) T cells are the two major T cell subsets in the periphery of wild type mice, the repertoire of mice bearing loss-of-function mutation in either Fas (lpr mice) or Fas ligand (gld mice) is predominated by CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double negative &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells that also express B220 and generally referred to as B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cells. Despite extensive analysis, the basis of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cell lymphoproliferation remains poorly understood.

The high proliferation rate is restricted to B220&#x0002b;DN T cells found in the gut epithelium whereas the high apoptosis rate occurred both in the gut epithelium and periphery. However, only in the periphery, apoptosis of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cell is Fas-dependent. When the Fas pathway is genetically impaired, apoptosis of peripheral B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cells was reduced to a baseline level similar to that of SP T cells. Under these conditions of normalized apoptosis, B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cells progressively accumulate in the periphery, eventually resulting in B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN T cell lymphoproliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The Fas pathway plays a critical role in regulating the tissue distribution of DN T cells through targeting and elimination of DN T cells from the periphery in the steady state.

Both proliferation and apoptosis of DN T cells in the gut epithelium were regulated by Fas-independent mechanisms. Consequently, impairment of the Fas pathway had minimal impact on the overall homeostasis of DN T cells in the gut epithelium. By contrast, DN T cells in the periphery were cycling at comparable rate as SP T cells but were dying at a very high rate and hence remained a negligible component of the peripheral T cell repertoire. The Fas pathway played a non-redundant role in the apoptosis of peripheral DN T cells. Consequently, impairment of the Fas pathway reduced apoptosis of peripheral DN T cells to a baseline level similar to that of SP T cells. Under these conditions of normalized apoptosis, Sdc1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells progressively accumulated in the periphery resulting in what is referred to as B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell lymphoproliferation. Thus, it appears that DN T cells are directly targeted and removed by Fas-mediated apoptosis from the periphery and that in the absence of this regulatory mechanism, homeostasis and tissue distribution of DN T cells become dysregulated. These results provide new insights into pathogenesis of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell lymphoproliferation.</p><p>The current prevailing view is that B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell lymphoproliferation is caused by SP T cells that failed to undergo apoptosis and persisted as B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells after upregulation of B220 and downregulating their coreceptors to dampen autoreactivity. While we cannot formally rule out some conversion of SP into B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells, the microarray analysis indicates that the transcript profile of gld DN T cells is complex and with significant qualitative difference from the transcript profile of gld SP T cells <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003465-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Therefore, if B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells were derived from SP T cells they must have undergone complex differentiation process that extended beyond simple loss of the coreceptor and upregulation of B220. Furthermore, while the absolute numbers of both SP and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells progressively increased in the periphery of gld mice, accumulation of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells occurred at a rate that significantly exceeded that of SP T cells eventually resulting in predomination of the repertoire by B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells.

Thus, many SP T cells that accumulate in mutant mice did so without losing their coreceptors.</p><p>Mathematically, it would be impossible for conversion of SP into B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells to account for B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell lymphoproliferation unless newly generated B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells were proliferating at higher rate or dying at lower rate than SP T cells in mutant mice. However, these were not the cases, as the cycling rate of SP and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells in the periphery of gld mice were not significantly different. Furthermore, there were no survival advantages for B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells over SP T cells in the periphery of gld mice. In fact B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells chances of surviving in gld mice were not better than those of CD8 T cells and worse than those of CD4 T cells <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003465-g006"><bold>Fig. 6E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Hence, the increase in the frequency of DN T cells occurred despite a parallel increase in the absolute number of SP T cells and hence was not at the expense of SP T cells. In the light of the new data presented in this study, we propose the alternative hypothesis that autoimmune SP and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells are independently regulated by Fas-mediated apoptosis and thus there is parallel but independent accumulation of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN and SP T cells in the periphery of mice with impaired Fas pathway. However, accumulation of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells occurs at a rate that significantly exceeds that of SP T cells eventually resulting in predomination of the repertoire by B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells.</p><p>This study raises several important questions: Why DN T cells are directly targeted and eliminated from the periphery of wt mice by Fas-mediated apoptosis in the steady state. There may be a customized/specific role for DN T cells in regulating immune responses in the gut epithelium but not the periphery and hence their presence in the periphery is undesirable. Consistent with this view, B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell accumulation in the peripheral lymphoid organs is associated with systemic autoimmunity in mice with certain genetic backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-Cohen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and in children with ALPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-vanderWerffTenBosch1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-Rao1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it leads to severe lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly that occasionally require surgical intervention in ALPS patients to relieve organ compression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-Teachey1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. If B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells were not immediate progeny of SP T cells, what is their source? The definitive source of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells that accumulate in the periphery is currently unknown and beyond the scope of this study. However, it will be important in the future to determine whether peripheral B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells had previously resided in the gut epithelium or came directly from the thymus. The former possibility is supported by our data and by previous studies showing existence of lpr-like B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cells in the appendix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-Yamagiwa1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and genital tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003465-Johansson1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> of wild type mice. New experimental systems are required to approach this issue, <italic>however</italic>.</p><p>In summary, this study shows that DN T cells are proliferating and dying at exceptionally high rates than SP T cells in the steady state in wild type mice. The high proliferation rate is restricted to DN T cells found in the gut epithelium whereas the high apoptosis rate occurred both in the gut epithelium and peripheral lymphoid tissues of wild type mice. However, only in the periphery that DN T cell apoptosis is Fas-dependent. The high sensitivity of DN T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis in the periphery appears to be an important factor in regulating their tissue distribution and homeostasis. These results have important implications for understanding pathogenesis of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN T cell lymphoproliferation that occurs in mice and children with genetically impaired Fas pathway. Future studies should investigate mechanisms underlying rapid proliferation of DN T cells in the gut epithelium and how their presence in the periphery influences peripheral tolerance and autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>C3H mice carrying homozygous loss-of-function gld and lpr mutations of FasL and Fas, respectively, C3H and NOD wild type mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.
