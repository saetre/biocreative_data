For apical progenitors, the orientation of the cleavage plane relative to their apical-basal axis is thought to be of critical importance for the fate of the daughter cells. For basal progenitors, the relationship between cell polarity, cleavage plane orientation and the fate of daughter cells is unknown. Here, we have investigated these issues at the very onset of cortical neurogenesis. To directly observe the generation of neurons from apical and basal progenitors, we established a novel transgenic mouse line in which membrane GFP is expressed from the beta-III-tubulin promoter, an early pan-neuronal marker, and crossed this line with a previously described knock-in line in which nuclear GFP is expressed from the Tis21 promoter, a pan-neurogenic progenitor marker. Mitotic Tis21-positive basal progenitors nearly always divided symmetrically, generating two neurons, but, in contrast to symmetrically dividing apical progenitors, lacked apical-basal polarity and showed a nearly randomized cleavage plane orientation. Moreover, the appearance of beta-III-tubulin&#x02013;driven GFP fluorescence in basal progenitor-derived neurons, in contrast to that in apical progenitor-derived neurons, was so rapid that it suggested the initiation of the neuronal phenotype already in the progenitor. Our observations imply that (i) the loss of apical-basal polarity restricts neuronal progenitors to the symmetric mode of cell division, and that (ii) basal progenitors initiate the expression of neuronal phenotype already before mitosis, in contrast to apical progenitors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The stem and progenitor cells that generate the neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (here collectively referred to as neural progenitors) build up a polarized tissue, the wall of the neural tube, whose inner side faces the lumen of the neural tube and whose outer side contacts the basal lamina. Initially in neural development, this wall consists of neuroepithelial cells, the primary neural progenitors, which form the pseudostratified neuroepithelium. With the onset and progression of neurogenesis, additional neural progenitors appear, and the neural tube wall adopts a multi-cell-layer architecture. Divisions of neural progenitors are confined to the innermost cell layer, the ventricular zone (VZ), and to the adjacent, telencephalon-specific, subventricular zone (SVZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Smart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kriegstein1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Neural progenitors in the developing cerebral cortex can be classified into two principal groups depending on whether they undergo mitosis at the apical or basal side of the VZ.

In addition to APs, previous work has established the existence neuronal progenitors that divide in the basal region of the VZ and in the SVZ; these progenitors have been called intermediate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kriegstein1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Noctor1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, basal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Haubensak1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> or SVZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Miyata1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> progenitors and will collectively be referred to as basal progenitors (BPs) here. Aside from the site of mitosis, APs and BPs can be distinguished by the expression of distinct transcription factors, i.e. Pax6 and Tbr2, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Englund1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A hallmark of APs, their apical-basal polarity, exists not only in interphase but is retained through mitosis. Specifically, mitotic APs exhibit distinct apical and basolateral plasma membrane and cortical domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kosodo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Costa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and retain a basal process contacting the basal lamina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Miyata2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Fishell1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> (Y. Kosodo, K. Toida, V. Dubreuil, J. Schenk, E. Kiyokage, A. A., F. Mora-Bermudez, T. Arii and W. B. H., unpublished observations). This apical-basal polarity is thought to be of critical importance for the mode of division of APs, which can be either symmetric, with both daughter cells exhibiting the same fate, or asymmetric, with the daughters exhibiting different fates. On symmetric division, the cleavage plane is oriented parallel to the apical-basal cell axis and hence cell fate determinants with a polarized distribution in mitotic APs are equally distributed to the daughters, whereas on asymmetric division, this distribution is unequal because the cleavage plane orientation deviates from the apical-basal axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kosodo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Fish1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, APs, in particular in the telencephalon, are highly elongated cells, and hence their apical domain is relatively small as compared to their basolateral domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kosodo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Huttner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the molecular machinery controlling mitotic spindle positioning and cleavage furrow ingression operates with remarkable precision in order to ensure cleavage parallel to the apical-basal cell axis, and down-regulation of this machinery is thought to result in asymmetric division by default <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Fish1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Compared to APs, the mode of cell division of BPs is more restricted, with essentially all divisions being symmetric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Noctor1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Miyata1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. BPs arise from divisions of polarized APs and concomitant with, or following, the translocation of their cell body to the basal VZ or SVZ retract their apical process prior to mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Miyata1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, given their origin and the symmetric mode of their cell division, a crucial question arises. Do mitotic BPs, despite this retraction, retain apical-basal polarity, as is the case for other delaminated mitotic progenitors, notably the paradigmatic Drosophila neuroblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Wodarz1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>? Or have mitotic BPs, in contrast to other delaminated mitotic progenitors, lost apical-basal polarity?</p><p>Previously reported immunostainings for apical polarity markers have shown their concentration at the ventricular side of the VZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Cappello1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Costa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-AakuSaraste1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Manabe1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it should be stressed that these immunostainings are dominated by APs in interphase and allow no conclusion as to the question whether or not mitotic BPs, which at the onset of neurogenesis are a minor subpopulation relative to APs, have lost apical-basal polarity. Rather, answering this question requires that the analysis of mitotic BPs for the absence or presence of polarity markers is performed under conditions in which the entire shape of the dividing cell is revealed, which as far as we are aware has not been done.</p><p>Divisions of neural progenitors can generate either other progenitors, i.e. cells that re-enter the cell cycle, or neurons, i.e. post-mitotic cells. Cell cycle re-entry can be initiated rapidly after completion of cytokinesis, but this should not occur if a daughter cell is to become a neuron. A key question in neurogenesis therefore is when after progenitor division a neuronal phenotype, which is revealed by the appearance of a molecular marker specific of newborn neurons and indicative of a post-mitotic state, becomes apparent in the daughter cells. Moreover, it is unknown whether the time course of appearance of a neuronal phenotype is a stereotypical process, or differs between neurons arising from asymmetric <italic>versus</italic> symmetric divisions, or from APs <italic>versus</italic> BPs.</p><p>In the present study, we have used a novel approach that allowed us to address these two related questions at the very onset of neurogenesis. Most of the studies addressing the fate of APs and BPs by time-lapse imaging have been carried out at later stages of neurogenesis, due to the technical difficulties of examining these progenitors at the very onset of neurogenesis. Here, we explore the fate of AP and BP daughters at a developmental stage at which APs are still a relatively homogeneous population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Mizutani1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and neuroepithelial rather than radial glial in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kriegstein2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and BPs begin to appear.

We investigated this issue on live imaging that yielded three-dimensional information of progenitor cell division, exploiting the fact that, as a result of nuclear envelope break-down during prophase, <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP diffuses into the cytoplasm, which in turn reveals the ingression of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This, together with the initial position of the reforming nascent daughter cell nuclei in telophase, revealed by re-entry of <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP into the nucleus, allowed the determination of cleavage plane orientation. We arbitrarily defined four groups of cleavage plane orientation relative to the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002388-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002388-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002388.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Cleavage plane orientation in apical and basal progenitors.</title><p>Slice cultures prepared from dorsal telencephalon of E10.5-E12.5 <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP/<italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP double transgenic mouse embryos were analyzed by two-photon video microscopy for the cleavage plane orientation of mitotic APs and BPs.

It is important to emphasize that the present two-photon microscopy set-up performs best with GFP. We therefore used also GFP for the <italic>Tubb3</italic> transgenic line, but targeted it to a subcellular location distinct from <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP, i.e. the Golgi complex/plasma membrane (<italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP), to be able to discern progenitor-expressed and neuron-expressed GFP. This allowed us to obtain dual information with one fluorescent protein, and to directly (i.e. without the need of post-imaging identification) observe &#x02013; as far as we are aware, for the first time &#x02013; a progenitor cell generate a neuron.</p><p>With the present approach of using the same fluorescent protein in two distinct subcellular locations, we could, on live imaging, readily distinguish (i) cells showing only nuclear fluorescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002388-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s008">Movie S3</xref>), (ii) cells showing both nuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002388-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s006">Movie S1</xref>), and (iii) cells lacking nuclear but showing plasma membrane (and Golgi) fluorescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s004">Fig. S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s010">Movie S5</xref>).

In fact, the majority of BP daughters (86&#x00025;) behaved like neurons, either showing <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence (33&#x00025;) or entering the neuronal layer (53&#x00025;) and, when the cell could be tracked (25&#x00025;), remaining in it. However, we cannot exclude that some of the <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive BP-derived daughters for which we were unable to observe <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression underwent cell division, i.e. were progenitors rather than neurons. In addition, we did observe a small proportion (14&#x00025;) of daughter cells that remained in the VZ for longer (&#x0003e;100 min) than the mean VZ residence time of those daughters that entered the neuronal layer. Given that also these daughters originated from <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive BPs, they may be neurons which migrate more slowly into the neuronal layer and whose phenotype takes longer to develop. In this context, it should be noted that the present approach of identifying neurons by the appearance of <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence does not allow any conclusion as to the specific neuronal subtype.</p><p>The speed with which <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence became detectable in the newborn neurons after completion of BP mitosis (on average 45 min) is remarkable. In fact, <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence was seen to appear in neurites as early as 12 min after mitosis. Appearance of <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP in neurites comprises its transcription, translation, folding to a fluorescent state, membrane insertion and intracellular transport. As it is unlikely that all these steps can occur in a period as short as 12 min, our observations imply that, in the case of BP-derived neurons, the expression of the neuronal phenotype is initiated, at least in some cases, already in the progenitor, for example by inducing neuron-specific genes before mitosis. The previously observed presence of beta-III-tubulin immunoreactivity in some non-surface dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Ishii1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> is consistent with this scenario. In this context, the almost three-fold slower appearance of <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence in AP-derived than BP-derived neurons presumably reflected a slower onset of transcription of the mGFP mRNA rather than less efficient translation or slower protein maturation. The initiation of the neuronal phenotype already in BPs would be compatible with their lack of cell polarity (in contrast to APs), as will be discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Neurogenic as well as non-neurogenic basal progenitors lack apical-basal polarity during mitosis</title><p>Apical-basal polarity, notably (i) the maintenance at the apical-most end of the lateral plasma membrane of adherens junctions containing ZO-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Rasin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-AakuSaraste1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, (ii) the concentration of the par3/6/aPKC complex at the apical cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Costa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Manabe1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, (iii) the presence of an apical plasma membrane bearing a primary cilium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Weigmann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Dubreuil1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Chenn2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, and (iv) a cleavage plane parallel to the apical-basal cell axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Gtz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kosodo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Fish1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Huttner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Chenn1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Huttner2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Konno1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, are thought to be prerequisites for AP daughters to remain APs and re-enter the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Costa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

In APs, the orientation of the cleavage plane parallel to their apical-basal axis acts in concert with the polarized subcellular localization of cell fate determinants along this axis, thereby ensuring their equal distribution to the daughter cells on symmetric division, and a small deviation of the cleavage plane from this orientation suffices for asymmetric division to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Kosodo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Fish1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Huttner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. BPs, in contrast, are fundamentally different in this regard, because they divide symmetrically irrespective of cleavage plane orientation.

For the same reason, such lack of cell polarity would also allow the initiation of the neuronal phenotype already in the progenitor, before the ensuing symmetric cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>In the dorsal telencephalon, <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive apical progenitors generate not only neurons but also basal progenitors</title><p>An unexpected finding of the present study was that on time-lapse imaging of the dorsal telencephalon of the double transgenic embryos at the very onset of neurogenesis, surprisingly few (3 of 79) of the <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive APs generated daughter cells showing detectable <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP fluorescence, although tracking was performed on average for almost 5 hours (282 min) and in the longest case for &#x02248;13 hours, i.e. the length of a full cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Calegari1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, when there was detectable <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression, it occurred within &#x02248;2 hours after birth of the AP daughter, i.e. well within the average tracking time. Thus, the lack of detectable <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression in the vast majority of AP daughters even several hours after their birth is puzzling. Of course, on the one hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the few <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP&#x02013;positive AP daughters constituted a minor, specific neuronal subpopulation, and that the typical time course of appearance of a neuronal phenotype (as revealed by <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression) in AP daughters takes longer than could be visualized with the present imaging approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> for the reasons that prevented tracking for longer periods). On the other hand, one may wonder why <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression was not detectable even in those AP daughters that left the VZ after 5.5 hours (i.e. the average VZ exit time) and in those that could be tracked within the VZ for at least this length of time. If one assumes that upon tracking for longer than 5.5 hours, <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expression should have become detectable if <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive AP daughters were neurons, alternative possibilities as to the fate of these cells should be considered.</p><p>Tis21 expression is an established marker of neurogenic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Haubensak1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Iacopetti1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

This, however, does not necessarily mean that the only type of progeny derived from <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;expressing APs are neurons. For example, a possibility is that Tis21 expression already occurs in the AP cell cycle preceding the first neurogenic AP cell cycle. However, two considerations render this possibility unlikely. First, if both, (i) <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive but not yet neurogenic APs that generate <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive neurogenic APs, and (ii) <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive APs that generate neurons, would co-exist at similar abundance at E10.5, one would still expect a greater proportion of the <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive apical divisions to generate <italic>Tubb3</italic>-mGFP expressing cells than was actually observed. Second, the time of onset of Tis21 mRNA and protein as well as <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP expression on the one hand, and of the appearance of the first neurons on the other hand, is so similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Haubensak1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Iacopetti1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> that it seems incompatible with a scenario in which <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP appearance precedes the appearance of neurons by two cell cycles (about 24 h at the onset of neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002388-Calegari1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>This leaves us with the most probable explanation that, at the onset of neurogenesis in the dorsal telencephalon of rodents, <italic>Tis21</italic>-nucGFP&#x02013;positive APs comprise at least two subpopulations, one that generates neurons, and another that generates cells that are committed to the neuronal lineage but are not yet neurons, i.e. BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002388-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>).

Slice cultures prepared from dorsal telencephalon of E10.5 (A) and E11.5 (B) Tis21-nucGFP/Tubb3-mGFP double transgenic mouse embryos were analyzed by two-photon video microscopy. (A) Basally-directed relocation of the Golgi complex concomitant with neurite outgrowth but preceding neuronal migration. Open arrows indicate a neuron, identified by Tubb3-mGFP expression, which no longer shows Tis21-nucGFP fluorescence. The cell body resides in the ventricular zone (0&#x02013;130 min), with bright perinuclear fluorescence in the Golgi complex area (triangles), and grows a process in the basal direction (130&#x02013;140 min, arrowheads), which branches transiently (180 min). The Golgi complex relocates towards the direction of neuronal migration (230&#x02013;280 min), prior to migration of the soma towards the neuronal layer (250&#x02013;370 min). See Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s010">Movie 5</xref>. Occasionally, we observed neurons changing the direction of migration, in which case the Golgi complex became positioned towards the future direction of migration before its onset (data not shown). (B) Transient apical neuronal growth cone in the ventricular zone. Fifty-eight cases of neurites growing in the VZ, in the majority of cases with the neuronal cell body migrating within the VZ, were observed. In the example shown, two neurons extend Tubb3-mGFP-positive neurites from the neuronal layer towards the ventricular surface (0&#x02013;150 min, arrowheads). In half of the 16 cases studied, the neurites reached the apical side of the VZ, and their tips assumed a flattened shape parallel to it. This morphology persisted for up to 90 min (160&#x02013;250 min, triangles), then the neurite assumed its previous shape and retracted (270 min). The soma of one of the neurons migrates towards the apical surface (230&#x02013;250 min, open arrows), while growing another process in the basal direction (230&#x02013;250 min, open triangles), which becomes the leading process as the neuron migrates towards the neuronal layer (250&#x02013;330 min). Both neurons eventually retract their apical neurites (270&#x02013;330 min). See Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002388.s011">Movie 6</xref>.
