Using ER&#x003b1; as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a novel ER&#x003b1;-interacting protein, ZNF366, which is a potent corepressor of ER&#x003b1; activity. The interaction between ZNF366 and ER&#x003b1; has been confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and is mediated by the zinc finger domains of the two proteins. Further, we show that ZNF366 acts as a corepressor by interacting with other known ER&#x003b1; corepressors, namely RIP140 and CtBP, to inhibit expression of estrogen-responsive genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, our results indicate that ZNF366 may play an important role in regulating the expression of genes in response to estrogen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Estrogens play diverse roles in the body, most notably in the development and maintenance of the female and the male, reproductive systems and secondary sexual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Estrogens also play a central role in promoting breast cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), as well as being implicated in uterine and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), and are also implicated in the physiology of the brain, bone and the cardiovascular system, as evidenced by the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis engendered by the decline in estrogen levels during menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>Estrogen action is mediated by two highly related estrogen receptors (ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;), which are members of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). NRs are characterized by a DNA binding domain (DBD), comprised of two zinc fingers, which mediate receptor dimerization and binding to specific response elements in the promoters of target genes. Binding of the ligand to the ligand binding domain (LBD), located C-terminal to the DBD, results in a conformational change in the LBD and activation of the intrinsic transcription activation function AF2, which facilitates the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Transcription activation requires cooperation of AF2 with a region N-terminal to the DBD that encodes transcription activation function AF1, which is often, as in the case of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, regulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>The liganded estrogen receptors regulate gene expression by direct binding to DNA at estrogen response elements in target genes, resulting in the recruitment of diverse transcriptional coregulators, including the SWI&#x02013;SNF complexes that remodel chromatin to alter nucleosomal organization in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the p160 family of coactivators (SRC1/NCo-A1, TIF-2/GRIP1 and AIB1/pCIP/ACTR/RAC3/TRAM1) and TRAP/DRIP complexes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The p160 coactivators facilitate the recruitment of other proteins, including CBP, its homologue p300 and p/CAF, which possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, as well as histone methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1 that methylate arginine residues in histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The thyroid receptor&#x02013;associated protein (TRAP) complex, similar to or identical with the vitamin D3 receptor&#x02013;interacting protein (DRIP) complex, which is also similar in many respects to the Mediator complex acts to bridge RNA polymerase II with basal transcription factors and transcription activators. These and other coregulators are recruited to gene promoters in a sequential/ordered manner, resulting in cycles of chromatin remodelling and modification that facilitate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>The ER&#x003b1; LBD is composed of 12 &#x003b1;-helices packed in three layers, with a central hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Helix 12, together with helices 3, 4 and 5, form a coactivator-binding groove. Most coactivators recruited by agonist-bound ER&#x003b1; contain LXXLL motifs, which form a two-turn amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix that fits into the coactivator-binding groove in the ER&#x003b1; LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In addition to the well-characterized recruitment of coactivators to the LBD/AF2, coactivator interaction with AF1 of estrogen receptors has also been described, the interaction being influenced by the phosphorylation status of the receptor in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>When unliganded, some DNA-bound NR recruit the corepressors NCoR and SMRT and associated protein complexes implicated in transcriptional repression and histone deacetylation, these complexes being dissociated upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). NCoR/SMRT bind to NR through CoRNR boxes, LXXI/HIXXXL/I motifs, that form a more extended &#x003b1;-helix than the LXXLL motifs, with helix 12 in the LBD being displaced from the conformation it occupies in the agonist-bound LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). NCoR/SMRT is also recruited by antagonist-bound ER&#x003b1; to inhibit gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>In addition to stimulating gene expression, estrogen-bound ER represses the expression of many genes. Indeed, gene profiling studies show that the down-regulation of gene expression is a significant feature of the response to estrogen in the ER&#x003b1;-positive, estrogen-responsive MCF7 breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). This is likely to involve transcriptional corepressors, such as LCoR and RIP140, which can be recruited to the agonist-bound ER&#x003b1; via LXXLL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Repression by LCoR and RIP140 occurs through HDAC-dependent and -independent mechanisms and involves the recruitment of HDACs and the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) corepressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). CtBP, originally identified based on its interaction with the C-terminal end of adenovirus E1A via the sequence PLDLS, is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes and plays a critical role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Other transcription factors also interact with CtBP1, and the highly related CtBP2, through PXDLS motifs. Although, the mechanisms by which CtBP acts as a corepressor have not been fully defined, a recent study has identified CtBP complexes that contain HDACs and histone lysine methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>The ER&#x003b1; DBD participates in the recruitment of transcriptional co-regulator proteins. These include the coactivator XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), which modulates ER&#x003b1; signalling both in the absence and presence of estrogen, the signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and the corepressor TAF-Ib that has been shown to decrease ER&#x003b1; acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Here, we report that ZNF366, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein, interacts with the ER&#x003b1; DBD. We also show that ZNF366 represses ER&#x003b1; activity through association with RIP140, CtBP and histone deacetylases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The mammalian expression plasmids and reporter genes have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>).

Screening of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> transformants yielded 24 positive clones. One of these encoded the C-terminal portion of ZNF366, described previously based on gene prediction of genomic DNA sequence of human chromosome 5q13.2. Human ESTs were identified using the NCBI site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/"/>) by carrying out a BLAST search against the database of human ESTs, using sequences derived from the yeast 2-hybrid clone. The exact intron/exon structure of ZNF366 was established by complete DNA sequencing of overlapping EST IMAGE clones with GenBank accession nos BI523869, 5201353, BI770486 and BE552137 to generate an mRNA sequence encoding a predicted polypeptide of 744 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), encoded within 5 exons. Based on the homology with the Fugu fZF1 gene, this was subsequently confirmed by Gilligan <italic>et al</italic>.

Regions N- and C-terminal to the zinc fingers were also well conserved, albeit less so than the zinc finger region. Together, the high degree of sequence conservation indicates that the identified vertebrate genes represent orthologues of human ZNF366. Support for this idea is provided by additional homology searches, which indicated that the human gene most closely related to ZNF366 is ZNF710, also encoding an 11 zinc finger protein, the zinc finger regions of human ZNF366 and ZNF710 showing amino acid sequence identity of 78%, considerably lower than the identity between human and the putative ZNF366 homologue in chicken or <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Moreover, no significant homology was detectable between human ZNF366 and ZNF710 outside the zinc finger region. All other human genes demonstrating homology to human ZNF366 displayed amino acid sequence identities no better than 39%, when the zinc finger region of ZNF366 was used in the BLAST searching. Together with the previous report demonstrating, based on very high (88%) amino acid sequence homology in the zinc finger region, as well as conservation of the chromosome location of human ZNF366 and the Fugu fZF1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), these analyses indicate that ZNF366 is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution.</p><p>Northern blotting of human tissue RNAs demonstrated that ZNF366 is broadly expressed at varying levels in human adult tissues, with highest expression in heart, placenta, muscle and spleen, with possible alternative splice forms in the liver and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of ZNF366 with ER-&#x003b1;</title><p>To further confirm interaction between ER&#x003b1; and ZNF366, whole cell lysates were prepared from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with ER&#x003b1; and FLAG-tagged ZNF366, in the presence of E2.

However, for full-length ER&#x003b1;, productive interaction, as assayed by growth in the absence of uracil, was ligand-dependent, requiring the addition of estrogen (17&#x003b2;-estradiol; E2) or an anti-estrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT).</p><p>In order to confirm the ligand requirement for the interaction between ER&#x003b1; and/or ZNF366 in mammalian cells, COS-1 cells were transfected with ER&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x00394;NLS, which is excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). ZNF366-FLAG was exclusively localized to the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), whilst ER&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x00394;NLS was always cytoplasmic in the presence of E2, or in the presence of the anti-estrogens OHT or ICI 182, 780 (ICI), as well as in the absence of ligand, when expressed alone (data not shown).

These data further demonstrate that ER&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x00394;NLS and ZNF366 interact <italic>in vivo</italic> and in agreement with the yeast 2-hybrid data, show that the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction requires estrogen agonist or antagonist binding by ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>In contrast, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays showed that ER&#x003b1; bound to GST-ZNF366 in the absence of ligand, as well as in the presence of E2 or anti-estrogens, although the interaction appeared to be greater in the presence of E2 and ICI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which may suggest that the interaction between ER&#x003b1; and ZNF366 <italic>in vivo</italic> is regulated by other factors (see Discussion). ER&#x003b1; can be phosphorylated at serine 118 within AF1, and substitution of this residue by alanine significantly reduces ER&#x003b1; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Substitution of leucine-539 and leucine-540 in the LBD also dramatically reduces ER&#x003b1; activity, by preventing coactivator recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Substitution of serine 118 or of leucine-539/540 did not inhibit ZNF366 interaction with ER&#x003b1;, suggesting that AF1 and the LBD/AF2 may not be involved in the interaction of ZNF366 with ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>GST pulldowns were performed to delineate the regions of ER&#x003b1; and ZNF366 required for their interaction. ER&#x003b1; deletion mutants lacking AF1 (ER&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x00394;AF1) or the LBD (ER&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x00394;LBD) interacted with ZNF366, as did the isolated ER&#x003b1; DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the interaction with the LBD was weak, suggesting that the ER&#x003b1; DBD is required for interaction with ZNF366. GST fusion proteins encoding the N- and C-terminal regions of ZNF366, ZNF366(9&#x02013;251) and ZNF366(558&#x02013;744) respectively, did not interact with ER&#x003b1;, indicating that the zinc finger region is required for the interaction. Interestingly, this assay suggests that the interaction requires independent binding to several zinc fingers, since ZNF366(9&#x02013;452) and ZNF366(455&#x02013;744), which do not overlap, both interacted with ER&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>ZNF366 is a corepressor for ER&#x003b1;</title><p>In reporter gene assays, co-transfection with increasing amounts of ZNF366 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ER&#x003b1; activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

A trans-repression assay was employed to see whether ZNF366 is a repressor and encodes autonomous repression domain(s). For this, a luciferase reporter gene under the control of LexA and Gal4 binding sites upstream of an E1A TATA box was used. As expected, LexA-VP16 stimulated reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with this activity being reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the Gal4 DBD fused to the NR corepressors RIP140 (Gal4-RIP140), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). ZNF366 similarly repressed reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, confirmative of its activity as a transcriptional repressor.</p><p>In order to address the potential activity of ZNF366 on ER&#x003b1;-regulated gene expression, we looked for human cell lines in which the genes were co-expressed (data not shown). The PE04 ovarian cancer cell line was found to express both ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Transfection with siRNA for ZNF366 resulted in down-regulation of ZNF366 expression and concomitant increase in the expression of the estrogen-responsive GREB1 and TERT genes, indicating that ZNF366 is involved in the regulation of estrogen-responsive gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ZNF366 interacts with CtBP <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Since ZNF366 can repress ligand-stimulated ER&#x003b1; activity, we wondered whether it interacts with other corepressors that are known to associate with ER&#x003b1; in a ligand-dependent manner. Amongst these is RIP140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), which acts by recruiting HDACs and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In GST pulldown assays, ZNF366 interacted with RIP140 1&#x02013;415 and 753&#x02013;1158 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which encode repression domains RD1 and RD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). This interaction appeared to require the C-terminal-most zinc fingers 8&#x02013;11 of ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, ZNF366 also interacted with CtBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the interaction apparently requiring sequences C-terminal to the zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Many proteins interact with CtBP through sequence motifs having the consensus sequence PXDLS, with a lysine residue two amino acids C-terminal to the serine also often being present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Two such motifs, 590-PFDLS(QK)-596 and 645-PEDLS(TK)-651 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are located within the region of ZNF366 required for interaction with CtBP. Mutation of the CtBP motifs by substituting the proline (P) and aspartic acid (D) residues by alanines, prevented interaction between ZNF366 and CtBP in GST pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Mutation of M1 or the M2 motif reduced the interaction between ZNF366 and CtBP1. In these assays, the N-terminal CtBP motif (M1) appeared to be more important than the C-terminal motif (M2).</p><p>In the trans-repression assay, mutation of the N-terminal-most CtBP binding motif in ZNF366 (M1) partially relieved the repression of LexA-VP16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), whereas mutation of the second motif (M2) did not significantly relieve the repression and mutation of both motifs almost completely abolished the repression by ZNF366. These findings show that the interaction between ZNF366 and CtBP is important for the repression activity of ZNF366, the interaction being mediated by two CtBP-interaction motifs, with both motifs being required for the interaction with CtBP, although motif M1 may be more important than M2 for the interaction.</p><p>Whole cell lysates prepared from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with CtBP1 and FLAG-tagged ZNF366 immunoprecipitated using a CtBP antibody resulted in co-IP of FLAG-ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In the reciprocal experiment, CtBP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). CtBP1 was not co-immunoprecipitated with ZNF366 in which the CtBP binding motifs were mutated. Collectively these data demonstrate that ZNF366 interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with CtBP1, the interaction being mediated by two CtBP binding motifs. In agreement with these findings substitution of the CtBP motifs in ZNF366 significantly reduced the repression of ER&#x003b1; activity by ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Gene repression by transcriptional corepressors, including RIP140 and CtBP, frequently requires HDAC recruitment and histone deacetylation. The HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) relieved the repression of ER&#x003b1; activity by ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), whilst GST pulldowns showed that ZNF366 interacts with HDACs 1, 3 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that transcriptional repression by ZNF366 is mediated, at least in part through histone deacetylation.</p></sec><sec><title>ZNF366 represses the expression of estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells</title><p>The majority of breast cancers express ER&#x003b1;, and the growth of ER&#x003b1;-positive breast tumours is stimulated by estrogen, as evidenced by the utility of anti-estrogens and inhibitors of estrogen biosynthesis in breast cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The MCF7 breast cancer cell line expresses ER&#x003b1; and grows in response to estrogen, its growth being inhibited by anti-estrogens. Further, MCF7 cells demonstrate estrogen-stimulated expression of a number of well-characterized estrogen-responsive genes, including cathepsin D and pS2. In order to evaluate the effect of ZNF366 on ER&#x003b1;-regulation of these genomically encoded estrogen-responsive genes, MCF7 cells were transfected with ZNF366. This resulted in a marked reduction in expression of both cathepsin D and pS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). MCF7 cell growth was also reduced following ZNF366 transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), whilst growth of an ER&#x003b1;-negative breast cancer cell line that is not estrogen-responsive, was not inhibited by ZNF366 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Zinc finger proteins constitute a very large family of transcriptional regulators and can be further subdivided into groupings based on the type of zinc finger present, as well as by the presence of additional motifs elsewhere in the protein that mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions and transcriptional regulation. Sequence analysis of ZNF366 shows that it encodes encodes a protein containing 11 Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers, which is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution. However, ZNF366 does not belong to any of the major subfamilies of the Kruppel zinc finger family and shows most significant amino acid sequence similarity to one other Kruppel zinc finger protein, ZNF710, of unknown function, where the homology is restricted to the Kruppel zinc finger region. However, several other Kruppel-type zinc finger proteins act as transcriptional repressors, including ZNF217, a putative oncogene that is amplified and overexpressed in breast and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), and copurifies with a CtBP corepressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Further, the Bcl11 Kruppel zinc finger gene, which is translocated in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, acts as a corepressor for the COUP-TF NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>).</p><p>Although we did not investigate the potential of ZNF366 to bind DNA, alter reporter gene activities in yeast or in mammalian cells in the absence of ER&#x003b1; (see Results and Supplementary Figure 1A). Further, ZNF366 did not bind to estrogen response elements in gelshift assays (Supplementary Figure 1B). Recruitment of ER&#x003b1; to the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene promoter was also not inhibited by ZNF366 expression in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). Collectively, these findings indicate that the repression of estrogen-responsive reporter genes by ZNF366 does not involve inhibition of DNA binding by ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>ZNF366 appears to be recruited to estrogen-responsive genes through interaction of the zinc finger region of ZNF366 with the zinc finger region (DBD) of ER&#x003b1;. Whilst the zinc finger region was required for ZNF366 interaction with ER&#x003b1;, the exact sequence requirements for the interaction with ER&#x003b1; were not established, although non-overlapping regions of ZNF366, encoding zinc fingers 1&#x02013;7 or 8&#x02013;11 were sufficient for the interaction. Whilst the interaction of ZNF366 and ER&#x003b1; did not require ligand for <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, the interaction was apparently better in the presence of estrogen. Further, <italic>in vivo</italic> assays demonstrated a requirement for estrogen or anti-estrogen binding for the interaction between ZNF366 and ER&#x003b1;. The <italic>in vivo</italic> requirement for ligand binding may be influenced by post-translational modifications. Additionally, steroid receptors, including ER&#x003b1;, are complexed in the unliganded state, with the Hsp90 chaperone complex, required for appropriate folding of steroid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). The Hsp90-steroid receptor also likely interferes with steroid receptor interaction with some proteins. Ligand binding results in a conformational change in steroid receptors and Hsp90 dissociation. This could explain the estrogen and anti-estrogen regulation of ZNF366 recruitment by ER&#x003b1;.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, ZNF366 also interacted with other steroid receptors (ER&#x003b2;, androgen and glucocorticoid receptors), as well as the non-steroid retinoic acid, retinoid X and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (data not shown). In all cases the ZNF366 zinc finger region mediated the interaction, with no interaction being detected for the region C-terminal to the zinc finger region (558&#x02013;744 amino acids), with the exception of retinoid X receptor-&#x003b1; (RXR&#x003b1;). In this case, ligand-stimulated interaction of RXR&#x003b1; with 558&#x02013;744 amino acids was observed, indicating that the interaction between ZNF366 and RXR&#x003b1; is mechanistically distinct from the interaction of ZNF366 with other NRs, perhaps requiring the potential LXXLL motif located near the C-terminus of ZNF366.</p><p>ZNF366 inhibited ligand-dependent transactivation by ER&#x003b1; in a dose-dependent manner and functioned as a repressor when tethered to DNA by the GAL4 DBD. Its interaction with the ER&#x003b1; DBD suggests that the observed repression is not due simply to prevention of coactivator recruitment, nor does ZNF366 inhibit DNA binding by ER&#x003b1; (data not shown). Rather, ZNF366 appears to recruit multiple factors that act to repress transcription. Hence, the HDAC inhibitor SAHA partially relieved the repression of ER&#x003b1; by ZNF366 and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays showed that ZNF366 interacts with Class I HDACs 1 and 3, as well as the Class II HDAC6, indicating that the corepressor activity of ZNF366 is, at least in part, HDAC-dependent.</p><p>Several different corepressor complexes that are associated with NRs have been identified, most notably N-CoR&#x02013;SMRT complexes that include HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). These are usually recruited to unliganded or antagonist-bound NRs, such as the tamoxifen-bound ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). RIP140 is unusual in being a corepressor that is recruited by agonist-bound NRs. The repressive activity of RIP140 is achieved by the recruitment of class I HDACs and CtBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). CtBP1 and the related protein CtBP2 are potent corepressors that are present in protein complexes containing HDACs and histone lysine methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), and its corepressor activity is mediated through HDAC-dependent and&#x02014;independent mechanisms, the HDAC-independent mechanisms likely involving PcG complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). ZNF366 interacted with RIP140, the interaction requiring 455&#x02013;558 amino acids of ZNF366, which encode zinc fingers 7&#x02013;11. ZNF366 also interacted with CtBP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the interaction being mediated by two PXDLS CtBP-interaction motifs located C-terminal to the zinc fingers in ZNF366. Mutation of the CtBP-interacting motifs prevented the interaction of ZNF366 and CtBP1 and relieved repression of ER&#x003b1; activity by ZNF366, confirming the importance of CtBP recruitment for the corepressor activity of ZNF366. However, the mutant ZNF366 still significantly repressed ER&#x003b1; activity, likely due to the fact that it directly interacts with HDACs and with RIP140.</p><p>These studies suggest that ZNF366 acts as a corepressor for ER&#x003b1;. In agreement with these findings, transfection of ZNF366 into the estrogen-responsive and ER&#x003b1;-positive MCF7 breast cancer cell line, which does not express ZNF366 (data not shown), reduced expression of genomically encoded ER&#x003b1;-regulated genes. Moreover, expression of ZNF366 inhibited MCF7 cell growth in response to estrogen, whereas ZNF366 expression did not inhibit growth of the ER&#x003b1;-negative, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line that is not estrogen-responsive. Finally, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of ZNF366 in the ER&#x003b1;-positive PE04 ovarian cell line, stimulated expression of the estrogen-regulated GREB1 and TERT genes, further evidence for the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of ZNF366 as a corepressor for ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel ER&#x003b1;-interacting protein ZNF366, which represses ligand-dependent ER&#x003b1; transactivation by recruitment of multiple factors, to regulate the expression of estrogen-responsive genes. ZNF366 is widely expressed in adult tissues and our preliminary findings of interaction between ZNF366 and many other NRs suggest that ZNF366 may have a widespread role as a NR corepressor, in addition to its action as an ER&#x003b1; corepressor, as defined in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_21_6126__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_34_21_6126__nar-01734-w-2006-File009.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_34_21_6126__nar-01734-w-2006-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Drs P.
