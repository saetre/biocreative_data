The survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma was under 20% before 1970. The introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, establishment of guidelines for adequate surgical margins, and development of post-excision reconstruction raised the five-year survival rate to 60&#x02013;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These advances overshadowed the pioneering adjuvant immunotherapy trials using autologous tumor vaccines for patients with osteosarcoma, despite their having some therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma has reached a plateau in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which has reignited interest in immunotherapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We previously identified papillomavirus-binding factor (PBF) as a novel osteosarcoma antigen, using an osteosarcoma cell line and an autologous CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) clone restricted by HLA-B*5502 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PBF is a DNA-binding transcription factor and a regulator of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PBF protein is expressed in 92% of osteosarcomas. Moreover, PBF-positive sarcomas have a significantly worse prognosis than PBF-negative sarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Development of PBF-based immunotherapy requires identification of naturally presented CTL epitopes in osteosarcoma cells in the context of common HLA molecules such as HLA-A2 and HLA-A24. The present study was designed to determine HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes from PBF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved under institutional guidelines for the use of human subjects in research.

Peptide-pulsed PBMC were seeded at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/200 &#x003bc;l/well into round-bottom 96-microwell plates in AIM-V with 10%HS, IL-2 (20 U/ml; a kind gift from Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka Japan) and IL-7 (10 ng/ml; R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), and incubated. On day 7, half of the medium was replaced with fresh AIM-V containing IL-2, IL-7 and the same peptides. The cell cultures were maintained by adding fresh AIM-V containing IL-2.

CD8<sup>- </sup>cells were pulsed with the PBF A2.2 peptide for 60 min. Half of the CD8<sup>- </sup>cells were cryopreserved at -80&#x000b0;C for the second stimulation. CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells (1.0&#x02013;2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>/well) and irradiated PBF A2.2 peptide-pulsed CD8<sup>- </sup>cells (1&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>/well) were cocultured in 48-well cell culture plates in 500 &#x003bc;l of AIM-V with 10%HS, IL-2 and IL-7. On day 7, the second stimulation was performed by adding irradiated peptide-pulsed CD8<sup>- </sup>cells to each culture well in 500 &#x003bc;l of AIM-V with 10%HS, IL-2 and IL-7. On days 13&#x02013;23, they were subjected to tetramer-based frequency analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Tetramer-based frequency analysis</title><p>An FITC-conjugated HLA-A*0201/HIV tetramer (here termed the control tetramer) and a PE-conjugated HLA-A*0201/PBF A2.2 tetramer (A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer) were constructed by Medical &#x00026; Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). PBMCs from patients were stimulated with the PBF A2.2 peptide by using the LD/MLPC procedure as described above. From each microwell containing 200 &#x003bc;l of the microculture pool, 100 &#x003bc;l was transferred to a V-bottom microwell and washed. To the spin-down pellets, the control tetramer and A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer (10 nM in 25 &#x003bc;l of PBS) were added in combination and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then a PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA) was added (dilution of 1:30 in 25 &#x003bc;l of PBS containing the control tetramer and A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer) and incubated for another 15 min. The cells were washed in PBS twice, fixed with 0.5% formaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California, USA). CD8<sup>+ </sup>living cells were gated and the cells labeled with the A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer were referred to as tetramer-positive cells. Tetramer-positive cells in each well are theoretically derived from a single CTL precursor, regardless of the number (percentage) of tetramer-positive cells. Accordingly, the number of tetramer-positive wells represents the number of CTL precursors. The frequency of anti-PBF A2.2 CTLs was evaluated using the following calculation: (number of tetramer-positive wells)/[(total number of tested wells) &#x000d7; (initial number of CD8+ cells per well)].</p></sec><sec><title>Development of CTL line and CTL clones</title><p>Attempts to establish CTL clones were made by a limiting dilution procedure and subsequent single-cell sorting procedures.</p><p>In the limiting dilution procedure, cells from a tetramer-positive T cell pool derived from Patient 4 were replated into a 96-well round-bottom microplate at one cell per well.

On day 7, 100 &#x003bc;l of AIM-V containing 10% HS and IL-2 was added. On day 14, all proliferated cells were collected, washed and replaced with fresh AIM-V containing 10% HS and IL-2, followed by maintenance in a 48-well microplate at 0.5&#x02013;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per well.

The peptide PBF A2.2 was recognized by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in three of five HLA-A*0201-positive patients with osteosarcoma and induced an oligoclonal CTL line and five CTL clones from these CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. The CTL line, CTL 5A9, and five CTL clones all exhibited specific cytotoxic activity against PBF A2.2-pulsed T2 cells and allogeneic osteosarcoma cell lines expressing both HLA-A*0201 and PBF. In addition, CTL 5A9 lysed autologous osteosarcoma cells derived from fresh biopsy specimens. These findings indicated that PBF A2.2 served as a CTL epitope on osteosarcoma cells in the context of HLA-A*0201.</p><p>Interestingly, CTL 5A9 and the five CTL clones lysed an allogeneic osteosarcoma cell line (KIKU) that expressed PBF and HLA-A*0206, but not HLA-A*0201. This suggested that the peptide PBF A2.2 might also be presented on osteosarcoma cells in the context of HLA-A*0206, as seen for other tumor-associated antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Alternatively, CTL 5A9 and the five CTL clones might cross-react with an allogeneic antigen presented by HLA-A*0206, B*4006, or -Cw*0802, that was not shared by OS2000 and HOS, on KIKU cells. To determine these possibilities, cytotoxicity assays with other target cells that express both PBF and HLA-A*0206 will be required. Thus far, the proof of immunogenicity of PBF has been limited to an HLA-B55-positive patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and HLA-A24-positive patients with osteosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our findings in the present study extend the application of PBF-targeting immunotherapy towards patients with HLA-A*0201 and potentially those with HLA-A*0206.</p><p>The frequency of the PBF A2.2-specific CTL precursors ranged from 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>in patients with osteosarcoma. On the other hand, the frequency of the PBF A2.2-specific CTL precursors in healthy donors ranged from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>and 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7</sup>. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the frequency of PBF A24.2-specific CTL precursors was between 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>and 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>. In melanoma patients, the MAGE3.A1-specific CTL precursor frequency was less than 10<sup>-7 </sup>in normal individuals and non-vaccinated patients as determined by the LD/MLPC/tetramer procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Notably the frequency of MAGE3.A1-specific CTL precursors rose to 10<sup>-6 </sup>following vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore the significance of measuring the frequency of peptide-reactive CTL precursors is to determine the baseline frequency in non-vaccinated patients for forthcoming clinical vaccination trials.</p><p>The frequency of CTL precursors is generally under the detection limit of the standard tetramer analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] so the LD/MLPC/tetramer procedure was developed. The presence of false-positive wells is a concern in the LD/MLPC/tetramer procedure. To reduce this, we double-stained cells with A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer-PE and control tetramer-FITC (this detects cells that nonspecifically bind tetramers). In tetramer-positive wells, percentages of tetramer-positive cells varied from 0.03% to 0.39% in the present study. The variation of the percentages of tetramer-positive cells conceptually reflects the differing proliferation activities of a single CTL precursors seeded in each well, but does not affect calculation of the frequency of CTL precursors. Therefore, it is critical in the LD/MLPC/tetramer procedure to detect cells that react with the A2/PBF A2.2 tetramer despite the quite low percentages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates the immunogenicity of peptide PBF A2.2 in HLA-A*0201-positive patients with osteosarcoma. The PBF A2.2 peptide is a novel antigenic peptide naturally presented on osteosarcoma cells in the context of HLA-A*0201 and, potentially, HLA-A*0206. This extends the availability of PBF-derived therapeutic peptide vaccines for patients with osteosarcoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TT designed the study, carried out most experiments and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>SK made a substantial contribution to critical reading.
