They all appear to be functional U1 genes since they are accurately transcribed into full length, capped snRNAs upon injection into Xenopus oocytes. A mouse pseudogene that is not transcribed in Xenopus oocytes was also isolated from the mouse genomic library. DNA sequence analysis of the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the functional genes revealed the presence of three highly conserved sequence elements that have been shown to be required for transcription initiation or 3' end formation in other U1 genes. Each of these U1 RNA genes also contains non-conserved sequences in the 5' flanking region that could function in their controlled expression during development.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0270-a" xlink:role="9814"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0272-a" xlink:role="9816"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0267.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9811"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0268.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9812"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9813"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0270.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9814"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9820"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9821"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9822"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9823"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9824"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00293-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9825"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
