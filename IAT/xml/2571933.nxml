Repair pathways process these mismatches to produce point mutations in the Ig variable region or double-stranded DNA breaks in the switch region DNA. However, AID can also produce off-target DNA damage, including mutations in oncogenes. Therefore, stringent regulation of AID is required for maintaining genomic stability during maturation of the antibody response. It has been proposed that AID phosphorylation at serine 38 (S38) regulates its activity, but this has not been tested in vivo. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and immunochemical approaches, we found that in addition to S38, AID is also phosphorylated at position threonine 140 (T140). Mutation of either S38 or T140 to alanine does not impact catalytic activity, but interferes with class switching and somatic hypermutation in vivo. This effect is particularly pronounced in haploinsufficient mice where AID levels are limited. Although S38 is equally important for both processes, T140 phosphorylation preferentially affects somatic mutation, suggesting that posttranslational modification might contribute to the choice between hypermutation and class switching.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; CSR, class switch recombination; GC, germinal center; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; s38, serine 38; SHM, somatic hypermutation; ss, single-stranded; T140, threonine 140.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The immune system produces a diverse array of antibodies by a series of DNA transactions that require programmed DNA damage. <italic>Ig</italic> transcription units are assembled by random joining of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments by a site-specific recombination reaction mediated by RAG1 and RAG2 proteins in developing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Later, during immune responses, antigen-specific clones of B cells are selectively expanded in structures called germinal centers (GCs), where they undergo Ig somatic mutation and class switch recombination (CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces nontemplate nucleotide substitutions into the <italic>Ig</italic> variable gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), which can alter the binding affinity of the antibody molecule. If the affinity is enhanced, the resulting B cell clone is selectively expanded, ultimately resulting in affinity maturation of the antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). CSR is a region-specific deletional recombination reaction that replaces one antibody-constant region for another, thereby altering antibody effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Class switching does not involve the variable regions, and therefore switched antibodies retain their antigenic specificity. Although somatic mutation and class switching are fundamentally different DNA transactions, they are initiated in the nucleus by the same enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), which introduces uracil:guanine mismatches in transcribed single-stranded (ss) <italic>Ig</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its effects on <italic>Igs</italic>, AID produces off-target DNA damage, including point mutations in oncogenes such as <italic>bcl6</italic> or <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and it also induces double-stranded DNA breaks in <italic>Igs</italic> that serve as substrates for chromosome translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). DNA damage by AID is minimized in part because AID expression is restricted to activated B cells within GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) by a requirement for PAX5 and E47 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>AID levels are limiting for CSR and hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), and they are known to be regulated by microRNA-155, which controls the half-life of AID mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In addition, the concentration of AID in the nucleus is limited by a combination of active export and selective nuclear degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Finally, biochemical and tissue culture experiments indicate that a fraction of AID is posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation of serine 38 (S38) and that this modification may also regulate AID activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>S38 is thought to be a target of c-AMP&#x02013;dependent protein kinase A (PKA) because S38 is part of a PKA consensus site and can be phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that AID is physically associated with PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In biochemical assays phosphorylation at S38 is essential for AID to associate with replication protein A (RPA), a single stranded DNA binding protein, and the interaction is required for AID to access actively transcribed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Consistent with this observation, AID phosphorylated at S38 is enriched in chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Although the role of S38 phosphorylation has not been tested in vivo, mutating S38 to alanine (AID<sup>S38A</sup>) results in catalytically intact AID, which may have an altered substrate preference in biochemical assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Expression of AID<sup>S38A</sup> has also been reported to variably decrease CSR assayed in AID-deficient B cells in vitro (10&#x02013;80% of wild type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) and SHM and gene conversion in chicken DT40 B cells (15% of wild type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Further confounding the question of the function of S38 phosphorylation is the fact that zebrafish AID lacks a serine at this position, yet retains activity in CSR and gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report on a novel site of AID phosphorylation at threonine 140 (T140) and examine the impact of S38 and T140 phosphorylation on CSR and SHM in vivo.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>To examine posttranslational modification of AID, we purified the protein from B cells cultured with LPS and IL-4 and subjected the material to mass spectrometry.

Anti-p140 was reactive with AID purified from B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4, but was not reactive with AID-T140A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The level of anti-p140 reactivity in cultured B cells differed depending on the stimulus with the highest levels found with CpG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, phosphorylation at AID-T140 was not B cell specific and could also be detected in NIH-3T3 NTZ cells expressing AID (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Finally, anti-p140 did not react with recombinant AID produced in bacteria, but was reactive with AID phosphorylated in vitro with protein kinase C (PKC) catalytic subunit and not PKA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The PKC family is composed of at least 10 serine/threonine kinases, and anti-p140 and -p38 was reactive to varying degrees with recombinant AID after in vitro phosphorylation with the different isoforms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). We conclude that AID is phosphorylated at position T140 and that this site of posttranslational modification resembles S38 in that it is not B cell specific.</p><p>To determine whether T140 is essential for catalytic activity, we compared wild-type and AID-T140A for their ability to revert an inactivating point mutation in a kanamycin resistance encoding plasmid in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).

We found that AID-S38A was normally phosphorylated at position T140 and, conversely, that AID-T140A was normally phosphorylated at S38. We conclude that the two sites of phosphorylation are not interdependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><p>AID is phosphorylated in 3T3 fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and mutates indicator substrates when it is expressed in these cells. Mutator activity can be measured by reversion of a green fluorescent protein indicator containing a premature stop codon (NIH-3T3 NTZ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>]). When assayed by FACS or sequencing, AID-S38A and -T140A showed &#x0003c;15 and &#x0003c;50% of wild-type levels, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). We conclude that T140 is required for normal levels of mutation in NIH-3T3 NTZ cells in vitro.</p><p>AID can be assayed for its ability to induce CSR in B cells in vitro by retroviral complementation of AID-deficient B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Because AID expression levels may impact on the results of the assay, we used two retroviral vectors that directed different levels of AID expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). B cell retroviral infection with PMX-AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) or MK-AID, which contains a mutant Kozak sequence, results in AID levels that are 10- or 2.5-fold higher than physiological levels, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Consistent with the high levels of AID expression, B cells infected with PMX-AID switched to IgG1 at higher efficiency than cells infected with MK-AID (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and H</xref>). AID mutants showed varying degrees of activity in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and H</xref>). High levels of AID-T140A expression reconstituted nearly 95% of control levels of class switching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). In contrast, lower levels of AID-T140A expression resulted in 50% of control levels of switching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>). As previously reported, AID-S38A mutants varied in activity depending on expression levels ranging from nearly undetectable to 60% of control levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, G and I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). High-level expression of the double mutant, AID-ST/AA, resulted in a modest drop in class switching compared with AID-S38A, 35 versus 55% of control levels of switching, respectively, which is consistent with an additive effect of the two mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). We conclude that phosphorylation of S38 and T140 are important for class switching in LPS- and IL-4&#x02013;stimulated B cells. Furthermore, higher levels of AID expression drive higher levels of switching to IgG1 and diminish the requirement for S38 or T140 phosphorylation. Therefore, the precise contribution of these posttranslational modifications to AID function is difficult to evaluate in this assay.</p><p>To determine if AID protein levels are a rate-limiting factor in CSR, we augmented AID levels in wild-type LPS- and IL-4&#x02013;stimulated B cells with retrovirally expressed AID and measured isotype switching to IgG1. Compared with wild type alone or wild type transduced with empty PMX retrovirus, cells supplemented with AID from the PMX-AID retrovirus displayed a &#x0003e;40% increase in isotype switching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref>). We conclude that AID levels are rate limiting and that superphysiological levels can drive higher rates of isotype switching.</p><p>To examine the physiological function of AID phosphorylation at positions S38 and T140, we produced mice that carry S38A or T140A mutations in <italic>AID</italic>, AID<sup>S38A</sup>, and AID<sup>T140A</sup>, respectively (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081319/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081319/DC1</ext-link>). AID<sup>S38A</sup> and AID<sup>T140A</sup> mutant B cells developed normally (not depicted) and were assayed for CSR to IgG1 after stimulation with LPS and IL-4 in culture. Cell division was monitored by labeling cells with CFSE and tracking dye dilution by flow cytometry. AID protein levels expressed by wild-type, AID<sup>S38A</sup>, and AID<sup>T140A</sup> B cells were indistinguishable when measured by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and heterozygous AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>, AID<sup>S38A/&#x02212;</sup>, and AID<sup>T140A/&#x02212;</sup> expressed half as much AID as their homozygous counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). AID<sup>S38A</sup> and AID<sup>T140A</sup> B cells divided normally in response to LPS and IL-4, but were impaired in switch recombination to IgG1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). AID<sup>S38A</sup> mutant B cells showed 32% the level of CSR to IgG1 of wild-type controls, whereas AID<sup>T140</sup> produced a milder defect resulting in 87% of wild-type CSR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). In both cases, the defect was exacerbated in haploinsufficient mice. Although AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells displayed IgG1 switching, 80% of wild-type B cells, AID<sup>S38A/&#x02212;</sup>, and AID<sup>T140A/&#x02212;</sup> showed 4 and 45% the level of wild-type B cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). This relative decrease was consistent within each experiment, despite overall switching rates varying from experiment to experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). We also measured mutation within the region 5&#x02032; of the S&#x003bc; switch repeats. Similar to CSR, AID<sup>S38A</sup> and AID<sup>T140A</sup> had mutation rates of 25 and 85%, respectively, compared with WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Because different stimulation conditions may result in differential levels of AID phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), we measured isotype switching to IgG3. After stimulation with LPS or LPS and anti-dextran in culture, AID<sup>S38A</sup> B cells showed 19 or 16% the level of CSR to IgG3 of wild-type controls, whereas AID<sup>T140A</sup> produced a milder defect resulting in 71 or 52% wild-type CSR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

In this study, we observe larger GCs in AID-haploinsufficient mice together with further enlargement in AID<sup>S38A/&#x02212;</sup> mice, indicating that the GC phenotype is directly related to the level of AID activity. AID activity might impact GC size by a variety of mechanisms, including antibody gene or generalized genomic damage. For example, increased AID activity could result in higher rates of detrimental antibody gene mutation, leading to loss of affinity, loss of expression, or development of self-reactive antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Conversely, higher rates of off-target genomic damage by AID may lead to mutations that result in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Irrespective of the mechanism, the magnitude of the effect of AID levels on GC size emphasizes the importance of AID regulation in vivo.</p><p>Phosphorylation of AID at position S38 is believed to facilitate the interaction between AID and RPA, a cofactor that is required for AID to access transcribed DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). RPA binds to ssDNA and it was proposed that RPA might stabilize ssDNA liberated during transcription to serve as a substrate for AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Consistent with this idea, AID-S38A is inactive on transcribed dsDNA in the absence of RPA, while retaining catalytic activity on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Nevertheless, AID-S38A is active at between 20 and 35% of wild-type levels in hypermutation and CSR in vivo. One way to reconcile these results would be to posit that association between AID and RPA is only required for a subset of AID substrates that do not stabilize ss regions spontaneously. For example, ssDNA in switch regions is stabilized spontaneously by R-loops, but this does not occur in Ig variable region DNA. This model might predict that the S38A mutation would preferentially interfere with Ig variable region hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). However, the AID<sup>S38A</sup> mutation affects switching and mutation equally; therefore, the mechanism by which S38 phosphorylation alters AID function is likely to be independent of whether the ssDNA substrate is created by R-loops. An alternative nonexclusive explanation for our results is that S38 phosphorylation enhances AID activity by facilitating its interaction with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical studies with AID purified from insect cells assayed on artificial substrates showed that S38A mutation does not alter overall AID activity, but shifts target preference in a way that might result in specific loss of activity on hotspots found in the <italic>Ig</italic> switch region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). This in vitro bias is not consistent with our mutation data in transfected fibroblasts or GC B cells because we find lower levels of SHM in all cases and the selective hotspot bias found in the in vitro transcription systems would not affect the rate of SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Previous coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase experiments suggest that PKA phosphorylates AID at S38; the importance of this kinase in regulating AID is supported by the finding that inhibition of its activity in B cells inhibits class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Our experiments indicate that T140 is not a PKA target site, and that S38 can be phosphorylated by either PKA or PKC in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In addition, PKC family members overlap in their preference to phosphorylate T140 or S38 in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>) and S38 or T140 phosphorylation is nonexclusive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, AID activity may be modulated by phosphorylation on one or both sites, depending on which kinase is activated. The PKC family is composed of at least 10 serine/threonine kinases, many of which are expressed in activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). They have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, tolerance, immunity, and tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Which family members phosphorylate AID and the precise pathways that regulate phosphorylation in vivo remains to be determined.</p><p>How T140 phosphorylation modulates AID activity is not known, but this modification differs from S38 in that it preferentially affects somatic mutation. Differential regulation of class switching and somatic mutation is a well-characterized physiological feature of gene diversification in B cells. For example, B cells undergoing switch recombination in response to LPS and IL-4 in vitro do not mutate their <italic>Ig</italic> variable regions. This cannot be ascribed to a general absence of the factors that mediate hypermutation because the DNA 3&#x02032; of the I&#x003bc; promoter and the switch regions themselves are mutated by AID in LPS- and IL-4&#x02013;stimulated B cells. Indeed, the amount of mutation in switch regions in AID-T140A&#x02013;expressing B cells is directly proportional to the amount of class switching and differs from <italic>Ig</italic> variable region gene mutation, which is more severely affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). One explanation for the disparity between the effects of AID-T140A on switching and mutation would be that there are specific requirements for AID in the two reactions. This idea is supported by the finding that mutations in the amino or carboxyl terminal regions of AID preferentially affect somatic mutation or class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Finding that phosphorylation at T140 preferentially affects somatic mutation suggests a mechanism by which AID activity on closely related substrates might be differentially regulated.</p><p>AID activity is regulated by several mechanisms, including restricted expression, mRNA stability, nuclear degradation, nuclear export, and multiple phosphorylation sites. Although each of these alone appears to have a small effect on CSR and SHM, the combined effects are dramatic. For example AID haploinsufficiency supports rates of 80 and 70% of wild type in CSR and lymph node SHM, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). However, CSR is decreased to 5% of AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> controls, and lymph node SHM was at background levels in AID<sup>S38A/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Similarly, AID<sup>T140A/&#x02212;</sup> B cells were severely, but selectively, impaired in lymph node SHM (10% of AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> vs. 57% for CSR to IgG1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Peyer's patch B cells supported SHM levels nearly three times higher then lymph node. In this case, SHM rates in AID<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and AID<sup>T140A/&#x02212;</sup> resemble those of AID and AID<sup>T140A</sup> in the lymph node (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Thus, AID appears to be controlled by multiple potentially overlapping mechanisms. We speculate that this type of combinatorial regulation facilitates fine control of AID levels, which is required because small imbalances in its expression can result in catastrophic effects on genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>To produce AID<sup>S38A</sup> and AID<sup>T140A</sup> mice, AID S38 or T140 was mutated to alanine using the same gene-targeting strategy (Fig. S1).
