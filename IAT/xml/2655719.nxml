However, RGS proteins with complex domain architectures are now known to regulate much more than G&#x003b1; GTPase activity. RGS14 contains tandem Ras-binding domains that have been reported to bind to Rap- but not Ras GTPases <italic>in vitro</italic>, leading to the suggestion that RGS14 is a Rap-specific effector. However, more recent data from mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> imply that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, RGS14 may instead be an effector of Ras.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Full-length and truncated forms of purified RGS14 protein were found to bind indiscriminately <italic>in vitro</italic> to both Rap- and Ras-family GTPases, consistent with prior literature reports. In stark contrast, however, we found that in a cellular context RGS14 selectively binds to activated H-Ras and not to Rap isoforms. Co-transfection / co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the ability of full-length RGS14 to assemble a multiprotein complex with components of the ERK MAPK pathway in a manner dependent on activated H-Ras. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RGS14 inhibited both nerve growth factor- and basic fibrobast growth factor-mediated neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, a process which is known to be dependent on Ras-ERK signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In cells, RGS14 facilitates the formation of a selective Ras&#x000b7;GTP-Raf-MEK-ERK multiprotein complex to promote sustained ERK activation and regulate H-Ras-dependent neuritogenesis. This cellular function for RGS14 is similar but distinct from that recently described for its closely-related paralogue, RGS12, which shares the tandem Ras-binding domain architecture with RGS14.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many extracellular signaling molecules exert their cellular effects through activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-CabreraVera1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Pierce1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Beyond regulation of heterotrimeric G&#x003b1; signaling, RGS14 is also reported to bind to activated monomeric G-proteins. An early yeast two-hybrid analysis of interactions between RGS14 and Ras-family GTPases reported a selective interaction between RGS14 and activated Rap1B, but not H-Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Traver1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have also shown RGS14 binding in a nucleotide-dependent manner to the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2 but not Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Traver1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Kiel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Traver2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these results, it has been suggested that RGS14 may be a direct effector of Rap <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, subsequent to this initial identification of Rap (and not Ras) as a small GTPase binding target of RGS14, additional studies have suggested that Ras may also bind to RGS14. Kiel <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Kiel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> found that RGS14 binds preferentially to both activated Rap1B and activated H-Ras <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that this interaction is mediated by the first RBD of RGS14.

Finally, we have recently discovered that RGS12, the mammalian paralogue of RGS14, binds specifically to activated H-Ras in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Willard1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these results suggest that RGS14 may bind to Rap and/or Ras GTPases. In addition to binding activated H-Ras, we found that RGS12 promotes a differentiated phenotype in both PC12 cells and embryonic DRG neurons by organizing a Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK signal transduction complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Willard1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The requirement for RGS12 in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuritogenesis of PC12 cells and axonal growth of embryonic DRG neurons suggests that the related protein RGS14 may play a similar role in coordinating Ras-dependent signals that are required for promoting and/or maintaining cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Willard1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our aim with these present studies was to resolve the discordant ideas regarding the monomeric G-protein selectivity of RGS14, as well as to establish a cellular role for such RGS14/monomeric G-protein interaction(s). Here, we demonstrate that full-length and truncated forms of RGS14 bind promiscuously to Rap and Ras GTPases <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with earlier reports. In cells, however, RGS14 selectively binds to activated H-Ras and not Rap nor most other Ras family isoforms. Additionally, RGS14 facilitates the formation of a Raf/MEK/ERK multiprotein complex that is dependent on activated H-Ras. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of RGS14 inhibits both NGF- and basic fibrobast growth factor (bFGF)-mediated neuritogenesis of PC12 cells, both processes known to require Ras-ERK signaling. These results suggest that RGS14 may regulate neuronal differentiation by the selective organization of a Ras&#x000b7;GTP-dependent Raf, MEK, and ERK signal transduction complex <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>2.5S mouse NGF was from Roche (Indianapolis, IN).

This distinction most likely arises from the unique domain architecture of RGS12, which contains two additional domains (N-terminal PDZ and PTB domains) not present in RGS14.

Our present data suggest that RGS14 most likely assembles a MAPK multienzyme complex differently than RGS12. This highlights the possibility that RGS14 might require additional protein partners beyond the MAPK members organized in the complex. Such a requirement for additional accessory proteins would increase the complexity of possible signaling cascades that are regulated by RGS14; it is within this scenario that RGS14 may interact with and modulate Rap-mediated signaling.</p><p>Secondly, knockdown of RGS14 in PC12 cells inhibits <underline>both</underline> NGF- and bFGF-mediated neuritogenesis, whereas depletion of RGS12 selectively inhibits only NGF-promoted neuronal differentiation. This selective modulation of growth factor receptor signaling may be due, at least in part, to the ability of RGS12 to bind to the NGF receptor TrkA, but not to FGFR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Willard1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. While we have shown that (a) RGS12 associates with TrkA, (b) RGS12 undergoes subcellular redistribution in response to NGF stimulation, and (c) RGS12 is localized coincident with endosomal markers in cells, we presently have no evidence for any of these functions or behaviors for RGS14. In contrast, RGS14 is typically localized to the cytosol, nucleus, and perinuclear regions in interphase, and on microtubule structures during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-MartinMcCaffrey2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Cho2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, coordinating activated Ras and the MAPK cascade at subcellular locales distinct from RGS12 likely engenders a different set of outputs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, distinct ERK phosphorylation substrates) from RGS14-dependent signaling; independent MAPK signaling dependent on RGS14 that is equally critical for an integrated, long-term phenotypic response to a growth factor like NGF would explain why RGS12 is not able to compensate for the loss of RGS14 in NGF-induced neuritogenesis in siRNA-treated PC12 cells.</p><p>It is important to note also that RGS14 has biochemical properties atypical of a classical MAPK scaffold such as RGS12, MP1, STE5, and others. We were unable to detect binary interaction of RGS14 with any MAPK pathway members other than Ras. Typical MAPK scaffolds demonstrate binary interactions with multiple MAPK components. It is possible that H-Ras binding induces a conformational change in RGS14 that facilitates binding to additional MAPK pathway members, or that interaction with MAPK members is activation-dependent. Cellular evidence for a MAPK scaffolding-like function for RGS14 is provided by the requirement of RGS14 expression for B-Raf(V600E)-induced signal transduction in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004884-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We have not yet delineated the structural determinants of multiprotein-complex formation between Ras, RGS14, and Raf. We hypothesize that this interaction is unlikely due to simultaneous binding of RGS14 and Raf to activated H-Ras. Both RBD1 of RGS14 and the sole RBD of Raf proteins represent evolutionarily conserved binding sites for the effector loops (switch regions) of activated Ras-family GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Kiel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Wohlgemuth1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, based on the current structural knowledge, simultaneous binding of a single molecule of activated H-Ras to two RBDs is highly improbable. Evidence supporting the alternative view of Ras/RGS14/Raf complex formation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004884-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, as formation of this complex is Raf-isoform selective. In the absence of RGS14, H-Ras(G12V) interacts equivalently with Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf (data not shown). However, in the presence of RGS14, complex formation showed distinct selectivity towards B-Raf and Raf-1, but <underline>not</underline> A-Raf, in terms of the amount of H-Ras(G12V) co-precipitated. This suggests that facile co-precipitation of Ras in binary complexes with RGS14 and with Raf is not occurring and that a Raf-isoform selective phenomenon is being observed.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies delineate a potential major difference between the physiological roles of RGS12 and RGS14. Conventional MAPK scaffold proteins execute two main functions: (i) tethering proteins together, and (ii) specifying the subcellular localization of the multiprotein complex which, in turn, guides their final output. The finding that RGS12 is localized to endocytic vesicles and acts as a conventional MAPK scaffold that regulates NGF-promoted signaling in both PC12 and DRG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Willard1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> supports the notion that RGS12 and its partners are key components of &#x02018;signaling endosomes&#x02019; that form in the axon terminal and traffic in a retrograde manner to the cell body where they initiate local signal transduction cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004884-Howe1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the subcellular localization of RGS14 is distinct from that of RGS12, and this may be reflective of functional differences in the ability to modulate signal transduction, such as the ability of RGS14, but not RGS12, to modulate FGFR-mediated signal transduction. Thus, it is likely that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, RGS14 integrates signaling independent of, and with different consequences than, RGS12.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004884.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Guanine nucleotide-state selective interaction between H-Ras and RGS14.
