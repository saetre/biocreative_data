IL-1&#x003b2; exerts neurotoxic effects in ischemic stroke and blocking its action has been shown to reduce ischemic brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In comparison, there is evidence that TNF-&#x003b1; has both neurotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and neuroprotective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] roles after ischemic stroke in rats and in mice. Increasing evidence implicates both cytokines in the early inflammatory response that precedes and accompanies ischemia-induced neuronal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, detailed knowledge about the contribution of different cell types to the production of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; is still not available.</p><p>The relative physiological outcome of increased IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; signaling in ischemic stroke may depend on the kinetics and location of cytokine producing cells. There is compelling evidence that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are primarily synthesized by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], although granulocytes and astrocytes have also been suggested to produce both IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Precise identification of cell source has, however, been compromised by the lack of microglial and macrophage specific markers, which prevents discrimination of these cell types at the histological level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, it is presently unknown whether IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are expressed to the same extent by the same or different subsets of microglia and macrophages following ischemic stroke.</p><p>We have previously shown that IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA and TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA, and TNF-&#x003b1; protein are produced by CD11b<sup>+ </sup>microglia and by CD11b<sup>+ </sup>macrophages at the edge of and within areas of infarction, and that this production reaches maximum levels of expression between 12 and 24 hours after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The objective of the present study was to provide additional insight into the cell types and cell subpopulations that produce IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; within the first 24 hours following ischemic stroke in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To distinguish microglia from infiltrating macrophages after pMCAO, we used flow cytometry with CD45 and CD11b as myeloid-lineage specific markers, we used a radiated, bone marrow (BM) chimeric mouse model; and we used intracellular cytokine-staining, and double immunofluorescence staining. In addition, since CD11b is expressed by both macrophages and granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we also analyzed cytokine production by granulocytes using the granulocyte specific marker Gr1. Our results show that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are produced by largely segregated subsets of microglia and macrophages, and that very few cells express both cytokines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Breeding pairs of CD45.1<sup>+ </sup>(B6.SJL-Ptprc<sup>a </sup>Pepc<sup>b</sup>/BoyJ) mice and CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J (GFP-Tg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, Maine, USA) and transferred to the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Aarhus, where they were maintained as a colony. GFP-Tg mice, which express the CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>allotype, were used as BM donors and congenic BoyJ male mice, which express the CD45.1<sup>+ </sup>allotype, were used as BM recipients. This combination of mice was chosen so that infiltrating cells could be identified by two different markers (GFP<sup>+ </sup>and CD45.2<sup>+</sup>), however the GFP signal alone proved to be sufficiently strong and reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to identify infiltrating cells. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from C57BL/6 mice, which were purchased from Taconic (Ry, Denmark). Mice were housed under diurnal lightning conditions with free access to food and water. The experiments were approved by the Danish Animal Inspectorate (J. no. 2005/561&#x02013;1068).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of bone marrow chimeras</title><p>BM cells from GFP-Tg mice were grafted into lethally irradiated mice as described by Wirenfeldt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For donor BM recovery, the proximal and distal ends of tibia and femur were removed and BM was flushed from the medullary channel into sterile 50 mL polypropylene tubes using cold RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK). The BM cells were rinsed in RPMI medium and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, then filtered through a sterile cotton sieve. After 3 rounds of rinsing and filtering, cells were kept on ice until use. Recipient mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks of age) were lethally irradiated with a single dose of 9.5 Gy from a <sup>137</sup>Cs source (Ris&#x000f8; National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark). Within 2 hours of irradiation, BM cells were injected into the tail veins of recipient mice (approximately 10<sup>7 </sup>cells/mouse). For 3 days after grafting, mice received oxytetracycline (2 g/L Terramycin vet. 20%; Pfizer, Amoise, France) in autoclaved drinking water. Thereafter they were supplied with acidified water (pH 3). The mice were fed irradiation-sterilized mouse chow and maintained under pathogen-free conditions for 6 weeks until they were subjected to surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion</title><p>Under anaesthesia, mice were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia by permanent occlusion of the distal part of the left middle cerebral artery (pMCAO), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. During surgery, mice were placed on a 37&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C warm heating pad. An incision was made from eye to ear, the parotid gland and the upper part of the temporal muscle were split, and a small hole was drilled over the distal part of the MCA. The MCA was occluded by electrocoagulation and the incision was stitched with a 4.0 nylon-suture. After surgery, mice were injected with 1 ml of isotonic saline and their eyes were coated with ointment. Mice were kept at 28&#x000b0;C until sacrificed, 24 hours post-surgery. For post-surgical analgesia mice were treated with Temgesic (0.001 mg/20 g buprenorphinum, Reckitt &#x00026; Colman, Hull, UK) three times at 8-hour intervals starting immediately after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><sec><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized i.p. with an overdose of pentobarbital and perfused through the left ventricle using 10 ml of Soerensen's phosphate buffer (SB) (0.03 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and 0.12 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) followed by 20 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.15 M SB, pH 7.4.

Estimation of the numbers of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>dim </sup>microglia revealed comparable cell numbers in brains of unmanipulated mice and mice after 6 hours of survival, whereas there was a significant increase in microglia 12 hours or 24 hours after pMCAO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).

Granulocytes, which accounted for 50% of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>high </sup>cell population and which are known to exacerbate ischemic brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], accounted for only 2.4% of IL-1&#x003b2; and 0.8% of TNF-&#x003b1; expression by CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>high </sup>cells after 24 hours of pMCAO, indicating that the contribution of these cells to the production of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; after pMCAO in mice is negligible. A scenario therefore emerges wherein different subsets of microglia and macrophages may have different roles in ischemic stroke, and may thus either improve or reduce the chance of survival of ischemic neurons.</p><p>Our observation of a peak in the total number of IL-1&#x003b2;- and TNF-&#x003b1;-expressing cells 24 hours after pMCAO is in line with previous demonstrations of a time-dependent peak in the number of IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA-, TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA-, and TNF-&#x003b1; protein-expressing cells in SJL and C57BL/6 mice, 12&#x02013;24 hours after pMCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. By taking advantage of the ability of flow cytometry to distinguish between CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>dim </sup>microglia and infiltrating CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>high </sup>macrophages, we showed that the number of IL-1&#x003b2;- and TNF-&#x003b1;-expressing microglia by far exceeded the number of cytokine-expressing macrophages 12 hours after pMCAO. This result was expected based on the known steady increase in the number of infiltrating macrophages over the first 24 hours of pMCAO, but this result has not been previously demonstrated.</p><p>It was striking to observe that a relatively large proportion of the small number of macrophages present in the cortex from unmanipulated mice express TNF-&#x003b1;, and that the MFI levels of TNF-&#x003b1; expression in these cells are comparable to mean cellular TNF-&#x003b1; expression levels in pMCAO and sham-operated mice. This indicates that TNF-&#x003b1; expression by macrophages is relatively constant no matter whether the cells have infiltrated the cortex prior to or after pMCAO. Interestingly, the proportion of cytokine-expressing macrophages in sham-operated mice was at least as high as that in mice subjected to pMCAO. This likely reflects that sham surgery in itself induces a focal lesion in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Although neurons and microglia can still be clearly detected after 6 hours of pMCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the developing infarct is usually characterised by severe cell loss 12 hours after pMCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] We were therefore surprised not to observe a reduction in the number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>dim </sup>microglia 12 and 24 hours after pMCAO. We wondered whether determination of upregulation of CD45, which is widely used to detect both resting and activated microglia in flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], might lead to increased detection. Indeed, MFI analysis showed that CD45 levels are upregulated in microglia 12&#x02013;24 hours after pMCAO. However, microglial expression of CD45 was far below that expressed by macrophages/granulocytes, confirming results by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Using a bone marrow chimeric approach, we observed that approximately 7% of the CD45<sup>dim </sup>microglia were GFP<sup>+ </sup>after 24 hours of pMCAO, suggesting that BM-derived microglial precursors could also contribute to the expansion of the microglial population after ischemic stroke in non-chimeric mice. Infiltration of GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells was specific to the infarcted cortex, since no increase was observed in the contralateral hemisphere of BM-chimeric mice or in unmanipulated BM-chimeric mice. Other factors contributing to the expansion of the microglial population 12 and 24 hours after pMCAO might be immigration of microglia from regions of the brain not included in the preparation used for flow cytometry, or microglial proliferation. However, microglial proliferation is not prominent at 12 and 24 hours, but is first evident at 48 and 72 hours after induction of focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a finding that is similar to observations in other models of acute neural injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The use of a GFP BM-chimeric approach in our study of pMCAO served two purposes: 1) direct visualization of infiltrating GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells in tissue sections and 2) validation of the BM origin of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>high </sup>macrophages/granulocytes identified by flow cytometry in our model. In addition to the massive infiltration of GFP<sup>+ </sup>macrophages/granulocytes 24 hours after pMCAO, we found that a small proportion of microglia in the infarcted cortex could be classified as GFP<sup>+ </sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>dim </sup>microglial cells.

However, BM-derived cells have been reported to infiltrate non-irradiated normal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and CD45<sup>high </sup>leukocytes are routinely detected in unmanipulated, perfused brains by flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although focal cerebral ischemia disrupts the blood brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and irradiation in itself preconditions the brain for cells to infiltrate the neuropil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we in line with earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] observed only sporadic GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells in contralateral, non-ischemic cortex and in the brains of unmanipulated BM-chimeric mice. Furthermore, numbers of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>high </sup>macrophages/granulocytes recruited to ischemic cortex 24 hours after pMCAO were not different between BM-chimeric mice and non-irradiated mice. This suggests that any damage induced by irradiation alone was insufficient to trigger excessive entry of BM-derived cells into the CNS.</p><p>Our observation of a significant reduction in microglial population in the cortex of unmanipulated BM-chimeric mice compared to unmanipulated non-chimeric mice indicates that irradiation might impair microglial turnover in normal brain. This is supported by observations by Wirenfeldt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], who reported that microglial numbers were reduced by approximately 30% in unmanipulated contralateral hippocampi of perforant pathway-lesioned BM-chimeric mice. That study also reported a lesion-induced impairment of the mitotic capacity of microglia in BM-chimeric mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Taken together, we ascribe the reduced microglial numbers in BM-chimeric mice to irradiation damage.</p><p>The quantification of BM-derived GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells was done by use of an approximated stereological approach, and by use of flow cytometry. The results show that approximately 2/3 of GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells are lost during tissue processing procedures prior to flow cytometric analysis. Since GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells located in perivascular aggregates were not included in the approximated stereological analysis, cell loss using flow cytometry might be larger than 2/3. However, the consistency in the data shows that flow cytometry is a reliable and robust tool with which to obtain quantitative data on microglia and infiltrating macrophages/granulocytes in brain pathology, as also has been shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Observations made by others using BM-chimeric mice have shown that BM cells have the capacity to differentiate into microglia and perivascular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], as well as non-myeloid cell types such as endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, in our study of mice with 24-hour survival after pMCAO, we observed no evidence of co-expression of GFP with the astroglial marker GFAP, confirming earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Similarly, we find no clear evidence of co-expression of GFP and vWF/CD31, although such co-expression has been previously reported at later times of observation (3 days &#x02013; 1 month) after induction of ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are produced by largely non-overlapping subsets of microglia and macrophages after pMCAO in mice. This observation is indicative of activation of distinct signalling pathways in different subpopulations of microglia and macrophages after ischemic stroke. Resolution of these pathways may further the development of cytokine-based therapies in stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BM: bone marrow; FCS: fetal calf serum; FSC: forward scatter; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GFP-Tg: C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J; HBSS: Hank's balanced salt solution; IL-1&#x003b2;: interleukin-1beta; MCA: middle cerebral artery; min: minutes; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PECAM: platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PFA: paraformaldehyde; pMCAO: permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion; RT: room temperature; SB: Soerensens phosphate buffer; s.c.: subcutaneous; SSC: side scatter; TBS: tris buffered saline; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; vWF: von Willebrand factor; WT: B6.SJL-Ptprc<sup>a </sup>Pepc<sup>b</sup>/BoyJ.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors of this manuscript declare that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest.
