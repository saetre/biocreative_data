Such stabilizing currents, in turn, depend on passive membrane conductance (G<sub>m</sub>), which in skeletal muscle fibers covers membrane conductances for K<sup>+</sup> (G<sub>K</sub>) and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (G<sub>Cl</sub>). Myotonic disorders and studies with metabolically poisoned muscle have revealed capacities of G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> to inversely interfere with muscle excitability. However, whether regulation of G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> occur in AP-firing muscle under normal physiological conditions is unknown. This study establishes a technique that allows the determination of G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> with a temporal resolution of seconds in AP-firing muscle fibers. With this approach, we have identified and quantified a biphasic regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in active fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus fibers of the rat. Thus, at the onset of AP firing, a reduction in G<sub>Cl</sub> of &#x0223c;70% caused G<sub>m</sub> to decline by &#x0223c;55% in a manner that is well described by a single exponential function characterized by a time constant of &#x0223c;200 APs (phase 1). When stimulation was continued beyond &#x0223c;1,800 APs, synchronized elevations in G<sub>K</sub> (&#x0223c;14-fold) and G<sub>Cl</sub> (&#x0223c;3-fold) caused G<sub>m</sub> to rise sigmoidally to &#x0223c;400% of its level before AP firing (phase 2). Phase 2 was often associated with a failure to excite APs. When AP firing was ceased during phase 2, G<sub>m</sub> recovered to its level before AP firing in &#x0223c;1 min. Experiments with glibenclamide (K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibitor) and 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (ClC-1 Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel inhibitor) revealed that the decreased G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1 reflected ClC-1 channel inhibition, whereas the massively elevated G<sub>m</sub> during phase 2 reflected synchronized openings of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. In conclusion, G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> are acutely regulated in AP-firing fast-twitch muscle fibers. Such regulation may contribute to the physiological control of excitability in active muscle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Excitation and propagation of action potentials (APs) are the hallmarks of excitable cells. Both of these cellular processes require that excitatory currents exceed the inhibitory currents that dampen cellular excitability via their stabilizing actions on the resting membrane potential. The magnitude of the inhibitory currents can be inferred from measurements of passive membrane conductance (G<sub>m</sub>), which reflect the function of the ion channels that are open at the resting membrane potential. In resting skeletal muscle fibers, G<sub>m</sub> represents the sum of conductances for K<sup>+</sup> (G<sub>K</sub>) and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (G<sub>Cl</sub>), the latter accounting for 80&#x02013;90% of G<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hutter and Noble, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant and Morales-Aguilera, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pierno et al., 2007</xref>). The roles of G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> for skeletal muscle excitability can be illustrated by considering two extreme conditions: at one extreme, loss of function mutations of the muscle-specific Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel, the ClC-1 channel, is the cause of greatly reduced G<sub>m</sub> and hyperexcitable muscles in patients suffering from myotonia congenita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McComas and Mrozek, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant and Morales-Aguilera, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koch et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pusch, 2002</xref>). At the other extreme, muscle excitability is completely lost when metabolic poisoning was used to reveal that G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> have the capacity to increase &#x0223c;14-fold and &#x0223c;110-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink and L&#x000fc;ttgau, 1976</xref>). Although these extreme conditions reflect pathological or unphysiological conditions, they do demonstrate that regulation of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels can cause very large changes in G<sub>m</sub> of skeletal muscle fibers and have dramatic consequences for muscle excitability. However, it is not known whether this potential of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels to modulate muscle excitability via G<sub>m</sub> is exploited in the normal physiological regulation of the excitability of active AP-firing muscle fibers. This lack of knowledge about regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in active muscles is likely to be ascribable mainly to the experimental difficulties associated with measuring G<sub>m</sub> while muscle fibers are firing APs.</p><p>In this study, we establish a new technique that allows the determination of G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> with a temporal resolution of seconds in AP-firing muscle fibers. This approach is used to demonstrate that G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> are both highly dynamic in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle fibers firing APs and, furthermore, that these changes in G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> are caused by regulation of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> ion channels. This study is followed by a companion study (see <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="134" page="323" id="d32e313" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="19786585" ext-link-type="pubmed">Pedersen et al.</related-article> in this issue) that compares the highly dynamic nature of G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> in fast-twitch muscle fibers with the dynamics of G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> in fatigue-resistant slow-twitch muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal handling and muscle preparation</title><p>All experiments were performed on isolated EDL muscles from 12&#x02013;14-wk-old female wistar rats (&#x0223c;230 g).

To measure resting membrane conductance before (G<sub>mS</sub>) and in between AP trains (G<sub>m</sub>), two electrodes were inserted into the same fiber. One electrode was used to inject square current pulses, and the other electrode recorded the membrane potential. The protocols for injections of current pulses and the data sampling were controlled using Signal 2.09 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Recordings were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 60 kHz. Electrodes were filled with 2 M K-citrate except for a few experiments in which 3 M KCl or 770 mM K-methanesulphonate was used to check for any influence on the results of the citrate ion. No effects of citrate except more stable resting membrane potentials were observed. Holding currents were not used in any of the experiments. Intracellular measurements of AP trains were achieved without interference from contractile activity by including 50 &#x000b5;M <italic>N</italic>-benzyl-<italic>p</italic>-toluene sulphonamide (BTS) in the perfusion solution. BTS is a specific inhibitor of fast-twitch myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2002</xref>) that does not markedly affect the excitability of the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Macdonald et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, it has been shown that despite the reduction in contractile force, BTS only reduces muscle energy turnover by &#x0223c;20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).

From the decay of the steady-state amplitude of such voltage changes along the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), G<sub>in</sub> and &#x003bb; are extracted and used to calculate G<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd2">Eq. 2</xref>). Although this classical technique is preferable in resting muscle fibers, it usually requires several minutes to extract the experimental observation required for each determination of G<sub>m</sub>. This makes it highly unsuitable for determinations of fast changes in G<sub>m</sub> as might occur in AP-firing muscles. Here, we have overcome this problem by developing a method in which G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing fibers is calculated from G<sub>in</sub>, which can be measured directly if the electrodes are inserted into the fiber at sufficiently close proximity. In the standard experimental protocol, the current electrode was used to trigger 3.5-s trains of APs repeatedly every 7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Currents of small amplitude were injected in between the successive AP trains, and from the ratio of these injected currents and the resulting steady-state deflection in membrane potential (&#x00394;<italic>V</italic>), G<sub>in</sub> was monitored in the AP-firing fibers.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Representative recordings of successive AP trains in a fast-twitch EDL muscle fiber. Two electrodes were inserted in the fiber at close proximity (&#x0223c;70 &#x000b5;m): one electrode was used for injection of square current pulses, and the other electrode recorded the membrane potential. (A) The current injection protocol consisted of low amplitude (&#x000b1;10&#x02013;20 nA) 75-ms square pulses, which were used for G<sub>in</sub> determinations. These were followed by a train of AP trigger pulses (for 3 ms at 300 nA), here delivered at 15 Hz. The protocol was repeated until 4,998 trigger pulses had been injected. Recovery of G<sub>in</sub> was assessed 1 min after the stimulation ceased. (B&#x02013;D) Recordings of the membrane potential during the 1st, the 32nd, and the 85th current injection protocol.

Remarkably, AP firing was associated with the pronounced biphasic development of &#x00394;<italic>V</italic>. Thus, at the onset of AP firing, &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, compare B with C</xref>), but as stimulation continued, a sudden drop in &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> to less than half its value before AP firing was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, compare B with D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> shows that when AP firing was stopped for 1 min after the fiber had fired 4,998 APs, &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> fully recovered to its level before AP firing.</p><p>Next, G<sub>in</sub> during AP firing was evaluated from the ratio of injected current and the recorded &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> values during the muscle activity.

This phase of G<sub>m</sub> regulation during muscle activity will be referred to as phase 1. When AP firing continued, G<sub>m</sub> suddenly rose to around 400% of its level before AP firing, marking the beginning of the second phase. This phase of G<sub>m</sub> regulation during muscle activity will be referred to as phase 2. If AP firing was stopped after 4,998 APs, at which point the second phase was fully developed, G<sub>m</sub> recovered within 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This fast recovery showed that the elevated G<sub>m</sub> during phase 2 was not caused by membrane damage. This was further supported by a repolarization from &#x02212;69 &#x000b1; 1 to &#x02212;76 &#x000b1; 1 mV during the development of phase 2 (18 fibers stimulated at 15 Hz), which would not occur under conditions of unspecific membrane damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausen and Gissel, 2005</xref>). If AP firing was resumed after the 1 min of rest, G<sub>m</sub> rapidly rose. This indicates that the cellular signaling that triggered phase 2 had not completely recovered in the 1-min resting period (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Fast-twitch muscle fibers showed biphasic regulation of G<sub>m</sub> during AP firing.

In these experiments, the electrodes were only inserted once the AP firing had ceased, and the recovery of G<sub>in</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200910290/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>) or its behavior upon resumed AP firing in the impaled fiber (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200910290/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>) was compared with the G<sub>in</sub> dynamics observed when all APs were elicited via the inserted electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). These experiments confirmed that the G<sub>m</sub> dynamics observed when the APs were triggered by the current electrode could also be induced when the whole muscle was stimulated by more physiological stimulation without inserted electrodes (Part III in supplemental text). Also, the derivation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd3">Eq. 3</xref> assumed that the volume of the fiber did not change during the AP firing, which may not be absolutely valid because it is well known that muscles swell during activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Usher-Smith et al., 2009</xref>).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, the mean of the five parameters obtained by the fits was used to calculate G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing muscle fibers during the firing of 5,000 APs (solid red line).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of G<sub>m</sub> depends most closely on the total number of APs fired</title><p>To examine the importance of the AP firing intensity for the regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing fibers, the development of G<sub>m</sub> was compared in fibers in which the AP firing frequency in the pulse trains was either 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), or 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). At all frequencies, the increase of &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> that characterized phase 1 was observed at the onset of AP firing, and with prolonged AP firing, &#x00394;<italic>V</italic> suddenly dropped, marking the beginning of phase 2.

Interestingly, a comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref> suggests that G<sub>m</sub> dynamics in AP-firing fibers were more closely related to the number of APs elicited than to the experimental duration. To quantify this notion, the experimental observations at all frequencies were fitted to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd5">Eqs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd6">6</xref>, whereby the time constants for phase 1 (&#x003c4;<sub>1</sub>) and phase 2 (&#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>) were obtained both as functions of the number of APs fired and as functions of the experimental duration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Such quantification revealed that the 400% increase in AP firing frequency (6 to 30 Hz) was associated with 266% and 524% variations in &#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>, respectively, when these parameters were assessed as functions of experimental durations. In contrast, &#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub> only varied by 37 and 25% when assessed as functions of the number of APs fired. This confirmed that the G<sub>m</sub> dynamics during phase 1 and phase 2 were most closely related to the number of APs fired and further suggested that the dynamics of G<sub>m</sub> were elicited by mechanisms that, with the present experimental protocol, could sense and integrate the discrete AP events. However, note that the quantification showed that phase 2 did occur slightly later with 6-Hz AP trains than with the 15- and 30-Hz trains (3,264 &#x000b1; 237 APs at 6 Hz vs. 2,466 &#x000b1; 2,611 APs and 2,611 &#x000b1; 129 APs at 15 Hz and 30 Hz, respectively; P &#x0003c; 0.05). The quantification also showed that the magnitudes of reductions in G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1 (A<sub>1</sub>) were similar at all frequencies (P &#x0003e; 0.31). Furthermore, it showed that the magnitude of the rise in G<sub>m</sub> during phase 2 (A<sub>2</sub>) was smaller at 6 Hz than when compared with the values of A<sub>2</sub> at 15 and 30 Hz (P &#x0003c; 0.05). In marked contrast to phase 1, in which all APs were well maintained at all frequencies of AP firing, phase 2 was characterized by the dropout of AP (i.e., loss of AP excitation with the 300-nA current injection, particularly at the highest frequency of AP firing). Thus, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> (right), AP dropout during phase 2 left only the passive responses from the injection of the AP trigger currents. Such dropout was observed in all fibers at 30 Hz (13 out of 13), in some fibers at 15 Hz (7 out of 18; P &#x0003c; 0.05, Fisher's exact test; 15 vs. 30 Hz), and was not observed at 6 Hz (eight fibers; P &#x0003e; 0.05 and P &#x0003c; 0.05 against 15 Hz and 30 Hz, respectively).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The dynamics of G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing fibers were more closely related to the number of APs fired than to the experimental duration.

This was consistent with the observations in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-free solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>) and shows that the inhibition of ClC-1 channels underlies the reduction of G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1.

At 127 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, phase 1 appeared to be largely unaffected by the inhibitor (A<sub>1</sub> = &#x02212;579 &#x000b1; 27 &#x000b5;S/cm<sup>2</sup>; &#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> = 299 &#x000b1; 27 APs), whereas phase 2 was substantially reduced and delayed. In 5 out of the 13 fibers at 127 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, a clear phase 2 was never observed, even after firing &#x0223c;5,000 APs, and in the remainder of the glibenclamide-treated fibers, phase 2 was not accurately described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd6">Eq. 6</xref>. Thus, the observations from the experiments with glibenclamide were not quantified by fitting. However, comparison of the maximum G<sub>m</sub> during phase 2 in the absence and presence of glibenclamide suggested that glibenclamide blocked phase 2 more than would be expected if this inhibitor only blocked the rise in G<sub>K</sub> during phase 2. Consequently, experiments with glibenclamide were also performed at 50 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> whereby extraction of G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> in AP-firing fibers treated with glibenclamide became possible (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd4">Eq. 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref> shows that elevations in both G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> during phase 2 were markedly reduced and delayed by glibenclamide. This demonstrates that in addition to preventing the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels during phase 2, the drug also prevented the reopening of ClC-1 channels during phase 2. In addition, phase 2 was usually associated with repolarization of the resting membrane potential in the absence of glibenclamide, whereas with glibenclamide, this repolarization was either not observed or was delayed in onset.</p><p>Because the involvement of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in phase 2 was assessed with glibenclamide, which is known to target the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in both the surface membrane of muscle fibers as well as in their mitochondria, a series of experiments was conducted using the inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), which predominantly targets the mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moses et al., 2005</xref>).

We report that modulation of the functions of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> ion channels underlies biphasic dynamics of G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing rat EDL muscle fibers: at the onset of AP firing, inhibition of ClC-1 channels conveys a reduction in G<sub>m</sub>, whereas with continued AP firing, reopening of ClC-1 channels and activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels massively elevate G<sub>m</sub>.</p><sec><title>G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> can be determined on a time scale of seconds in AP-firing muscle fibers</title><p>With the classical technique of measuring G<sub>m</sub>, muscle fibers must be penetrated multiple times, making it an unsuitable approach for determinations of rapid regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing fibers. To determine G<sub>m</sub> with a temporal resolution of seconds in AP-firing fibers, an alternate method was developed in this study that extracts G<sub>m</sub> during muscle activity from on-line measurements of G<sub>in</sub>. However, this approach only provides a relative measure of G<sub>m</sub>, and to obtain absolute values for G<sub>m</sub>, the value of the resting membrane conductance before AP firing, G<sub>mS</sub>, had to be determined in a separate group of fibers under similar experimental conditions using the classical technique. Thus, a full description of G<sub>m</sub> in AP-firing fibers relies on observations obtained with both techniques. The massive benefit of combining the two techniques is witnessed by the possibility of separating G<sub>m</sub> dynamics into its G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> components from experiments conducted at two different Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentrations. In this way, the involvement of K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels for G<sub>m</sub> dynamics may be assessed. In AP-firing EDL muscle fibers, we observed that upon the onset of AP firing, a substantial reduction in G<sub>Cl</sub> and a minor increase in G<sub>K</sub> summed to give the substantial reduction in G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1. With prolonged AP firing leading to phase 2, G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> rose to stable levels corresponding to &#x0223c;3-fold and &#x0223c;14-fold of their initial values, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1 reflects inhibition of ClC-1 channels</title><p>When experiments were performed in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-free conditions or the ClC-1 channels were blocked by 9-AC, G<sub>mS</sub> was reduced by almost 90%, and the normal reduction in G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1 in AP-firing fibers was absent. This suggests that during early stages of physical activity, AP firing in muscle initiates a cellular signaling pathway that leads to inhibition of ClC-1 channels and, consequently, to a reduction in G<sub>Cl</sub>. Interestingly, G<sub>m</sub> during phase 1 was well described by a single exponential function, which suggests that inhibition of the ClC-1 channels during phase 1 proceeds via a cellular signaling system that has a single rate-limiting step.</p><p>The physiological role of reduced G<sub>Cl</sub> for the excitability and contractile properties of working muscle have been investigated previously using intact muscle and mechanically skinned muscle fibers. Because it is well documented that exercise is associated with marked elevation in the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sejersted and Sj&#x000f8;gaard, 2000</xref>), several of these studies have focused on the role of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels for the effect of elevated K<sup>+</sup> on muscle function. These studies show that under conditions of elevated K<sup>+</sup>, muscle excitability becomes substantially depressed, but if ClC-1 channels are inhibited via intracellular acidification, 9-AC, or by removal of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> from the extracellular solution, the muscle fibers substantially regain excitability and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nielsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pedersen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Emst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Paoli et al., 2007</xref>). This could indicate that loss of excitability in working muscles can be counteracted if ClC-1 channels are inhibited. This study demonstrates for the first time that the onset of muscle activity is indeed associated with an inhibition of ClC-1 channels, and, consequently, it can be speculated that this reduction in G<sub>m</sub> would assist in the maintenance of muscle excitability in working muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open synchronously during phase 2</title><p>A remarkable characteristic of phase 2 was its consistent appearance after firing roughly &#x0223c;1,800 APs irrespective of whether the APs were fired in trains of 6, 15, or 30 Hz. This suggests that the recovery of the pathway that signals phase 2 was slow compared with the difference in experimental time with the different stimulation frequencies. Experiments showed that after the fibers had fired &#x0223c;5,000 APs, G<sub>m</sub> achieved full recovery if the fibers rested for 1 min. However, upon resumed AP firing, phase 2 rapidly reoccurred. From the full recovery of G<sub>m</sub> during the 1-min resting period and the fast reappearance of phase 2 upon resumed AP firing, it can be envisaged that phase 2 relies on a cellular signaling system that has a distinct threshold such that once this threshold is crossed, it leads to the opening of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels. If this cellular signal behind phase 2 recovers below the threshold in the 1 min of rest, G<sub>m</sub> should fully recover. However, upon resumed AP firing, the cellular signal starts to increase again, but this time from a much higher level. Therefore, the threshold is crossed much faster in the second round of AP firing. Indeed, such a system should be well represented by a sigmoidal function, which typically describes systems that can alternate between two states.</p><p>Experiments with reduced extracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-free solutions, and 9-AC (a) showed that reopening of ClC-1 channels caused the rise in G<sub>Cl</sub> during phase 2 and (b) demonstrated that the elevations in G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> during phase 2 appeared after the same number of APs and rose with similar steepness. This indicated that the reopening of ClC-1 channels and the rise in G<sub>K</sub> were temporally very closely synchronized and suggested that the ClC-1 and K<sup>+</sup> channels that mediated the elevations in G<sub>Cl</sub> and G<sub>K</sub> during phase 2 responded to similar cellular signaling. To this end, three lines of evidence suggest that this common signal may be a substantial reduction in the cellular energetic state of the muscle fibers: (1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink and L&#x000fc;ttgau (1976)</xref> showed that metabolic poisoning of frog skeletal muscle causes enormous elevations in both G<sub>K</sub> (110-fold) and G<sub>Cl</sub> (14-fold). Importantly, these elevations in G<sub>K</sub> and G<sub>Cl</sub> occurred almost synchronously, as occurs during phase 2. Furthermore, such elevations occurred without alterations in the resting membrane potential, which indicates that the cellular integrity of the poisoned muscle fibers was conserved. Such observations with metabolic poisoning have been linked to opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in mammalian muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 1995</xref>). Collectively, the experiments with metabolic poisoning demonstrate that skeletal muscle fibers are equipped with Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ion channels that are sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell and that these channels appear to open at the same level of metabolic depression. However, the present study provides the first direct evidence that similar regulation of K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels may be involved in physiological regulation of ion channels in active skeletal muscle fibers. (2) Experiments performed in this study demonstrate that the dramatic elevation of G<sub>K</sub> in phase 2 is significantly reduced and delayed by the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibitor glibenclamide. These channels are generally considered to constitute a link between the metabolic state and excitability of cells because they open when the energy level becomes low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nichols, 2006</xref>). Thus, the experiments with glibenclamide indicate that the rise in G<sub>K</sub> during phase 2 was initiated by the depressed metabolic state of the fibers that caused K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to open. (3) The synchronicity of ClC-1&#x02013; and K<sub>ATP</sub>-channel opening in phase 2 suggests that ClC-1 channels should also be sensitive to the metabolic state of the cells.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennetts et al. (2005)</xref> have recently demonstrated in expression systems that conditions of low cellular energy levels increase the opening probability of ClC-1 channels. This important contribution to the understanding of ClC-1 channels has now been further developed to show that the sensitivity of ClC-1 channel to the metabolic state of cells is inversely related to the intracellular proton activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennetts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>) and is completely lost upon cell oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). However, one study has raised doubt that ClC-1 channels are sensitive to the metabolic state of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zifarelli and Pusch, 2008</xref>). All of these observations on the regulation of ClC-1 channels were obtained using various expression systems, and whether native ClC-1 channels are sensitive to the metabolic state of muscle fibers has not been explored. In the present study, we demonstrate that ClC-1 channels open after prolonged AP firing, and the synchronicity of opening of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels strongly suggests that ClC-1 channels do respond to depressed metabolic conditions in native skeletal muscle fibers. Because the metabolic state can be severely depressed in fast-twitch fibers during physical exertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esbj&#x000f6;rnsson-Liljedahl et al., 1999</xref>), it is possible that such openings of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels occur in fatigued muscles in vivo.</p><p>Until now, our understanding of the regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in working muscles has been limited to extrapolations from knowledge obtained in resting muscles. Using a new technical approach, however, we here identify significant activity-induced regulation of G<sub>m</sub> in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers that provides new perspectives on the roles of ClC-1 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels for muscle function. We demonstrate that at the onset of muscle activity, ClC-1 channels are rapidly inhibited. Such inhibition of ClC-1 channels may assist working muscle in their maintenance of excitability. The data further implicate ClC-1 channels in a mechanistic alliance with K<sub>ATP</sub> channels such that at times of low cellular energy levels, opening of these channels generates a large G<sub>m</sub>. Because such an increase in G<sub>m</sub> tends to lower fiber excitability, we suggest that elevation of G<sub>m</sub> in response to the reduced metabolic state of the muscle fibers may switch off further muscle fiber activation and thus prevent complete depletion of the energetic state of the fibers that otherwise might result in loss of cellular integrity. This scenario is supported by the loss of AP excitation when G<sub>m</sub> became elevated during phase 2 and by observations of severe muscle damage in K<sub>ATP</sub> channel knockout mice after treadmill running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thabet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cifelli et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200910290_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200910290_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank T.L.
