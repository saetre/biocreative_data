Although the amounts or concentrations of secreted FHA <italic>in vivo</italic> are unclear, we see great value in understanding the potential consequences of FHA interactions with host cells.

We also analyzed the interactions of FHA with a cell-line model of bronchial epithelial cells, which is a major target cell type for <italic>B. pertussis.</italic></p><p>Our results revealed a dynamic, time-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B pathway response to FHA where, despite the initial rapid activation of the pathway in macrophages, prolonged exposure to FHA inhibited this pathway and suppressed subsequent responses to other inflammatory signals. In contrast, in bronchial epithelial cells, FHA blocked activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway at all examined time points. Cells were analyzed with various assays that assess the activation state of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, including I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, DNA binding of the transcription factor, and the secretion of NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8.

The chemokine IL-8 was detected in the supernatant of epithelial cells exposed to FHA; however, since NF-&#x003ba;B is not activated by FHA in these cells, we speculate that a different transcription factor is responsible for IL-8 transcription.

To verify if the initial inflammatory response might be due in part to the minute amounts of contaminating LPS, we pretreated FHA with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml polymixin B and then used this preparation to treat differentiated U-937 cells. We found that I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was degraded by 0.5 hour following exposure to either polymixin B-pretreated FHA or untreated FHA, suggesting that LPS does not contribute significantly to the rapid activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by FHA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003825.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p>It was previously suggested that FHA binds to macrophages through &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003825-Relman2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, it remains to be determined whether this is the mechanism by which FHA activates NF-&#x003ba;B. It is possible that the different responses of macrophages and epithelial cells originate in the distinct repertoire of receptors expressed by these cells. A prior study showed that in BEAS-2B cells exposed to FHA-coated wells, the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is activated in an RGD motif-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003825-Ishibashi3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that differences in the presentation of FHA (surface-associated versus soluble) may account for the discrepancy in the responses identified in BEAS-2B epithelial cells. Since cells are exposed <italic>in vivo</italic> to both surface-associated FHA and soluble FHA, both models of FHA presentation are relevant.</p><p>As reported by others, we observed high levels of secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by U-937 macrophages and fresh human monocytes exposed to FHA. Additional immunosuppressive activities have been attributed to FHA, and associated with the induction of T regulatory cells.

This is a representative experiment of three performed under similar conditions.</p><p>(0.91 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003825.s005.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Drs.
