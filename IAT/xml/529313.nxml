In a well-studied model, starvation of stationary-phase <italic>lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Escherichia coli</italic> cells on lactose medium induces Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> revertants at higher frequencies than predicted by usual mutation models. These revertants carry either a compensatory frameshift mutation or a greater than 20-fold amplification of the leaky <italic>lac</italic> allele. A crucial distinction between alternative hypotheses for the mechanisms of adaptive mutation hinges on whether these amplification and frameshift mutation events are distinct, or whether amplification is a molecular intermediate, producing an intermediate cell type, in colonies on a pathway to frameshift mutation. The latter model allows the evolutionarily conservative idea of increased mutations (per cell) without increased mutation rate (by virtue of extra gene copies per cell), whereas the former requires an increase in mutation rate, potentially accelerating evolution. To resolve these models, we probed early events leading to rare adaptive mutations and report several results that show that amplification is not the precursor to frameshift mutation but rather is an independent adaptive outcome. (i) Using new high-resolution selection methods and stringent analysis of all cells in very young (micro)colonies (500&#x02013;10,000 cells), we find that most mutant colonies contain no detectable <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, in contrast with previous reports. (ii) Analysis of nascent colonies, as young as the two-cell stage, revealed mutant Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with no <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells present. (iii) Stringent colony-fate experiments show that microcolonies of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells grow to form visible colonies of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified, not mutant, cells. (iv) Mutant cells do not overgrow <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells in microcolonies fast enough to mask the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. (v) <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells are not SOS-induced, as was proposed to explain elevated mutation in a sequential model. (vi) Amplification, and not frameshift mutation, requires DNA polymerase I, demonstrating that mutation is separable from amplification, and also illuminating the amplification mechanism. We conclude that amplification and mutation are independent outcomes of adaptive genetic change. We suggest that the availability of alternative pathways for genetic/evolutionary adaptation and clonal expansion under stress may be exploited during processes ranging from the evolution of drug resistance to cancer progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Cells can respond to stress by apparently increasing their mutation rate.

In this system, cells carrying a &#x0002b;1 frameshift mutation in <italic>lac</italic> genes on an F&#x02032; conjugative plasmid are starved on solid medium with lactose as the sole carbon source, selecting Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> revertants. Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones appear over time during selection in a population of cells that shows no net growth (i.e., is in stationary phase). In most clones, Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is conferred by a compensatory &#x02212;1 frameshift mutation in the <italic>lac</italic> gene (Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutants). Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutation during stationary phase differs from mutation during rapid growth in that it requires the recombination proteins RecA, RecBC, RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris2">Harris et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris3">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster6">Foster et al. 1996</xref>), and induction of the SOS DNA damage response regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns1">Cairns and Foster 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie1">McKenzie et al. 2000</xref>), particularly error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol) IV (DinB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie3">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Wolff1">Wolff et al. 2004</xref>).

Adaptive amplification requires RpoS, the transcriptional activator of approximately 50 stationary-phase/starvation- and general-stress-response-specific genes, which is also required for point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Lombardo1">Lombardo et al. 2004</xref>). Amplification does not require DinB or induction of other SOS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>), and whether or not it requires recombination proteins has not been determined unambiguously (Tlsty et al. 1984; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings1">Hastings and Rosenberg 2002</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with Darwinian principles of evolution by selection of undirected and random genetic changes, adaptive point mutation in the Lac system is accompanied by a high level of mutation in genes unrelated to lactose catabolism (secondary mutation). Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutants show about 50-fold more secondary mutations than do cells starved on the same plate that did not become Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosche1">Rosche and Foster 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Godoy1">Godoy et al. 2000</xref>). This indicates that a subpopulation of the starved cells experiences a transient episode of hypermutation (adaptive point mutants are not mutator mutants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg6">Rosenberg et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosche1">Rosche and Foster 1999</xref>). In keeping with their independence of DinB and SOS, the amplified clones do not show hypermutation of unrelated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). These differences, together with the finding that cells carrying <italic>lac</italic> amplification (&#x0201c;<italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells&#x0201d;) do not readily yield Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutants when resubjected to selection on lactose medium, led us to propose that amplification reflects a pathway of genetic change wholly or partly separate from point mutation (we suggested an alternative outcome of a branched pathway; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings1">Hastings and Rosenberg 2002</xref>).</p><p>Two general models for the adaptive point mutation mechanism in this system are currently at odds, each focused on the role of DNA amplification, and each representing a different view of evolution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg3">Rosenberg and Hastings 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg4">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Roth1">Roth and Andersson 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Roth2">2004b</xref>). In &#x0201c;hypermutation models,&#x0201d; the observed high frequency of Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutants is proposed to result from transient hypermutation as part of a stress response, one consequence of which is acceleration of genetic change (and so potentially of evolution) (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>, and below, where specific molecular mechanisms are suggested). In this view, amplification is an adaptive pathway alternative to point mutation that allows growth of cells, relieving the stress of starvation, and so deflects them from the point mutation route. This view is compatible with Darwinism, which allows for changing rates of generation of heritable variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Darwin1">Darwin 1859</xref>).</p><p>In an alternative model, called &#x0201c;amplification&#x02013;mutagenesis,&#x0201d; amplification is an intermediate in the formation of Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutants, and its most important role is to provide more <italic>lac</italic> copies per cell so that point mutation can occur without increase in mutation rate per copy of <italic>lac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>). This adheres to conservative neo-Darwinist ideas of constant and gradual evolutionary change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Mayr1">Mayr 1982</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report several experiments that demonstrate that amplification and point mutation are separate adaptive outcomes, compatible with hypermutation models, and not part of a sequential pathway leading to mutation (as in the amplification&#x02013;mutagenesis model). We also report the first genetic requirement specific to the adaptive amplification pathway, Pol I.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Colony Phenotypes</title><p>Experiments described below make use of the different colony color phenotypes of point-mutant and <italic>lac</italic>-amplified clones grown on rich medium with the dye 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl &#x003b2;-D-galactoside (X-gal) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We use the word &#x0201c;sectored&#x0201d; to describe the appearance of a colony of cells on X-gal medium (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">1</xref>C). The word &#x0201c;unstable&#x0201d; is used to denote continued sectoring when cells from sectored colonies are replated. This instability has been shown in many examples to reflect tandem amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster1">Foster 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). Sectoring that is not unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) may reflect incidental juxtaposition of blue and white colonies on a plate (see below). &#x0201c;Stable&#x0201d; describes the absence of visible sectoring that indicates Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Most Microcolonies Are Pure, Not Mixed</title><p>If most adaptive point mutants arise by mutation in young colonies carrying <italic>lac</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), then young colonies should contain both the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified progenitor cells and their point-mutant descendants, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> and reexamined here. To determine whether a microcolony carries point-mutant or <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells or both, in principle, one picks the microcolony from the lactose-minimal selection medium and replates its cells onto rich X-gal medium to observe whether the resulting colonies are pure blue (point mutant), unstable sectoring (<italic>lac-</italic>amplified), or both. A significant problem in interpreting data from such analyses is that the picked microcolony carries with it many Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> background cells from the selection plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and may contain cells from unrelated microcolonies, because, of necessity, these microcolonies cannot be streaked to purify them before analysis.</p><p>We have improved the sensitivity of microcolony analysis substantially, first, by analyzing all cells in a microcolony (rather than a sample) and, second, by imposing stringent methods to reduce contamination of microcolonies with neighboring cells and microcolonies from the selection plate (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). First, frameshift-bearing (tester) cells were mixed with 3&#x00025; each of three or four different derivative testers that carry antibiotic resistance markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and only microcolonies that carried one of these minority antibiotic resistance markers were analyzed to search for sectored colonies on medium carrying the antibiotic. This reduces, but does not eliminate, accidental overlap with Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> background cells and with unrelated Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microcolonies accidentally harvested in the same sample (shown below). Second, because some sectored colonies are not unstable (e.g., mixtures of stable, white Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> background cells, and blue colony formers that overlapped), all sectored colonies found were retested by plating a sample on the same X-gal antibiotic medium to determine whether there was continued instability indicative of amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Third, because the sequential model predicts that the younger the microcolony is, the greater the proportion of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (colony-forming units &#x0005b;cfu&#x0005d;) it should contain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), and because one might miss the putative <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cfu by not examining enough cfu per microcolony, we analyzed very young microcolonies of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>4</sup> cfu/microcolony (as compared with approximately 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/microcolony used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. &#x0005b;2002&#x0005d;</xref>) and analyzed <italic>all</italic> cfu in each of them (rather than a sample) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The results of analyzing every cell in 18 whole microcolonies of stable cells, isolated on days 3 through 6 of adaptive mutation experiments, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>. Although we found sectored colonies at frequencies of 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in almost all microcolonies (as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), these sectored colonies, when replated, were almost all found to consist of cells giving rise to stable white and stable blue colonies only, indicating that these were not from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified clones (also demonstrated below). In general, we looked at 50 to 100 cells from these replated sectored colonies, but, for three of them, we screened 3,000&#x02013;4,000 cells with the same result: we could find no unstable cfu within them. In contrast, cells from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies, upon replating, again give rise to sectored colonies. Therefore, most of the sectored colonies that we found give no evidence of carrying amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> locus. Sectoring in these colonies may occur by chance juxtaposition of Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point-mutant cells with non-mutated background cells (which are numerous) during the plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Other explanations might also be possible; however, these colonies are not <italic>lac-</italic>amplification bearers by this test and also as demonstrated in the following section. An example of such a colony is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. Such colonies may account for the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> that more than 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> of cells in every Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microcolony are sectored colony formers. These sectored, non-<italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies have also been reported by another laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Poteete1">Poteete et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Of the 18 whole microcolonies examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>), 16 were pure stable. One day-6 microcolony was found to contain seven unstable cfu. (Another, found on day 5, contained two cfu showing sectors of an extremely pale blue color along with sectors of the same color as the Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> parental cells.) Those unstable cfu might be clonally related to the rest of the microcolony, or might result from chance juxtaposition of two different clones carrying the same antibiotic resistance marker. To determine the frequency at which such chance juxtapositions are expected, we analyzed the cells carried on the agar plugs on which microcolonies were harvested. We did this by plating the microcolony suspensions on medium containing an antibiotic to which cells of the microcolony were sensitive, to ascertain the frequency of marked Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that are unrelated to a microcolony but get harvested with it. The microcolony plugs contained from 900 to 7,000 antibiotic-resistant <italic>lac</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> background cells each. Of eleven such plugs analyzed, one contained three unrelated (different antibiotic resistance) point-mutant Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cfu, one contained one unrelated unstable cfu, and three contained unrelated cfu of the very pale sectored phenotype described above. The presence on agar plugs of cells giving rise to sectored colonies that are unrelated to the microcolony, but occur at a frequency comparable to the frequency of unstables in a microcolony of the same antibiotic-resistance genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>, last line), implies that the presence of unstable cfu was independent of the microcolony, and thus not relevant to the origin of the microcolony.</p><p>The very pale sectored colonies that we found were examined further and were shown to be unstable upon retesting but contained no cells capable of forming colonies on lactose medium under the conditions of an adaptive mutation experiment. Presumably they contain too few copies of the <italic>lac</italic> region to allow growth on lactose medium. They might carry <italic>lac</italic> gene duplication, or tandem amplification at a very low level. In support of this possibility, we note that their pale appearance on X-gal medium is similar to known <italic>lac</italic> gene duplications of this frameshift allele that we have constructed (A. Slack and P. J. Hastings, unpublished data). Another possibility is that they contain multiple F&#x02032; plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster5">Foster and Rosche 1999</xref>). Their failure to form adaptive point-mutant or <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies shows that they do not advance to a Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype efficiently (so are not obvious precursors to point mutation).</p><p>Thus, colonies composed of a mixture of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and point-mutant cells, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al.

They scored small (presumed young) and large (old) colonies and found many more unstable cfu in small colonies than in larger colonies. We note that they did not follow the same small colonies to score later, when those small colonies had grown larger, as we have done. Their result is probably caused by the slow growth rate of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, which causes microcolonies of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells to remain at the microcolony size for longer than do microcolonies of point-mutant cells, such that many more small colonies are <italic>lac</italic>-amplified.

An additional explanation for why the small colonies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al.

These include the antibiotic-resistant-minority-scoring method outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Thus, when they picked small colonies in a fixed volume of agar, a greater fraction of the cells in their sample would be unrelated background cells than when they picked larger colonies (same number of background cells each time, but fewer or more cells from the colony they intended to sample). This, too, should result in the appearance of more mixtures of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified and point-mutant cfu in the small colony samples and more pure point mutant in the large colony samples; but the mixtures in the small colony samples would be unrelated.

Microcolonies were found by use of a dissecting microscope, and harvested on a plug of agar with a capillary tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Working at 25&#x000d7; magnification on a dissecting microscope, we were able to find and harvest very young colonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), down to a size of 10<sup>2</sup> cells. The cells were suspended in 500 &#x003bc;l M9 buffer. One percent of the suspension was plated on LBH plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>) containing 40 &#x003bc;g/ml X-gal and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml rif (to prevent growth of scavenger cells). The remainder of the suspension was diluted with glycerol (to 12.5&#x00025;) and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. Many of the cells in any plating of a harvested microcolony were background (white colony forming) Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tester cells that were on the agar plug (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The cells from the microcolony either formed solid blue colonies on LBH X-gal rif plates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), indicating a point-mutant colony, or sectored blue colonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating an unstable <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). The colonies were scored for sectoring, counted, and patched from the LBH X-gal rif plates onto plates containing antibiotics. Those microcolonies that showed a stable Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point-mutant phenotype, had a suitable cell number, and carried one of the minority antibiotic-resistance markers were then plated in toto from the frozen suspension onto LBH X-gal rif medium with the appropriate antibiotic, to search for sectored colonies. Because some sectored colonies are not unstable (e.g., mixtures of stable white and blue colonies that overlap; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">see Results/Discussion</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>), all sectored colonies found were retested by plating a sample on the same LBH X-gal antibiotic medium to determine whether there was continued instability indicative of amplification.</p><p>Harvesting the microcolony on a plug of agar with a 25-&#x003bc;l capillary pipette also picks up many Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tester cells. The number of these that form colonies during the analysis is reduced by use of antibiotics (as described above) because most cells are not resistant, but the background of tester cells may still be equal in number to those in the microcolony (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Use of a smaller caliber tube was found to risk losing microcolony cells on the wall of the tube.</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>Selection for <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells</title><p>Microcolonies of PJH220 were harvested as above and suspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of buffer. One microliter (0.5&#x00025;) of the suspension was spread on LBH X-gal rif medium to determine cell number and which microcolonies were point mutant. Point-mutant microcolonies were then plated to select CamR on LBH plates containing X-gal, rif, and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol. Plates were scored after 15 to 20 h at 37 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>To analyze background cells without microcolonies, plugs of agar were taken from areas of the plates where no microcolony was visible at 20&#x000d7; magnification and the cells suspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of buffer. Half of each suspension was plated on chloramphenicol-containing medium as above, and the other half was plated with scavenger cells onto lactose-minimal medium. Chloramphenicol plates were scored between 15 and 18 h, and lactose plates were scored at 2 d, and again at 7 d. Colonies appearing on lactose medium were scored for amplification by plating a sample of the cells on LBH X-gal rif medium. Colonies appearing on chloramphenicol-containing medium were scored for <italic>lac</italic> amplification (blue and white sectoring) directly on that plate. All CamR colonies were seen to be <italic>lac</italic>-amplified.</p><p>The fraction of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells detectable by CamR selection was determined as follows. There are two reasons why <italic>lac</italic> amplification might fail to be detected with the CamR selection: first, because some <italic>lac</italic> amplifications have not co-amplified the neighboring <italic>codA</italic>::<italic>cat</italic> gene, and, second, because some <italic>cat-</italic>amplified microcolonies obtained from the lactose plates (grown selectively for Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and not for CamR) might have too few <italic>cat</italic> copies for growth on 100 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol. We determined each of these separately. We found that 59 of 77 <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolonies were CamR (at least 77&#x00025; had co-amplified <italic>cat</italic>), and that 84&#x00025; of cells from CamR (<italic>cat</italic>-amplified) isolates grown on lactose without chloramphenicol were then able to form colonies on chloramphenicol medium. The cells that did not form colonies on chloramphenicol presumably had lost or reduced their amplification of <italic>cat</italic> and <italic>lac.</italic> This would indicate that 77&#x00025; of 84&#x00025; (65&#x00025;) of all <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells should be detected by the CamR selection. An independent determination of the number of <italic>cat</italic>-amplified cells that grow on chloramphenicol after growth on lactose was obtained in a reconstruction experiment in which a few CamR cells were plated with a 10<sup>4</sup>-fold excess of Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point-mutant cells, mimicking more closely the conditions of the experiments in which microcolonies are obtained. A total of 79&#x00025; of the <italic>cat-</italic>amplified cells formed colonies on chloramphenicol medium, so 77&#x00025; of 79&#x00025; (61&#x00025;) of all <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells should be detected. The selection for CamR is actually a more sensitive assay for <italic>lac</italic> amplification than is selection for Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, as shown by the fact that only 60&#x00025; of cells from the cultures that showed CamR were able to form colonies on lactose medium under the conditions of an adaptive mutation experiment, though all carried<italic>lac</italic> amplification (indicating that 40&#x00025; had too few <italic>lac</italic> copies for growth on lactose), whereas 79&#x00025; were detected on chloramphenicol medium.</p></sec><sec id="s3a6"><title>Colony-fate experiments</title><p>Microcolonies were touched with the point of a needle, and cells were transferred to LBH X-gal rif plates, where they were spread by streaking for scoring. Control experiments (not shown) showed that this procedure removed, on average, 5&#x00025; of the microcolony from the plate. About 50 separate colonies from each microcolony were scored for sectoring. The remainder of the colony was left for 1 to 4 d to form a visible colony in situ. The visible colony was then sampled, plated, and scored for sectoring (see &#x0201c;whole microcolony analysis&#x0201d; above).</p></sec><sec id="s3a7"><title>Competition experiments</title><p>M9 lactose liquid cultures of Lac<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> point-mutant and <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells were grown (separately) to saturation, then mixed in various proportions, and 0.5 &#x003bc;l of the mixed cell suspensions was put onto the surface of prescavenged lactose plates and grown into visible colonies. These &#x0201c;pseudocolonies&#x0201d; were suspended, and cells were spread on LBH X-gal rif plates at 100 to 200 cells per plate and scored for sectoring blue phenotypes after 2 d growth.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The Swiss-Prot ( <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/</ext-link>) and Ecogene ( <ext-link xlink:href="http://bmb.med.miami.edu/EcoGene/EcoWeb/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bmb.med.miami.edu/EcoGene/EcoWeb/</ext-link>) accession numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are <italic>cat</italic> (Swiss-Prot P62577), <italic>codA</italic> (Swiss-Prot P25524), DNA Pol I (Swiss-Prot P00582), DNA Pol IV/<italic>dinB</italic> (Swiss-Prot Q47155), <italic>fadAB</italic> (Swiss-Prot P21177), <italic>malB (</italic>Swiss-Prot P02943), <italic>gfp-mut2</italic> (Swiss-Prot P42212), <italic>lac</italic> (Swiss-Prot P00722 and P03023), <italic>recA</italic> (Swiss-Prot P03017), <italic>recBC</italic> (Swiss-Prot P08394 and EcoGene EG10825), <italic>rpoS</italic> (Swiss-Prot P13445), <italic>ruvA</italic> (Ecogene EG10923), <italic>ruvB</italic> (Ecogene EG10924), <italic>ruvC</italic> (Ecogene EG10925), and <italic>sulA</italic> (Swiss-Prot P08846).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank H.
