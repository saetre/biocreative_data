Mutations or variants that impair function of RNase L, particularly R462Q, have been proposed as susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Given the role of this gene in viral defense, we sought to explore the possibility that a viral infection might contribute to prostate cancer in individuals harboring the R462Q variant. A viral detection DNA microarray composed of oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved sequences of all known viruses identified the presence of gammaretroviral sequences in cDNA samples from seven of 11 R462Q-homozygous (QQ) cases, and in one of eight heterozygous (RQ) and homozygous wild-type (RR) cases. An expanded survey of 86 tumors by specific RT-PCR detected the virus in eight of 20 QQ cases (40&#x00025;), compared with only one sample (1.5&#x00025;) among 66 RQ and RR cases. The full-length viral genome was cloned and sequenced independently from three positive QQ cases. The virus, named XMRV, is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), but its sequence is clearly distinct from all known members of this group. Comparison of <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> sequences from different tumor isolates suggested infection with the same virus in all cases, yet sequence variation was consistent with the infections being independently acquired. Analysis of prostate tissues from XMRV-positive cases by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that XMRV nucleic acid and protein can be detected in about 1&#x00025; of stromal cells, predominantly fibroblasts and hematopoietic elements in regions adjacent to the carcinoma. These data provide to our knowledge the first demonstration that xenotropic MuLV-related viruses can produce an authentic human infection, and strongly implicate RNase L activity in the prevention or clearance of infection in vivo. These findings also raise questions about the possible relationship between exogenous infection and cancer development in genetically susceptible individuals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men over the age of 50. Several genetic factors have been proposed as potential risk factors for the development of prostate cancer, including a viral defense gene called <italic>RNASEL</italic>. A common genetic variant in this gene, R462Q, was recently implicated in up to 13&#x00025; of prostate cancer cases. Given the antiviral role of <italic>RNASEL,</italic> the authors sought to examine if a virus might be present in prostate cancers associated with the R462Q variant. Using a DNA microarray designed to detect all known viral families, the authors identified a novel virus, named XMRV, in a subset of prostate tumor samples. Polymerase chain reaction testing of 86 prostate tumors for the presence of XMRV revealed a strong association between the presence of the virus and being homozygous for the R462Q variant. Cloning and sequencing of the virus showed that XMRV is a close relative of several known xenotropic murine leukemia viruses. This report presents the first documented cases of human infection with a xenotropic retrovirus.

While sporadic prostate cancer displays an age-related increase in prevalence, familial prostate cancer kindreds often display early-onset disease. Such kindreds, defined by having more than three affected members per family, account for 43&#x00025; of early onset cases (&#x0003c;55 years old) and 9&#x00025; of all cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The genetics of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) is complex, and several genes have been proposed as susceptibility factors in this syndrome.

Remarkably, a large, controlled sib-pair study implicated the R462Q RNase L variant in up to 13&#x00025; of unselected prostate cancer cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

This led us to consider the possibility that the putative linkage of RNase L alterations to HPC might reflect enhanced susceptibility to a viral agent. To test this hypothesis, we have examined RNA derived from wild-type and RNase L variant (R462Q) prostate tumors for evidence of viral sequences, by hybridization to a DNA microarray composed of the most conserved sequences of all known human, animal, plant, and bacterial viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we report that 40&#x00025; (eight of 20) of all tumors homozygous for the R462Q allele harbored the genome of a distinct gammaretrovirus closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). In contrast, retroviral sequences were present in &#x0003c;2&#x00025; of tumors bearing at least one copy of the wild-type allele (one of 66). In addition, virus-harboring cells were detected within infected prostatic tumor tissues by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). These findings represent the first detection of xenotropic MuLV&#x02013;like agents in humans, and reveal a strong association between infection with the virus and defects in RNase L activity. The relation of retroviral infection to prostate cancer will require further study, but a cofactor role is not excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detection of XMRV by Microarray-Based Screening</title><p>To search for potential viruses in prostate cancer tumors, we employed a DNA microarray-based strategy designed to screen for viruses from all known viral families &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Total or polyadenylated RNA extracted from tumor tissue was first amplified and fluorescently labeled in a sequence-nonspecific fashion. The amplified and labeled fragments, which contained host as well as potential viral sequences, were then hybridized to a DNA microarray (Virochip, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, United States) bearing the most conserved sequences of ~950 fully sequenced NCBI reference viral genomes (~11,000 70-mer oligonucleotides).</p><p>The Virochip was used to screen RNA samples isolated from prostate tumors of 19 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A positive hybridization signal suggestive of a gammaretrovirus was detected in seven of 11 tumors from patients homozygous for the R462Q <italic>RNASEL</italic> variant (QQ). In contrast, no virus was detected in three tumors from RQ heterozygotes, and only one of five tumors from RR individuals was positive. Clustering of the microarray oligonucleotide intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g001">Figure 1</xref>) revealed a similar hybridization pattern in all positive cases. Furthermore, a computational analysis using E-Predict, a recently described algorithm for viral species identification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, suggested that the same or similar mammalian gammaretrovirus was present in all positive tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-st001">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the Virochip detected the presence of a probable gammaretrovirus in half of the QQ tumor samples and in only one non-QQ sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Characterization of XMRV Genome</title><p>To further characterize the virus, we recovered its entire genome from one of the tumors (VP35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To obtain viral clones, we first employed a direct microarray recovery technique described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, amplified nucleic acid from the tumor tissue, which hybridized to viral microarray oligonucleotides, was eluted from two specific spots. The eluted DNA was re-amplified, and plasmid libraries constructed from this material were screened by colony hybridization using the spots' oligonucleotides as probes. The array oligonucleotides used in this case derived from the LTR region of murine type C retrovirus (MTCR) and spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The largest recovered fragment was 415 nt in length, and had 96&#x00025; nt identity to the LTR region of MTCR, a MuLV identified in the genome of a mouse myeloma cell line (T. Heinemeyer, unpublished data). These findings established that the virus in question was indeed a gammaretrovirus, and likely a relative of MuLVs. To clone and sequence the rest of the viral genome from sample VP35, we used tumor cDNA to PCR-amplify overlapping segments using primers derived from MTCR; gaps were closed using primers from earlier recovered clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-st002">Table S2</xref>). Using a similar strategy, we have also determined the full sequence of the virus from a second tumor, VP42. Finally, a complete viral genomic sequence from a third tumor case, VP62, was obtained by PCR amplification of two ~4 Kb&#x02013;long overlapping fragments jointly spanning close to the entire length of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The three sequenced genomes share &#x0003e;98&#x00025; nt identity overall and &#x0003e;99&#x00025; amino acid (aa) identity for predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and thus represent the same virus.</p><p>The full genome of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-sg001">S1</xref>) is 8,185 nt long and is distinct from all known isolates of MuLV. The genome is most similar to the genomes of exogenous MuLVs, DG-75 cloned from a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and MTCR, with which it shares 94&#x00025; and 93&#x00025; overall nt sequence identity, respectively.

Phylogenetic trees constructed using available mammalian type C retroviral genomes and representative full-length proviral sequences from the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-sg002">S2</xref>) showed that the newly identified virus is more similar to xenotropic and polytropic than to ecotropic genomes. Based on these findings we propose the provisional name Xenotropic MuLV-related virus (XMRV) for this agent.</p><p>Translation of the XMRV genomic sequence using ORF Finder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; identified two overlapping ORFs coding for the full-length Gag-Pro-Pol and Env polyproteins. No exogenous coding sequences, such as viral oncogenes, could be detected in the XMRV genome. The predicted Gag polyprotein is 536 aa long and is most similar to a xenotropic provirus on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. musculus</named-content> Chromosome 9, with which it shares 97&#x00025; aa identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A).

An amber (UAG) stop codon separates the Gag and Pro-Pol coding sequences, analogous to other MuLVs in which a translational read-through is required to generate the full-length Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Similar to other MuLVs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, the Env polyprotein of XMRV is in a different reading frame compared with Gag-Pro-Pol.

Distinct FISH-positive cells were observed in the tumors positive for XMRV by RT-PCR (e.g., VP62 and VP88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To identify cell types associated with the positive FISH signal, the same sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E).

While the XMRV nucleic acid was usually present within nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020025-sv001">Video S1</xref>), suggesting integrated proviral DNA, some cells showed cytoplasmic staining adjacent to the nucleus, suggestive of viral mRNA and/or pre-integration complexes in non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020025-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p><p>We also used FISH to obtain a minimal estimate of the frequency of XMRV-infected prostatic cells. For this purpose we employed a tissue microarray containing duplicates of 14 different prostate cancer tissue specimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020025-t002">Table 2</xref>). FISH with DNA probes derived from XMRV VP35 showed five to ten XMRV/FISH&#x02013;positive cells (about 1&#x00025; of prostate cells observed) in each of five homozygous RNase L 462Q (QQ) cases: VP29, 31, 42, 62, and 88. Patient sample VP79, also a QQ case, contained two positive cells (0.4&#x00025; of total cells examined). All of the XMRV/FISH&#x02013;positive cells observed were stromal cells. In contrast, three RR tissue samples and two RQ tissue samples showed one or no (&#x0003c;0.15&#x00025;) FISH-positive cells. Two of the QQ cases, VP35 and VP90, positive by <italic>gag</italic> RT-PCR, showed only one FISH-positive cell each (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020025-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Thus, consistent with the microarray and RT-PCR data, detection of XMRV by FISH was associated primarily with QQ cases. In addition, in samples where XMRV was detected, all positive cells were stromal and did not account for more than 1&#x00025; of all prostatic cells. Finally, differences in the numbers of XMRV-positive cells detected in the different samples could be due to heterogeneity in virus copy numbers between different patients and/or specific regions of the prostate sampled.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Detection of XMRV in Tumor-Bearing Prostatic Tissues Using IHC</title><p>To identify cells expressing XMRV proteins, we assayed for the presence of Gag protein using a monoclonal antibody against (SFFV); this antibody is reactive against Gag proteins from a wide range of different ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MuLV strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.

Parallel RT-PCR studies of prostate tumors from wild-type (RR) and heterozygous (RQ) patients revealed evidence of XMRV in only one of 66 samples, clearly demonstrating that human XMRV infection is strongly linked to decrements in RNase L activity. This result supports the view that the R462Q RNase L variant leads to a subtle defect in innate (IFN-dependent) antiviral immunity.</p><p>As its name indicates, XMRV is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). Unlike ecotropic MuLVs, such as the canonical Moloney MuLV, which grow only in rodent cells in culture, xenotropic MuLVs can grow in non-rodent cells in culture but not in rodent cell lines. Xenotropic viruses have been isolated from many inbred as well as wild mouse strains. Studies of the distribution of non-ecotropic sequences in different mouse strains show that the diversity of xenotropic proviral sequences in wild mice is greater than that found in the inbred laboratory strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;.

XPR1 is expressed in all higher vertebrates, including mice, but polymorphisms in the murine gene render it unable to mediate xenotropic MuLV entry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, xenotropic MuLVs have a potential to infect a wide variety of mammalian species, including humans.</p><p>Xenotropic MuLVs have occasionally been detected in cultured human cell lines. For example, MuLV DG-75 was cloned from a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and an infectious xenotropic MuLV was detected in a human small cell lung cancer line NCI-417 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Although laboratory contamination, either in culture or during passage of cell lines in nude mice, cannot be ruled out as a possible source in these cases, such contamination cannot explain our results. The evidence for this is as follows: (i) XMRV was detected in primary human tissues; (ii) no murine sequences (e.g., GAPDH) could be detected in our materials by PCR; (iii) infection was predominantly restricted to human samples with the QQ <italic>RNASEL</italic> genotype; (iv) polymorphisms were found in the XMRV clones recovered from different patients consistent with independent acquisition of the virus by these individuals; and (v) viral nucleic acids and antigens could be detected in infected QQ prostate tissue by FISH and IHC, respectively. Taken together, the above evidence argues strongly against laboratory contamination with virus or cloned DNA material as the source of XMRV infection in the analyzed samples. To our knowledge, this report represents the first published examples of authentic infection of humans with a xenotropic MuLV-like agent. Although our efforts to clone the sites of XMRV integration into the host genome have been limited by the small amounts of prostate tissue available for this purpose, our work to clone such sites is ongoing and will provide an important additional piece of evidence for XMRV infection in humans.</p><p>The XMRV sequence is not found in human genomic DNA, and none of the human endogenous retroviruses, including the only known gammaretrovirus-like human endogenous sequences (hERVs E and T) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;, bare any significant similarity to the XMRV genome. This indicates that XMRV must have been acquired exogenously by infection in positive subjects. From what reservoir and by what route such infections were acquired is unknown. It seems unlikely that direct contact with feral mice could explain the observed distribution of infection in our cohort, since there is no reason to believe that rodent exposure would vary according to <italic>RNASEL</italic> genotype. It is possible that infection is more widespread than indicated by the present studies, especially if, as seems likely, individuals with the wild-type RNase L clear infection more promptly than those with the QQ genotype. But if so, a cross-species transfer model of XMRV infection would require improbably high levels of rodent exposure for a developed society like our own. Thus, although the viral sequence suggests that the ultimate reservoir of XMRV is probably the rodent, the proximate source of the infection seems unlikely to be mice or rats. Provisionally, we favor the notion that the XMRV infections we have documented were acquired from other humans, i.e., that XMRV may have been resident in the human population for some time. This speculation will, however, require direct epidemiologic validation. It also remains to be determined if RNase L R462Q homozygotes are more sensitive to the acquisition of infection, or are simply less likely to clear infection once acquired. This is an important issue, since if the latter model is correct, it would imply that in younger humans, XMRV prevalence may be higher than what is observed in our prostate cancer cohort (mean age 58.7 y). We are currently developing serologic assays for use in population-based studies that should shed light on these matters.</p><p>While presented work documents a clear link of XMRV infection to RNase L deficiency, we emphasize that the data we have accumulated does not mandate any etiological link to prostate cancer. Furthermore, our finding that XMRV infection is targeted to stromal cells and not to carcinoma cells and the fact that the XMRV genome harbors no host-derived oncogenes rule out two classical models for retroviral oncogenesis: direct introduction of a dominantly acting oncogene and insertional activation of such a gene. However, more indirect contributions of the virus to the tumor can certainly be envisioned. Recent work has shown that stromal cells have an active role in directly promoting tumorigenesis of adjacent epithelial cells by producing various cytokines and growth factors that serve as proliferative signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d; or indirectly by modifying the tumor microenvironment by promotion of angiogenesis or recruitment of inflammatory mediators leading to oxidative stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulate growth of human prostatic epithelial cells and alter their histology in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020025-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;. It is conceivable that XMRV-infected prostatic stromal cells could produce and secrete growth factors, cytokines or other factors that stimulate cell proliferation or promote oxidative stress in surrounding epithelia. Such a paracrine mechanism could still function quite efficiently even with the relatively small number of XMRV-infected cells that characterize the lesion.</p><p>Finally, we note that the identification of an exogenous infection such as XMRV could help explain why not all genetic studies have consistently identified RNase L as a prostate cancer susceptibility factor. If such an infection were linked, however indirectly, to prostate cancer risk, and if the prevalence of infection is not uniform in different populations, populations with low XMRV prevalence might be expected to show no association of <italic>RNASEL</italic> lesions to prostate cancer.</p><p>Clearly, resolution of these issues will require much further investigation. We need to determine the prevalence of XMRV infection in the general population, understand its routes of transmission and tissue tropism, explore its associations with pre-maligant and other prostatic conditions, and define the biochemical interactions of the virus with the 2&#x02013;5A/RNase L system. The availability of molecular clones, infectious virus stocks, and susceptible cell culture systems should greatly enhance our ability to probe these and other questions in the near future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genotyping of patients, and prostate tissue processing.</title><p>All human samples used in this study were obtained according to protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic's Institutional Review Board.
