This mechanism is well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c1">1</xref>). It plays an established role in the release of torsion stress adjacent to replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c2">2</xref>) and transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c3">3</xref>), and may also be involved in DNA-recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c4">4</xref>), DNA-damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c5">5</xref>), DNA-repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c10">10</xref>) and chromosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c11">11</xref>). It is unclear, how inside a living cell the enzyme is assigned to these diverse tasks and how they are orchestrated with complex nuclear processes and higher-order chromatin structure.</p><p>According to X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c12">12</xref>) and biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c14">14</xref>) topo I is organized into four domains: N-terminal domain (Met<sup>1</sup>-Gly<sup>214</sup>), core (Ile<sup>215</sup>-Ala<sup>635</sup>), linker (Pro<sup>636</sup>-Lys<sup>712</sup>) and C-terminal domain (Gln<sup>713</sup>-Phe<sup>765</sup>). The last three domains constitute the minimal active unit of the enzyme. Together, they form a clamp-like structure carrying out the basic type I topoisomerase reactions, such as relaxation of supercoiled plasmid-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c15">15</xref>). The function of the N-terminal domain is less clear, because this portion has eluded structural analysis until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c14">14</xref>). It is not essential for DNA-relaxation activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>). On the other hand, evolution has preserved a similar, though mainly genetically divergent domain in all type IB topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c19">19</xref>), suggesting that it is essential&#x02014;albeit in a manner not readily apparent <italic>in vitro</italic> or delineated by sequence motifs.</p><p>Some functions of the N-terminal domain are known: it serves as a docking place for interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c23">23</xref>). It contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c25">25</xref>) and putative target sequences for protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c27">27</xref>). It influences the distribution of the enzyme in the cell and in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c29">29</xref>). These features suggest that the N-terminal domain provides some kind of a handle by which the catalytic machinery of topo I is controlled and directed <italic>in vivo</italic>. More recent evidence suggests that the N-terminal domain could also be involved in the catalytic process itself. It has been observed that a fragment lacking more or less the entire N-terminal domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;206) has catalytic properties <italic>in vitro</italic> that are slightly different from full-length topo I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>), whereas this is not the case for a fragment lacking at the N-terminal end 16 amino acids less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c17">17</xref>). Consistent with this, two recent X-ray crystallography studies extending the structure until Gln<sup>201</sup> revealed interactions between Trp<sup>203</sup> and His<sup>346</sup>, and between Trp<sup>205</sup>, Trp<sup>206</sup> and the flexible hinge, which may be important for proper closing of the enzyme around its DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c31">31</xref>). Thus, a region within the N-terminal domain of human topo I spanning approximately residues 190&#x02013;210 seems to play a role in the mechanism of DNA-catalysis, although it is not part of the genetically conserved minimal active unit of the enzyme. On the other hand, the covalent topo I-DNA cleavage complex is equally stabilized by camptothecin <italic>in vitro</italic>, irrespective of the presence or absence of the first 206 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address the question of what role this region plays in the functioning of human topo I inside a living cell. For this purpose we removed, at the N-terminal end, either 190 or 210 amino acid residues, and established human cell lines expressing bio-fluorescent chimera of these truncated enzymes. We used a bicistronic expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c32">32</xref>), conferring stable and permanent expression of the fluorescent enzymes at levels similar to that of endogenous topo I. Recently this approach has allowed us to investigate localization, mobility and DNA-interactions of full-length human topo I in substructures of the living cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>). By this same approach, we show here that human topo I lacking amino acids 190&#x02013;210 does not interact in a catalytic manner with the DNA inside a living cell, although it is active <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructs and cell culture</title><p>Cell lines supporting stable expression of fusion proteins of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and variants of topo I followed published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>). Briefly, GFP-chimera of full-length human topo I, of the N-terminally truncated fragments topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup>, topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> and of the active site mutant topo I<sup>Phe723</sup> were stably expressed in the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (German Collection of Micro organisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) using the bicistronic expression vector pMC-2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c32">32</xref>), in which the translational initiation of the selection marker puromycin-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl transferase in the second cistron is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site from poliovirus. Since the N-terminally truncated versions of topo I lack a NLS, PCR-primers were supplemented with the NLS of SV40 (PKKKRKV), thus generating amino acid sequences <bold>YK</bold>-RWTRPPKKKRKVPP-<bold>K</bold><sup>190</sup><bold>K</bold><sup>191</sup> and <bold>YK</bold>-RWTRPPKKKRKVPP-<bold>R</bold><sup>210</sup><bold>Y</bold><sup>211</sup> for GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup> and GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup>, respectively. (The last amino acids of GFP and the first ones of topo I are indicated in bold letters.) Cells grown in DMEM supplemented with Glutamax-I (Gibco BRL&#x0002f;Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) were transfected using Lipofectamine (Gibco BRL&#x0002f;Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). Stable transgenic cell lines were selected after 2 days with 0.35 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> puromycin and maintained under selection. We have ascertained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>) that (i) the GFP-chimera were not heavily over-expressed, (ii) the chimeric genes were not rearranged, (iii) green fluorescence of the cells could be unambiguously assigned to constitutive expression of the intended proteins and (iv) dose response to camptothecin was equal for GFP&#x02013;topo I and endogenous topo I.</p></sec><sec><title>Life cell imaging</title><p>For confocal imaging and for measurements of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we used a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. A CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled on-stage heated cell chamber and a heated 63x&#x0002f;1.4 NA oil-immersion objective were used, thus allowing culturing of the cells under the microscope at 37&#x000b0;C. For FRAP measurements, fluorescent images of a single optical section were taken at 1.6 s time intervals before (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) and after bleaching of a circular area at 20 mW nominal laser power with three iterations. Imaging scans were acquired with the laser power attenuated to 0.1&#x02013;1&#x00025; of the bleaching intensity. For a quantitative analysis of FRAP, fluorescence intensities of the bleached region and the entire cell nucleus were measured at each time point. Data were corrected for extra-cellular background intensity and for the overall loss in total intensity as a result of the bleach pulse itself and of the imaging scans. The relative intensity of the bleached area <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>rel</italic></sub> was calculated according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c34">34</xref>). We ascertained that FRAP results were independent of the expression level of GFP&#x02013;topo I, in as much as we failed to detect any differences in FRAP between individual cells exhibiting strong or weak GFP fluorescence within a cell population expressing the same construct.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Endogenous topo I and GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> from the same batch of transfected 293 cells were purified as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c36">36</xref>) and summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>A. Endogenous topo I was adsorbed from nuclear extracts (330 mM NaCl) to Ni-NTA&#x02013;Sepharose (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany), eluted from there with 200 mM imidazol, then adsorbed to phenyl&#x02013;Sepharose (Amersham-Pharmacia-Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) in the presence of 0.9 M ammonium sulfate, and finally eluted from the latter resin with buffer lacking ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was thus purified to apparent homogeneity and had the expected size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B, lane 3). GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> present in the same nuclear extracts was separated from endogenous topo I, as it did not bind to Ni-NTA&#x02013;Sepharose. It was recovered from the effluent of the Ni-NTA column by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (as described above) and further purified by adsorption to heparin&#x02013;Sepharose (Amersham-Pharmacia-Biotech, Freiburg, Germany), followed by elution with 800 mM NaCl. In the final eluate endogenous topo I or topo II were absent and GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> constituted &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B, lane 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>We analyzed either nuclear extracts, or whole cell lysates.

Material equivalent to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells was then applied to each slot of an SDS-gel (8&#x00025; polyacrylamide). After electrophoresis, proteins were electro-blotted onto PVDF-membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MD). The membranes were subsequently blocked with PBS, containing 2&#x00025; BSA, 0.05&#x00025; Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies diluted with the same buffer. Topo I was stained with rabbit peptide antibodies against the last 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the human enzyme (Genosys, Cambridge, UK). GFP was stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). After washing, the filters were incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies diluted with PBS containing 2&#x00025; BSA and 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20. Following extensive washing with the same buffer, labelled protein bands were finally visualized with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). For immuno-band depletion, cells were first incubated with camptothecin (20 min) and the same concentration of drug was also added to the lysis buffer. Immuno-band depletion assays with nuclear extracts were carried out under the same conditions as plasmid-relaxation assays (see next paragraph), with the exception that 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml calf thymus DNA was added to the reaction and the reaction product was applied to an SDS-protein gel instead of an agarose DNA-gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequential salt extraction of nuclei</title><p>Exponentially growing cells were harvested, sedimented (600 <italic>g</italic>, 3 min), carefully resuspended (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells&#x0002f;3 ml) in lysis buffer &#x0005b;10&#x00025; sucrose, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EGTA, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 30 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> spermine, 7.5 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> spermidine, 5 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> leupeptin, 5 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> pepstatin A, 10 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> aprotinin, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM PMSF&#x0005d;, and incubated for 5 min on ice to allow for cell swelling.

This conflicts with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c25">25</xref>) claiming the N-terminal domain to be required for nucleolar localization&#x02014;an issue addressed in a recently published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c28">28</xref>).</p><p>Here, we will concentrate on the effects of camptothecin on the nuclear distribution and the mobility of these constructs, which are demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>A, right and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>B, respectively. For the understanding of these data one must keep in mind that camptothecin binds and stabilizes covalent catalytic DNA-intermediates of topo I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c37">37</xref>). Therefore, it renders GFP-chimera of topo I less mobile in the cell. This can be measured by FRAP. Such experiments have revealed recently that camptothecin targets topo I preferentially in the nucleoplasm, thus shifting the enzyme&#x02019;s nuclear distribution equilibrium away from the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>). Both effects &#x0005b;nucleolar de-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c39">39</xref>) and nucleoplasmic immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>)&#x0005d; require topo I to be active in the cell nucleus. Therefore, the two phenomena can be used as criteria for judging topo I cleavage activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The effect of camptothecin on the localization of the various topo I constructs can be gauged by comparing the middle and right columns of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>A, where GFP-fluorescence of the same set of cells is shown before and after exposure to the drug. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>B shows corresponding FRAP curves determined in the nucleoplasm of cells treated with camptothecin (closed symbols) or not (open symbols). It is apparent that full-length GFP&#x02013;topo I became depleted from the nucleoli in response to camptothecin, and that FRAP was much faster without camptothecin than with the drug present. This confirms our previous observation that camptothecin renders topo I less mobile in the nucleoplasm, and thus induces nucleolar depletion of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>). In contrast, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>Phe723</sup> was not affected by camptothecin with respect to its localization, and FRAP curves of the active site mutant were virtually the same with and without the drug. This observation fits the fact that in lack of the active site tyrosine, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>Phe723</sup> does not form covalent DNA-intermediates to be targeted by camptothecin. The construct with a partial truncation of the N-terminal domain (GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup>) was affected by camptothecin in the same fashion as the full-length enzyme. It was depleted from the nucleoli and became less mobile in the nucleoplasm. Similar results were also obtained with constructs lacking even smaller portions of the N-terminal domain (not shown). In contrast, the construct lacking the entire N-terminal domain (GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup>) was hardly affected by camptothecin. It was not depleted from the nucleoli by camptothecin, and its mobility in the nucleoplasm was almost the same with or without the drug.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic>, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> has the same DNA-relaxation activity and the same sensitivity to camptothecin as full-length topo I at physiologically relevant salt concentrations</title><p>These findings suggested two alternative interpretations: (i) GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> is not performing cleavage; (ii) GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> is actively cleaving DNA, but resistant to camptothecin. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first determined whether GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> was actively cleaving DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup> and GFP&#x02013;topo I have the same sensitivity towards camptothecin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>B). Moreover, GFP&#x02013;topo I and endogenous topo I are known to respond equally well to camptothecin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c33">33</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup> behaves similar to endogenous topo I, at least with respect to camptothecin. Therefore, endogenous topo I is a suitable control for the <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of the cleavage activity of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup>. Following this strategy, we purified from the same batch of nuclear extract GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> and endogenous topo I, and compared the two enzyme varieties with respect to DNA-relaxation activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>A outlines the purification strategy and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B and C demonstrate the outcome with respect to enzyme purity. The top panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B shows the result of SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by protein staining. It can be seen that endogenous topo I (lane 3) was purified to apparent homogeneity similar to recombinant human topo I produced in yeast (lane 1), whereas GFP&#x02013;topoI<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (lane 2) was &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70&#x00025; pure. Immuno-blotting with topo I antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B, middle) demonstrates that the major bands were indeed topo I, that the three preparations had a similar concentration of topo I, and that the enzymes were mostly not degraded. GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (lane 2) appeared to be marginally larger than endogenous topo I. This feature was employed to exclude a contamination with endogenous topo I. First, we extended electrophoresis time to separate GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> and endogenous topo I more clearly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>C, compare lanes 2 and 3). Secondly, we mixed GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> and endogenous topo I and demonstrated that we could separate the two proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>C, lane 4). Thus, we would have detected a significant contamination of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> with endogenous topo I by a double band. It should be noted that proteolysis in the linker domain would not show up in these blots, because they were probed with a serum against a C-terminal peptide of topo I. However, such fragments would reconstitute the so-called Core &#x0002b; C-terminus-topo I known to have a reduced sensitivity to camptothecin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c16">16</xref>). Thus, they would not interfere with the camptothecin assays shown below, because they would be less active and not a likely cause of false positive results. Immunoblotting with GFP antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B, bottom) shows that GFP&#x02013;topoI<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (lane 2) was almost entirely separated from endogenous topo I (lane 3), which contained only insignificant contaminations of GFP-positive material. By immunoblotting with topo II-antibodies we have also ascertained that none of these preparations was contaminated with type II topoisomerases (not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>D shows a comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-relaxation activity of the enzymes, determined by the limiting dilution of DNA-relaxation endpoints (left) and by relaxation kinetics obtained with equivalent enzyme amounts (right). By both approaches, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (bottom) had the same <italic>in vitro</italic> activity as endogenous full-length topo I prepared from the same batch of nuclear extract (middle), whereas recombinant human topo I produced in yeast (top) was slightly less active, which represents an established finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c36">36</xref>). Thus, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> relaxes supercoiled DNA as efficient as endogenous topo I under low salt conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it has been suggested that the N-terminal domain is important for DNA binding, and that topo I lacking the first 206 amino acids has a lower salt optimum than full-length enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>), raising the possibility that GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> is inactive at physiological salt concentrations. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>E shows a comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-relaxation activity of the enzymes in the presence of increasing concentrations of KCl (50&#x02013;400 mM). Salt optima were determined at low (left), medium (middle) or high (right) enzyme concentrations. At high enzyme concentrations, recombinant human topo I (top) and endogenous full-length topo I (middle) exhibited the same relaxation activity. At low enzyme concentrations, both exhibited their optimum at 200 mM KCl. In contrast, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (bottom) was less active at high salt concentrations and had its optimum at 150 mM KCl. These observations are consistent with the notion that the N-terminal domain plays a role in DNA binding. To further corroborate this finding, we compared the salt stability of the binding to nuclear structures between GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> and GFP&#x02013;topo I. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>F shows a sequential salt extraction (100&#x02013;400 mM NaCl) of nuclei from 293 cells expressing either GFP&#x02013;topo I (top) or GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (bottom). Fitting the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>B, the nuclear binding of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> was less salt stable than that of full-length GFP&#x02013;topo I. The major fraction of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> was extracted with 250&#x02013;300 mM NaCl, whereas GFP&#x02013;topo I remained stably bound until 300 mM NaCl. In conclusion, we find that topo I lacking the entire N-terminal domain is more salt sensitive and better extractable from the nuclear structure than the full-length enzyme. However, these alterations are not apparent at salt concentrations encountered inside a living cell under physiological conditions, and, therefore, should not play a crucial role.</p><p>Consequently, we considered the alternative hypothesis of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> being resistant to camptothecin, and investigated if DNA cleavage by this enzyme was stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by the drug. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>G demonstrates nicking of a double stranded DNA-plasmid in the presence of camptothecin as a function of topo I concentration. DNA cleavage by endogenous topo I (middle section) and GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (right section) was significantly stimulated by camptothecin, and it can be seen clearly that in this respect the two sets of enzyme had a capacity similar to each other and also similar to recombinant human topo I produced in yeast (left section). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>H demonstrates nicking of plasmid-DNA by the three sets of enzymes as a function of camptothecin concentration. It shows that GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (right), endogenous topo I (middle) and the recombinant human enzyme (left) had a similar sensitivity to the drug <italic>in vitro</italic>. Again we needed to take into account that topo I becomes more sensitive to salt, when lacking the entire N-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>). To exclude this as a possible reason for the apparent camptothecin resistance of the enzyme inside the cell, we measured camptothecin-induced DNA-nicking <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of increasing concentrations of KCl (50&#x02013;150 mM) or KGlu (33&#x02013;100 mM), the latter resembling most closely the physiological intracellular saline milieu. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>I (right section) demonstrates that <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA cleavage by GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> was not affected by KCl (top) or KGlu (bottom) within a concentration range to be encountered inside a living cell under physiological conditions. In summary, we concluded from these data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>D&#x02013;I) that <italic>in vitro</italic> and at optimal salt concentrations GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> was indistinguishable from endogenous topo I or the full-length recombinant human enzyme in as much as it was neither inactive, nor resistant to camptothecin. These <italic>in vitro</italic>-observations conform to the established finding that the N-terminal domain influences the salt sensitivity of topo I to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>), but otherwise is mostly dispensable for the catalytic action of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c1">1</xref>), and that linkage to GFP does not appear to influence enzymatic properties of topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup><italic>in vitro</italic>. These observations are however in striking contrast to the behavior of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup><italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>By a comparable assay, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> is sensitive to camptothecin <italic>in vitro</italic>, but resistant <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The most plausible hypothesis explaining the discrepancy of data obtained with GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup><italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>A and B) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f2">2</xref>D&#x02013;I) would be that the innermost part of the N-terminal domain (i.e. the region spanning residues 190&#x02013;210) is crucially required for the activity and&#x0002f;or the camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme inside the living cell, whereas it is dispensable for these properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. We corroborated this notion by comparing camptothecin sensitivity of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup><italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> by immuno-band depletion, a biochemical assay that can be carried out in a similar manner with intact cells (i.e. <italic>in vivo</italic>) and with nuclear extracts supplemented with a surrogate of genomic DNA (i.e. <italic>in vitro</italic>). In both constellations, the enzyme will be trapped in large DNA&#x02013;protein complexes upon addition of camptothecin, provided it is capable of interacting with DNA and sensitive to the drug. Thus, the active and camptothecin-sensitive fraction of the enzyme will be prevented from entering an SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel, and consequently will not be detectable in subsequent immuno-blotting. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f3">3</xref> demonstrates a dose response curve obtained by treating a mixture of 293 cells expressing equal amounts of either GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> or full-length GFP&#x02013;topo I with various concentrations of camptothecin, and a similar <italic>in vitro</italic> curve obtained by treating nuclear extracts of such cells substituted with calf thymus DNA. Inside the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f3">3</xref>, left), GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> (the lower band) was completely resistant to camptothecin, since it was not depleted upon exposing the cells to concentrations of the drug as high as 100 &#x000b5;M. In contrast, full-length GFP&#x02013;topo I (the upper band) was completely lost from the blots at concentrations higher than 1 &#x000b5;M. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>A and B, GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>190&#x02013;765</sup> was also efficiently depleted at camptothecin concentrations &#x0003e;1 &#x000b5;M (not shown). A completely different situation was encountered <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f3">3</xref>, right). Here, full-length GFP&#x02013;topo I and GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> were both sensitive to camptothecin in a similar fashion. They both disappeared from the blot, when camptothecin was added to the assay at concentrations &#x0003e;1 &#x000b5;M. Taken together, these findings confirm that a region spanning residues 190&#x02013;210 is absolutely required for topo I to be targeted by camptothecin inside the living cell, whereas it is dispensable for this property <italic>in vitro.</italic></p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We show here that a fragment of human topo I lacking the entire N-terminal domain up to position 210 is not stabilized by camptothecin in covalent DNA-complexes inside a living cell, whereas <italic>in vitro</italic> it is targeted by camptothecin in the usual manner and retains full DNA-relaxation activity at physiologically relevant salt concentrations. This difference in behavior <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> is not shared with a fragment lacking the N-terminal domain up to residue 190 or smaller portions of it. Thus, our findings indicate residues 190&#x02013;209 of topo I to play a crucial role for the activity of the enzyme in its physiological environment. Unfortunately, topo I DNA-relaxation activity <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot be measured directly. It can only be approximated from camptothecin stabilized cleavage activity &#x0005b;using assays such as immuno-band depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c40">40</xref>), LM-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c41">41</xref>) or tardis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c42">42</xref>)&#x0005d;. Consequently, we cannot discriminate whether the apparent insensitivity of GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> to camptothecin indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg927f1">1</xref>A and B is due to inactivity or drug resistance, and whether residues 190&#x02013;209 are required for topo I to form covalent intermediates with genomic DNA, or just for camptothecin to bind and stabilize such complexes in the cell.</p><p>The latter possibility, however, seems unlikely, since all residues and portions of topo I known to confer camptothecin resistance at the cellular level are placed around the active center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c43">43</xref>) or in the linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c16">16</xref>) and not in the N-terminal domain. In keeping with this, the X-ray crystal structure of the topo I-DNA cleavage complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c30">30</xref>) did not suggest a role for the N-terminal domain in the interplay between drug, DNA and topo I. Thus, resistance seems an unlikely explanation for the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> response of topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> to camptothecin. More likely, it seems that the enzyme has a dramatically reduced activity inside the living cell, when it lacks the N-terminal domain including residues 190&#x02013;210. This notion is also supported by the observation that GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> appears to be less toxic to the cells than full-length topo I, since heterologous expression of this fragment is tolerated at 4-fold higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c28">28</xref>).</p><p>This reasoning implies that a region ranging from residues 190&#x02013;210 of human topo I must somehow play a direct role in the catalytic cycle, and that this role is crucial <italic>in vivo</italic>, but not or only marginally so <italic>in vitro</italic>. It has been reported that <italic>in vitro</italic> the catalytic properties of topo I lacking the N-terminal domain up to position 206 are slightly different from those of the full-length enzyme. Most notably, DNA-relaxation is more distributive and <italic>trans</italic>-ligation to external DNA-pieces is impeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c18">18</xref>). In keeping with this, we observed here that GFP&#x02013;topo I<sup>210&#x02013;765</sup> is better salt extractable from the nuclear structure and its activity is more salt sensitive. These features could indicate a reduced binding affinity to DNA and other nuclear proteins, which suggests that removal of the entire N-terminal domain changes conformation of the enzyme in a global manner. This is plausible in the light of recent structural data proposing a physical contact of Trp<sup>203</sup> with His<sup>346</sup> and of Trp<sup>205</sup>, Trp<sup>206</sup> with the hinge region of the core domain, which determines flexibility of the enzyme clamp and allows for a control of strand rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c31">31</xref>). In synopsis, these findings suggest that in the absence of the entire N-terminal domain including region 190&#x02013;210, flexibility of topo I could be altered. Recent reconstitution experiments have shown that the &#x02018;cap&#x02019; of topo I (amino acid residues 175&#x02013;432) complements DNA cleavage by a portion of topo I comprising residues 433&#x02013;765 (&#x02018;&#x00394;cap&#x02019;&#x00029;, which lacks catalytic activity, although it contains all of the residues known to be important for catalysis and binds DNA with an affinity similar to that of the intact enzyme. These findings suggest that, when topo I binds DNA, two opposing lobes in the enzyme clamp tightly around the DNA helix to form the pre-cleavage complex, one of them being the &#x02018;cap&#x02019; and the other &#x02018;&#x00394;cap&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, only part of the &#x02018;cap&#x02019; (i.e. 210&#x02013;432) seems to be required <italic>in vitro</italic> for catalytic activity. However, considering the complexity of the DNA-structures encountered by topo I within the mammalian genome, and considering the highly limited space provided in the cell nucleus for the enzyme&#x02019;s interactions with these structures, one could imagine that <italic>in vivo</italic> the flexibility of the enzyme clamp might actually become a factor that limits DNA-interactions of topo I in a more general manner. Thus, it can well be that an enzyme lacking the entire N-terminal domain is altogether precluded from engaging in catalytic DNA-interactions inside the living cell because the flexibility of the enzyme clamp is improperly controlled, whereas this does not play a role, when the same enzyme fragment deals in a test tube with comparably simple substrate molecules such as DNA-plasmids or oligonucleotides. On the other hand, residues 190&#x02013;210 might contain interaction domains of nuclear proteins that position topo I in the nucleus and thus facilitate its activity in living cells. This view is clearly supported by the altered extractability of the truncated enzyme shown here, and by the striking observation that all proteins shown so far to interact with topo I bind the N-terminal domain. Moreover, some of these proteins have been shown to stimulate topo I activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and thus could be required for its functioning in the living cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg927c23">23</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg927f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Distribution, mobility and camptothecin sensitivity of various topo I-fragments, expressed as GFP-chimera in 293 cells.
