What kinds of changes at the level of the DNA are most important for the generation of phenotypic differences remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. One well-studied source of phenotypic diversity is mutation in gene regulatory regions that results in changes in gene expression, but what proportion of phenotypic diversity is due to such mutations is not entirely clear. We investigated the relative contribution to phenotypic diversity of mutations in protein-coding regions compared to mutations in gene regulatory sequences. Given the important regulatory role played by phosphorylation across biological systems, we focused on mutations in protein-coding regions that alter protein&#x02013;protein interactions involved in the binding of kinases to their substrate proteins. We studied the evolution of this &#x0201c;phosphoregulation&#x0201d; by analyzing the in vivo complement of phosphorylated proteins (the &#x0201c;phosphoproteome&#x0201d;) in three highly diverged yeast species&#x02014;the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>&#x02014;and integrating those data with existing data on thousands of known genetic interactions from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Sc. pombe</italic>. We show that kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions are altered at a rate that is at most two orders of magnitude slower than the alteration of transcription factor (TF)&#x02013;promoter interactions, whereas TFs and kinases both show a faster than average rate of functional divergence estimated by the cross-species analysis of genetic interactions. Our data provide a quantitative estimate of the relative frequencies of different kinds of functionally relevant mutations and demonstrate that, like mutations in gene regulatory regions, mutations that result in changes in kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions are an important source of phenotypic diversity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic variation, in the form of point mutations, gene duplication/loss, and recombination serves as the raw material upon which natural selection acts during the evolution of a species.

We identified 12 functional groups (e.g., cellular respiration, cell budding, pseudohyphal growth, vitamin metabolic process) and nine complexes (e.g., clathrin-associated complex, outer kinetochore complex, H&#x0002b; transporting v-ATPase, etc.) with significant cross-species variation in levels of phosphorylation ranging from 1.5 to 7 times the average number of phosphosites as expected by orthology.

One striking example of this is the phosphorylation of the pre-replication complex. Although the level of phosphorylation of this complex is conserved, the proteins that are phosphorylated have changed. For this complex, phosphorylation of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologs in <italic>Sc. pombe</italic> is less conserved than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.005, hypergeometric distribution), and vice-versa (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.04, hypergeometric distribution).</p><p>The orthology definitions used include cases of one-to-one assignments and also cases of one-to-many assignments due to species-specific gene duplication. For this reason, the functional groups mapped by orthology from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to the other fungal species do not necessarily have the same number of proteins in all species. Because of this, gene duplication could account for some of the observed changes in the average number of phosphosites per protein across species. To examine this, we analyzed the functions and complexes showing significant differences in phosphorylation levels that also show significant differences in the number of proteins assigned to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000134-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>), which applied to six out of 19 functional groups. However, even in these cases, it is clear that changes in the total numbers of proteins do not explain the changes in phosphorylation levels. For example, the expansion of a respiratory chain complex in <italic>C. albicans</italic> does not explain the observed differences in phosphorylation across the three species.</p><p>Because protein abundance biases and protein duplication account for only a small fraction of the observed variation in phosphorylation, we conclude that most of the changes in the groups identified here are due to the evolutionary gain or loss of phosphorylation sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Evolution of Phosphoregulation of Yeast Protein Complexes</title><p>Protein complexes are stable assemblies of proteins that cooperate in the cell to carry out specific functions, many of which are conserved across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000134-vanDam1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

We hypothesized that protein kinases, given their crucial regulatory role and transient interactions, could be an important source of phenotypic variability across species. To study this, we have experimentally determined phosphorylation sites by MS analysis for three yeast species (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>Sc. pombe</italic>) spanning 400 to 600 million years of evolution. We have used this information to estimate the global rates of change of phosphoproteins. Based on these rates, our estimated kinase&#x02013;substrate interaction changes are within an order of magnitude of previous estimates for gain or loss of interaction after gene duplication. Furthermore, kinase&#x02013;substrate interaction evolution is at most two orders of magnitude slower than TF&#x02013;promoter interactions. These observations are further supported by the comparative analysis of quantitative genetic interactions between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Sc. pombe</italic> genes. We observed a lower-than-average conservation of genetic interactions for protein kinases and TFs, suggesting that the observed divergence of phosphorylation correlates with functional changes of protein kinases. Interestingly the level of conservation of genetic interactions between kinases and their interaction partners is similar to that observed for TFs and the genes they bind to. However, it should be noted that the current overlap between genetic interactions and physical interactions for kinases and TFs is still small. Also, the different nature of physical interaction (protein&#x02013;DNA versus protein&#x02013;protein) could potentially result in differences in the genetic interactions observed between interacting partners. For these reasons, further studies are needed to determine the exact relative functional divergence rate.</p><p>Our results indicate that there is a high level of conservation of phosphorylation for different functional groups across the broad time scale studied. This would mean that even if individual kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions differ, the overall phosphorylation levels of a given functional group might be strongly predicted by homology. It is conceivable that this conservation of phosphorylation levels is maintained by physical proximity of kinases and substrates due to shared interaction partners or sub-cellular localization. Given that the in vivo targets of a protein kinase are determined, in large part, by factors other than its own substrate recognition (i.e., gene expression, localization, scaffolding, etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000134-Linding1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that differential association to kinases serves to maintain the levels of phosphorylation among different functional groups.</p><p>In this study, we have combined experimental phosphorylation information with computational methods to predict kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions and their evolution. We used this approach to study eight protein complexes that show significant changes in phosphorylation and we predict putative kinase regulators responsible for these observed changes. Analysis of well-studied pre-replication complexes showed that we predict known examples of conserved and divergent phosphoregulation. In addition to our analysis, the study of human phosphorylation sites has recently shown that highly conserved phosphorylation networks are associated to disease (C.S.H. Tan and R. Linding, personal communication).These results highlight the importance of studying the evolution of kinase regulation and our work offers a starting point for further studies.</p><p>Selection pressure acts on the preservation or acquisition of phenotypes, rather than the mechanisms by which these phenotypes are implemented.

The two prediction scores were obtained for all protein sequences in the genomes of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. bayanus</italic>, <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, <italic>S. castellii</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>, <italic>K. waltii</italic>, <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> and <italic>Sc. pombe</italic>. The prediction scores were benchmarked using the known phosphoproteins of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We plotted the ROC curve and determined the area under the ROC (AROC) curve for both methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000134.s004">Protocol S1</xref>). The LR method predicts phosphoproteins with an AROC of 0.69 while the GPS 2.0 method predicts phosphoproteins with an AROC of 0.73. For each complex, we selected the method that could best predict the phosphoproteins determined for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>Sc. pombe</italic> for that complex. The exact AROC values for each complex are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000134.s004">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Kinase&#x02013;Substrate Interaction Prediction for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Proteins</title><p>In order to predict kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins, we used a na&#x000ef;ve Bayes predictor integrating sequence based prediction of kinase interactions with available protein and genetic interaction data defined in the BioGRID database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000134-Stark1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> version number 2.0.43. Four features were used in the predictor: (1) substrate motifs enrichment LRs in putative target as determined above; (2) presence or absence of at least one phosphosite matching the kinase motif; (3) number of orthologs (from 0 to 2) in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and/or <italic>Sc. pombe</italic> with at least one phosphosite matching the kinase motif; and (4) the number of shared physical or genetic interactions partners in common between the kinase and the putative target. These four indicators were integrated using a na&#x000ef;ve Bayes algorithm, and its performance was evaluated by AROC using a set of 472 kinase&#x02013;substrate interactions curated from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000134-Fiedler1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> as our set of positive interactions.

For each complex, we selected (from the 116 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein kinases) the top five kinases predicted to regulate the complex for further analysis. These five kinases were then ranked on how well their substrate specificity explains the phosphorylation pattern of the complex subunits across the three species with available phosphorylation data. The ranking was done on the AROC value for phosphorylation prediction using the kinase&#x02013;substrate LRs predicted from their binding motifs as described above.
