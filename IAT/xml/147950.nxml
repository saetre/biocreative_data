The promoter contains a putative USF binding site which overlaps an antioxidant response element (ARE) located at -101 bp relative to the transcription start point. The USF/ARE composite element increases basal expression of the mouse MT-I gene, and partly mediates response to oxidative stress. However, other functions of this composite element and the in vivo roles for USF in MT-I promoter functions have not been examined. We report studies which indicate that USF participates via the USF/ARE element in cadmium responsiveness of the mouse MT-I promoter. During the course of these studies a second, higher affinity USF binding site at -223 bp was identified. Stable and transient transfection assays in mouse hepatoma cells, using the USF/ARE in the context of a minimal promoter and site-directed and truncation mutants of the MT-I promoter, revealed that the USF and the ARE sites contribute to cadmium (2-30 microM) but not zinc responsiveness, and to basal promoter activity. Overexpression of dominant-negative (dn)USF in co-transfection assays significantly attenuated cadmium induction of the USF/ARE in the context of a minimal promoter, and attenuated cadmium, but not zinc, induction of the intact MT-I promoter. A consensus E-box (CACATG) at -223 bp in the MT-I promoter was also found to bind USF in vitro , and to be constitutively footprinted in vivo . The interaction of USF with E-box1 was apparently 10-fold stronger than that with the USF/ARE. However, in contrast, E-box1 was not a strong basal promoter element nor was it metal ions responsive in mouse Hepa cells. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate a role for USF in cadmium-specific induction of the mouse MT-I gene, but bring into question an obligate role for USF in regulating basal activity of this gene. The data further suggest that USF interacts with ARE-binding proteins to influence MT-I gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
