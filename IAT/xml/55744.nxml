In mice Dazl is only expressed in germ cells and is necessary for meiosis. A dual approach was taken to understand the RNA-binding specificity of the Dazl protein: (i)&#x000a0;traditional SELEX and (ii) a novel tri-hybrid screen. Both approaches led to the same conclusion, namely that Dazl binds oligo(U) stretches interspersed by G or C residues. In a directed tri-hybrid assay the strongest interaction was with the consensus (GUn)n. This motif is found in the 5&#x02032; UTR of CDC25C whose homologue is thought to be the target of Boule, the Dazl homologue in flies. CDC25C 5&#x02032; UTR also interacted specifically with Dazl <italic>in vitro</italic>.

The gene was transposed from an autosome after the divergence of the old-world monkeys and is solely autosomal in lower mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c2">2</xref>). Dazl proteins are germ cell-specific and knocking them out across the animal kingdom has revealed various roles in germ cell differentiation. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> there is a primordial germ cell defect, which manifests as a failure to survive and migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c3">3</xref>). There is male meiotic failure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c4">4</xref>), female meiotic failure in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c5">5</xref>), and meiotic failure in both sexes of the Dazl knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c6">6</xref>).</p><p> Despite the many genetic studies aimed at elucidating the function of Dazl, its biochemical (i.e. RNA-binding) activity and the extent to which this is important for Dazl function have not been elucidated. We have used two independent screening methods, <italic>in vitro </italic>selection of high affinity RNA molecules bound by recombinant Dazl protein (SELEX) and selection of testes RNA sequences by tri-hybrid screening. Both approaches yielded remarkably similar U-rich sequences. SELEX preferred short oligo(U) runs with intervening G residues, and the yeast tri-hybrid screen produced U-rich tracts with G or C residues in-between.</p><p> In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the Dazl (Boule) knockout has a block in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M of meiosis 1 which can be overcome by expressing the reading frame from the meiosis-specific CDC25 homologue Twine. Expression of Twine correlates with the presence of Boule in the cytoplasm, leading the authors to propose all Dazl proteins as translational enhancers, although it is not established that Boule binds directly to either of Twine&#x02019;s UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c7">7</xref>). In mammals there are three CDC25 homologues that are differentially expressed; CDC25A is postulated to drive S phase, while CDC25B and CDC25C are involved in M phase of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c8">8</xref>). Unlike the other CDC25 isoforms, CDCD25C is predominantly expressed in germ cells, especially in spermatocytes and round spermatids in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c9">9</xref>). Here we report that Dazl binds to the 5&#x02032; UTR of CDC25C <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the yeast tri-hybrid system and that the (GUn)n element in the 5&#x02032; UTR of CDC25C that conforms to our consensus found by both SELEX and tri-hybrid screening is specifically bound by Dazl and therefore that CDC25C may be a target of Dazl in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>GST fusion constructs</title><p>pGD encoding a GST fusion to mouse Dazl and pGDmut encoding a GST fusion of Dazl containing four point mutations in its RRM were created by cloning PCR products from pASd and pASmutRNP1&#x0002f;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c10">10</xref>), respectively, into pGex 5X-1 (Pharmacia). PGD137 and pGD137mut encoding GST fusions of the first 137 amino acids (which includes the RRM) of wild-type and mutant Dazl were generated as above.

Cells were sonicated in PBS containing extra 250 mM KCl, 1&#x000a0;mM DTT and 0.05&#x00025; Tween-20 and bound to glutathione&#x02013;agarose. For the band shift assays, cells were induced with 0.2&#x000a0;mM IPTG and sonicated in denaturing extraction buffer (PBS containing additional 20 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 2&#x00025; sarkosyl). The extract was bound to glutathione&#x02013;agarose overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and beads were washed four times in extraction buffer with decreasing amounts of detergent to allow renaturation of the protein: (i) 2&#x00025; sarkosyl; (ii) 0.75&#x00025; sarkosyl, 0.75&#x00025; Triton X-100; (iii) 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100; (iv) 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100. GST fusion proteins were then eluted in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 125 mM KCl, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT and 10 mM glutathione (final pH 7) for 10 min at room temperature.

The flow through (unbound RNAs) was then mixed with GST-Dazl (the GST Dazl RRM mutant failed to bind a significant number of counts) bound to glutathione&#x02013;agarose. Following washing in 40 column volumes of RNA-binding buffer, RNA was eluted in RNA-binding buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione, phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, reverse transcribed with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and PCR amplified (15 cycles). PCR products were then used as transcription template for the next round of selection. After seven and nine rounds, RT&#x02013;PCR products were subcloned for sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Testes RNA fusion library construction</title><p>For the first strand synthesis, 25 pmol of oligo Eag1N8 GGACACAATTCGGCCGATTTNNNNNNNN and 250 ng adult mouse testes poly(A)&#x0002b; RNA in a total of 11 &#x000b5;l were heated to 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min and placed on ice.

The more widely used relies on bacteriophage MS2 RNA binding to its coat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c15">15</xref>) while the other uses tri-hybrid vector pREVRX that exploits the REV&#x02013;RRE interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c17">17</xref>). Neither system has been used to screen for unknown mRNA targets of RNA-binding proteins, but the idea was shown to work in theory when a U1 snRNP was used to retrieve U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c18">18</xref>). However, there were several problems with the MS2 three-hybrid system, including high false positive rates and instability of longer inserts, so we decided to use the REV tri-hybrid system to screen for RNA targets of Dazl.</p><p> A mouse testes RNA library (average fragment size 250 bases) was constructed in pREVRX and screened using mouse Dazl as bait. Independent colonies (400 000) were screened for growth on 3-AT and subsequently for blue colour, yielding &#x0223c;400 colonies that grew well on 3-AT selection, of which &#x0223c;250 were blue in the &#x003b2;-Gal assay. Direct PCR and sequencing of positive colonies revealed &#x0003e;95&#x00025; had oligo(U) sequences of &#x0003e;10 bases with interspersed G or C nucleotides (as with the SELEX a sample of sequences from the starting library showed no discernible bias). Plasmids from 52 yeast colonies were rescued, and when retested, 50 interacted with Dazl in the yeast tri-hybrid assay; when cotransfected with empty vector pACT, all were negative. Table S1 shows the 70 bases of sequence with the highest U content from the first 45 clones that gave a strong blue colour (full-length accession nos AJ409460&#x02013;AJ409505). This sample is composed of 58&#x00025; U residues and 13&#x00025;, 15&#x00025; and 14&#x00025; A, C and G residues, respectively. However the nucleotide proportions found flanked by 3&#x000a0;Us in the sequence U<sub>3</sub>NU<sub>3 </sub>are 4&#x00025; A, 51&#x00025; C and 45&#x00025; G, respectively, indicating a consensus minimal binding site of U<sub>3</sub>G&#x0002f;CU<sub>3</sub>. As the library was non-directionally cloned, Blast searching of the retrieved sequences revealed mostly matches with antisense sequences and ESTs. There were no matches to coding regions of any known genes but there were matches to four intronic sequences including double strand break protein spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c19">19</xref>) and mitotic protein Pin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c20">20</xref>) and two 3&#x02032; UTRs sequences: SNF-1 like kinase (containing GUUUUGUUUUGUUUUCGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c21">21</xref>) and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (containing UUUUUUGUUUUUUGUUUUUUUU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c22">22</xref>) and one 5&#x02032; UTR, that of the tyrosine phosphatase PRL-1 (containing GUUGUUUUUUGGUUUUGCUUUGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCUGUUUUGGUUUU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dazl binds broken oligo(U) rich tracts with an order of preference G &#x0003e; C &#x0003e; A for the interspersing nucleotides</title><p>As the two methods of screening above gave similar results, the UTRs of the three mouse CDC25 homologues A, B and C were searched for broken oligo(U) tracts since the UTRs of&#x000a0;CDC25 homologue &#x02018;Twine&#x02019; in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are probable targets for the Dazl homologue &#x02018;Boule&#x02019; (7).

Translational control is known to be an important part of the process of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c26">26</xref>), and intriguingly Dazl has been found associated with actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c14">14</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dazl (Boule) upregulates the translation of a meiosis-specific homologue of CDC25C (Twine) although it remains to be determined if this effect is direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c7">7</xref>). Support for the translational regulation of CDC25C mRNA comes from the observation that fresh translation of CDC25C is necessary for meiosis in pig oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c27">27</xref>) and <italic>cdc25&#x0002b;</italic> is translationally regulated by U-rich sequences in its 5&#x02032; UTR in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c28">28</xref>). The fact that Dazl binds a U-rich element in the 5&#x02032; UTR of CDC25C and that both genes are predominantly expressed in the male germline makes it attractive that Dazl may control the translation of CDC25C. However, while in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the control of CDC25 (Twine) translation is thought to be the primary function of Dazl (Boule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c7">7</xref>), in the Dazl knockout mouse the phenotype is detectable many days earlier (H.J.Cooke and P.Saunders, manuscript in preparation) than the CDC25C message and protein which are first detected around day 17 post partum, coincident with the first wave of meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c9">9</xref>). It is probable therefore that Dazl, which is present throughout germ cell development, has other earlier targets involved in commitment to enter meiosis.</p><p> A search through 7400 mouse 5&#x02032; UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c29">29</xref>), revealed 34 possible downstream targets of Dazl (not shown) indicating that such sequences occur relatively frequently and therefore that Dazl may target multiple RNAs, but it remains to be established if any of them are transcribed in germ cells. Cell cycle regulator p27kip contains a (GUn)n element in its 5&#x02032; UTR that may be important for translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c30">30</xref>) although in testes p27kip is predominantly expressed in Sertoli cells rather than germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c31">31</xref>). Although different antibodies have given opposing views about whether mouse Dazl is strictly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c33">33</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, nuclear localisation is not essential for meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c34">34</xref>), so it is questionable whether the intronic sequences retrieved here are physiological sites of action.</p><p> If Dazl regulates translation it may do so alone or by interacting with the translation machinery through testes-specific proteins like the human &#x02018;DAZ associated protein&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke381c35">35</xref>), which may be essential components of any assay systems. However, proof of the function of Dazl may await identification of its first essential targets in development. To this end we have shown the promise of the yeast tri-hybrid system to reveal mRNA sequences bound by RNA-binding proteins, and saturating screens of physiologically relevant substrates may be facilitated by refining the source of RNA for library construction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_29_12_2479__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_29_12_2479__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke381f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Binding of mouse Dazl to the GU-rich sequence in the 5&#x02032; UTR of CDC25C.
