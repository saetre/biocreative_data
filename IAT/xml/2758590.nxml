It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. The degree to which IL-3 acts at the posttranscriptional level is largely unknown. We have conducted global mRNA decay profiling and bioinformatic analyses in 32Dcl3 myeloblasts indicating that IL-3 caused immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function. Stabilized transcripts were enriched for AU-Response elements (AREs), and an ARE-containing domain from the interleukin-6 (IL-6) 3&#x02032;-UTR rendered a heterologous gene responsive to IL-3-mediated transcript stabilization. Many IL-3-stabilized transcripts had been associated with leukemic transformation. Deregulated Abl kinase shared with IL-3 the ability to delay turnover of transcripts involved in proliferation or differentiation blockade, relying, in part, on signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of an mRNA network linked to IL-3 contributes to leukemic cell growth.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The growth factor Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a pleiotropic cytokine protein that promotes the survival and proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, and stimulates the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages.

We sought to determine whether proliferating myeloblasts expressed a distinct profile of mRNA half-lives that was controlled by hematopoietic cytokines such as IL-3.</p><p>The regulation of mRNA turnover often occurs via the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) at AU-rich elements (ARE's) that are recognized and competitively bound by RNA-binding proteins that stabilize or destabilize the transcripts. Roughly 4000 genes are known to contain these elements and consist primarily of short-lived transcripts. Three classes of AU-rich sequences have been described including those with single or noncontinuous canonical UUAUUUAWW motifs (Class I), those containing overlapping or continuous copies of the motif (Class II), and a 3<sup>rd</sup> class of U-rich sequences lacking that the AU-motif (Class III) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Zubiaga1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Coordinate stabilization of multiple mRNAs allows coherent cellular responses to external stimuli.

However, no systematic analysis of mRNA turnover in myeloblasts exposed to proliferative hematopoietic cytokines has been performed. Better understanding of the control of mRNA metabolism in myeloblasts could illuminate posttranscriptional defects that occur in myeloproliferative disorders or myeloid leukemias.</p><p>As a model for studying hematopoietic cytokine regulation of mRNA turnover, we have used the murine myeloblast cell line 32Dcl3. These nonleukemic, diploid cells are IL-3-dependent for proliferation and survival and differentiate into functional neutrophils when IL-3 is replaced by G-CSF in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Guchhait1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. 32Dcl3 cells have frequently been used to analyze molecular components of cytokine signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Gaines1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Numata1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously reported that 32Dcl3 myeloblasts growing in IL-3 express high basal levels of p21WAF1 mRNA and protein, and that p21 inhibits the neutrophilic differentiation of these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Ghanem1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Because reports in nonhematopoietic cells have demonstrated that p21 transcript turnover changed in response to cellular stress, growth factors and differentiation stimuli, we posited that IL-3 induction of p21 could reflect mRNA stabilization. In this report, we demonstrate that p21 is just one of many transcripts that are stabilized by IL-3. Of note, IL-3 stabilized these mRNAs without the need for IL-3- mediated transcription because IL-3 was added after transcriptional blockade. These posttranscriptionally regulated mRNAs are functionally coordinated, mapping to several key pathways characteristic of the myeloblast phenotype. In particular, IL-3 opposed the decay of transcripts related to cell cycling. Bioinformatic analysis indicated enrichment of AU-rich sequences in the 3&#x02032; UTR of transcripts stabilized by IL-3. These findings support a model in which IL-3 supports myeloblast growth through signals that encroach on shared 3&#x02032;-UTR motifs in a substantial portion of the transcriptome.</p><p>Oncoproteins such as v-Abl can render 32D myeloblasts IL-3-independent for growth.

If IL-3 coordinates this phenotype in part through stabilizing mRNAs, then a subset of transcripts linked to these functions will decay slower in IL-3 than when IL-3 is withdrawn or replaced with the differentiating cytokine G-CSF. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g001">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that p21 mRNA levels decrease when cells are switched from IL-3 to G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to determine whether cytokine exposure directly affected transcription of p21, 32Dcl3 cells were stably transfected with an EGFP reporter driven by the p21 promoter. Cell were washed, resuspended in IL-3 or G-CSF, and EGFP fluorescence was measured two days later using flow cytometry. EGFP expression varied by less than 10&#x00025; between culture conditions, indicating a minimal effect of IL-3 on p21 transcription and bolstering a posttranscriptional basis for differences in p21 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Actinomycin D chase experiments confirmed that the half-life of p21 in physiologic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Li1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> (1 ng/ml) IL-3 was roughly 3.5 times longer than when cells were maintained in IL-3 &#x02013;deficient (0.01 ng/ml) medium or in G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of IL-3 to cells cultured overnight in G-CSF restored p21 stability. Stably transfected 32Dcl3 cells harboring exogenous human p21 cDNA lacking the 3&#x02032;-UTR (untranslated region) exhibited increased stability that did not change significantly in IL-3-deficient medium. In contrast, the mRNA signal corresponding to endogenous p21 bearing the full-length 3&#x02032;-UTR was markedly less stable in IL-3-deficient medium than with physiologic IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Having shown that IL-3 upregulated p21 mRNA by increasing it's stability in 32Dcl3 mouse myeloblasts, we determined whether human p21 was also subject to similar regulation. Full-length human p21 (including untranslated regions) cDNA was stably transfected into 32Dcl3 cells. The decay of exogenous human p21 and endogenous mouse p21 transcripts were detected using species-specific probes on Northern blots of Actinomycin D chase experiments (1E). IL-3 stabilized transcripts of either species similarly. This indicated that enhanced expression of p21 in 32Dcl3 myeloblasts reflected a longer p21 mRNA half-life due to IL-3 that was dependent on the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the p21 transcript.</p><fig id="pone-0007469-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007469.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Posttranscriptional p21 mRNA regulation by IL-3.</title><p>A) <italic>Downregulation of p21 mRNA in differentiating myeloblasts</italic>.

The posttranscriptional stabilization of p21 by IL-3 (noted above) could contribute to IL-3 blockade of 32Dcl3 cell differentiation. We therefore determined whether IL-3 altered the turnover of a number of transcripts linked to myeloblast growth or function, in addition to p21. In order to derive a global list of candidate IL-3 targets, we conducted kinetic microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Wang2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> in which 32Dcl3 cells were washed free of IL-3, exposed to actinomycin D to stop transcription and then treated with either IL-3-replete or IL-3-deficient medium (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s006">Figure S1</xref>). Cells were harvested 2 and 4 hours after cytokine re-addition and Affymetrix 430A-2.0 microarrays were run on samples harvested from each condition at 0, 2 and 4 hours. These time points were chosen to capture labile, cytokine-responsive transcripts within a temporal window in which cells were fully viable. Two independent experiments were run. A series of analyses were conducted in order to rank-order probe sets by the degree to which IL-3 stabilized the corresponding transcripts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s001">Supplemental Methods S1</xref>).</p><p>To perform these analyses, a novel algorithm was developed. The degree to which IL-3 stabilized a transcript was denoted by the difference between the transcript's decay rate in cells exposed to IL-3 replete- versus IL-3-deficient medium. The algorithm begins by calculating the average area between the mRNA decay curve of each gene probe set in the presence of IL-3 and the decay curve of that probe set in IL-3-deficient medium (<italic>g<sub>area</sub></italic>). The greater the value of <italic>g<sub>area</sub></italic>, the larger the difference in transcript decay with and without IL-3 depletion. We then adjusted <italic>g<sub>area</sub></italic> based on the time point 0 signal intensity to correct for the greater effect that noise would have on <italic>g<sub>area</sub></italic> for probes with the lowest signal intensity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s001">Supplemental Methods S1</xref>). This adjustment led to a score for each probe set termed <italic>g<sub>score</sub></italic>. Higher <italic>g<sub>score</sub></italic> values were expected to correspond to increased transcript stabilization by IL-3 as manifested by a greater difference in the adjusted area between the decay curve in IL-3-replete and -deficient medium. We used our algorithm to rank order the 22,690 probe sets from those corresponding to transcripts that were the most-stabilized by IL-3 to those least-stabilized by IL-3 (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s001">Supplemental Methods S1</xref>), as shown on scatter plots (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s007">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Confidence in the rank-ordered list was bolstered by the identification of p21 as a strongly stabilized transcript. Out of the 22,690 probe sets on the microarray, the two probes corresponding to p21 occupied the 14<sup>th</sup>-most and 17<sup>th</sup>-most stabilized positions. The probesets included on microarrays used for these studies represent 13,486 unique transcripts based on Entrez gene ID's. When ordered by unique transcript (i.e. averaging out probesets that recognize distinct portions of the transcript), p21 was the 10<sup>th</sup>-most stabilized transcript out of 13,486. The list of probesets arranged by IL-3-mediated stability is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s002">Supplemental Table S1</xref>. A table of genes ranked from most- to least-stablized derived from taking the mean value for probesets annotated to the same gene is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s003">Supplemental Table S2</xref>. The listings in both supplemental tables were in close agreement in the sense that we found either list would produce similar results in our downstream analysis.</p><p>The primary conclusion from this microarray analysis was that transcripts represented by 5290 probe sets were measured to decay slower in 1 ng/ml IL-3 than without it, with most of the total measured magnitude of stabilization occuring in the top 1000 probe sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s002">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s007">Figure S2</xref>). IL-3 was therefore concluded to stabilize hundreds of gene transcripts in 32Dcl3 myeloblasts.</p><p>In order to validate microarray-based rankings, Northern blotting for p21 and several other transcripts was conducted on extracts of cells from Actinomycin D chase experiments conducted in the presence or absence of IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For each of seven independent experiments shown on Northern Blots, p21 was probed as a positive control and manifested a decay half-life of 3.6 hours in IL-3 and 1.5 hours without IL-3 on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The probe sets for the loading control utilized, GAPDH, were at positions 10,018, 10,420, and 14,173 out of all queried probe sets and manifested minimal cytokine-dependent variation.

Extensive research has delineated transcriptional control pathways during myelopoiesis that are disrupted in leukemia and more recent investigations have highlighted differentiation-specific or leukemia-related posttranscriptional modulation of translation by microRNAs. The impact of mRNA stability control on normal and malignant myelopoiesis has been less well characterized despite evidence that changes in turnover rates of certain mRNAs can dramatically affect cellular behavior (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Steinman3">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>This paper delineates the range of posttranscriptional mRNA regulation by IL-3 in murine myeloblasts as evidence that IL-3 controls myeloblast function through its effects on mRNA turnover rather than solely through transcriptional activation.

The algorithm that we used to compare global mRNA decay rates under these conditions will be useful for other kinetic microarray analysis of mRNA stability.</p><p>This analysis ranked transcripts from most- to least-stabilized by IL-3. Northern blotting of cells incubated with or without IL-3 confirmed IL-3 mediated stabilization of select transcripts ranked from position 3 to position 273 out of 22,690 probe sets on an Affymetrix array (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007469-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007469-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The number of transcripts whose decay rate is slowed by IL-3 is therefore substantial, supporting the relevance of this posttranscriptional pathway to IL-3-supported survival, growth and differentiation blockade of 32Dcl3 myeloblasts. Many of the proteins encoded by IL-3 stabilized transcripts have been shown to support leukemic cell growth and survival and/or to inhibit differentiation in 32Dcl3 myeloblasts (for examples, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007469-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results supported a significant role for IL-3-mediated RNA stabilization in sustaining myeloblast growth and suggested that elucidation of IL-3-stabilized transcripts could reveal genes and pathways that support blast cell proliferation in myeloid leukemias. In this context, it was notable that two of the five most stabilized genes, pik3cd and IL6 are already directly targeted by therapeutics in clinical trials of hematologic malignancies (NCT00710528, NCT00402181).</p><p>It is notable that transcripts involved in RNA processing were significantly enriched as IL-3 stabilization targets upon gene ontology analysis. Enhanced expression of this class of genes could serve to bolster IL-3 effects on decay rates, or alternatively, to limit IL-3 posttranscriptional effects. Two transcripts that were markedly stabilized by IL-3, BRF1 (zfp36l1) and BRF2 (zfp36l2), destabilize mRNA transcripts at AREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Stoecklin2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Hudson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. These gene products have been linked to leukemia and may facilitate degradation of apoptotic or antiproliferative transcripts in myeloblasts. Alternatively, BRF1 and 2 transcript stabilization could herald a negative feedback loop that limits the durability of IL-3-sustained messages. This possibility is supported by a recent global assessment of epidermal growth factor signaling that identified early upregulation of BRF1 and 2 as part of a negative feedback loop that was characterized by BRF destabilization of mitotic transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Amit1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data indicated that some of the same transcripts stabilized by IL3 are stabilized by the v-abl oncoprotein in an imatinib-dependent manner. This raises the prospect that many of the growth-promoting mRNAs that are stabilized by IL3 are also stabilized by v-Abl, potentially through the same terminal mediator(s). Such a mechanism could contribute to the ability of v-Abl to substitute for IL-3 in supporting the growth of this myeloblast cell line. Because multiple oncogenes can render these myeloblasts factor-independent, it is conceivable that the appropriation of growth factor pathways regulating RNA decay is a general feature of leukemogenesis. IL-3 and v-Abl share overlapping signaling pathways, including activation of the Mek/Erk pathway. This pathway has been shown to stabilize several transcripts (as discussed in Sugiura <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007469-Sugiura1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>). In our experiments, the Mek inhibitor U0126 partially inhibited IL-3 and v-Abl-mediated transcript stabilization.

This assumption is not applicable to the kinetic microarray experiments conducted to measure mRNA decay, because later time points followed transcriptional blockade. We thus evaluated several normalization programs (dChip, MAS 5, and RMA) to determine which would be most consistent with our expectation that the mRNA levels at time point 0 would contribute a greater signal than time points after transcriptional inhibition. Using thiscriteria we selected the dChip normalization (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007469.s001">Supplemental Methods S1</xref> for details). All ten microarray hybridizations were normalized together using the dChip software with the default settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Scoring Probe Sets</title><p>The probe sets were ranked for IL-3 induced stability based on the signed area between a curve for the high IL-3 experiment and the low IL-3 experiment. For each probe set, the signed area values were averaged over the two replicates and divided by a variability term. The variability term was a function of the average intensity of the probe set for the 0 hour time point. This function was computed based on the variability of the area between the replicates for probe sets with similar average 0 hour probe set intensity.
