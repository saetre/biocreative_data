More specifically, these results suggest there is a synergistic interaction between T and hyperinsulinemia in its effect beyond that of hyperinsulinemia alone. At both the low and high doses of T, IRS-1 demonstrated an &#x0223c;300&#x00025; increase in insulin stimulated Ser<sup>636/639</sup> phosphorylation. Regarding the Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway, low-dose testosterone exposure significantly increased both mTOR and S6K phosphorylation by insulin compared to those from control cells that were not pre-exposed to testosterone. There are other factors causing insulin resistance, known to be involved in elevated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation including tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), free fatty acids, cellular stress, amino acids, and insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Gual1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Of note, PCOS patients had significant elevations in both total and bioavailable T compared to the control subjects. A recent study using cultured skeletal muscle from 10 PCOS patients and matched control subjects reported a 35&#x00025; significant increase in IRS-1 protein abundance in cultured skeletal muscle of PCOS patients, and the insulin stimulated IRS-1 associated PI3K activity was reduced in the PCOS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Corbould1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The present study took the next logical step by examining the effects of both low-dose and high-dose testosterone exposure on insulin-induced phosphorylation of serine (inhibitory) residues on IRS-1 as well as some of its downstream targets. This finding from the current study is consistent with that of Courbold et al and demonstrates that increased insulin stimulated IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation occurs in cultured rat skeletal muscle after pre-exposure to T. Although there are at least 50 known potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1, most studies relating IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to insulin resistance study one, or at most several, sites in response to a given stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Khamzina1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Corbould1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Bouzakri1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Gual1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Ozes1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Gual2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Bouzakri2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

It should be noted that the low-dose T concentrations is at the upper limit of the physiological range, which demonstrated a significant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and although the larger dose of T showed similar trend it did not reach the level of statistical significance. There may be multiple pathways and signaling proteins other than IRS-1 involved in this interaction between T and insulin. Previous studies suggested other pathways such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the stress activated protein kinase JNK, which are implicated in insulin induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Mussig1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004274-Hiratani1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another intriguing finding of the present study is the observation that insulin stimulated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in the absence of T, while concomitantly inhibiting the phosphorylation AKT beyond 30 minutes of insulin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004274-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004274-g003">3A</xref>).

Specifically, our results suggest that there is a synergistic interaction between T and insulin in this effect beyond that of insulin alone. Additionally, we suggest future studies utilizing primary skeletal muscle culture exposed to T in the presence of a hyperinsulinemic environment may serve as models for PCOS-related insulin resistance.

The T concentrations were empirically chosen. In brief, we used the upper physiologic limit for T concentration for the low-dose T and multiplied it by a factor of 10 base on our understanding that metabolic processes occur at much faster rates in rats. We then performed preliminary Western blots to determine if we could see a difference in protein phosphorylation. Based on our preliminary results we designed the experiment to compare the 2 concentrations.

For both the low-dose and high-dose T exposed cells, the 30 min data is presented based on preliminary experiments which suggested that at this time point the phosphorylation status of IRS1 Ser<sup>636/639</sup> and S6k plateaued, Akt reached its peak phosphorylation, and mTOR phosphorylation remained unchanged. Total proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis using the Invitrogen Mini Cell<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> system and NuPage 4&#x02013;12&#x00025; Tris-Bis gels. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes, and western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against total and phosphorylated Akt Ser<sup>473</sup> (Cell Signaling #9272, #9271), mTOR Ser<sup>2448</sup> (Cell Signaling #2972, #2971), S6 kinase Thr<sup>389</sup> (Cell Signaling #9202, #9205), and IRS-1Ser<sup>636/639</sup> (Cell Signaling #2382, #2388). Signal intensities of phosphorylated and total proteins were quantified and analyzed using Kodak image station 1000 and the accompanying software packages. Phosphorylated signals were normalized to total protein for each measurement. The net effect of insulin on protein phosphorylation was determined using the ratio of the insulin-treated phosphorylation signal to the non-insulin treated phosphorylation signal for both control cells and T exposed cells.
