The feasibility of paratransgenic malaria control has been hampered by the lack of candidate symbiotic microorganisms for the major vector <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. In other systems, densonucleosis viruses (DNVs) are attractive agents for viral paratransgenesis because they infect important vector insects, can be genetically manipulated and are transmitted to subsequent generations. However, <italic>An. gambiae</italic> has been shown to be refractory to DNV dissemination. We discovered, cloned and characterized the first known DNV (AgDNV) capable of infection and dissemination in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. We developed a flexible AgDNV-based expression vector to express any gene of interest in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> using a two-plasmid helper-transducer system. To demonstrate proof-of-concept of the viral paratransgenesis strategy, we used this system to transduce expression of an exogenous gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein; EGFP) in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes. Wild-type and EGFP-transducing AgDNV virions were highly infectious to <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae, disseminated to and expressed EGFP in epidemiologically relevant adult tissues such as midgut, fat body and ovaries and were transmitted to subsequent mosquito generations. These proof-of-principle data suggest that AgDNV could be used as part of a paratransgenic malaria control strategy by transduction of anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> peptides or insect-specific toxins in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. AgDNV will also be extremely valuable as an effective and easy-to-use laboratory tool for transient gene expression or RNAi in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Paratransgenesis, the genetic manipulation of mosquito symbiotic microorganisms, is being considered as a potential strategy to control malaria.

Microorganisms associated with <italic>Anopheles</italic> could be manipulated to alter the mosquito's ability to become infected with and transmit the malaria parasites, or reduce mosquito fecundity or lifespan. A suitable microbial candidate for paratransgenic malaria control would have a symbiotic (mutualistic, commensal or parasitic) relationship with the vector, be readily propagated and stably engineered to express the gene(s) of interest without compromising microorganism fitness, and be easily delivered to wild mosquito populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000135-Riehle1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Ideally, the engineered microbe would also be maintained in the environment, be passed to subsequent mosquito generations and have limited effects on non-target species.</p><p>Densonucleosis viruses, or &#x0201c;densoviruses&#x0201d; (DNVs), are non-enveloped single-stranded DNA icosahedral viruses in the family Parvoviridae (subfamily Densovirinae) that infect arthropods such as mosquitoes. Mosquito DNVs have narrow host ranges and are maintained in natural populations by a cycle that includes both horizontal and vertical transmission from infected adults to larvae. DNVs possess some of the smallest known viral genomes (4&#x02013;6 kb), a trait that makes them highly amenable as molecular tools because the entire genome can be placed into an infectious plasmid, manipulated by standard cloning techniques, and used to express foreign genes (i.e. anti-parasite or toxin) upon infection in cell cultures or live mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000135-Carlson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. DNV infectious clones, expression systems, and lethal biocontrol agents (based on the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> densovirus; AeDNV) have been developed and show promise for <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000135-Carlson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000135-Ward1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similar results were observed when researchers could only infect <italic>An. gambiae</italic> with TaDNV (isolated from a <italic>Toxorhynchites amboinensis</italic> cell line) by adult injection but not larval exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000135-ONeill1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, DNVs have previously not been considered useful for paratransgenic manipulation or control of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.</p><p>We serendipitously discovered a novel DNV capable of infection and dissemination in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae (AgDNV) while investigating a PCR artifact in an unrelated experiment. AgDNV is highly infectious to <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae, disseminates to adult tissues, and is passed on to subsequent generations. Recombinant AgDNV genomes were able to transduce expression of an exogenous transgene (enhanced green fluorescent protein; EGFP) in cultured <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cells and mosquitoes and were transmitted to subsequent mosquito generations.

To select for the viral genotype(s) that were infectious to <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae, we infected larvae as first-instars with virus isolated from Sua5B cells, reared them to adulthood and sequenced most of the coding portion of the AgDNV genome (nucleotides 403&#x02013;3709) from 5 infected females. All 5 sequences were identical, indicating that within the viral population in Sua5B cells only one genotype was infectious to larvae. This genotype differed from pBAg at 3 sites: A636G (Lys to Glu in NS1), A1174C (Asp to Ala in NS1 and Ile to Leu in NS2) and A3399T, (Asn to Ile in capsid) (no synonymous mutations were detected).

For mosquito infections, virion particles were purified from cells 1&#x02013;2 weeks post-transfection by glass bead lysis/filtration and first-instar larvae infected directly as described above. EGFP expression in cells, dissected tissues and mosquitoes was monitored using an Olympus BX41 epifluorescent compound microscope. Images were captured using a Macrofire monochrome digital camera (Optronics).</p></sec><sec id="s3p"><title>Intergenerational transfer of EGFP-transducing AgDNV</title><p>Mosquitoes which had observable EGFP expression were allowed to oviposit, offspring reared and EGFP expression in offspring assessed as described above. DNA was extracted from positive offspring and EGFP DNA detected using primers egfpF2 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TGA-AGT-TCA-TCT-GCA-CCA -3&#x02032;</named-content>) and egfpR2 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CAG-CAG-GAC-CAT-GTG-ATC-3&#x02032;</named-content>). PCR was conduced using pAgActinGFP as a positive control and water as negative control. Amplicons were gel purified and directly sequenced.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
