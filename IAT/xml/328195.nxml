The L gene is 6904 nucleotides long including the intergenic region at the HN-L junction and putative negative strand leader RNA, almost all of which is complementary to the positive strand leader RNA of PIV-2. The deduced L protein contains 2262 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 256,366. The L protein of PIV-2 shows 39.9, 28.9, 27.8 and 28.3% homologies with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SV), parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV-3) and measles virus (MV), respectively. Although sequence data on other components of transcriptive complex, NP and P, suggested a closer relationship between PIV-2 and MV, as concerns the L protein, MV is closely related to another group as SV and PIV-3. From analysis of the alignment of the five l proteins, six blocks composed of conserved amino acids were found in the L proteins. The L protein of PIV-2 was detected in purified virions and virus-infected cells using antiserum directed against an oligopeptide corresponding to the amino terminal region. Primer extension analyses showed that the intergenic regions at the NP-P, P-M, M-F, F-HN and HN-L junctions are 4, 45, 28, 8 and 42 nucleotides long, respectively, indicating that the intergenic regions exhibit no conservation of length and sequence. Furthermore, the starting and ending sequences of paramyxoviruses were summarized.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0205-a" xlink:role="2744"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0205-b" xlink:role="2744"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2739"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2740"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2741"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2742"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2743"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2744"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2745"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00090-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2746"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
