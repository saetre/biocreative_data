Severe sepsis occurs when sepsis leads to dysfunction of at least one organ or system due to hypoperfusion or hypotension, while septic shock is associated with refractory arterial hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The criteria for diagnosis of sepsis and severity were established by the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus in 1992 and remain valid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Bone1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite recent advances in management, sepsis is still a life-threatening condition with a poor outcome and is the major cause of death among critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Dombrovskiy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The physiopathology of sepsis continues to be poorly understood and, consequently, only a few specific therapies are available to treat this condition. Several scoring systems are used, including the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, but these systems evaluate clinical parameters related to the associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and do not include any factor involved in pathogenesis of the sepsis itself. Intraabdominal sepsis after abdominal surgery is responsible for approximately 13&#x00025; of all ICU admissions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Hutchins1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Lichtenstern1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies have suggested that clearance of intraperitoneal sepsis may be beneficial when patients develop signs of intraabdominal sepsis after abdominal procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Hutchins1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the diagnosis of postoperative infections is difficult because clinical signs (e.g., pain, changes in level of consciousness, etc.) and laboratory findings, such as elevated acute-phase reactants (e.g., C-reactive protein), or fever are unspecific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Lichtenstern1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, new diagnostic markers could offer advantages over routine clinical and laboratory parameters in identifying postoperative patients with early-stage sepsis.</p><p>Recently, a new category of non-coding RNAs (RNAs that do not codify for proteins), named microRNAs (miRNAs), was found to be involved in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of any type of analyzed human cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Calin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Nicoloso1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>; miRNAs also play a role in other diseases, such as schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Perkins1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Wu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and renal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Anglicheau1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. miRNAs are small RNAs that regulate expression of protein-coding genes by direct (sequence complementarity) interaction with and degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or by inhibition of protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Ambros1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. miRNAs have been implicated in a wide array of cellular and developmental processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Ambros1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In a previous experimental study on mice, we demonstrated that <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-125b</italic> play a role in innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Tili1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of mouse Raw 264.7 macrophages resulted in the upregulation of <italic>miR-155</italic> and downregulation of <italic>miR-125b</italic> levels. The same changes also occurred when C57BL/6 mice were intraperitonealy injected with LPS. The data suggest that the LPS/tumor necrosis factor-alpha- (TNF-alpha) dependent regulation of <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-125b</italic> may be implicated in the response to endotoxin shock, thus offering new targets for drug design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Tili1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. As a continuation of our previous work, in the present study we interrogated miRNA expression in a set of sepsis patients by performing genome-wide profiling by microarray in leukocytes followed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on plasma samples; we then compared the levels of miRNA expression in the sepsis patients with the miRNA levels in a series of healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a plasma miRNA ratio (miR-150/IL-18) that can be used for assessing the severity of the sepsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sepsis Patients and Healthy Controls</title><p>In the present study, we prospectively collected 24 samples from 17 sepsis patients (mean age &#x0002b;/&#x02212; standard deviation (SD)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;55.4&#x0002b;/&#x02212;17.13 y; 9 women, 8 men) and 32 samples from 32 healthy controls (mean age&#x0002b;/&#x02212;SD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;49.2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;20.12 y; 9 women, 23 men; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.267 for age variation; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.081 for gender) of peripheral blood leukocytes and/or plasma.

This microarray consisted of 60-mer DNA probes for 470 human miRNAs, sourced from the Sanger miRBase public database (Release 9.1). One-color miRNA expression was performed according to the manufacturer's procedure. Briefly, total RNA was obtained from samples by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Labeled miRNAs were obtained from 500 ng of total RNA through the ligation of a 5&#x02032;-cytidine bisphosphate-Cy3 (pCp-Cy3, Agilent Technologies) group at the 3&#x02032;-end of each miRNA. To enhance the T4 RNA-ligase (Promega, Madison, WI) efficiency, we had previously treated total RNA with alkaline phosphatase (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Labeled miRNAs were purified on chromatography columns (Micro Biospin 6, Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and then hybridized on a microarray. Hybridizations were performed at 55&#x000b0;C for 17 h in a rotating oven.

First, using GeneSpring GX software version 7.3 (Agilent Technologies), we preprocessed data files with the plug-in for the Agilent Feature Extraction software results. Data transformation was applied to set all negative raw values at 5.0, followed by on-chip and on-gene median normalization. We filtered data for low gene expression so that only probes expressed (flagged as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d;) in at least one sample were kept; probes that did not change between samples, i.e., identified as having an expression value across all samples between median&#x000b1;1.5, were removed. Next, samples were grouped according to their status and then compared. Differentially expressed genes were selected as having a 2-fold expression difference between their geometrical mean in the two groups of interest (sepsis and control) and a statistically significant <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) by analysis of variance statistics.</p><p>Independently, a second type of data analysis was performed by using extracted fluorescence intensity values (Agilent Feature Extraction) from all 16 hybridizations.

Absent calls were assigned at a threshold of 7 (log<sub>2</sub>) before statistical analysis. Intensities were normalized using average factors scaled to the median array intensities over the entire array by using the median array as a reference. This filtering method was decided a priori to eliminate probes whose miRNA expression levels were thought to be unreliable.

Therefore, we investigated the expression of <italic>miR-150</italic> in plasma by performing qRT-PCR on 24 sepsis (including 16 at day 1 and 8 at day 7) and 32 control samples. We initially used U6 and U6B for the selection of the normalizer gene, but since these RNAs were degraded in plasma we could not obtain reproducible results in triplicate experiments. Thereafter, we analyzed two miRNAs (<italic>miR-192</italic> and <italic>let-7a</italic>) that, according to the array data, had no variance in expression between sepsis samples and controls.

Interestingly, by considering an 8.5-fold cutoff value for the expression ratio miR-150/miR-192 (meaning at least three amplification cycles' difference for the &#x00394;Ct between <italic>miR-150</italic> and <italic>miR-192</italic>) at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007405-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>), we found that the 6 patients with higher ratios (15.07 to 97.24) had significantly lower SOFA scores than the 10 patients with lower ratios (0.44 to 8.20) (2.83&#x0002b;/&#x02212;2.64 versus 7.80&#x0002b;/&#x02212;5.41 mean ratio &#x000b1; SD, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.028) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007405-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). All three patients with septic shock had levels of <italic>miR-150</italic> lower than 8.5. Furthermore the miR-150/miR-192 relative expression was negatively correlated with the SOFA score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007405-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>) and this ratio decreased from the sepsis to severe sepsis to sepsis shock patients (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007405.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). These data are in agreement with our initial observation that sepsis patients have lower levels of <italic>miR-150</italic> than healthy controls; in fact, the patient with the highest <italic>miR-150/192</italic> ratio (97.24) had the lowest SOFA score at both days 1 and 7. Further strengthening this conclusion, we did not find any significant differences in <italic>miR-150</italic> expression between day 1 and day 7 (43.98&#x0002b;/&#x02212;29.35 versus 28.08&#x0002b;/&#x02212;25.32; <italic>p</italic> not significant), as the SOFA score was quite similar for this limited set of patients (day 1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;SD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.28&#x0002b;/&#x02212;2.69 versus 1.86&#x0002b;/&#x02212;2.61 for day 7; <italic>p</italic> not significant).

First, it addresses a significant medical condition, the sepsis, from a new perspective&#x02014;the involvement of small non-coding RNAs. Sepsis is the major cause of death among critically ill patients in ICU. Total mortality for patients with acute postoperative sepsis is about 30&#x00025;&#x02013;35&#x00025;; however, the mortality rate for patients with severe sepsis is over 50&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Hotchkiss1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Libert1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, severe sepsis is a disease in the need for critical care resources. We found that in sepsis patients the microRNoma (defined as the full spectrum of expressed miRNAs) is different from that in healthy controls, both in leukocytes (considered the cells involved in the immune disturbances characteristic of sepsis) and plasma on the first day of admission to the ICU. We found by microarray or qRT-PCR that the levels of three miRNAs &#x02014; <italic>miR-150</italic>, <italic>miR-182</italic>, and <italic>miR-342-5p</italic> &#x02014; are at least twice as dysregulated in leukocytes from patients than in those from healthy controls. Supporting these findings is a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> profile of the human leukocyte miRNA response to endotoxemia in which leukocyte RNA was isolated from venous blood samples obtained from three healthy male volunteers before and 4 h after LPS infusion and profiled for miRNA expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Five miRNAs consistently responded to LPS infusion, four of which were downregulated (<italic>miR-146b</italic>, <italic>miR-150</italic>, <italic>miR-342</italic>, and <italic>let-7g</italic>) and one of which was upregulated (<italic>miR-143</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, <italic>miR-150</italic> was found to control c-Myb expression <italic>in vivo</italic> in a dose-dependent manner over a narrow range of miRNA and c-Myb concentrations, and this dramatically affected lymphocyte development and response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Xiao1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. These data further strengthen the functional significance of <italic>miR-150</italic> downregulation in sepsis patients. Furthermore, abnormal processing of <italic>miR-21</italic> transcript was recently reported in ICU patients suffering from sepsis-induced multiple organ failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Fredriksson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, expanding the spectrum of miRNA alterations in sepsis.</p><p>Second, the recent identification of miRNAs in serum and plasma from healthy individuals and individuals with pathologic conditions, such as cancer, opens up the possibility of exploring miRNAs as biomarkers of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Cortez1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNA measurement in plasma from sepsis patients. We found not only that <italic>miR-150</italic> levels are significantly different in patients and healthy controls, but also that the levels of <italic>miR-150</italic> correlate with SOFA scores (but not with WBC). SOFA is a scoring system used to track a patient's status while in the ICU; it is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Minne1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified a ratio between the quantitative RT-PCR expression of <italic>miR-150</italic> and a nonvariable control <italic>miR-192</italic> that can be used to assess the severity of sepsis based on its correlation with the SOFA score. Additional candidates for large studies could be <italic>miR-182</italic> and <italic>miR-342-5p</italic> that we found differentially expressed in sepsis versus control leukocytes.</p><p>Finally, we revealed a new potential pathogenetic mechanism explaining some of the immune system dysfunctions in sepsis patients. The malfunction of regulatory mechanisms during sepsis can result in a loss of control of inflammation, eventually leading to profound immunosuppression and host damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Hotchkiss2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Hotchkiss4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study points to a miRNA regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes involved in sepsis. We found that the expression levels of <italic>miR-150</italic> correlated with those of main immune response genes, such as TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-18. Furthermore, the putative spectrum of targets of <italic>miR-150</italic> is highly enriched in genes involved in immune system functions. Therefore, in addition to <italic>miR-155</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Baltimore1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>miR-125</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007405-Tili2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>miR-150</italic> could be one of the main regulatory miRNAs of immune function, and our study unraveled the clinical significance of the <italic>miR-150</italic> expression correlation with cytokine expression in patients with sepsis.</p><p>In conclusion, although the functions of most human miRNAs have yet to be discovered, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of gene expression. The present data support the hypothesis that miRNAs are main regulators of the immune system, and abnormal expression has been found and can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in immune disease. Sepsis is the newest addition to the long list of disease states proved by studies in patients to be linked to abnormal miRNA expression. One of the important regulators is <italic>miR-150</italic>, and this is significantly abnormally expressed in both leukocytes and plasma from sepsis patients. Our study is the first to identify a specific miRNA profile and to interrogate about the clinical significance of miRNA variations in sepsis patients. Due to the limited number of cases originating in the same center and to the bias toward intra-abdominal causes of sepsis, larger multi-institutional studies with higher numbers of patients will establish the final prognostic significance of our initial findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007405.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>White blood count (WBC) and miR-150/miR-192 relative expression plot.
