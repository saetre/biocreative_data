In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> this job is performed by a member of the RNase H/Integrase superfamily called RuvC, whereas in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> it has been attributed to the XPF family member Mus81-Eme1. HJ resolution is achieved through the sequential cleavage of two strands of like polarity at or close to the junction crossover point. RuvC functions as a dimer, whereas Mus81-Eme1 is thought to function as a dimer of heterodimers. However, in both cases the multimer contains two catalytic sites, which act independently and sequentially during the resolution reaction. To ensure that both strands are cleaved before the nuclease dissociates from the junction, the rate of second strand cleavage is greatly enhanced compared to that of the first. The enhancement of second strand cleavage has been attributed to the increased flexibility of the nicked HJ, which would facilitate rapid engagement of the second active site and scissile bond. Here we have investigated whether other properties of the nicked HJ are important for enhancing second strand cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>A comparison of the efficiency of cleavage of nicked HJs with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site shows that a 5&#x02032; phosphate is required for most of the enhancement of second strand cleavage by RuvC.

They are normally formed between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids, and consequently their timely processing is a prerequisite for successful chromosome segregation during cell division. An assortment of nucleases, helicases and topoisomerases process four-way DNA junctions. Amongst these are the HJ resolvases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Declais1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. HJ resolvases are typically small homodimeric endonucleases that bind with structure-specificity to the HJ and introduce a pair of symmetrically placed incisions in strands of like polarity at or close to the junction crossover point. This type of dual incision resolves the HJ into two nicked duplexes, with each nick containing a 5&#x02032; phosphate and 3&#x02032; hydroxyl making them directly repairable by DNA ligase.</p><p>In addition to structure-specific binding, some HJ resolvases also exhibit sequence-specific DNA cleavage. An example of this type is RuvC from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which cleaves nucleotide sequences with a 5&#x02032;-<sup>A</sup>/<sub>T</sub>TT&#x02193;<sup>G</sup>/<sub>C</sub>-3&#x02032; consensus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Shah1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Such sequence specificity endows RuvC with an added level of substrate selectivity since efficient cutting is only achieved if both active sites within the homodimer are correctly positioned next to a strand with the right nucleotide sequence. HJs fulfil this requirement because they consist of two pairs of identical strands, and can undergo branch migration to relocate to sequences that are cleavable.</p><p>Proper resolution of a HJ requires that the dual incisions are made with perfect symmetry. However, the two active sites within a RuvC homodimer operate independently with respect to cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Shah2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In principle this could be problematic if the junction branch migrated following the first incision and before the second incision is made, since widely spaced nicks would not result in junction resolution. Resolvases, like RuvC, avoid this by an acceleration of the second strand cleavage compared to the first, so that two incisions are made within the lifetime of a single binding event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of RuvC a 150-fold acceleration has been calculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Fogg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism underlying this acceleration is thought to be due to the increase in junction flexibility caused by the first incision, which promotes interaction between the second active site and the scissile bond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the HJ resolvases members of the XPF family of endonucleases have been implicated in processing four-way DNA junctions. Most notable in this grouping is Mus81, which functions with a partner protein called Eme1 (or Mms4 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Boddy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Kaliraman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This enzyme is conserved from yeasts to mammals, and, depending on the species, promotes the processing of stalled and/or broken replication forks, the repair of interstrand crosslinks, and the formation of crossover recombinants during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Hollingsworth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Osman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Like the HJ resolvases, Mus81-Eme1 can cleave fully ligated HJs, albeit the cut sites are asymmetrically-related and therefore the cleavage products cannot be directly repaired by DNA ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Boddy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaillard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Taylor1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it has a strong preference for binding and cleaving nicked HJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaillard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaskell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Osman2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and as such it is thought that these junctions represent its favoured substrate <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Hollingsworth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaskell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Osman2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to the enhancement of second strand cleavage by RuvC, efficient cleavage of nicked junctions by Mus81-Eme1 has been attributed to the increased flexibility of nicked HJs over fully ligated HJs, which enables the junction arm on the 5&#x02032; side of the nick to interact with a patch of basic residues near the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Chang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although nicked HJs are key intermediates/substrates of both RuvC and Mus81-Eme1 cleavage reactions it is not known whether the terminal chemistry at the nick site plays any role in the cleavage mechanism. In other words is the flexibility of a nicked HJ sufficient to promote efficient cleavage or are there other properties of nicked HJs that are needed? Here we have investigated whether the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site affects either RuvC's or Mus81-Eme1's cleavage of a nicked HJ. In the case of Mus81-Eme1 the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate makes no difference to cleavage efficiency, suggesting that the flexibility of a nicked junction is the main factor in promoting its efficient cleavage. In contrast, a 5&#x02032; phosphate dramatically stimulates RuvC's cleavage of a nicked HJ. This suggests that junction flexibility on its own is insufficient to promote optimal second strand cleavage during HJ resolution by RuvC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A 5&#x02032; phosphate is needed for optimal cleavage of nicked Holliday junctions by RuvC</title><p>It has been shown previously that a pre-existing strand break at the point of strand exchange within a synthetic HJ stimulates its rate of cleavage by RuvC by 8-fold compared to the corresponding intact junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Fogg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it has not been determined whether a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the strand break is necessary for cleavage stimulation. To investigate this we used intact and nicked versions of a static X-junction (X0 and X0n, respectively), whose point of strand exchange is fixed by sequence heterology between its four junction arms. For optimal cleavage RuvC requires that the consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-<sup>A</sup>/<sub>T</sub>TT<sup>G</sup>/<sub>C</sub>-3&#x02032; is present in opposite strands symmetrically positioned at the point of strand exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Shah1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. X0 does not contain this consensus in any of its strands at the strand exchange point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Nevertheless, RuvC can weakly cleave X0 to generate nicked duplex products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1A, and 1B</xref>, lane b). To map the cleavage sites in X0 four identical junctions were made, each of which was 5&#x02032; end-labelled in a different strand. Following incubation with RuvC the reaction products were run on a denaturing gel adjacent to appropriate sequencing ladders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005347.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A single main cleavage site was detected in each of the four junction strands at or within one nucleotide of the junction crossover point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane c, 1D, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005347.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes c, h and m). To see what effect a pre-existing nick at the point of strand exchange has on RuvC's ability to cleave X0, we used X0n, which contains a pre-existing nick that is exactly symmetrical with the RuvC cleavage site in oligonucleotide 7 of X0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Without a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site RuvC resolves X0n into nicked duplex products at a similar rate as X0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and the position it cleaves in oligonucleotide 7, which is opposite the nick, is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes c and e). RuvC is still able to cleave X0n in oligonucleotides 2 and 6, albeit in slightly different positions than in X0, resulting in a fork product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lane d, 1D, and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005347.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes d and i). The presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site makes little difference to RuvC's cleavage of oligonucleotides 2 and 6 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005347.s001">Figure S1</xref>, lanes e and j). However, it makes a big difference to the amount of cleavage opposite the nick in oligonucleotide 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes e and g). This can also be seen by the increase in nicked duplex product on a native gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lane f). A comparison of the rate of cleavage of X0n with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate shows that the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate increases the cleavage rate by &#x0003e;50-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This improvement in junction cleavage does not correlate with an increase in binding affinity, since X0, X0n (no 5&#x02032; phosphate) and X0n (&#x0002b; 5&#x02032; phosphate) are bound equally well by RuvC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005347-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005347.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cleavage of X0 and X0n (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5&#x02032; phosphate at nick site) by RuvC.</title><p>(A) Schematic showing the linear duplex products that are generated by the cleavage of X0 or X0n by RuvC.

M1 contains a much better cleavage site for RuvC than X0, albeit it is still sub-optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Derivatives of M1 containing a single-strand break at the RuvC cleavage site opposite oligo 39 were constructed with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the break site. These M1n junctions were then compared together with M1 for binding by RuvC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar to X0 and X0n, M1 and M1n (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5&#x02032; phosphate) are bound equally well by RuvC. However, under single turnover conditions the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the strand break in M1n results in a marked stimulation of cleavage rate by RuvC, with a first-order rate constant of 0.209 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared to 0.067 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for M1n and 0.028 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for M1. These data, together with those obtained using X0 and X0n, indicate that the acceleration of the second strand cleavage during the resolution of a HJ by RuvC depends to a large extent on the 5&#x02032; phosphate that is exposed by cleavage of the first strand.</p><fig id="pone-0005347-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005347.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cleavage of M1 and M1n (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5&#x02032; phosphate at nick site) by RuvC.</title><p>(A) Schematic showing the core nucleotide sequences in M1 and M1n.

We have previously shown that recombinant <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Mus81-Eme1 (referred to as Mus81 hereafter) readily cleaves X0n to produce a mixture of duplex products containing a single-strand gap or 5&#x02032; flap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Osman2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the version of X0n that was used in these experiments did not contain a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site. We therefore tested whether Mus81's ability to cleave X0n is enhanced by the addition of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast to RuvC, the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site makes little or no difference to Mus81's ability to cleave X0n (compare lanes b&#x02013;e with g&#x02013;j). To confirm this result we also monitored the cleavage of X0n plus and minus a 5&#x02032; phosphate in a time course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Again no significant difference was observed in the rate of cleavage of X0n with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate.

Indeed it has been proposed that cleavages at sites b, c and d in X0n result from Mus81 acting on the gapped duplex generated from site a cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaillard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site may mediate its effect on cleavage site position at the level of the gapped duplex rather than the nicked X-junction. To investigate this we monitored the rate of cleavage at sites a&#x02013;d on X0n by Mus81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005347-g004">Figure 4A, C and D</xref>). Without a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site X0n is cleaved fastest at site a, whereas sites b&#x02013;d are cleaved at much slower rates. These data are consistent with the idea that cleavage at sites b&#x02013;d result from secondary events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaillard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, X0n with a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site is cleaved fastest at sites b, c and d, which is not indicative of secondary events. These data indicate that a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site in X0n directs Mus81 to preferentially cleave at sites b, c and d rather than at site a.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many HJ resolvases, including RuvC, cleave HJs by two consecutive, but uncoupled, strand cleavages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. To ensure that bilateral strand cleavage is achieved within the lifetime of a single resolvase-HJ complex, incision of the second strand is accelerated compared to that of the first strand. One possible explanation for this is that cleavage of the first strand is slowed by the need to distort the junction in order to position the scissile bond within the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, once the first strand is cleaved, the junction becomes more flexible, and therefore the second scissile bond can be more readily located into the resolvase's active site. One of the supporting pieces of evidence for this is that the rate of strand cleavage in a nicked junction, containing a consensus RuvC cleavage site, is 8-fold higher than in the same junction without a nick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Fogg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Our own data shows that the rate of cleavage of M1n is &#x0223c;2.4 fold higher than M1, which is consistent with the idea that increased junction flexibility aids second strand cleavage. However, the rate of cleavage is increased by a further &#x0223c;3.1 fold if the nick contains a 5&#x02032; phosphate. In the case of X0, which contains a very poor RuvC cleavage site, the effect is even more dramatic with the 5&#x02032; phosphate stimulating cleavage by more than 50 fold compared to the same junction without a 5&#x02032; phosphate. These data suggest that the acceleration of second strand cleavage during the resolution of a HJ by RuvC depends to a large extent on the exposure of a 5&#x02032; phosphate.</p><p>Why is the 5&#x02032; phosphate critical for accelerating second strand cleavage by RuvC? One possibility is that a nicked HJ without a 5&#x02032; phosphate is not as flexible as one with a 5&#x02032; phosphate. We are unaware of any study that has directly addressed this possibility, however it has been reported that the phosphates at the centre of an intact HJ influence junction conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Liu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we think that the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate is unlikely to have any major effect on the flexibility of a nicked HJ. Certainly it does not improve the efficiency of X0n cleavage by Mus81, which is thought to require considerable junction flexibility for proper complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Chang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A second possibility is that the 5&#x02032; phosphate provides a molecular &#x0201c;handle&#x0201d; for RuvC to interact with thereby enabling it to influence junction conformation in a way that enhances second strand cleavage. This would be analogous to another member of the RNase H/Integrase superfamily, Tn5 transposase, which interacts with the 5&#x02032; phosphate exposed by hairpin cleavage during the transposition reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Klenchin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The coordination of the 5&#x02032; phosphate involves residues of the (R)YREK motif that is common to the IS<italic>4</italic> transposase family, and stabilizes a DNA conformation that dramatically enhances strand transfer of the donor DNA into the target by promoting target DNA capture and/or the strand transfer reaction itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Klenchin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A third possibility is that the putative interaction between RuvC and the 5&#x02032; phosphate generates a conformational change in RuvC itself that, together with the additional flexibility of the nicked HJ, stimulates second strand cleavage. Here we imagine that charge repulsion or attraction between the exposed phosphate and residue(s) in the active site of the first monomer might help to promote a conformational change, which could in some way be relayed to the active site of the second monomer aiding its interaction with the scissile bond. Indeed the idea that a conformational change in one subunit can be relayed to a second subunit has been mooted to explain the enhancement of second strand cleavage by the HJ resolvase Ydc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Ceschini1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Structural studies of RuvC and its interaction with nicked HJs with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate will be needed to determine whether or not the phosphate promotes protein and/or DNA conformational changes that can account for the dramatic stimulation of second strand cleavage during junction resolution.</p><p>In contrast to RuvC, Mus81 does not need a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site to stimulate its ability to cleave nicked HJs. The presence of the nick itself regardless of its terminal chemistry seems to be sufficient for optimal cleavage efficiency. Recently we showed that nicked HJs are bound with higher affinity than intact HJs in the presence of a relatively low concentration of divalent metal ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaskell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to cleavage efficiency, the binding affinity of Mus81 for nicked HJs is unaffected by the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site. This correlation between binding affinity and cleavage efficiency contrasts with RuvC, which binds equally well to intact and nicked HJs (with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site) even though optimal cleavage of a nicked HJ depends on the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site. We suspect that optimal binding and cleavage by Mus81 simply requires a junction with the level of flexibility that is achieved by the presence of a strand nick at or close to the junction crossover point.</p><p>Although the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the nick site of a nicked HJ has no effect on the activation of Mus81 cleavage, it does influence cleavage site selection. A recent model of the Mus81-Eme1-nicked HJ complex shows how the exposed 5&#x02032; DNA end may be close to residues in and around helix 5 of Mus81 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Chang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. These residues include a conserved aspartate, and therefore it is possible that charge repulsion could cause movement of the 5&#x02032; side of the nick away from helix 5, which in turn would &#x0201c;drag&#x0201d; the cleavage site further from the junction crossover point.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we have shown that the presence of a 5&#x02032; phosphate at the strand discontinuity in a nicked HJ plays an important role in stimulating junction cleavage by RuvC. From this we conclude that the acceleration of second strand cleavage during HJ resolution by RuvC is not solely promoted by increased junction flexibility caused by incision of the first strand as previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Lilley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether a 5&#x02032; phosphate is similarly important for efficient bilateral strand cleavage by other HJ resolvases is yet to be determined. However, our observation that Mus81 cleaves nicked HJs with and without a 5&#x02032; phosphate with equal efficiency suggests that at least in some cases a nick may only be needed to impart junction flexibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Proteins</title><p>Recombinant <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Mus81-Eme1 was overexpressed <italic>in E. coli</italic> and purified as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005347-Gaskell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.
