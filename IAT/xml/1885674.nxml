The most important regulator of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene activity is 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> itself, which down-regulates the gene. The down-regulation of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene has been proposed to involve a negative vitamin D response element (nVDRE) that is located &#x0223c;500&#x02009;bp upstream from transcription start site (TSS). In this study, we reveal the existence of two new VDR-binding regions in the distal promoter, 2.6 and 3.2&#x02009;kb upstream from the TSS, that bind vitamin D receptor&#x02013;retinoid X receptor complexes. Since the down regulation of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene is tissue- and cell-type selective, a comparative study was done for the new 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive regions in HEK-293 human embryonic kidney and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that reflect tissues that, respectively, are permissive and non-permissive to the phenomenon of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-mediated down-regulation of this gene. We found significant differences in the composition of protein complexes associated with these <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter regions in the different cell lines, some of which reflect the capability of transcriptional repression of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene in these different cells. In addition, chromatin architecture differed with respect to chromatin looping in the two cell lines, as the new distal regions were differentially connected with the proximal promoter. This data explains, in part, why the human <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene is repressed in HEK-293 but not in MCF-7 cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1&#x003b1;, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>)), is required for mineral homeostasis and skeletal integrity, as well as controlling cell growth and differentiation in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the body, the amount of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is tightly controlled by several enzymes that are transcribed from genes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. This gene family encodes a wide variety of enzymes that are needed in the oxidative metabolism of a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). One of the enzymes needed in the metabolism of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is the protein product of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene, 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) 1&#x003b1; -hydroxylase. It has an important role in the synthesis of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> because it catalyzes the metabolic activation of the main circulating form of vitamin D, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, into 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene expression is negatively regulated by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, and this has been proposed to occur via a negative vitamin D response element (nVDRE), located &#x0223c;500&#x02009;bp upstream from transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The down-regulation of this gene by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is a cell-type and tissue-restricted phenomenon. In the body, the major expression site of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene and its protein product, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), is the kidney. Within this organ, both the mRNA and the protein product have been observed to be repressed in the presence of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in the proximal tubules only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene is also expressed in extra renal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), however the suppression of the gene by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has been described only in a few other cell lines derived from other tissues, such as colon-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The effects of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are mediated via the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, to which 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> binds with high affinity. Responsiveness of a given gene to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> requires that its regulatory regions contain a VDRE. The VDREs of positively regulated genes are direct repeats of two hexameric-core-binding motifs spaced by 3 or 4&#x02009;nt (DR3 or DR4, respectively) or everted repeats spaced by 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;nt (ER6 and ER9, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The hexameric sequences of the response elements of the primary 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target genes usually have the consensus sequence RGKTSA (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;A or G, K&#x02009;=&#x02009;G or T, S&#x02009;=&#x02009;C or G). The VDREs of most previously studied negatively regulated genes resemble those of positively regulated genes, although negative regulation may not necessarily require both VDRE half sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). The reported negative VDRE of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> is an exception, because it does not contain a consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, the authors proposed that the regulation of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene involves an indirect binding of VDR to DNA, where VDR associates with the nVDRE ligand-dependently via another transcription factor, the VDR interacting repressor (VDIR).</p><p>Binding of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> causes a conformational change within the ligand-binding domain of the VDR, which modulates its interactions with nuclear proteins, such as coactivator (CoA) and corepressor (CoR) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). CoR proteins, such as NCoR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and SMRT/NCoR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), link non-liganded, DNA-bound VDR to enzymes with histone deacetylase activity that cause chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The conformational change within VDR&#x02019;s ligand-binding domain results in the replacement of a CoR by a CoA protein of the p160 family, such as SRC-1, SRC-2 or SRC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). These CoAs link the ligand-activated VDR to enzymes displaying histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, such as CBP, that cause chromatin relaxation by their action on histone tails and thereby reversing the action of unliganded VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Traditionally, VDREs are thought to locate relatively close to the TSS of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target genes. For example, both human and rat vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (<italic>CYP24</italic>) genes have a cluster of VDREs in their proximal promoters (approximate position &#x02212;140 to &#x02212;300) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>). However, recently several promoter studies have revealed that the gene promoters may contain multiple response elements that locate not only within proximal promoters but also in more distal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and even within coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These studies have so far concerned with only positively regulated genes. This raises a question, whether negatively regulated genes also have multiple response elements. Since the promoter studies of the human <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene have so far been limited to the first 1.7&#x02009;kb upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>), in this study, we have extended the promoter analysis further upstream and examined the role of distal promoter regions to the regulation of the human <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. We analyzed 13 contiguous genomic regions spanning 5.4&#x02009;kb of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) scanning. Our studies revealed two new 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive regions in the distal promoter 2.6 and 3.2&#x02009;kb upstream from the TSS. Interestingly, in contrast to the nVDRE-containing region, <italic>in silico</italic> screening revealed that both of the new 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive regions contained classical VDRE sequences that were shown to directly bind VDR&#x02013;retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers in a ligand-dependent manner, when studied by gel shift assays. Extensive ChIP analysis suggested that the new regions have a number of similarities with the established nVDRE in the recruitment of different cofactors, as well as recruiting both VDR and RXR, supporting the idea that the putative VDREs are functional. In addition, chromatin conformation capture (3C) analysis suggested that the new regions are directly connected with the TSS via chromatin looping in a ligand-dependent and cell-specific manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2&#x02009;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 0.1&#x02009;mg/ml streptomycin and 100&#x02009;U/ml penicillin in a humidified 95% air&#x02013;5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Expression profiling of CYP27B1 gene expression in response to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub></title><p>To establish model systems, in which to study the expression level and the transcriptional responsiveness of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene, we have chosen the cell line HEK-293, which was derived from a tissue (kidney) where this gene is known to be regulated by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. As a reference, we took the cell line MCF-7, which is often used to study 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> signaling, but in which the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene is not regulated by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.

As a control, the methyltransferase-like-1 (<italic>METTL1</italic>) gene, a direct genomic neighbor of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene, was studied in case the hormone also regulated its transcription. Moreover, the levels of the <italic>VDIR</italic> gene were examined, because of its key role in the regulation of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Finally, the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene, which is known to be strongly up-regulated in the presence of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, was used as a positive control for the presence of the hormone. In HEK-293 cells, the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated after 6 and 24&#x02009;h treatment with 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that siVDR treatment significantly increased <italic>CYP27B1</italic> mRNA expression in HEK-293 cells but had no effect in MCF-7. For the expression of both the <italic>METTL1</italic> and the <italic>VDIR</italic> genes, no significant differences between control siRNA and VDR siRNA-treated cells could be observed, indicating that the changes in their mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) are probably not caused by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment. When unspecific siRNA was used, 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was able to up-regulate <italic>CYP24</italic> mRNA expression 3.5-fold in HEK-293 cells and 4000-fold in MCF-7 cells.

This region could be considered as the &#x02018;pure&#x02019; promoter of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene, since the <italic>METTL1</italic> gene is located only 1.2&#x02013;5.4&#x02009;kb upstream from its TSS.

We observed VDR binding to the region of the established nVDRE (region 2: &#x02212;350 to &#x02212;776) but also to two additional regions located further upstream (region 7: &#x02212;2486 to &#x02212;2885 and region 9: &#x02212;3070 to &#x02212;3462). All three regions recruited VDR in a ligand-dependent fashion, reaching a maximum 120&#x02009;min after onset of ligand treatment.

VDIR bound efficiently to the nVDRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), but did not interfere with the ligand-dependent VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimer formation on VDRE1, VDRE2 and the positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, E and F). Conversely, VDR and RXR did not associate on the nVDRE and did not interfere with VDIR binding to this element, either as monomers or as heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Similarly, an anti-VDR antibody could not modulate the binding of VDIR on the nVDRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), but it reduced the binding of VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers to VDRE1, VDRE2 and the positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, E and F). </p><p>Taken together, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the nVDRE shows only association with VDIR protein, while VDRE1 and VDRE2 binds only VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers.

As a positive control, we used the proximal promoter of the human <italic>CYP24</italic> gene that contains a cluster of DR3-type VDREs. The latter promoter fragment was 6-fold inducible by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in HEK-293 cells and showed even a 30-fold inducibility in MCF-7 cells. In HEK-293 cells the basal activity of regions 2, 7 and 9 of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter was reduced by 15&#x02013;40% by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment, but only the reductions of regions 2 and 9 were found to be statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

Region 6 of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter, which does not contain a VDRE, served as a negative control and a region covering the proximal promoter of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene including its VDRE cluster was the positive control. In addition to VDR and RXR, the proteins were chosen to represent general chromatin activity (AcH3 and AcH4), gene activation (the CoAs SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, CBP and pPolII) and gene repression (Sin3A and the CoRs SMRT and NCoR). At the three VDRE-containing regions of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter and in both cell types the acetylation level of histone H3 decreased in response to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment, while on the proximal promoter of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene it significantly increased.

The recruitment of HAT CBP, whose main substrate is the histone H3 tail, mirrored the changes in the histone H3 acetylation levels with the exception of the proximal promoter of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene in HEK-293 cells, which did not bind CBP. In both cell types, pPolII associated strongly with the region 2 (containing the nVDRE) and reduced its binding after ligand treatment. Interestingly, in HEK-293 cells the same observation was made with region 7 (containing VDRE1), while in MCF-7 cells pPolII remained associated with the region even after ligand treatment. In both cell lines, region 9 and the negative control did not show any binding of PolII, while the proximal promoter of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene demonstrated strong ligand-dependent recruitment of the polymerase.</p><p>The association of CoAs of the p160 family with different regions significantly differed in HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells. After ligand treatment in MCF-7 cells, SRC-1, SRC-2 and SRC-3 were recruited to the proximal <italic>CYP24</italic> promoter, while in HEK-293 cells this was the case only for SRC-1 and SRC-3. In HEK-293 cells, SRC-1 and SRC-3 bound only to region 2 of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter (and not to regions 6, 7 and 9) and dissociated from it after ligand stimulation.

The CoR, SMRT was recruited by ligand in both cell lines to regions 2 and 7 and dissociated from the proximal <italic>CYP24</italic> promoter region. SMRT was in HEK-293 cells and was also recruited to region 9, a phenomenon not observed in MCF-7-cell-derived chromatin templates. Finally, in HEK-293 cells, after ligand treatment, NCoR1 was recruited to regions 2, 7 and 9, while in MCF-7 cells it was only recruited to region 7 and in parallel dissociated from regions 2 and 9.

Under no conditions was a PCR product obtained with the genomic primers A and B, indicating that the control region was not looping to the TSS. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells VDRE1 containing-region (region 7) was ligand-dependently connected with proximal region (PCR fragment obtained by primers A and C) containing both the nVDRE and the TSS, while in HEK-293 cells this DNA looping occurred even in the absence of ligand.

Moreover, in HEK293 cells specifically, region 9 interacted with regions 1/2 only in the presence of hormone. This together with our previous reporter gene analysis indicates that region 9 contains a functional vitamin D-dependent repressor that is able to act together with the TSS/nVDRE-containing region to repress gene transcription. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells only a connection between regions 1/2 and region 7 was observed and this did not lead to gene repression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The mechanism of negative gene regulation by nuclear receptors is still poorly understood, but the human <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene and its down-regulation in the presence of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may be so far the most detailed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Since the model takes account only the proximal promoter of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene, we aimed in this study to test the hypothesis that also in the case of gene repression multiple response elements located in more distal regions may be involved in the regulation.</p><p>The distance between the TSSs of the neighboring genes <italic>CYP27B1</italic> and <italic>METTL1</italic> is only 5.4&#x02009;kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), with the <italic>METTL1</italic> gene being read in the same direction as <italic>CYP27B1</italic> (its last exon ends only 1.2&#x02009;kb upstream of the TSS of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic>gene). Thus, the promoter of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> seems to be only 1.2&#x02009;kb in size. Indeed, the studies of human and mouse <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoters have so far considered only the first 1.7&#x02009;kb upstream from the TSS of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting that the combined results of our <italic>in silico</italic> screening and promoter ChIP scanning suggested that within the studied <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter region, two additional VDREs, located in regions 7 and 9 (being within introns of the <italic>METTL1</italic> gene) upstream from region 2 carrying the nVDRE. According to our ChIP scanning of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter, the time-dependent binding profile of VDR was similar both in MCF-7 cells and HEK-293 cells with one exception. In HEK-293 cells, the VDR seemed to associate with the described <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene TSS stronger than in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Since region 1 possesses neither an nVDRE nor a regular VDRE, this may suggest that the protein bridge exists between the VDR-binding regions and the TSS in HEK-293, but not in MCF-7 cells.</p><p>According to Murayama and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), the association of the VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimer to the nVDRE is not a direct binding to DNA, but occurs via the transcription factor VDIR. We found that <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers cannot bind to the nVDRE although <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated VDIR can (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, with the distal VDREs, reasonable VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimer association could be observed with VDRE1 and VDRE2 from regions 7 and 9, respectively. This did not apply to the neighboring VDRE3, suggesting that VDR is associated only with VDRE2 within region 9. The binding of the VDR&#x02013;RXR complex to VDRE1 and VDRE2 was ligand dependent, but contrary to that of nVDRE, the binding may involve direct interactions with DNA sequences. Therefore, the new distal VDREs resemble positive VDREs, as has been previously described for most of the negative VDREs identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>A reporter gene analysis of different <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) showed that both the regions containing the nVDRE and VDRE2/3 were able to repress gene activity in HEK-293 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells. In addition, a longer promoter fragment including both the nVDRE and VDRE2/3, an even more significant repression was achieved. Therefore, our results suggest that both nVDRE and VDRE2/3 are efficient negative regulators of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter and work in HEK-293 cells together in the repression of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene expression.</p><p>Our ChIP data suggested that the acetylation level of histone H3 tails was decreased in both cells in response to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, although the histone H3 acetylation levels decreased, the chromatin did not change to completely non-permissive form, because the acetylation status of the histone H4&#x02009;at all regions remained constant or even increased after the addition of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. The acetylation level of histone H3&#x02009;at control region remained constantly high and acetylation level of histone H4 increased. This suggests that a wide area of chromatin of distal <italic>CYP27B1</italic> promoter is permissive in both cells in the absence of ligand, which may be related to the high basal activity of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene. Addition of ligand results in local deacetylation of regions 7 and 9 together with region 2 thus leading to repression. Neither of these histone acetylation patterns is able to describe the cell-type-selective repression described here. However, it is possible that other forms of histone marking such as methylation, acting alone or in combination with the histone acetylation may be involved. It is also possible that tissue-selective factors may have to be present.</p><p>In both cell types, different transcription factors were associated with the nVDRE in a very similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Significant differences could be observed in the recruitment of pPolII, the CoAs SRC-1 and SRC-3 and the CoR NCoR. In MCF-7 cells, the VDRE1-containing region seemed to favor interactions with CoAs more than in HEK-293 cells. Contrary to this, the region containing VDRE2/3 seemed to recruit CoRs more efficiently in HEK-293 cells than in MCF-7 cells. One possible explanation is that the different cell lines possess differing levels of distinct cofactors. According to the GNF SymAtlas database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), MCF-7 and HEK-293 cells differ significantly from each other with respect to expression of SRC-1, SRC-3, NCoR1 and HDAC2, where the respective CoAs are expressed more in MCF-7 cells, whilst NCoR1 and HDAC2 are more abundant in HEK-293 cells. Thus it is possible that, although the CYP27B1 promoter is similarly permissive in both cell types, concerning the binding of transcription factors, the repression of the gene is reached only in HEK-293 cells, because some important transcription factors are missing in MCF-7 cells. This could explain, at least in part, our ChIP data. Interestingly, the binding profiles of transcription factors at different regions were very similar, especially in HEK-293 cells. This suggests that it is possible that different regions may be connected with each other via chromatin looping and therefore the output of single antibody ChIP analysis of the distal and proximal regions actually represents the same super complex of transcription factors.</p><p>This hypothesis is supported by the fact that our 3C analysis confirmed that the proximal and distal regions of the human <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene promoter are in contact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). From the results, it can be observed that in MCF-7 cells region 7 (containing VDRE1) is connected to the region containing the TSS in a ligand-dependent manner, but the region containing VDRE2/3 does not form any similar connections. In contrast to this, in HEK-293 cells, regions encompassing both VDRE1 and VDRE2/3 were connected with a region containing the TSS of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene. The connection between the VDRE1-containing region and the proximal promoter was present both in the absence and in the presence of ligand. However, the most striking result was that VDRE2/3-containing region was only in contact with the proximal promoter when 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was present. This suggests that VDRE1-containing region seems to be related more with basal (positive) transcriptional activity and that the VDRE2/3-containing region may have an important role in transcriptional repression. Please note that because there were no restriction-enzyme-cutting sites between the nVDRE and the TSS, it was impossible to determine exactly if VDRE1 or VDRE2/3 are connected to the nVDRE or TSS or both. In this case, the 3C analysis only reveals that the distal regions are connected with the proximal region that contains both the nVDRE and TSS.</p><p>In the light of our results presented here, we propose a model that may explain the role of distal VDREs in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). When the gene is active, chromatin looping brings the distal region, which includes VDRE1, close to the proximal promoter. Both regions associate with a common super complex of transcription factors that is broadly transcriptionally positive and includes CoAs such as SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and CBP. The nVDRE is connected via VDIR, but the anchoring transcription factor at VDRE1 is presently unknown. We cannot either exclude the possibility that the ligand-independent looping happens via some other element that locates close to VDRE1. The HAT activity of CBP acetylates the histone H3 tails and thus keeps the chromatin at proximal promoter permissive for basal transcriptional machinery including pPolII. The region containing VDRE2/3 on the other hand is not involved in the transcriptional activation of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene as can be inferred from its non-connectedness to the TSS-containing region in MCF-7 cells. However, it seems to recruit several transcription factors including repressive proteins, which are missing from the super complex associated with the nVDRE- and VDRE1-containing chromatin regions, selectively in HEK-293 cells. This suggests that a different complex is bound to this region, but the purpose of this complex is presently unknown as well as how the protein complex is associated with the region containing VDRE2/3. The addition of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> results in the modulation of the super complex where activating transcription factors are replaced with repressing proteins. At the same time, the chromatin architecture changes and chromatin looping locates VDRE2/3 close to proximal promoter allowing it to associate with a common repressive super complex together with nVDRE and VDRE1. </p><p>In conclusion, we have revealed that the responsiveness of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is a cell-type-selective event that involves different combinations of multiple VDREs that act to recruit and interact with protein super complexes of differing transcriptional abilities. It is hoped that this work will allow us to understand better gene repression by nuclear receptors in general and the tissue-selective nature of the <italic>CYP27B1</italic> gene repression by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> specifically.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Shigeagi Kato for VDIR cDNA, Dr Job Dekker for help with the 3C technique, Dr Lise Binderup for 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and Maija Hiltunen for help in cell culture.

The dependence of the hormone responsiveness of the genes on VDR expression was investigated by RNAi inhibition experiments. For this purpose, the cells were transfected with unspecific control siRNA oligomers or with specific siRNAs against the VDR mRNA. The siRNA treatment time was 72&#x02009;h.
