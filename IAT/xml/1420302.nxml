Phosphorylation with cyclin E/CDK2, a kinase previously reported to phosphorylate SF3b1, generated a completely different pattern of phosphopeptides. By mass spectrometry and mutational analysis of SF3b1, Thr434 was identified as the major phosphorylation site for DYRK1A. Overexpression of DYRK1A or the related kinase, DYRK1B, resulted in an enhanced phosphorylation of Thr434 in endogenous SF3b1 in COS-7 cells.

Spliceosome assembly proceeds <italic>via </italic>the step-wise recruitment of U1 snRNP, U2 snRNP, and U4/U6&#x000b7;U5 tri-snRNP on a pre-mRNA as well as multiple rearrangements between the spliceosomal components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. After splicing catalysis, the spliceosome dissociates into its snRNP subunits, which take part in ensuing rounds of splicing.</p><p>Both spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The best studied targets for phosphorylation are members of the SR family of splicing factors, which contain domains rich in Arg/Ser dipeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several kinases phosphorylate these RS domains and modulate interaction of SR proteins with other proteins during spliceosome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, phosphorylation affects the intranuclear distribution of splicing factors and alternative splice site selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The only non-SR component of the spliceosome known to be phosphorylated during splicing catalysis is SF3b1 (also called SAP155 or SF3b155), one of the subunits of the U2 snRNP-associated complex SF3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. SF3b1 is positioned at the spliceosome catalytic center and contacts pre-mRNA on both sides of the branch site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Phosphorylation of SF3b1 appears to be functionally important in the basic splicing reaction as it is detected only in functional spliceosomes and occurs concomitant with splicing catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The N-terminal part of SF3b1 contains abundant Thr-Pro dipeptides motifs which are potential phosphorylation sites of proline-directed kinases like the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Indeed, cyclin E/CDK2 has been shown to phosphorylate SF3b1 <italic>in vitro </italic>and to be associated with the U2 snRNP complex <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We have recently identified several splicing factors, including SF3b1, as substrates of the protein kinase DYRK1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. DYRK1A is a nuclear protein kinase that has been localised to the splicing factor compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, we have previously characterised DYRK1A as a kinase that targets serine/threonine followed by a proline residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Here we report that DYRK1A efficiently phosphorylates SF3b1 within the TP-rich domain at several sites that are also phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in COS-7 cells.

In order to further characterise SF3b1 as a substrate of DYRK1A, we performed a kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of His<sub>6</sub>-SF3b1<sub>304&#x02013;493</sub>, the fusion protein produced from the library clone, by GST-DYRK1A-&#x00394;C. The C-terminally deleted mutant of GST-DYRK1A was used for <italic>in vitro</italic>-kinase assays since this construct exhibits the same substrate specificity but is more active than wild type GST-DYRK1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>value obtained for total phosphate incorporation into the substrate was 2.16 +/- 1.72 &#x003bc;M (mean of three independent experiments +/- S.E.M.), characterising SF3b1 as a high affinity substrate of DYRK1A. A representative experiment is shown below in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. Notably, His<sub>6</sub>-SF3b1<sub>304&#x02013;493 </sub>contains 14 Thr-Pro dipeptide motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) which are potential target sites for DYRK1A.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DYRK1A phosphorylates SF3b1 within the TP-domain</bold>.

Assuming that DYRK1A may phosphorylate one ore more of the Thr-Pro dipeptides, we took advantage of a commercially available antibody which recognises phosphothreonine C-terminally flanked by proline (pTP) to detect phosphorylation of SF3b1. This antibody detected two bands in the immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing GFP-SF3b1-NT, of which the lower one (apparent molecular weight of about 95 kD) also reacted with the GFP-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The difference from the calculated molecular weight (82.4 kD) is possibly due to post-translational modifications. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, both bands were eliminated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, the upper band was also found after immunoprecipitation with an SF3b1-specific antibody, but not in untransfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Thus, this band most likely represents a highly phosphorylated form of GFP-SF3b1-NT which is present in too low amounts to be detected by the GFP-specific antibody (see also below, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Co-transfection of DYRK1A caused a very pronounced and dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of SF3b1-NT (95kD-band) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), strongly suggesting that DYRK1A phosphorylates SF3b1 in COS-7 cells. This effect required low amounts of GFP-DYRK1A compared with its substrate GFP-SF3b1-NT, as evidenced by the direct comparison of GFP-immunoreactivity (second lane in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of SF3b1 by DYRK1A in COS-7 cells</bold>.

Protein kinases of the CLK family are related with the DYRK family and also phosphorylate splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a further control, we used GFP-DYRK1A-K188R which carries a point mutation in the ATP binding site and exhibits greatly reduced catalytic activity (1&#x02013;3% of residual activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, co-expression of GFP-CLK3 failed to induce phosphorylation of SF3b1 as compared to GFP alone. As shown by immunodetection with the GFP-specific antibody, GFP-CLK3 was expressed at similar levels as wild type GFP-DYRK1A (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Immunocomplex kinase assays with myelin basic protein as substrate confirmed that GFP-CLK3 was an active protein kinase when expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Unexpectedly, co-expression of DYRK1A-K188R significantly enhanced phosphorylation of SF3b1-NT, although the effect was much weaker than that of the wild type kinase (note also that in the experiment shown DYRK1A-K188R was expressed at a higher level than wild type DYRK1A). The result that a mutant of DYRK1A with reduced activity (K188R), but not the related kinase CLK3, enhanced threonine phosphorylation of SF3b1-NT is evidence of the specificity of this reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the phosphorylation of SF3b1 by DYRK1A and cyclin E/CDK2</title><p>SF3b1 is phosphorylated concomitant with or just after catalytic step one of the splicing reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

In order to compare the phosphorylation of SF3b1-NT-His<sub>6 </sub>by DYRK1A and cyclin E/CDK2, we performed a preliminary kinetic analysis of both reactions by measuring the velocities of phosphate incorporation at two different substrate concentrations (0.7 and 7 &#x003bc;M).

COS-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-SF3b1-NT and metabolically labelled by incubation with <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate. Phosphopeptide mapping of the immunoprecipitated GFP-SF3b1-NT fusion protein showed that the <italic>in vivo</italic>-phosphorylation pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) strikingly resembled the phosphorylation pattern obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic>-phosphorylation with DYRK1A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Six of the spots on the <italic>in vivo</italic>-map matched phosphopeptides generated by DYRK1A <italic>in vitro </italic>and comigrated in the map of a mixed sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A+C</xref>), strongly suggesting that the phosphopeptides generated <italic>in vitro </italic>by DYRK1A are identical with those generated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unlike <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, spot 1 was much more intense than spot 2. A possible explanation for this difference is a superposition of signals derived from spot 1 and a comigrating phosphopeptide (spot X) that is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>by a kinase other than DYRK1A (see below, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). No match was detectable between the cyclin E/CDK2 phosphopeptide map and the <italic>in vivo </italic>map (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B+C</xref>). This result provides evidence that the major part of the phosphorylation within the Thr-Pro-rich domain of SF3b1 is catalysed by DYRK1A or a related kinase with similar substrate specificity. However, it cannot be excluded that relevant CDK2 sites escaped detection because phosphopeptides were lost during purification or were poorly soluble in the running buffers.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>SF3b1 is phosphorylated at Thr434 by endogenous kinases in COS-7 cells and <italic>in vitro </italic>by DYRK1A</bold>.

Two phosphorylated peptides were identified: (1) VLPPPAGYVPIR<underline>T</underline>PAR, containing Thr426 (underlined) as the phosphoamino acid; the phosphorylated residue completely inhibited tryptic cleavage at the preceding Arg whereas in an unphosphorylated sample, this cleavage occurred freely. (2) KL<underline>T</underline>A<underline>T</underline>PTPLGGMTGFHMQTEDR (with both Met residues in the sulphoxide form &#x02013; a side reaction of preparation). MS<sup>2 </sup>and MS<sup>3 </sup>analysis of this peptide indicated that the phosphorylation was confined to either of the first two threonines of the peptide (Thr432 or Thr434) but from the data the labelled residue could not be distinguished. This was because the predicted fragment ions needed to resolve this question laid beyond the dynamic range of the ion-trap instrument. Attempts to examine smaller MS<sup>2 </sup>ions further by MS<sup>3 </sup>to gain access to this region were unproductive, as were secondary digest attempts with chymotrypsin. We considered Thr434 the more likely target because DYRK1A is a proline-directed kinase. Therefore we prepared alanine mutants of Thr426 and Thr434 by site directed mutagenesis of SF3b1-NT. In addition, Thr273 and Thr303 were mutated because the surrounding sequences of both threonines (Thr273: G<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>GDT<sub>273</sub><bold><underline>P</underline></bold>; Thr303: TE<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>DT<sub>303</sub><bold><underline>P</underline></bold>) matched known target sequences of DYRK1A (<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>XXS/T<bold><underline>P</underline></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; <bold><underline>R</underline></bold>XS/T<bold><underline>P</underline></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]).</p><p>The mutant proteins were phosphorylated with GST-DYRK1A-&#x00394;C <italic>in vitro </italic>and analysed by peptide mapping. Mutation of Thr434 resulted in the loss of the two most prominent spots (spots 1 and 2; right panels of Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), indicating that Thr434 is the major phosphorylation site for DYRK1A. The existence of two different phosphopeptides containing Thr434 can be explained by incomplete tryptic cleavage as the MS analysis showed this peptide to exist with and without the lysine at the N-terminus. Such ragged N- or C-termini can be expected when an XRKX sequence is cleaved by trypsin.

The mutants T426A and T303A yielded the same pattern of spots as the wild type protein (data not shown). The failure to detect the VLPPPAGYVPIR<underline>T</underline>PAR phosphopeptide containing Thr426, which was identified as a phosphorylated residue by MS, may be due to poor solubility of this peptide under the conditions applied.</p><p>Next we asked whether Thr273 and Thr434 are <italic>in vivo </italic>phosphorylation sites of SF3b1. The respective point mutants of GFP-SF3b1-NT were metabolically labelled in COS-7 cells and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. Analysis of SF3b1-NT-T273A did not reveal differences between the wild type and the mutated protein (data not shown). In contrast, one of the major phosphopeptides (spot 2) was absent in the map of GFP-SF3b1-NT-T434A as compared to the wild type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This result confirms our conclusion that spot 2 represents the same phosphopeptide in the <italic>in vitro </italic>and the <italic>in vivo</italic>-maps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We assume that the absence of the other peptide (spot 1) is masked by a comigrating phosphopeptide (spot X). Spot X is lacking in SF3b1-NT-T434A after phosphorylation by DYRK1A <italic>in vitro</italic>, hence this phosphopeptide appears to harbour the only major phosphorylation site not recognised by DYRK1A.

In addition, three new spots appeared that were not detectable when SF3b1 was labelled without coexpression of DYRK1A (arrows).

In contrast, the commercial pThrPro-specific antibody also bound to other phosphorylated ThrPro motifs in the T434A mutant of SF3b1. This result shows that the pT434-directed antibody exhibits high specificity for this phosphorylation site in SF3b1.</p><p>The anti-pT434 antibody was then used to study the phosphorylation of Thr434 in transfected COS-7 cells. To assess the specificity of the reaction, several nuclear protein kinases were tested in parallel with DYRK1A for their capacity to enhance phosphorylation of Thr434 in GFP-SF3b1-NT. DYRK1B is the kinase most closely related to DYRK1A (85% of identical amino acids in the catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) was selected as a more distant member of the DYRK family (42% identity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and CLK3 is a kinase known to phosphorylate splicing factors (see above). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, the pThr434-specific antibody detected SF3b1-NT in cells that did not overexpress DYRK1A (leftmost lane). This result is consistent with the labelling of spots 1 and 2 by endogenous kinases in COS-7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Signal intensity was dose-dependently enhanced by co-expression of DYRK1A or DYRK1B but not DYRK1A-K188R. SF3b1-T434A (lane 5) was not recognised by the antibody, confirming that the antibody was indeed specific for phosphoThr434. Notably, co-expression of HIPK2, but not CLK3, also resulted in an increased phosphorylation of Thr434 in SF3b1-NT. A second band (marked by an asterisk in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) could also be identified as a form of SF3b1-NT because of its absence in cells transfected with SF3b1-NT-T434A. As noted above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), it is likely that this band represents a posttranslationally modified form of the protein.</p><p>In addition to the recombinant SF3b1-NT protein, the anti-pT434 antibody labelled a band with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa that was only detectable in lysates of cells overexpressing catalytically active DYRK1A or DYRK1B. This band co-migrated with the endogenous SF3b1 protein as identified by a commercially available antibody. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, the 150-kDa band was also detected in a nuclear protein fraction purified from DYRK1A-overexpressing COS-7, further supporting the identification as SF3b1. These data provide evidence that DYRK1A and DYRK1B can phosphorylate the full length, endogenous SF3b1 protein in intact cells.

One of the components of SF3b, SF3b1, is known to be reversibly phosphorylated during splicing catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], suggesting that protein kinases play a role in the regulation of splicing. Previous studies have shown that cyclin E/CDK2 complexes associate with spliceosomal proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that CDK2 phosphorylates SF3b1 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here we provide evidence that the protein kinase DYRK1A phosphorylates SF3b1 <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The N-terminal part of Sf3b1 harbours a large number of Thr/Pro dipeptide motifs within a 240-amino acid region preceding the carboxyterminal repeat domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Both DYRK1A and CDK2 are proline-directed kinases, <italic>i.e. </italic>they phosphorylate serine or threonine residues followed by a proline residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has been shown that cyclin E/CDK2 phosphorylates SF3b1 <italic>in vitro </italic>at multiple sites within the TP-rich domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that SF3b1 is phosphorylated by DYRK1A and cyclin E/CDK2 <italic>in vitro </italic>with similarly high affinity, but at different sites. Strikingly, the majority of the <italic>in vivo</italic>-phosphorylation sites within the N-terminal domain of SF3b1 corresponded to sites phosphorylated by DYRK1A <italic>in vitro</italic>, and overexpression of DYRK1A also enhanced the labelling of these phosphopeptides <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, overexpression of DYRK1A resulted in the increased phosphorylation of Thr434 in endogenous SF3b1, indicating that enzyme and substrate come into contact in living cells. However, in contrast to cyclin E/CDK2, DYRK1A does not appear to be stably associated with SF3b1 as we failed to detect the interaction in pulldown assays (data not shown).</p><p>Our conclusion that DYRK1A is the major SF3B1 kinase in asynchronously growing COS-7 cells is not in contradiction to previous reports that CDK2 phosphorylates SF3b1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] but rather complements these studies. Seghezzi <italic>et al. </italic>reported that only about 30% of the SF3b1-phosphorylating activity in immunoprecipitated SF3b1 complexes was inhibited by the CDK inhibitor p21, leading the authors to suggest "the existence of other kinases in the (...) complex" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Boudrez <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] also observed that SF3b1 kinase activity in lysates from COS-1 cells was only partially suppressed by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. It is well possible that the relative contribution of different kinases to phosphorylation of SF3b1 varies in different experimental systems (nuclear extracts, cellular extracts, immunoprecipitated splicing complexes). In our <italic>in vivo</italic>-phosphopeptide maps, no spot corresponded to a site also phosphorylated by cyclin E/CDK2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that CDK2 did not contribute detectably to phosphate incorporation into SF3b1 under these conditions. In contrast, 6 phosphopeptides matched spots that were obtained after phosphorylation with DYRK1A <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that DYRK1A or another protein kinase with similar substrate specificity, <italic>e.g. </italic>DYRK1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], catalyses the phosphorylation of SF3b1 in COS-7 cells at multiple sites. Overexpression of DYRK1B caused indeed an increase in the phosphorylation of Thr434 in SF3b1. Other members of the DYRK family, DYRK2 and DYRK3, are primarily localised in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and are thus unlikely to phosphorylate SF3b1. The proposed role of DYRK1A as a regulator of an essential splicing factor is in agreement with its ubiquitous expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the evolutionary conservation of DYRK kinases throughout the eukaryotic kingdoms, and the embryonic lethality of mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the <italic>Dyrk1a </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast, DYRK1B has a more restricted pattern of expression, and DYRK1B deficient mice are viable (S. Leder, M. Moser and W. Becker, unpublished data). Further studies will be necessary to reveal the roles of DYRK1A and DYRK1B in splicing.</p><p>Our experiments do not formally exclude the possibility that another nuclear kinase produces the phosphorylation pattern observed in COS-7 cells. We have tested HIPK2 as a DYRK-related kinase and found that this kinase was indeed able to phosphorylate Thr434 in GFP-SF3b1-NT. However, overexpression of HIPK2 did not cause phosphorylation of Thr434 in endogenous SF3b1, making it unlikely that this kinase targets SF3b1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, downregulation of DYRK1A by RNA interference led to a marked reduction of Thr434 phosphorylation in HEK293T and in HepG2 cells, providing evidence that in these cell lines DYRK1A is the major kinase that targets this phosphorylation site. It should be noted that one predominant <italic>in vivo</italic>-phosphopeptide (spot X in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) was neither labelled by DYRK1A nor by CDK2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, providing evidence that at least one more kinase phosphorylates SF3b1.</p><p>The present data identify Thr434 as the major phosphorylation site of DYRK1A in SF3b1. This site does not exactly match the consensus recognition site for DYRK1A as previously determined in peptide assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] since no arginine is present at position -2 or -3 relative to the phosphorylation site. However, <italic>in vitro</italic>-assays with a peptide mimicking the sequence context of Thr434 showed that this target sequence is similarly well recognised as a peptide designed according to the consensus phosphorylation sequence for DYRK1A (K. de Graaf, R. Frank and W. Becker, unpublished data).</p><p>At present we can only speculate on the effects of the phosphorylation of SF3b1. Protein-protein interactions of SF3b1 with U2AF35/65, the SF3b component p14, and nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1) have been mapped to the TP-rich domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NIPP1 contains a phosphothreonine-binding forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and the binding to NIPP1 has been shown to depend on the phosphorylation of SF3b1 by cyclin/CDK complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Coexpression of DYRK1A failed to alter the binding of SF3b1-NT to NIPP1 in pulldown assays (data not shown), most likely because CDKs and DYRK1A phosphorylate different sites within SF3b1. It should also be noted that Thr434 is located at the C-terminal end of the TP-rich domain and was absent in some of the constructs to which protein interactions had been mapped in the studies mentioned above. The location of Thr434 in the hinge region between the TP-rich domain and the C-terminal domain makes it tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of this residue may regulate the conformational changes of SF3b that have been proposed to be required for binding of the RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present data indicate that DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B phosphorylate specific threonine residues within the TP-rich domain of the spliceosomal protein SF3b1.
