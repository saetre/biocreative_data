The ability of those tumor cells to conform to new environments is due to a molecular plasticity.

This approach was only performed on the canine model due to the greater number of cells that express only sLe<sup>x</sup> as compared to the MARY-X model. The evaluation of the expression of sLe<sup>x</sup> using a specific monoclonal antibody showed no detection of this carbohydrate antigen on the E-cadherin immunoprecipitate from canine mammary carcinoma cell line, CMT-U27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006636-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

This study investigated two interesting exceptions to the above rule, namely the inflammatory breast cancer model, MARY-X and a canine mammary carcinoma model. Both models are highly metastatic, yet display neither a loss in E-cadherin expression nor overall gain in the carbohydrate ligand-binding epitope of endothelial cells, sLe<sup>x</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006636-Pinho1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006636-Ferrara1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Rather, these two exceptions suggest a more &#x0201c;adaptable&#x0201d; metastatic progression as opposed to a &#x0201c;one way&#x0201d; progression from the invasive (loss of E-cadherin expression) to malignant phenotype (gain in sLe<sup>x</sup> expression). The heterogeneous population of cellular expression suggests a dynamic &#x0201c;back and forth&#x0201d; transition state between phenotypes that might promote survival of the tumor embolus during metastatic progression.</p><p>Our study shows a correlated inverse relationship of E-cadherin and sLe<sup>x</sup> expression in the genesis, dissemination and subsequent metastases in the MARY-X and canine mammary carcinoma models. These preliminary findings suggest that loss and gain in expression of adhesion molecules is not an aberrant variation but rather an adaptive cellular and molecular mechanism of the cancer that contribute to its metastatic ability. Our findings are the beginning to a better understanding of these adaptive mechanisms. More specifically, since molecular variation contributes to cancer progression and survival then the present findings set the ground for targeting these mechanisms resulting in new therapeutic strategies of metastatic disease. Further work is in progress regarding the clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying gene expression of these two key molecules through out the metastatic progression in both comparative models.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests the existence of a biologically coordinated mechanism of E-cadherin and sLe<sup>x</sup> expression (i.e. molecular plasticity) essential for tumor establishment and metastatic progression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Eva Hellm&#x000e9;n for providing the CMT-U27 carcinoma cell line.
