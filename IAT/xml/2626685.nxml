They participate in numerous cell&#x02013;cell recognition events and can also mediate the binding to vertebrate cells of certain toxins and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). A relatively common postsynthetic modification of sialic acid is <italic>O</italic>-acetylation at the C-9 position. Acetylation of sialic acid also frequently occurs at the C-7 position, from where the acetyl group can spontaneously migrate to the 9-OH position under physiological conditions. The hemagglutinin esterases of influenza C viruses and certain nidoviruses, including group 2 coronaviruses, recognize 9<italic>-O-</italic>acetylated sialic acid&#x02013;containing glycoconjugates on the surface of host cells, and some can remove the 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). However, the in vivo biological function of this acetylation event has remained a mystery. One attempt to elucidate the biological role of sialic acid 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation involved the transgenic expression of Influenza C hemagglutinin esterase in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). This led to a defect in early embryogenesis, indirectly suggesting that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl sialic acid may be essential during murine development. In vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) suggested that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid containing glycoconjugates impairs the recognition of this glycan moiety by certain Siglecs (sialic acid binding Ig superfamily lectins) including CD22. However, despite these and other tantalizing clues, the intrinsic in vivo functions of this abundant modification have not been established.</p><p>The Siglecs are the largest known group of vertebrate sialic acid-recognizing cell surface proteins. This family comprises 13 members in humans including sialoadhesin (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), CD33 (Siglec-3), myelin associated glycoprotein (Siglec-4), Siglec-15, and the so-called CD33-related Siglecs, 5&#x02013;10, 11, and 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). CD22 is one of the best studied Siglecs and binds specifically to &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid&#x02013;containing N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). CD22 inhibitory signaling depends on the recruitment of SHP-1 to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Antigen receptor cross-linking leads to the activation of Lyn and other less abundant Src-family kinases that phosphorylate ITIM tyrosines in CD22. Initiation of inhibitory signaling by CD22 is not well understood and the exact mechanism remains controversial. The simplest model that may be indirectly inferred from the phenotypes of KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) suggests that antigen receptor ligation contributes to the sialic acid&#x02013;dependent recruitment of CD22 to the BCR and the subsequent phosphorylation by Lyn of CD22 ITIM tyrosines, which is followed by the recruitment and activation of SHP-1. Other mechanisms of signal initiation have been suggested by several studies variously implicating sialic acid&#x02013;dependent homooligomerization and sialic acid&#x02013;independent association of this Siglec with the B cell receptor (BCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Because CD22 is expressed constitutively on mature B cells and &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid&#x02013;containing <italic>N</italic>-glycans are abundantly present on the cell surface, it could be argued that CD22 inhibition may itself be constitutive. How inhibitory signaling via CD22 is temporally regulated in mature B cells is unclear. Because CD22 does not bind to 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acid in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), we considered the possibility that the function of this Siglec might be regulated in vivo by the enzymatic acetylation and deacetylation of &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid. Sialic acid acetyl esterase (Siae), which is molecularly characterized as an enzyme that removes acetyl groups from the 9-OH position of &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), was also independently identified as a gene that is up-regulated during B cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), suggesting a role in the biology of B lymphocytes. In this paper, we show that Siae influences B cell signaling and B cell development and participates in inhibitory signaling mechanisms that are crucial to the maintenance of immunological tolerance in the B lineage.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Sialate <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase is secreted and can access the cell surface</title><p>The <italic>Siae</italic> gene (<italic>sialate:O-acetyl esterase</italic>) can generate two alternatively spliced variants. One form contains a signal peptide and can encode a protein that enters the secretory pathway (originally called Lse [lysosomal sialic acid acetylesterase]), whereas the other lacks this signal peptide and encodes a cytosolic esterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Although the Lse protein was thought to localize to lysosomes, a site that would not be suitable for the modification of Siglec ligands, we have observed in transfected cells that this protein exhibits, at best, a limited lysosomal localization and is secreted and can bind to the surface of transfected cells (Figs. S1 and S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1</ext-link>). The enzyme, therefore, has the potential to remove acetyl groups from 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Siglec ligands in a post Golgi vesicle or at the cell surface. Although some antibodies against Siae have been generated, they lack the specificity to detect Siae in murine cells and tissue sections. The actual location of the Siae protein in murine B cells is therefore yet to be conclusively established.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Siae</italic><sup>&#x00394;2/&#x00394;2</sup> mice</title><p>Exon 2 of the <italic>Siae</italic> gene is unique to <italic>Lse</italic>.

We sought to examine if there was a defect in CD22 signaling in <italic>Siae</italic><sup>&#x00394;2/&#x00394;2</sup> mice. After BCR cross-linking, CD22 was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitates were examined for CD22 tyrosine phosphorylation and for associated SHP-1 using Western blot assays. As seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (left, experiment 1; and right, experiment 2), tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 after BCR signaling was reduced in <italic>Siae</italic><sup>&#x00394;2/&#x00394;2</sup> mice in spite of similar levels of surface CD22 expression in WT and mutant mice (Figs.

A well established reagent for the detection of 9-<italic>O-</italic>acetylated &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid is a fusion protein containing the Fc portion of human IgG and the influenza C hemagglutinin esterase treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Modification of the catalytic serine nucleophile in this fusion protein by diisopropyl fluorophosphate permits the viral protein to bind to 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl sialic acid but not to cleave it.

No gross defect in T cell development was discovered in the absence of Siae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>), although there was a small decrease in T cell numbers both in the thymus and the spleen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables III</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">IV</xref>). Other B cell&#x02013;deficient mice have been reported to have a mild decrease in T cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).

Murine CD22, unlike human CD22, has a markedly higher affinity for Neu5Gc (sialic acid with an <italic>N</italic>-glycolyl moiety in the C5 position; the major form in the mouse) as compared with Neu5Ac (sialic acid with an <italic>N</italic>-acetyl moiety in the C5 position) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). The enzyme CMP-Neu-5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, and mice lacking this enzyme not only synthesize <italic>N</italic>-glycans with a subtly different form of sialic acid that binds CD22 poorly but they also exhibit a poorly understood down-regulation of <italic>Siae</italic> expression and an increase in 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). <italic>Cmah</italic>-null mice as well as <italic>Cmah/Siae</italic> double mutant mice would therefore be expected to exhibit BCR hyperreactivity, the relative loss of MZ B cells, and a relative loss of perisinusoidal B cells. Indeed, B cells from <italic>Cmah</italic> mutant mice have been reported to exhibit an enhanced proliferative response to BCR cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). We show here that B cells from <italic>Cmah</italic>-null mice have higher levels of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyated sialic acid as revealed by CHE-FcD binding (Fig. S10, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1</ext-link>).

These common features include an enhancement of BCR-induced release of calcium from internal stores, the loss of MZ B cells, a reduction in BM perisinusoidal B cells, alterations in B cell proliferation that are dependent on the degree and duration of BCR cross-linking, some increase in follicular B cell apoptosis, and the spontaneous development of antinuclear antibodies.</p><p>Our results suggest that in <italic>Siae</italic> mutant mice, terminal &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid moieties on <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans are 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated and, as a result, CD22 cannot readily inhibit BCR signaling. Although these results imply that ligation of CD22 by &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6 sialic acid&#x02013;containing ligands contributes to inhibitory signaling, the precise role that sialoglyconjugates play in the function of CD22 remains to be determined with certainty. The phenotypes of CD22 KO mice clearly suggest that a major in vivo function of this Siglec is to attenuate BCR signaling, but other studies have suggested that CD22 may potentially contribute to both inhibitory and activating functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Mutating or blocking the sialic acid binding site of CD22 in a cell line context led to a loss of CD22 inhibitory signaling as indicated by an enhanced calcium flux after BCR ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Knockin mice harboring an identical mutation in the sialic acid binding site of CD22 exhibited some, but not all, of the phenotypic changes seen in CD22 null mice. Strikingly, an enhanced calcium flux was not observed in this knockin mouse after BCR ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Background-dependent modifier genes do contribute to differences seen in CD22-dependent phenotypes in KO and knockin animals, and there is growing evidence from SNP genotyping that even inbred mice strains are heterogenous at several loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Nevertheless, no satisfactory explanation can be provided at present for the discrepant results of site directed mutagenesis-based studies of CD22 function.</p><p>ST6GalI is the sialyl transferase that transfers sialic acid in an &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked form from CMP-Sia to the preterminal galactose on <italic>N</italic>-glycans in the Golgi. In mice lacking ST6GalI, the absence of ligands for CD22 might have been expected to result in enhanced BCR signaling. Instead, these mice exhibit a gross defect in B cell signaling after ligation of the BCR and of other mitogenic receptors in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). One interpretation provided for these data is that in the absence of &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid in the <italic>ST6GalI</italic>-null mouse, CD22 fails to multimerize and cannot be sequestered from the BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). It is possible that in the absence of ST6GalI, inhibition of the BCR by CD22 is enhanced because of an abnormal facilitation of CD22 and IgM colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). However, the basis for this enhanced colocalization is not known, the reason for the relatively broad defect in signaling in <italic>ST6GalI</italic> mutant mice is not entirely clear, and is it not fully understood why these mice have defects in thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>Mice that lack both CD22 and ST6GalI exhibit enhanced BCR signaling similar to that seen in CD22-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Although these data have been interpreted to indicate a restoration in the absence of CD22 of BCR signaling that was diminished in the absence of ST6Gal I, both studies on <italic>cd22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/ST6GalI<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice do not actually show a restoration of BCR signaling to WT levels but demonstrate that BCR signaling is enhanced in double mutant mice to levels similar to those seen in <italic>cd22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> B cells. The loss of CD22 may be considered to be dominant. These data are therefore compatible with the possibility that CD22 can provide inhibitory signals constitutively, presumably by providing ITIM tyrosines as a potential substrate for phosphorylation by Lyn and other Src family kinases. Nevertheless, CD22 might provide optimal inhibitory signals only in the presence of its sialoglycoconjugate ligands. The total absence of &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6-linked sialic acid may represent a relatively drastic alteration that could result in aberrant capping of <italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine termini of many glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) and might affect B cell function adversely in poorly understood ways. A subtle alteration of the structure of CD22 ligands, such as enhanced 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acid in mice with mutant <italic>Siae</italic>, or the combined loss of Neu5Gc and enhanced 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acid in the <italic>Cmah</italic>-null mouse and the <italic>Cmah-Siae</italic> double mutant mouse both appear to provide somewhat different insights compared with those obtained from the <italic>ST6Gal1</italic> KO mouse harboring a more global alteration in CD22 ligand structure.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Siae</italic> mutant mice that have detectable anti-DNA antibodies when they are 5 mo of age, <italic>cd22</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, also on a C57BL/6 background, develop anti-DNA antibodies only when they are at least 9 mo old, and these latter mice do not develop kidney deposits of antibody and complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Collectively, the spontaneous secretion of increased levels of class switched immunoglobulins and antichromatin antibodies, the accumulation of glomerular immune complex deposits, and the apparent activation-dependent attrition of follicular B cells in <italic>Siae</italic> mutant mice suggest a stronger phenotype in these mice than that observed in mice lacking CD22. These data suggest indirectly that Siae might not only attenuate CD22 function but may also possibly regulate an additional Siglec or Siglecs in B cells, although direct evidence for such a hypothesis is lacking. A second inhibitory Siglec in murine B cells, Siglec G, has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). However, although Siglec G&#x02013;deficient mice exhibit a marked increase in B-1a B cells, IgG autoantibodies are not increased. It remains to be determined whether this or any other Siglec, other than CD22, is regulated by Siae.

The enhanced BCR signaling noted in mice that lack CD22 and in <italic>Siae</italic> mutant mice suggests that loss of tolerance may result from a mechanism that is distinct from models invoking clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy, all of which might be presumed to be enhanced, not abrogated, by an increase in BCR signal strength in B cells. These well established mechanisms of tolerance have been studied extensively using transgenic and knockin models that use relatively high-affinity BCRs for model self-antigens. The analysis of anti&#x02013;HEL-soluble HEL double transgenic mice in a <italic>cd22</italic>-null background did not result in a break in tolerance to HEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). We expand here on a suggestion originally made by Neuberger and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) and also discussed by Cornall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) that CD22, and possibly other Siglecs, might set thresholds for the activation of B cells in the periphery. Weakly self-reactive B cells may not be activated by self-antigens because CD22 helps set an activation threshold in the periphery. If the strength of activation of B cells by self-antigens were to cross a threshold, the processing and presentation of self-antigens could be facilitated, and the unwanted entry of relatively weakly self-reactive B cells into the germinal center reaction might also occur. There are many potential ways in which, during an infection, a self-structure may be physically complexed with a foreign protein. In a viral infection, for instance, host chromatin may contain proteins of viral origin bound to host antigens including host nucleic acids. If the BCR threshold signaling is not set high enough (because of defects in CD22 or Siae for instance), self-antigens might not only activate weakly self-reactive B cells but may also deliver physically linked foreign proteins to endosomes in B cells, thus permitting the receipt of T cell help for somatic mutation. It is perhaps significant that in human autoimmune diseases in which antibodies are known to be relevant, pathogenic autoantibodies tend to be somatically mutated and class switched. Siglecs, assisted by Siae, presumably play a key role in keeping weakly self-reactive B cells quiescent. It is clear that analyses of responses to one specific T cell&#x02013;dependent synthetic immunogen are not apparently consonant with the spontaneous immunoglobulin and autoantibody levels observed in <italic>Siae</italic> mutant mice, and there is a need for more detailed immunization studies in these mutant mice and in controls.</p><p>Elucidating the full complexity of the biological functions of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acid will require the analysis of a mutant organism that lacks the sialic acid <italic>O</italic>-acetyl transferase in the Golgi complex that can transfer an acetyl moiety from acetyl CoA to the 7-OH or 9-OH position of terminal sialic acid residue on glycoconjugates. Although more than one sialic acid <italic>O</italic>-acetyl transferase may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), to date no such O-acetyl transferase has been molecularly identified. Our data indicate that modulation of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acid, a modification which was first described more than half a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), regulates inhibitory signaling in B lymphocytes and participates in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Furthermore, our ongoing unpublished studies involving deep resequencing of the <italic>SIAE</italic> gene in human controls, and patients with autoimmunity have revealed a strong association of rare loss-of-function variants of <italic>SIAE</italic> with autoimmune disease, suggesting that the regulatory function of Siae is not restricted to rodents (unpublished data).</p><p><italic>Siae</italic> was identified over a decade ago as a gene that is regulated during B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). We have now shown that this enzyme regulates the cell surface acetylation of sialic acid. It remains to be determined where exactly in B cells Siae is located and whether the expression and catalytic activity of this enzyme is regulated during antigen-mediated B cell activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>8&#x02013;12-wk-old C57BL/6 and B6.129S7-<italic>Rag1</italic> mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used in this study.
