Despite their importance, there is still little information on how their activity is regulated. Here we demonstrate that the functions of lipin 1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. The two lipins display distinct intracellular localization in HeLa M cells, with a pool of lipin 2 exhibiting a tight membrane association. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of lipin 1 leads to a dramatic decrease of the cellular PAP1 activity in HeLa M cells, whereas silencing of lipin 2 leads to an increase of lipin 1 levels and PAP1 activity. Consistent with their distinct functions in HeLa M cells, lipin 1 and 2 exhibit reciprocal patterns of protein expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lipin 2 levels increase in lipin 1-depleted 3T3-L1 cells without rescuing the adipogenic defects, whereas depletion of lipin 2 does not inhibit adipogenesis. Finally, we show that the PAP1 activity of both lipins is inhibited by phosphorylation during mitosis, leading to a decrease in the cellular PAP1 activity during cell division. We propose that distinct and non-redundant functions of lipin 1 and 2 regulate lipid production during the cell cycle and adipocyte differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>GM-28140</grant-num> (to G.

Phospholipids are also active participants of signaling cascades that control diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Two key precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis are PA<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">3</xref> and DAG, both of which have essential functions in signaling cascades, energy storage, and lipid biosynthetic pathways. Early biochemical studies identified a soluble Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PA phosphatase (PAP1) activity that is key to catalyzing PA conversion to DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). DAG has multiple functions. First, DAG is used for the synthesis of the most abundant phospholipids found in biological membranes, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Second, DAG is also used for the synthesis of the neutral lipid triacylglycerol, an essential storage form of energy and fatty acids, which accumulates as lipid droplets in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Despite the key role of the PAP1 reaction, the identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity remained unknown until recently. Han <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) have demonstrated that Pah1p/Smp2p is the PAP1 enzyme controlling biosynthetic production of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in yeast. A separate study found that Pah1p regulates transcription of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, nuclear/ER membrane biogenesis, and nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>Mammals express three Pah1p-related proteins called lipins 1, 2, and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Two closely related lipin 1 isoforms have been described, the&#x003b1; form and the&#x003b2; form, which contains a short insertion close to its N-terminal end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). All members of the Pah1p/lipin family exhibit the same primary organization; they are soluble proteins containing a very conserved N-terminal domain of &#x0223c;100 amino acid residues of unknown function and a C-terminal haloacid dehalogenase-like domain that contains the catalytic site. Recent studies have demonstrated that mammalian lipins possess PAP1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Lipin 1 was originally identified through positional cloning as the mutated gene in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). These mice are characterized by significantly reduced adipose tissue mass throughout the body, insulin resistance, and a progressive peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Consistent with its metabolic functions in adipogenesis, high levels of lipin 1 in transgenic mice promotes obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Recent studies have also implicated lipin 1 in the regulation of gene expression of hepatic lipid metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>Despite this progress, there is still relatively little information about the function of lipin 1 in cell physiology, especially outside adipocytes, and essentially no functional information about lipins 2 and 3. If lipins, like Pah1p, are responsible for the production of biosynthetic pools of phospholipids, then temporal and spatial regulation of their activity would be expected to play an important role in membrane biogenesis. Interestingly, the three lipins exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), raising the question of the functional differences of the various paralogues expressed within the same cell. We report here that the function of lipins is evolutionarily conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. We provide the first evidence that lipin 1 and 2 exhibit distinct intracellular localization in HeLa M cells and show that lipin 1 is the major PAP1 enzyme in HeLa M cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of the two lipins shows that their expression is reciprocally regulated both in HeLa M cells and differentiating adipocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that the activity and solubility of both lipins is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by mitotic phosphorylation.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Reagents, Plasmids, and Yeast Methods</italic>&#x02014;Unless otherwise stated, all of the reagents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. MGC clones (Invitrogen) containing the full-length cDNA for human lipin 1 (3906281) and mouse lipin 2 (5101211) were subcloned into high copy (YEplac181-<italic>LEU2</italic>) yeast expression vectors.

Antibodies against the glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase fusion proteins (500 &#x003bc;g of protein/injection) were raised in rabbits by three subcutaneous injections over 66 days. Affinity purification of the antibody was carried out by coupling the glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase fusion proteins to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) following the product specifications. Rabbit sera from the final bleeds were then incubated with the CNBr-activated Sepharose fusion protein complex for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C before washing with PBS.

Transfections of HeLa M cells with plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides were carried out using the standard protocols supplied with <italic>Trans</italic>IT-HeLaMONSTER transfection kit (Mirus, MIR2900) and oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, with the exception that the final concentration of siRNA oligonucleotides was reduced to 10 n<sc>m</sc> for all experiments. The siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. as SMART pool siGENOME duplexes for human lipin 1 (NM_145693) and human lipin 2 (NM_014646). The siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA#1 was used as the control for each siRNA knockdown experiment. Unless otherwise stated, HeLa M cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection. The medium was changed 24 h after transfection, and the cells were collected for analysis on day 4, 72 h post-transfection. One single siGENOME duplex was chosen to represent each SMART pool, for lipin1 siGENOME duplex number 2 (D-017427-02) was used and for lipin2 siGENOME duplex number 2 (D-013458-02). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured and differentiated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).</p><p><italic>Flow Cytometry</italic>&#x02014;HeLa M cells were collected by trypsin-EDTA release.

The cells were then fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol and stored at -20 &#x000b0;C for at least 4 h. DNA was labeled with propidium iodide (15 &#x003bc;g/ml) in the presence of RNase (0.2 mg/ml), 1.1% trisodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The samples were then passed through a 70-&#x003bc;m Nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon) into a tube prior to flow cytometric determination of DNA content using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow cytometer. Propidium iodide levels were measured by using the FLA-3 laser, and the cell cycle distributions were determined through analysis on FlowJo software.</p><p><italic>Retrovirus-mediated shRNA Knockdown</italic>&#x02014;Two independent short sequences specifically targeting lipin 1 and lipin 2 were designed and cloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ vector (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the primer pairs L101Bam/L101Eco, L103Bam/L103Eco, L209Bam/L209Eco, and L210Bam/L210Eco were annealed and ligated directly into the BamHI-EcoRI open RNAi-ready pSIREN-RetroQ vector to yield the constructs shRNA-L1A and shRNA-L1C for lipin 1 or shRNA-L2A or shRNA-L2B for lipin 2, respectively. The pSIREN-Luc vector containing shRNA targetting luciferase (Clontech) was used as a control. Retroviral packaging BOSC-HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs to generate retroviruses to infect 3T3-L1 cells. Virus collection, preparation, and infection of cells were essentially as previously described in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>.</p><p><italic>Cell Cycle Synchronization</italic>&#x02014;For the double thymidine block, HeLa M cells were arrested with 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> thymidine for 19 h and released by washing two times in medium and allowing them to rest for 9 h, followed by a second 16 h arrest with 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> thymidine. The cells were then released from the block and allowed to progress through the cell cycle. Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off every 30 min, between 8 and 11 h after release from the second cell cycle arrest. The nocodazole block was achieved through an initial cell cycle arrest with 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> thymidine for 19 h. The cells were then released from the block by washing two times in medium and allowing them to recover for 4 h. This was followed by a second 12-h arrest using 50 ng/ml of nocodazole.

Lipin 2 fully rescued the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells contain enlarged and irregularly shaped nuclei often consisting of two interconnected lobes within a single cell and also accumulate nuclear/ER membranes into the cytoplasm. These structural defects are efficiently rescued by the expression of lipin 2 in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, as judged by the reappearance of round nuclei to the same extent as in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells expressing <italic>PAH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Lipin 1 could rescue the growth defect of <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; at 30 &#x000b0;C but not at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Consistent with this, expression of lipin 1 in <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells resulted in a partial restoration of nuclear morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). To compare the expression levels of the two lipins and Pah1p in the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; cells, we expressed them as C-terminal GFP fusions. The fusion proteins maintain their function because they are still able to rescue the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; growth defect as efficiently as the untagged proteins.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">4</xref> The lipin 2-GFP is expressed in yeast at similar levels as the Pah1p-GFP fusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). Although an intact lipin1-GFP can be also detected, most of this fusion protein is broken down to a &#x0223c;70 kDa C-terminal product, predicted to contain the haloacid dehalogenase-like domain. No other major degradation products were detected in the lipin 1-GFP sample.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">4</xref> The breakdown of the lipin 1 fusion could explain why it partially rescues the <italic>pah1</italic>&#x00394; defects.</p><p>Next, we used a second assay to investigate whether lipins can function in yeast. The combined knock-out of both the nucleoporin <italic>NUP84</italic> and the phosphatase subunit <italic>SPO7</italic>, which dephosphorylates Pah1p, causes lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The synthetic lethality of the <italic>nup84</italic>&#x00394; <italic>spo7</italic>&#x00394; strain can be rescued by the overexpression of <italic>PAH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). If lipins can provide the function of Pah1p in yeast, they should also be able to rescue the synthetic lethality of the <italic>nup84</italic>&#x00394; <italic>spo7</italic>&#x00394; mutant. To test this hypothesis, we used a <italic>nup84</italic>&#x00394; <italic>spo7</italic>&#x00394; double mutant complemented with a centromeric plasmid with the <italic>URA3</italic> marker, containing the <italic>NUP84</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Because this strain cannot survive the loss of the <italic>URA3</italic>-<italic>NUP84</italic> plasmid, it will die when grown on medium containing the drug 5-fluoroorotic acid that is toxic to cells expressing the <italic>URA3</italic> gene. If a functional or partially functional <italic>PAH1</italic> allele is introduced, then cells grown under non-selective conditions can afford the loss of the <italic>URA3</italic>-<italic>NUP84</italic> plasmid and can grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. Consistent with the complementation data described above, lipin 2 expression can efficiently rescue the synthetic lethality of the <italic>nup84</italic>&#x00394; <italic>spo7</italic>&#x00394; mutant, whereas lipin 1 displays a weaker rescuing activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).

Lipin 2-HA did not show any significant co-localization with a mitochondrial or a Golgi marker (supplemental Fig. S1).

To this end we used two different siRNA oligonucleotides for each lipin that could, independently, deplete efficiently the respective proteins 72 h after their transfection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and data not shown). Notably, depletion of either lipin resulted in an increase of both the mRNA and protein levels of the other lipin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting that the knock-down cells activate a compensatory mechanism. Cell cycle analysis shows that depletion of lipin 1 for 72 h causes a 6.3% increase in the relative number of cells in G<sub>1</sub> phase, whereas depletion of lipin 2 has no effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Because both lipin 1 and 2 are expressed in HeLa M cells, we set out to compare their relative contribution in the regulation of the cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PA phosphatase activity. To do this, we silenced lipin 1, lipin 2, or both in HeLa M cells, prepared extracts 72 h after transfection of the respective siRNAs and measured the PAP1 and PAP2 activities. Importantly, lipin 1-depleted extracts show an 86% reduction in the total cellular PAP1 activity, indicating that lipin 1 is the major PAP1 enzyme in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, knock-down of lipin 2 has the opposite effect and results in a dramatic increase in the cellular PAP1 levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). This could be explained by the fact that lipin 1 levels increase significantly in the lipin 2-depleted cells, leading to an increase in the total PAP1 activity. The combined lipin 1 and 2 knock-down led to a further small but significant decrease of the PAP1 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). On the other hand, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent PA phosphatase (PAP2) activity did not change in any of the lipin-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Taken together, the complementary up-regulation of each lipin in the respective knock-down and its effect on cellular PAP1 activity strongly suggest that lipin 1 is the more active enzyme, whereas the activity of lipin 2 is more tightly regulated in HeLa M cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>PAP1 activity increases during adipogenesis.</bold> 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate for 12 days.

To address this question, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate and protein extracts were prepared at various time points afterward. As seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, lipin 2 is expressed in preadipocytes and also during the early stages of adipogenesis before its levels decrease almost to undetectable levels in mature adipocytes. Lipin 1 shows a reciprocal pattern with no detectable expression in preadipocytes and a gradual increase after 48 h of differentiation, which coincides with a decrease in lipin 2 levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Lipin 1 is expressed first as a low and subsequently as a higher molecular weight protein band on SDS-PAGE that persists in mature adipocytes, probably corresponding to the two isoforms of lipin 1 generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Interestingly, lipin 2 is also expressed as a high and low molecular weight protein band on SDS-PAGE, but in this case the higher band is due to phosphorylation as it resolves to the lower form following phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitated protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>The fact that lipin 1 is the major PAP1 enzyme in HeLa M cells suggests that the change in the ratio between the protein levels of lipin 1 and 2 during adipogenesis could contribute to the maintenance of high biosynthetic PAP1 activity required for bulk triglyceride production. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the PAP1 activity during the differentiation of 3T3 preadipocytes. Indeed, cellular PAP1 levels increase steadily 24 h after induction of differentiation and peak at the 192-h time point, overlapping significantly with the induction pattern of lipin 1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether expression of the different lipins is co-regulated during adipocyte differentiation, we silenced lipin 1 or lipin 2 by infecting 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with retroviruses carrying shRNAs specifically targeting their mRNA sequences. For each lipin, two cell lines were constructed, each expressing a different shRNA (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;), and the results described below were reproduced with both. Infection of the cells with shRNA targeting either lipin 1 or lipin 2 resulted in an efficient decrease in the levels of the respective protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Notably, in lipin 1 knock-down cells, lipin 2 protein levels significantly increased at all time points examined and persisted for longer during differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Despite the increased lipin 2 levels, depletion of lipin 1 inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes as judged by the failure to induce aP2 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) or to accumulate intracellular lipid (triacylglycerol/steryl esters), followed by Nile Red staining.<sup>4</sup> In contrast, depletion of lipin 2 did not inhibit adipogenesis. Indeed, knock-down of lipin 2 led to a more rapid and robust induction of aP2, suggesting that adipogenesis may be accelerated in these cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

As seen in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>, both lipins undergo mobility shifts that reduce their electrophoretic mobility in the nocodazole-arrested samples.

Consistent with the results obtained from the nocodazole treated cells, mitotic HeLa M cells synchronized by the double thymidine block also result in MPM2-specific phosphorylation of lipin 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that lipin 1 and 2 are mitotically phosphorylated on Cdk1 consensus sites.</p><p>Next we examined the effect of the mitotic phosphorylation on the function of lipins. We first asked whether phosphorylation could regulate the PA phosphatase activity of lipin 1 and 2. To address this, endogenous lipin 1 and 2 were immunoprecipitated from asynchronous or nocodazole-arrested HeLa M cells with or without &#x003bb;-phosphatase treatment, and the immune pellets were then assayed for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PA phosphatase activity. As seen in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>, mitotic phosphorylation of both lipin 1 and 2 decreases their PA phosphatase activity, whereas dephosphorylation stimulates it. Consistent with a role of phosphorylation in inhibiting the activities of the lipins, the total Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PAP activity (PAP1) in the extracts of nocodazole-arrested HeLa M cells decreased when compared with the activity of asynchronous cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). On the other hand, the total Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity (PAP2), which is mediated by the LPP family of phosphatases, responded in the opposite way and showed increased levels in the nocodazolederived extracts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation also regulates membrane recruitment of lipin 1 and 2 in HeLa M cells. As seen in Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2<italic>C</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7<italic>D</italic></xref>, the slow migrating forms of lipin 1 are significantly enriched in the soluble fractions of both the asynchronous and mitotic cell lysates. Similarly, in the nocodazole-treated cells, only the phosphorylated lipin 2 becomes soluble. Taken together, these data show that mitotic phosphorylation of lipin 1 and 2 is a major determinant of their function in HeLa M cells, by controlling both their PAP1 activity and membrane recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In contrast to yeasts, nematodes, and flies that express only one lipin, mammals express three lipins that display overlapping expression in many different tissues. This observation raises two interesting questions: first, whether there are functional differences between the lipins, and second, how cells coordinate the activities of different lipins during growth and development.</p><p>Our results show that there are two major differences between lipin 1 and 2 in HeLa M cells. First, the two lipins show distinct intracellular localization, with lipin 1 exhibiting a more soluble distribution and lipin 2 exhibiting a detergent- and salt-insoluble pool. In this context it is interesting to notice that although the murine lipin 1&#x003b1; is primarily intranuclear in HEK293 and 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), we found that its apparent human homologue displays a cytosolic localization in HeLa M cells. The basis for this difference is not clear. Lipin 2 displays also a distinct ER-associated pool. Because the various lipin paralogues exhibit overlapping expression in many different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), their distinct localization raises the interesting possibility of the compartmentalization of the PAP1 reaction and thus control of PA, DAG, and phospholipid homeostasis, on different organelles. Because lipins have very similar domain organization, their targeting to different intracellular compartments might be mediated by interaction with different binding partners. Second, the levels of lipin 1, but not lipin 2, correlate with the cellular PAP1 activity in HeLa M cells. Thus, siRNA-mediated depletion of lipin 1 leads to a dramatic decrease of PAP1 activity. This is consistent with the absence of PAP1 activity in tissues from the <italic>fld</italic> mouse that expresses an inactive mutant lipin 1 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). On the other hand, depletion of lipin 2 has the opposite effect and leads to an increase of both lipin 1 expression and PAP1 activity levels. Thus, lipin 1 is the major PAP1 enzyme in HeLa M cells. Higher lipin 2 protein levels in lipin 1 siRNA and shRNA experiments in HeLa M and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively, do not compensate the relevant knock-down phenotypes, indicating that the two lipins perform non-redundant functions in lipid biosynthesis.</p><p>The different functions of the two lipins could explain the temporal regulation of their expression during adipogenesis. Cellular models of adipogenesis suggest that preadipocytes first become committed to differentiation, followed by a limited proliferation and a final maturation process when they acquire their specialized adipogenic properties, including lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Lipin 1 is not expressed in the preadipocytes, which suggests that lipin 2 and possibly lipin 3 are able to provide the necessary PAP1 activity prior to differentiation. On the other hand, expression of a highly active PAP1 enzyme is needed to support bulk triglyceride production at the final stages of differentiation. Interestingly, depletion of lipin 2 correlates with an earlier appearance of both the adipogenic marker aP2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and lipid accumulation.<sup>4</sup> Thus, the levels of lipin 2 are able to indirectly influence adipogenesis. This mirrors the situation in HeLa M cells, where lipin 2 knock-down increases cellular PAP1 activity and underscores the significance of the temporal regulation of lipin 1 expression.</p><p>Another important finding of this work is that phosphorylation of lipins inhibits their PAP1 activity during mitosis. What could be the function of this inhibition? Phospholipids accumulate in the S phase, whereas their synthesis is inhibited during the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase, when cellular metabolism reaches the lowest rate in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The decrease of the PAP1 activity caused by the mitotic phosphorylation of lipin 1 and 2 could contribute to the inhibition of phospholipid accumulation prior to cell division. Interestingly, CCT1&#x003b1;, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, is also inactivated by hyperphosphorylation late in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). These data are consistent with a model where biosynthetic production of phospholipids is inhibited at multiple steps during cell division. Phospholipid biosynthesis is also developmentally regulated, and recent studies found that transcription of lipin 1 is induced in cells that undergo ER proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether dephosphorylation-dependent activation of lipins accompanies some of these transcriptional changes.</p><p>Contrary to the results presented here, a recent study found that dephosphorylation of adipocyte lipin 1 does not have any effect on its PAP1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). It is possible that the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of lipin 1 in adipocytes and in mitotic HeLa M cells are not the same. Accordingly, phosphorylation of lipin 1 at different sites could have different functional consequences in either cell line. Alternatively, these differences could be due to the different responses of the two lipin 1 isoforms to phosphorylation. Adipocytes, which were used by Harris <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) as a source of lipin 1, express mostly the longer &#x003b2; form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), whereas HeLa M cells used to immunoprecipitate lipin 1 in our assays express two forms that differ slightly in their electrophoretic mobilities (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>), presumably representing the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; forms. It is possible that dephosphorylation of only one isoform (&#x003b1;) is responsible for the increase in PAP1 activity.</p><p>Proteins that regulate the phosphorylation state of lipins are expected to influence PAP1 activity and consequently lipid and membrane biogenesis. A recent study reported that Dullard, the mammalian orthologue of the protein phosphatase Nem1p that regulates Pah1p activity and nuclear membrane growth in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), localizes to the inner side of the nuclear envelope and dephosphorylates lipin 1 in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Because Pah1p regulates nuclear membrane biogenesis in yeast, this finding raises the intriguing possibility that lipins could perform a similar function in mammalian cells. Future experiments will address these possibilities.</p><p>In summary, we provide the first evidence that the two related PA phosphatases lipin 1 and 2 display differences in their localization, expression pattern, and activity. Such a differential regulation of the PAP1 activity could explain why higher eukaryotes evolved multiple lipin paralogues. This also suggests that although lipin 1 is the major PAP1 enzyme in HeLa M cells and murine adipocytes, lipin 2 and 3 have as of yet undetermined important roles. The future determination of the specific functions of each lipin is important to understand how these enzymes control the biosynthetic production of lipids, lipid signaling, cell differentiation, and membrane growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M804278200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M804278200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Lykidis, A., and Jackowski, S.
