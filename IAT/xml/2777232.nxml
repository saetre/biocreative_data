Among these are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, with the latter giving rise to the zoonotic appearance of variant CJD (vCJD). One specific characteristic of prion diseases is that the infectious agents appear to consist exclusively of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein PrP<sup>c</sup>, termed PrP<sup>Sc</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. PrP<sup>c</sup> is a sialoglycoprotein expressed mainly in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). In a posttranslational process the mainly &#x003b1;-helical PrP<sup>c</sup> is converted into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which has a high &#x003b2;-sheet content and accumulates within brains of affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>For cellular conversion of PrP<sup>c</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> several premises need to be fulfilled. First, expression of PrP<sup>c</sup> is absolutely necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second, localization of PrP<sup>c</sup> at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and its proper conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are required. As a GPI-anchored protein, PrP<sup>c</sup> and also PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are found in lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which are membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Due to selective localization of proteins in lipid rafts and spatial proximity, rafts serve as platforms for controlled protein-protein interactions and for initiation of signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For the formation of lipid rafts, free intracellular cholesterol is necessary. The content of free cholesterol within cells is tightly regulated by endogenous synthesis, uptake via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and the level of esterification, which enables storage of cholesterol in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Within the central nervous system, neurons downregulate their endogenous cholesterol synthesis and depend mainly on cholesterol synthesized and released by astrocytes bound to lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, cholesterol is released from its transport protein in endosomes and is partially recycled to the plasma membrane, to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), or to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One protein involved in this recycling is NPC-1, a late endosomal/lysosomal transmembrane protein that harbors a putative sterol sensing domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It appears to be involved in the vesicular transport of LDL-derived cholesterol to the ER and the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Mutations in NPC-1 lead to abrogation of this pathway and to accumulation of free cholesterol and other metabolites such as glycosphingolipids in the late endocytic pathway, resulting in Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), a fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Mechanistically, NPC-1 appears to interact with cholesterol-containing vesicles to mediate their retrograde transport. Mutations within the protein appear to impair fission of NPC-1-positive vesicles from cholesterol-laden organelles leading to accumulation of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In prion-infected cells, depletion of cholesterol by inhibition of its synthesis reduces PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the neuronal cell lines GT-1 or N2a infected with RML prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This treatment has been shown to perturb lipid raft formation and can lead to a block of PrP<sup>c</sup> transport to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Extraction of membrane cholesterol by methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], filipin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], or complexation of membrane cholesterol by amphotericin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] also reduced the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> content of cultured cells. When the signal peptide for GPI anchoring of PrP<sup>c</sup> is replaced by different transmembrane domains to alter the membrane distribution of PrP<sup>c</sup> and to prevent its association with lipid rafts, these mutant PrPs were not converted into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in persistently prion-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], supporting the importance of lipid raft localization for prion conversion. In vivo, the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin prolonged incubation times of prion disease in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, this effect is probably due to neuroprotective actions of the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Amphotericin B and its less toxic derivative MS-1809 both inhibit prion disease progression although the effect depends on the prion strain used for infection, and the drugs appear to be more effective against BSE prions than scrapie prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Most of the studies performed on the relationship between cholesterol and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generation focused on the impact of an inhibited cholesterol synthesis or of alterations in plasma membrane cholesterol levels, accompanied by perturbations of lipid rafts. However, the role of cholesterol recycling in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation is only poorly understood. For example, blocking this pathway induces alterations in the subcellular distribution of lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which could affect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> biogenesis. Furthermore, cells that accumulate cholesterol, e.g., CHO cells with mutations in the NPC-1 gene or fibroblasts derived from NPC-1 patients, show defects in vesicle transport due to immobilization of rab proteins on membranes enriched in cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Thus, alterations caused by such conditions might subsequently influence PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation in persistently infected cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to elucidate whether cholesterol accumulation in the late endocytic pathway interferes with cellular prion infection. To achieve cholesterol accumulation, NPC-1 knock-down using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the compound U18666A, which is commonly used to phenocopy mutations in the NPC-1 gene and which leads to cholesterol accumulation within several hours of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], were used. Under both conditions, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation was reduced in prion-infected cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, due to increased degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Interestingly, rab 9 overexpression partially restored the negative effects of cholesterol accumulation on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation. Our data provide novel insights into the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and suggest that recycling of cholesterol and possibly also of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is necessary to sustain its persistent propagation in prion-infected neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p>Proteinase K and Pefabloc proteinase inhibitor were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, (Mannheim, Germany).

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase or other enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis or application of compounds that bind or extract free membrane-bound cholesterol such as amphotericin B can significantly reduce cellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion or even prolong incubation time of prion disease in animal models. However, the impact of cholesterol membrane distribution and trafficking has not been investigated in detail so far.</p><p>Following endocytosis of LDL-cholesterol via the LDL receptor and its dissociation from LDL, a large amount of free cholesterol is recycled back to the plasma membrane. One protein implicated in this transport is NPC-1. Therefore, one way to inhibit cholesterol transport in cultured cells is to knock-down NPC-1 expression by transfection of cells with siRNA. In line with this, we transiently transfected RML-infected N2a cells (ScN2a) with siRNA targeting NPC-1 mRNA or non-silencing (ns) siRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The efficiency of the knock-down was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay using an anti-NPC-1 antibody (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In cells transfected with ns siRNA, a strong vesicular staining was observed (left image), whereas no specific fluorescence signal was detectable in cells transfected with NPC-1 siRNA under identical immunofluorescence conditions (right image). The inset shows the image excited with higher voltage and here, in single cells, residual fluorescence signals were detectable. This proves that NPC-1 siRNA very efficiently silenced the target gene. Similar results were obtained by immunoblot assay using an anti-NPC-1 antibody (Suppl.

ScN2a cells transfected transiently with ns or NPC-1 siRNA were lysed 2&#x000a0;days post transfection. The amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> upon PK digestion detected by immunoblot was densitometrically evaluated. The value for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in ns siRNA transfected cells was set to 100%; the amount in NPC-1 siRNA transfected cells was expressed as a percentage thereof. For statistical analysis, results of four independent experiments were used. Two out of four experiments were performed in duplicate and triplicate, respectively, and of these, the average percentage of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in relation to the control (ns siRNA) was used for statistical analysis (***&#x000a0;<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.005; <italic>t</italic>-test)</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="18_2009_158_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Next, the effect of NPC-1 knock-down on cellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> content was analyzed.

To support the significance of data obtained here, the experiment was performed several times, including triplicate assay. Two days post transfection, cells were lysed, an aliquot was digested with PK, and all lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. In samples without PK digestion (lanes 1&#x02013;6) no major differences in total PrP signals were detectable. In contrast, PK-treated samples from cells transfected with ns siRNA harbored high amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (lanes 7&#x02013;9; N-terminally trimmed PrP; un-, mono-, and di-glycosylated forms), whereas in NPC-1 siRNA-transfected cells, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was not detectable under these conditions.

In addition, ScN2a cells were treated with 0 or 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml U18666A for 3 and 7&#x000a0;days. To enable comparison of signals in treated and untreated cells, for each time point one control culture was lysed in parallel.

Again, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was reduced to undetectable levels, whereas in untreated control cells, a clear PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal was visible (lanes&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;PK). The increase in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals between day 3 and day 7 in control cells is indicative for accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> during cultivation. PrP<sup>c</sup> levels were not altered by the treatment (lanes &#x02014; PK).

Subsequently, brain homogenates from terminally sick mice infected with RML or 22L prions were added for 24&#x000a0;h.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c shows a representative immunoblot of several independent experiments. At 0&#x000a0;min, almost all PrP<sup>c</sup> could be released by trypsin indicating that the majority of PrP<sup>c</sup> was located at the cell surface and only small amounts were already internalized (lanes 2 and 4). After 60&#x000a0;min, in control cells slightly less PrP<sup>c</sup> than in U18666A-treated cells was accessible for trypsin, indicating that more PrP<sup>c</sup> was internalized without treatment (lane 6 vs. lane 8). Densitometric analysis revealed that in control cells ~55% of total PrP<sup>c</sup> was internalized, whereas in U18666A-treated cells only ~35% was found within the cells.

Since cholesterol accumulation upon NPC-1 knock-down or U18666A treatment occurs in late endosomes/lysosomes, cell biological effects induced by the treatments are likely exerted in the late endocytic pathway.</p><p>Consequently, we analyzed whether&#x02014;under combined bafilomycin A (Baf A) and U18666A treatment&#x02014;PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be detected in ScN2a cells. Bafilomycin A prevents protein transport from early to late endosomes by inhibiting acidification and maturation of those vesicles. Thereby, the degradation of proteins is prevented. The combined treatment might give hints to whether U18666A prevents synthesis of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> or rather induces its degradation. ScN2a cells were treated for 24&#x000a0;h with U18666A or left untreated. Then cells were lysed and lysates were digested with PK. In parallel, in ScN2a cultures, U18666A treatment was continued for 2&#x000a0;days, either in combination with Baf A or not. Untreated cells and cells treated only with Baf A served as controls. PK-treated lysates were analyzed in immunoblot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> upper panel; duplicate assay). After 24&#x000a0;h (lanes 1&#x02013;4), PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was detectable in controls but not in U18666A-treated cells. These PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals served as baseline levels for comparison with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal intensities after continued cultivation either without treatment (lanes 5 and 6), with U18666A (lanes 7 an 8) or Baf A (lanes 9 and 10) alone, or with a combination of U18666A and Baf A (lanes 11 and 12). Upon continued culture (day 3), in control cells without treatment a strong PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal was visible which was clearly higher than that at day 1 (lanes 5 and 6 vs. lanes 1 and 2). As expected, in U18666A treated cells (lanes 7 and 8) the signal again was lower than in untreated cells. However, Baf A treatment led to a strong increase of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals in both controls (lanes 9 and 10) and U18666A-treated (lanes 11 and 12) cells due to impaired degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> between day 1 and day 3. This indicates that despite cholesterol accumulation in endosomal vesicles, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be formed. In case the Baf A treatment were to only inhibit degradation of pre-existing PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the signal after 3&#x000a0;days would not exceed the initial signal after 1&#x000a0;day treatment (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 11 and 12). Analysis of corresponding samples without PK digestion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> lower panel) with anti-&#x003b2;-actin and anti-PrP antibodies served as control for comparable loading at the different time points. The increase in PrP<sup>c</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals between day 1 and day 3 is due to higher cell numbers and accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> which is newly formed between day 1 and day 3. A further hint for ongoing generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in U18666A-treated cells was provided by metabolic labeling of ScN2a cells followed by immunoprecipitation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (data not shown).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>U18666A treatment increases PrP<sup>Sc</sup> degradation. <italic>Upper panel</italic> ScN2a cells were treated for 1&#x000a0;day with U18666A (3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) or were left untreated.

Two proteins implicated in cholesterol recycling are NPC-1 and NPC-2. Loss-of-function mutations&#x02014;mainly in the NPC-1, but also in the NPC-2 gene&#x02014;are associated with Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In ScN2a cells we found that knock-down of NPC-1 led to a drastic loss of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Similar effects, also in 22L prion-infected N2a cells (data not shown), ScGT-1, and ScSN56 cells were obtained by treatment with the compound U18666A. This is in agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], however, the drug appears not to be effective in a mouse model of prion disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In both studies, significantly lower concentrations of the drug were used to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> value over 4&#x000a0;days of treatment, a factor which is critical if a drug will be applied in bioassays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In contrast, our main intention was to induce cholesterol accumulation within a short time frame (16&#x000a0;h to 2&#x000a0;days). Therefore, we applied higher concentrations of the drug as described in previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] which were not toxic to the cells under our experimental conditions to achieve the NPC phenotype. However, U18666A treatment, which phenocopies NPC, does not exclusively inhibit cholesterol recycling within the cell but also to some extent the endogenous cholesterol synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In contrast to the above mentioned studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], our data obtained with siRNA targeting NPC-1 mRNA clearly demonstrate that indeed cholesterol accumulation can cause reduction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in ScN2a cells. Interestingly, primary infection of N2a cells with RML or 22L prions was not inhibited by U18666A. This indicates that initial conversion of PrP<sup>c</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> might occur even under conditions of cholesterol accumulation. However, this initial conversion rate appeared to be insufficient for establishing persistent prion infection when U18666A treatment was continued after removal of brain homogenates (data not shown).</p><p>Our results on PrP<sup>c</sup> localization and trafficking support the assumption that formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can occur during U18666A treatment. PrP<sup>c</sup> is located at the cell surface, which is one prerequisite for conversion into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and its recycling is at least not statistically significantly altered. PrP<sup>c</sup> is still found in lipid rafts, in contrast to what has been suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The finding that lipid raft formation is not perturbed by U18666A treatment is supported by studies demonstrating that lipid rafts are stabilized in late endosomes in U18666A-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or even accumulate in cells expressing mutated NPC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is interesting to note that a shift of the raft marker protein caveolin-1 towards lighter fractions of a flotation gradient, which we observed for GM-1 and PrP<sup>c</sup> in U18666A-treated cells, was induced by infection of a fibroblast cell line with a murine parvovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These alterations led to an increased uptake of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> compared to controls without changing its subcellular distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The observation that trafficking of exogenously added PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not altered under such conditions supports the plausibility of our finding that despite slight alterations of lipid rafts induced by U18666A treatment, primary infections of N2a cells can be established.</p><p>Compounds targeting cholesterol homeostasis previously found to be active against PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation in cell culture mainly affected the pool of plasma membrane cholesterol and/or lipid raft formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In contrast, by inducing a NPC phenotype in cultured cells, alterations are expected to occur mainly in late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. That perturbations of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation are indeed occurring in the late endosomal/lysosomal system is shown by our experiments with co-treatment of cells with U18666A and bafilomycin A. Bafilomycin A inhibits protein degradation, since early to late endosome maturation is impaired due to perturbation of endosomal acidification. However, recycling of early endosomes and their cargo proteins to the plasma membrane is still possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Upon combined treatment with U18666A and Baf A, which inhibits lysosomal degradation, between day 1 and 3 PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a; lanes 3 and 4 vs. lanes 11 and 12). This demonstrates that, in principle, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be generated during U18666A treatment, but that increased degradation inhibits its accumulation. This is feasible since RML PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in infected cells might propagate in early endosomes or at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], both pathways that are not impaired by Baf A. To elucidate whether recycling from early endosomes to the plasma membrane is important for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation requires further experiments and is beyond the scope of this study. However, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation is increased in RML-infected N2a cells overexpressing a transdominant negative rab4 mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]; therefore this pathway seems to be dispensable for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that upon U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is accelerated. Indeed, the drug can stimulate cellular autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], a pathway that contributes to the degradation of misfolded protein, e.g., of huntingtin aggregates associated with Huntington&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Interestingly, two novel studies demonstrate that induction of autophagy can stimulate the degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in prion-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In NPC&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice levels and activity of cathepsin D and B are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates in late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], where it can be degraded, although it has a rather long half-life of more than 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In particular, lysosomal cystein proteases such as cathepsin B and L are capable of degrading PrP<sup>Sc</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and induction of their activity by inducing a NPC phenotype could also account for improved degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p><p>Impairment of cholesterol transport by NPC-1 knock-down is accompanied by disturbances in vesicle trafficking due to immobilization of rab GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], which regulate vesicle trafficking and docking to their specific target organelle membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In NPC&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts or U18666A-treated cells accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes can be alleviated by overexpression of rab 9, which increases delivery of cholesterol-laden vesicles and their cargo to the Golgi/TGN and thereby induces redistribution of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In ScN2a cells treated with U18666A, we observed that rab 9 overexpression partially rescued PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation. This indicates that cholesterol and/or vesicle recycling to the TGN is necessary for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation. Furthermore, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> located within late endosomes might be transported via rab 9-positive vesicles to the Golgi/TGN. Thereby, a certain escape from degradation could be achieved, explaining the partial rescue of the negative U18666A effects. Surprisingly, we found that rab 9 overexpression alone significantly impaired PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation. This apparently contradictory finding might be comparable to the relation between amyloid &#x003b2;-peptide (A&#x003b2;) production and expression levels of the sorting protein-related receptor sorLA. Upon overexpression of this protein, redistribution of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the Golgi complex is induced, thereby protecting APP from processing to A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. For PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, a similar balance between new formation and residence time in certain compartments might exist that could explain, on the one hand, the positive effects in U18666A-treated cells, and, on the other hand, the negative effects of rab 9 overexpression in untreated cells on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation.</p><p>Altogether, our study demonstrates that accumulation of cholesterol in the late endocytic pathway is deleterious for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation in cultured cells. Rather than perturbation of lipid raft association, we suggest that an increased degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is responsible for this effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1e24720N0x2dba1d0" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. </p><media xlink:href="18_2009_158_MOESM1_ESM.tif" id="MOESM1" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p><bold>Fig. 1.</bold> Transient reduction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> upon NPC-1 knock-down.
