In the light of a recent report that mutations in the BMP-13 gene are associated with spine vertebral fusion in Klippel-Feil syndrome, we hypothesized that BMP-13 signaling is crucial for regulating embryonic endochondral ossification. In this study, we found that BMP-13 inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) in vitro. The endogenous BMP-13 gene expression in MSCs was examined under expansion conditions. The MSCs were then induced to differentiate into osteoblasts in osteo-inductive medium containing exogenous BMP-13. Gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and activity, proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and matrix mineralization were assessed by cytological staining or ALP assay. Results showed that endogenous BMP-13 mRNA expression was higher than BMP-2 or -7 during MSC growth. BMP-13 supplementation strongly inhibited matrix mineralization and ALP activity of osteogenic differentiated MSCs, yet increased PG synthesis under the same conditions. In conclusion, BMP-13 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, implying that functional mutations or deficiency of BMP-13 may allow excess bone formation. Our finding provides an insight into the molecular mechanisms and the therapeutic potential of BMP-13 in restricting pathological bone formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BMP-13</kwd><kwd>GDF6</kwd><kwd>CDMP-2</kwd><kwd>osteogenic differentiation</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stromal cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="Section1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily, which includes the families of TGF-&#x003b2;s, BMPs, activins and inhibins. BMPs were originally identified because of their ability to induce endochondral bone formation and are important regulators of key events in the process of bone formation during embryogenesis, postnatal growth, remodelling and regeneration of the skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. Recombinant human BMP-2 and BMP-7 are used clinically to augment bone formation in spinal fusion and many other applications in which bone induction is desired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.</p><p>BMP-13, also known as growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6) and cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-2 (CDMP-2), was first identified and isolated as a component of bovine cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. Expression of BMP-13 has since been detected in a variety of mesenchymal derivatives such as tendon and cartilage, but its biological function is poorly defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. The majority of studies focus on connective tissue healing where de-novo implantation of BMP-13 induces neo-tendon/ligament formation in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, and the expression of chondrocyte markers such as proteoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. Comparisons with other BMPs known for their ability to stimulate bone growth have suggested that BMP-13 is not strongly osteo-inductive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Indeed, BMP-13 expression was absent from osteoblasts or newly formed osteocytes, rather BMP-13 was strongly detected in chondrocytes in a human osteophyte (bone spur) study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. In vivo, mutational inactivation of the BMP-13 gene is associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS), characterised by congenital fusion of the cervical spine vertebrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, and caused defects in joint, ligament, and cartilage formation in a transgenic mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>.</p><p>The function of BMPs in bone remodelling and fracture repair is associated with the recruitment of stem cells from surrounding tissues and with effects on the osteogenic lineage commitment of these cells. Bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types including osteoblasts and chondrocytes, which makes them an attractive cell source for tissue repair. We need to understand the complex differentiation pathways driven by multiple growth factors in order to select appropriate growth factors for clinical use.</p><p>Given the phenotypic effects of joint fusions and joint aberrations caused by BMP-13 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, we hypothesized that BMP-13 plays an important regulatory role in the balance between osteogenesis and chondrogenesis during early embryonic development. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of BMP-13 in determining the lineage fate of BM MSCs. BMP-13 was found to inhibit osteogenic differentiation, demonstrated by the deceleration of calcium mineralisation of the extracellular matrix and reduced alkaline phosphatase induction in BM MSCs. BMP-7, known to be a potent osteo-inductive agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, was used as a positive control throughout the study. Our data suggest a potential role of BMP-13 in directing stem cell fates in the development of structural tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="Section2"><title>2.

The endogenous expression of BMP-13 was detected at all time points, showing considerably higher levels than either BMP-2 or BMP-7. Expression increased over time, peaking at day 5-7. Whilst literature reports indicate BMP-13 expression in a variety of tissues localised to sites of cell proliferation or tissue re-modelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, BMP-13 expression in BM MSCs has only previously been reported in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Our finding suggests an important regulatory role of BMP-13 in BM MSCs which might be different from the other more osteogenic BMPs.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-13 inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BM MSCs</title><p>Cytological staining with Fast blue and Alizarin red S showed that BM MSCs cultured in osteo-inductive medium for 14-21 days were differentiated into osteoblasts, with elevated expression of cell surface alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium mineralisation of the extracellular matrix compared to MSCs grown under expansion conditions where staining was negligible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Addition of BMP-13 at 100, 300 and 500 ng/ml in osteo-inductive medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in detectable ALP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). A parallel dose dependent inhibition of calcium mineralisation, a later marker of osteogenic differentiation, was observed using Alizarin red S staining over both 14 and 21 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and C). In contrast, 100 ng/ml of BMP-7 dramatically increased both ALP expression and matrix mineralization in osteo-differentiated MSCs at day 14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) and day 21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C), which represents an enhancement or acceleration of osteogenic differentiation under these conditions. Whilst not shown here, BMP-7 enhancement of osteogenic differentiation is also dose-dependent (data not shown; Shen et al 2008, manuscript in preparation). The effect of BMP-13 on ALP in MSCs was further illustrated in measurements of ALP activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). BMP-13 dose dependently inhibited ALP activity to a maximum of 40%, confirming the results obtained from Fast blue staining (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the presence of BMP-13 in osteo-inductive media can, despite an environment promoting osteogenic differentiation, prevent MSCs from differentiating into a mature osteogenic phenotype. This represents a dramatically different role for BMP-13 to the better characterised BMP-2 and BMP-7. BMP-13 was shown to enhance BMP-7 promoted ALP expression in mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, but BMP-13 stimulation of ALP activity was generally at negligible to low levels in mouse BM MSCs or cell lines cultured in basal growth media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Unlike previous studies, we have utilised primary human BM MSCs and the effect of BMP-13 was examined during the osteogenic differentiation of BM MSCs. Such a model system has not been previously studied and may provide deeper insights into BMP-13 function. Actually, recent reports have suggested that BMP-13 was capable of inducing the chondrogenic differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stromal or progenitor cells, based on increased chondrocytic marker expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Instead of promoting bone formation, BMP-13 is more likely to be a potential factor for maintaining cartilage development. Thus, whilst previous reports have suggested BMP-13 is not a potent osteogenic differentiation inducer (9, 10), our data goes one step further in showing that BMP-13 can inhibit osteoblast formation. This implies that functional mutations or deficiency of BMP-13 may result in excessive endochondral ossification, disturbing the development of skeletal tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>The regulatory role of BMP-13 in osteogenic gene expression of BM MSCs</title><p>In order to evaluate more specifically the potential mechanism of BMP-13 in the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of BM MSCs, we performed gene expression analysis of markers for osteogenesis using real-time PCR assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Osteogenic medium alone induced the up-regulation of specific lineage marker expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> such as alkaline phosphatase (<italic>ALPL</italic>), bone gamma-carboxyglutamate (gla) protein (<italic>BGLAP</italic>), runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>RUNX2</italic>), and <italic>TAZ</italic> (WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1, <italic>WWTR1)</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The addition of BMP-13 inhibited <italic>ALPL</italic> mRNA expression, consistent with the ALP protein staining data discussed above. BMP-13 had no effect on the expression of crucial osteogenic transcription factor, osterix (<italic>SP7</italic>), whereas BMP-7 dramatically increased its expression by 1300-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). BMP-13 also showed considerably less induction of osteogenic markers, type I collagen (<italic>COL1A1</italic>), osteopontin (secreted phosphoprotein 1, <italic>SPP1</italic>) and <italic>RUNX2 </italic>compared to BMP-7 in the same experiment. BMP-13 somewhat surprisingly mediated up-regulation of <italic>SPP1</italic> mRNA, although once again this was also to a much lower level than stimulated by BMP-7, where <italic>SPP1</italic> was dramatically up-regulated. BMP-7 also induced up-regulation of BMP-2 expression, suggesting a potential mechanism for BMP-7 action via augmentation of BMP-2. BMP-13 gene expression was similar whether BM MSCs were cultured in growth medium or osteo-inductive medium. BMP-13 supplementation appeared to up-regulate its own gene expression under the osteogenic conditions. Additionally, the gene expression of noggin (<italic>NOG</italic>), a BMP antagonist, seems less responsive to BMP-13 than to BMP-7 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the gene expression analysis showed that BMP-13 down-regulated or failed to up-regulate crucial osteogenic marker gene expression, when compared to the gene expression pattern obtained with BMP-7 stimulation. BMP-13 was substantially less inductive of osteogenic marker genes, and the resulting phenotypic effect detected in cytological staining experiments suggests that such level of gene expression did not enhance the osteogenic differentiation process.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP-13 promotes proteoglycan synthesis of BM MSCs</title><p>Proteoglycan (PG) synthesis or accumulation in the extracellular matrix has been used as a marker of chondrogenesis of BM MSCs and BMP-13 has been shown to stimulate PG production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. In this study, we evaluated PG levels in the osteogenic differentiation of BM MSCs supplemented with BMP-13 using Alcian blue staining. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the presence of BMP-13 resulted in increased PG deposition or accumulation in the extracellular matrix of not only undifferentiated MSCs in growth medium, but even differentiated MSCs under specific osteo-inductive conditions.</p><p>The data presented here suggest that in the presence of BMP-13, osteo-inductive signaling is inhibited or retarded, whilst expression of more chondrogenic gene products is promoted. By inference, the absence of BMP-13 signaling at crucial stages of differentiation could be expected to cause an over-induction of osteogenic cell phenotypes, contributing to abnormal endochondral ossification of cartilaginous tissue. Strong expression of BMP-13 in the BM MSC population may play an important role in keeping osteogenic differentiation in check. Several studies have shown that BMP-13 is capable of inducing chondrogenic phenotypes, characterised by increased proteoglycan production in human foetal chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> and a mouse chondrocytic cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. BMP-13 is known to be expressed in the joints of mice in a particular striped pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> and mutations in BMP-13 gene are implicated in sporadic and familial cases of KFS, characterised by the spinal vertebral fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that BMP-13 potentially plays a crucial role in the delineation of BM MSC differentiation by inhibiting osteogenic lineage development, suggesting that functional mutations or deficiency of BMP-13 may result in excessive endochondral ossification. Our finding provides a clue into the possible molecular mechanisms of BMP-13 associated diseases and the therapeutic potential of BMP-13 in restricting pathological bone formation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Allen Turnbull for enabling his patients undergoing hip surgery to donate tissues.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Urist</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone: formation by autoinduction</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1965</year><volume>150</volume><fpage>893</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5319761</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Cordes</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hewick</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kriz</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Luxenberg</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Sibley BS &#x00026; Wozney</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Purification and characterization of other distinct bone-inducing factors</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</source><year>1988</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>9484</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3200834</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sampath TK &#x00026; Reddi</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dissociative extraction and reconstitution of extracellular matrix components involved in local bone differentiation</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</source><year>1981</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>7599</fpage><lpage>603</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6950401</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wozney</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Overview of bone morphogenetic proteins</article-title><source>Spine</source><year>2002</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>S2</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12205411</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoang</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Vukicevic</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Luyten</surname><given-names>FP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryba</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kozak</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Reddi AH &#x00026; Moos</surname><given-names>MJr</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins.
