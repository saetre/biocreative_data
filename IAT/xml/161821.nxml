Besides ovaries, LHR immunoreactivity (LHRI) was also found in other tissues, such as the brain, fallopian tube, endometrium, trophoblast and resident tissue macrophages. The 3B5 mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against purified rat LHR. In rat, porcine and human ovaries, the 3B5 identified six distinct LHR bands migrating at ~92, 80, 68, 59, 52 and 48 kDa. Characteristic LHRI was detected in rat, human and porcine corpora lutea. During cellular differentiation, subcellular LHR distribution changed from none to granular cytoplasmic, perinuclear, surface, nuclear and no staining. There were also differences in vascular LHR expression &#x02013; lack of LHRI in ovarian vessels and strong staining of vessels in other tissues investigated. In normal human term placentae, villous LHRI was associated with blood sinusoids and cytotrophoblast cells, and rarely detected in trophoblastic syncytium. In all abnormal placentae, the LHRI of sinusoids was absent, and syncytium showed either enhanced (immature placental phenotypes) or no LHRI (aged placental phenotype). LHRI in human brain was identified in microglial cells (CD68+ resident macrophages). Protein extracts from human vaginal wall and levator ani muscle and fascia showed strong ~92 and 68 kDa species, and LHRI was detected in smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, resident macrophages and nuclei of skeletal muscle fibers. Our observations indicate that, in contrast to the theory on the role of vascular hormone receptors in preferential pick up of circulating hormones, there is no need to enhance selective pick up rather only prevent LH/CG transport to inappropriate sites. Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the development of abnormal pregnancy. Expression of LHR in the pelvic floor compartments suggests that high LH levels in postmenopausal women may contribute to the pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders. Since chorionic gonadotropin increases secretion of a variety of cytokines by monocytes, and induces their inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity, high LH levels in aging individuals may also activate microglia (mononuclear phagocyte system in the central nervous system) and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) plays a fundamental role in ovarian responsiveness to pituitary LH. The LHR consists of a 335 residue extracellular domain which contains six N-linked glycosylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Posttranslational changes in glycosylation and phosphorylation result in several LHR variants migrating between ~93 and 44 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Lower molecular weight forms (48 and 44 kDa species) appear to represent a glycosylated extracellular domain expressed in mammalian cells (truncated receptor) and retain hormone binding specificity. They are not secreted from cells, but remain trapped intracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to various glycosylated LHR variants, western blotting also yielded a 170 kDa band representing an LHR dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. LH binds to LHR variants with different affinities, and highest affinity appears to be associated with the fully glycosylated receptor (~90 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Chorionic gonadotropin (CG), which is important for corpus luteum (CL) rescue and maintenance of pregnancy, also binds to LHR, although with a 10-fold lower binding affinity compared with that of LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The mouse anti-rat LHR monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone 3B5, was developed against purified rat LHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The antibody showed immunoreactivity with rat granulosa cells of mature (preovulatory) follicles, ovarian thecal and interstitial cells, granulosa-lutein cells of developing, mature and regressing CL, and with testicular Leydig cells, and no reactivity with rat kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. During the last ten years, affinity purified 3B5 antibody has been used in several immunohistochemical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To our knowledge, however, no analysis of the 3B5 antibody by western blot has been reported.</p><p>In porcine ovaries, LHR expression was detected in granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles, but not in granulosa lutein cells of the mature CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In human ovaries, LHR expression was also detected in granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles, but mature CL showed strong expression in luteal cells, which disappeared during luteal regression. CL from early human pregnancies showed various intensities of LHR expression (from weak to intense) on the surface and in the cytoplasmic regions of luteal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>LHR expression was also detected in nonpregnant human uterus (glandular and luminal epithelial cells, stromal cells, myometrial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells), syncytiotrophoblast of midterm but not term human placenta, fetal membranes and decidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], human and rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], rat prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], human trophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast from early pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], porcine fallopian tubes and umbilical cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], ovarian, decidual, endometrial and luteal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and ovarian cancer cell cultures and tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Beside its involvement in the regulation of ovarian function, the LHR appears to be involved in some additional effects. LHR immunoreactivity in porcine fallopian tubes was confined to the epithelium and smooth muscle cells, and in vitro LH treatment caused relaxation of the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Also, LHR stimulation plays a role in the induction and maintenance of myometrial quiescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Since smooth muscles belong among important compartments of the pelvic floor, high LH levels after menopause might be involved in the increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders, a common condition in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since the brain was reported to express functional LHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], there is also a possibility that high LH levels in aging individuals may in some way participate in the development and progression of neurodegenerative process of several degenerative neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate subcellular LHR distribution and determine LHR protein variants identified by 3B5 mAb in various rat, human and porcine tissues. During cellular differentiation, a transition from cytoplasmic to perinuclear, surface, nuclear and no LHR immunoreactivity was detected. In protein extracts from rat, porcine and human ovaries six distinct LHR bands were observed, migrating between ~92 and 48 kDa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Rats</title><p>Rats of the CII-ZV strain, born and maintained in the Laboratory of Biology of Reproduction, Zaragoza, Mexico, were maintained on a 14L-10D cycle (lights on 0500&#x02013;1900 h).

The molds with specimens were frozen by floating on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. Frozen tissues were sliced into 7 &#x003bc;m serial sections using a cryostat microtome with specimen retraction during return travel (Carl Zeiss Microm HM 505 E; MICROM Laborger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Waldorf, Germany) and ten to twelve distinct tissue sections were placed on each slide. The slides were dried ~2 h at room temperature, fixed 5 min in acetone, dried 30 min, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until immunoperoxidase staining was performed. Prior to staining, to prevent water condensation, the slides were transferred at -80&#x000b0;C into pre-chilled air protected boxes containing Drierite granules (W.A.

Regression of luteal tissue (CL investigated during the follicular phase) showed residual staining of theca-lutein cells and no staining of regressing granulosa lutein cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> vs. ctr).</p><p>In CL of pregnancy (CLP; 3 months), less or more distinct granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity (arrowhead, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> vs. ctr) and no surface staining was detected.

In western blots, the 3B5 antibody identifies six distinct bands migrating between ~92 and 48 kDa, and this reactivity with protein extracts from all three species diminishes when the antibody is preabsorbed with porcine ovaries. We also show changes in subcellular LHR distribution during differentiation of various cell types. To our knowledge, LHR expression in fibroblasts, striated muscle cells, and microglial cells (CD68+ resident macrophages) in the central nervous system is presented for the first time. We also report tissue differences in vascular LHR expression.</p><p>During cellular differentiation, subcellular LHR distribution changed from granular cytoplasmic to perinuclear, surface and nuclear staining; virtually no staining was detected in stem cells and most differentiated and aged cells. Yet, cell surface staining was observed only on classic LH/CG targets, granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles and mature luteal cells, but also in the vaginal epithelium. This indicates that these cells are prepared for the selective accumulation of LH/CG signals from the circulation.</p><p>There was also a striking difference in vascular LHR expression between ovaries and other tissues. In ovarian (and also striated muscle) vessels the LHR expression was virtually absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>), while other tissues investigated, including uterus, brain, skin and vagina, showed distinct vascular LHR immunoreactivity. We also reported previously that in the rat the endothelial LHR expression is absent in testicular vessels, and vessels in other tissues involved in LH/CG transport into (pituitary) and from the blood (kidney) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Saturation of LHR in ovarian targets may be dependent on the precise delivery of small amounts of circulating LH/CG from the blood into the extravascular space. A receptor mediated endothelial transport of hCG has been suggested to represent a model for general involvement of specific receptors in transport of other plasma proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Yet, application of this theory on our data will indicate that the LH/CG will be delivered to the uterus, brain, skin and vagina rather than to the ovary. Hence, the opposite mechanism should be considered &#x02013; endothelial LHR expression may suppress the transport of LH/CG from vessels to the extravascular space. The LH/CG molecule is smaller than that of albumin or IgG, i.e., proteins exhibiting ubiquitous distribution, so there is no need to enhance rather only prevent LH/CG transport to inappropriate sites. Binding of LH/CG to endothelial cells expressing LHR may prevent LH/CG transport from circulation by electrostatic forces, and the lack of endothelial LHR expression may be associated with LH/CG transport mediated by a general mechanism involved in protein exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>We report that normal term placentae show virtually no LHR expression in trophoblastic syncytium while syncytium of some abnormal placentae (immature phenotypes) exhibits LHR immunoreactivity. This resembles high LHR expression in first trimester placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which is a source of high hCG levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Yet, hCG levels fall during the second trimester, and elevated maternal midtrimester hCG is associated with higher rates of maternal and neonatal complications (pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and perinatal death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p><p>Hence, some abnormal term placentae appear to preserve syncytium in a younger state, accompanied by high secretion of hCG.

If the vascular LHR expression represents a barrier for hCG transport from chorionic villi to the fetal blood (see above), lack of this barrier may cause high levels of fetal hCG resulting in perinatal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], regardless of normal or abnormal hCG production.</p><p>Western blot analysis of placental villi and trophoblast cultures indicates that cultured trophoblast cells show additional bands, including ~170 kDa species, possibly an LHR homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although the ~170 kDa species persisted in late cultures, other (additional) LHR variants diminished. This suggests an activation of isolated trophoblast cells and enhanced LHR synthesis with formation of additional glycosylated LHR variants, particularly in time 0 and early cultures. When compared to chorionic villi, trophoblast cultures showed stronger ~59 and 48 kDa species, characteristic for cultured fibroblasts. Indeed, it has been reported, that differentiation of cultured trophoblast is associated with activation of accompanying fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>Early differentiation of granulosa, luteal, and other cell types expressing LHR was associated with cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity, reflecting receptor synthesis prior its surface expression. In addition, the CL of pregnancy, the function of which is highly dependent on CG, also showed cytoplasmic expression. Hence, it is possible that high levels of circulating LH/CG, e.g., during pregnancy and after menopause, may influence not only cells with surface LH expression, but also cells with cytoplasmic, and perhaps exclusively nuclear LHR expression (pelvic floor compartments, including striated muscle). In other words, cells lacking surface LHR may not be influenced by temporary increase of LH production during the preovulatory period of the ovarian cycle due to the "cell membrane LHR barrier," and the LH effect is probably also prevented by the "vascular LHR barrier." Yet, high CG levels during pregnancy may pass the "cell membrane barrier" and act through the cytoplasmic LHR in the CL of pregnancy and other cells with cytoplasmic expression, and such effect could be enhanced if the "vascular LHR barrier" is absent &#x02013; abnormal placentae of aged phenotype and similar putative age-related vascular changes in other tissues.</p><p>But the LH/CG action through the cytoplasmic/perinuclear and nuclear LHRs opens a possibility of more direct LH/CG action within the cells, which may not require a classic second messenger pathway (cyclic AMP dependent signaling mechanism) involvement, or this system can act through the intracellular LHRs. Evidence is accumulating that a number of other factors modulate the actions of gonadotropins in the ovary and testis via activation of alternative signaling pathways and via LHR protein variants, and alternative second messenger pathways for the transmission of the LHR activation effect exist, which may not include stimulation of cyclic AMP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. A question also arises if the nuclear LHR expression in terminally differentiated cells (e.g., striated muscle fibers) may not indicate a possibility of the direct effect of LH/CG on modulation of protein synthesis, reflecting certain effects of sex steroids on their nuclear receptors.</p><p>LH/CG causes a relaxation of smooth muscle cells, which express LHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The data presented also indicate that additional principal cell types in the pelvic floor show LHR expression, including stromal and fascial fibroblasts and striated muscle cells. This is associated with relatively high expression of LHR protein in western blots, and a fully glycosylated ~92 kDa species in particular. Interestingly, strong ~59 and 48 kDa proteins expressed in cultured fibroblasts were not detected in pelvic floor lysates, but a distinct ~68 kDa band from mesenchymal cells was apparent. We speculate that a ~92 kDa species in the pelvic floor is a result of interaction of resident macrophages with pelvic floor fibroblasts.</p><p>The hCG secreted by trophoblastic syncytium during pregnancy may play an important role in the physiologic adaptation of the body, and preparation of the pelvic floor for labor in particular. However, when compared to hCG, LH has a 10-fold higher LHR binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Consequently, high LH levels after menopause may cause pathologic relaxation of the pelvic floor resulting in pelvic floor disorders.</p><p>Strong LHR expression in microglial cells in the brain cortex is of particular interest. Microglial cells are resident macrophages in the central nervous system, and LHR expression has been described in other types of human resident macrophages (ovary, decidua, endometrium and corpora lutea) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Pathological activation of microglia has been reported in a wide range of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia, prion diseases, multiple sclerosis, AIDS dementia, and other degenerative neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Some of these degenerative diseases are associated with advanced age and high levels of circulating LH. High LH levels might pass the presumptive LH barrier of brain vessels expressing LHR, or vascular LHR expression might diminish with age, as in abnormal term placentae. Yet, elevated maternal mid-trimester chorionic gonadotropin is associated with fetal cerebral blood flow redistribution and adverse perinatal outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In addition, estrogens, which are known to cause a diminution of high LH levels in postmenopausal women, have been reported to be effective in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Microglia belong among cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Since CG increases secretion of a variety of cytokines by monocytes, and induces their inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], high LH levels in aging individuals may also activate resident macrophages in the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Outside of the area occupied by microglial cells in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, weaker LHR expression was also detected in some nerve cells. This suggests that such nerve cells could be directly influenced by LH/CG proteohormones (with unknown consequences), while the nerve cells among microglial branching processes are protected from such an effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our observations concur with and expand current knowledge on LHR expression in gonadal and nongonadal tissues reported by other investigators. We show that the 3B5 antibody identifies six distinct LHR protein variants in three different mammalian species. Subcellular LHR localization varies during cellular differentiation. In contrast to the theory on the role of vascular hormone receptors in preferential pick up of circulating hormones, there may be no need to enhance selective pick up rather only prevent LH/CG transport to inappropriate sites. Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the development of abnormal pregnancy and fetal outcome, and expression of LHR in the pelvic floor compartments suggests that high LH levels in postmenopausal women may contribute to pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders. High LH levels in aging individuals may also participate in the development of inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Supported by Physician's Medical Education and Research Foundation grants No. 93051 and 93066, Knoxville, Tennessee, to A.B.
