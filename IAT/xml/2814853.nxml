Within these structures, each epithelial cell bears a single motile cilium, and the concerted beating of these cilia produces a leftward fluid flow that is required to initiate left-right asymmetric gene expression. The leftward fluid flow is thought to result from the posterior tilt of the cilia, which protrude from near the posterior portion of each cell's apical surface. The cells, therefore, display a morphological planar polarization. Planar cell polarity (PCP) is manifested as the coordinated, polarized orientation of cells within epithelial sheets, or as directional cell migration and intercalation during convergent extension. A set of evolutionarily conserved proteins regulates PCP. Here, we provide evidence that vertebrate PCP proteins regulate planar polarity in the mouse ventral node and in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrocoel roof plate. Asymmetric anterior localization of VANGL1 and PRICKLE2 (PK2) in mouse ventral node cells indicates that these cells are planar polarized by a conserved molecular mechanism. A weakly penetrant <italic>Vangl1</italic> mutant phenotype suggests that compromised <italic>Vangl1</italic> function may be associated with left-right laterality defects. Stronger functional evidence comes from the <italic>Xenopus</italic> GRP, where we show that perturbation of VANGL2 protein function disrupts the posterior localization of motile cilia that is required for leftward fluid flow, and causes aberrant expression of the left side-specific gene <italic>Nodal</italic>. The observation of anterior-posterior PCP in the mouse and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic organizers reflects a strong evolutionary conservation of this mechanism that is important for body plan determination.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mouse, left-right asymmetry has been proposed to be controlled by fluid flow in the node propelled by clockwise movement of motile nodal cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Basu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Tabin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

If so, nodal cells must be polarized prior to the onset of nodal flow. To determine whether a conserved PCP signaling mechanism may establish PCP in the mouse ventral node, and if so, when this polarity is established, we used VANGL1, PK1, and PK2 antibodies to examine expression and localization of these proteins in early headfold stage embryos with 0 somites, prior to initiation of nodal flow, and in embryos with 1 to 2 somites, the time the nodal flow begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008999-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). PK2 asymmetric distribution at anterior-posterior boundaries of central cells in the ventral node can be detected in very early headfold 0 somite embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008999-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A, C</bold></xref>), presumably prior to the beginning of nodal flow. Asymmetric distribution of VANGL1 was also detected, but the earliest we detected it was later, at the 1 to 2 somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008999-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B, C, E, F</bold></xref>), the time when nodal flow begins. At this time, PK2 and VANGL1 colocalize. Both proteins appear to be at the anterior side of the cells, although mosaic studies will be needed to confirm this. Localization of these two PCP proteins in crescents is reminiscent of that seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, and of PCP protein localization patterns in the vertebrate sensory epithelia of the inner ear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Wang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Wang2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Wang3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Montcouquiol2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Deans1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

The relevance of PK2 asymmetric distribution in crescents preceding that of VANGL1 is not clear, but might suggest that PK2 could be involved in establishing PCP while VANGL1 may be necessary to maintain it.

In addition, despite advancing to the 20&#x02013;25 somite stage and maintaining viability up to E9.5-E10 as judged by beating hearts at the time of isolation, each of the phenotypically mutant embryos failed to turn. The turning of mouse embryos is a process that converts the embryo from lordotic to fetal position at the 8- to 13-somite stage of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Normal left-sided expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> was observed in seven additional <italic>Vangl1gt/gt</italic> embryos with normal morphology that were obtained from these litters, as well as in all the embryos from five other litters from <italic>Vangl1gt/&#x0002b;</italic> parents, from which we expect Mendelian ratios of <italic>Vangl1gt/gt</italic> homozygotes, although they were not genotyped.

We suggest that the very early establishment of PCP in the ventral node and GRP triggers the proper posterior localization of motile cilia that is required for efficient leftward nodal flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Shiratori1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Blum1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008999-Marshall1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is not clear from these results in which capacity DVL proteins function in the ventral node.

Positions of primers used for PCR based genotyping are marked (&#x0003e; and &#x0003c;). The <italic>&#x003b2;-Geo</italic> gene, together with the splice acceptor (SA) site and the polyA tail, is inserted at position 239 of the 3rd intron in the <italic>Vangl1</italic> locus of the XL802 ES cell line. The resulting VANGL1-&#x003b2;Geo fusion protein contains 70 N-terminal amino acids of the VANGL1 protein, and lacks all the trans-membrane domains (TM1-TM4) and the downstream C-terminal parts of the native VANGL1 protein.

To do so, we prepared mRNA and protein samples from cerebellum and found that VL1 protein is abundantly expressed in this adult tissue (not shown). (<bold>A</bold>) Position of primers that were used for RT-PCR is marked (&#x0003e;, &#x0003c;). To detect the Vangl1-&#x003b2;Geo fusion mRNA, we used oligo-dT to obtain cDNA for subsequent PCR reaction with Ex3F and BGeo-R1 primers that produced a &#x0223c;480 nucleotide RT-PCR product. To detect Vangl1 WT mRNA, we used oligo-dT to obtain cDNA for subsequent PCR reaction with 117-For and 996-Rev primers. The &#x0223c;880 nucleotide PCR product would be obtained only if &#x003b2;Geo was spliced out and Vangl1-WT mRNA was produced.

(<bold>E'</bold>) A litter containing two <italic>Vangl1gt/gt</italic> embryos: the first embryo on the left is normal and the third embryo from the left has a turning phenotype. This example demonstrates that one <italic>Vangl1gt/gt</italic> animal was phenotypically &#x0201c;rescued&#x0201d; (first embryo from the left) and the other one was not, presumably by varying alternative splicing of the mutant transcript to produce varying levels of VANGL1 wild-type protein. Further, two <italic>Vangl1&#x0002b;/gt</italic> embryos from the same litter (<bold>E'</bold>), produced varying amounts of VANGL1-&#x003b2;Geo fusion protein.

HeLa cells were transfected with vectors expressing VANGL1 (VL1), VANGL2 (VL2), as well as the corresponding YFP fusion proteins (YFP-VL1 and YFP-VL2). Lysates containing over-expressed proteins were analyzed by Western blots and compared to lysates of untransfected HeLa cells (&#x02013;) or to vector-transfected cells (vector).

Protein of the predicted size is detected after endoglycosidaseF treatment of lysates, demonstrating that glycosylation is the main reason for the observed discrepancy in size.
