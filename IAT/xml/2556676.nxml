Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) increases the intrinsic growth state of injured neurons early after injury, but the role of long-term changes and their relation to axonal outgrowth after a delayed nerve repair are not well understood. ATF3 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in motor and sensory neurons and in Schwann cells in rat sciatic nerve and related to axonal outgrowth after transection and delayed nerve repair (repair 0, 30, 90 or 180 days post-injury). Expression of the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is expressed in non-myelinating Schwann cells, was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The number of neurons and Schwann cells expressing ATF3 declined and the length of axonal outgrowth was impaired if the repair was delayed. The decline was more rapid in motor neurons than in sensory neurons and Schwann cells. Regeneration distances over time correlated to number of ATF3 stained neurons and Schwann cells. Many neurofilament stained axons grew along ATF3 stained Schwann cells. If nerve repair was delayed the majority of Schwann cells in the distal nerve segment stained for NCAM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Delayed nerve repair impairs nerve regeneration and length of axonal outgrowth correlates to ATF3 expression in both neurons and Schwann cells. Mainly non-myelinating Schwann cells (NCAM stained) are present in distal nerve segments after delayed nerve repair. These data provide a neurobiological basis for the poor outcomes associated with delayed nerve repair. Nerve trunks should, if possible, be promptly repaired.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Impaired nerve regeneration and weakened target reinnervation are significant clinical problems after nerve injury when the repair of a nerve trunk is delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Clinically, recovery of motor function is also less than sensory recovery after delayed repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], possibly due to the outgrowth of sensory axons interfering with the outgrowth of motor axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In delayed nerve repair the previously injured neurons are reactivated upon the additional injury leading to axonal outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. After a nerve injury Schwann cells are rapidly activated at site of the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and in the distal nerve segment with proliferation and remodelling of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The insufficient nerve regeneration after delayed nerve repair has been attributed to an inability of Schwann cells to support axonal outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, detailed signal transduction mechanisms underlying the impaired nerve regeneration are not well understood.</p><p>Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is rapidly expressed in neurons and Schwann cells after injury and is preceeded by phosphorylation of c-Jun and JNK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The number of Schwann cells and neurons in the spinal cord that express ATF3 declines over time if nerve regeneration is prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], although some sensory neurons may express ATF3 for at least 140 days after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A nerve repair 30 days after injury leads to a reduction in the number of ATF3 stained Schwann cells in the distal nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the consequences of ATF3 expression in neurons and Schwann cells for axonal outgrowth in relation to time after nerve injury are not known, particularly if there is a time limit at which a delayed nerve repair can be performed. In addition, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is expressed mainly in non-myelinating Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but its alteration after delayed nerve repair is unknown. Our aim was to study ATF3 expression in neurons and Schwann cells and relate that to axonal outgrowth and the presence of NCAM, after delayed nerve repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Nerve transection and repair induced expression of ATF3 in motor and sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (i.e. Schwann cells; see below) at the site of the lesion and in the distal nerve segment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Furthermore, the total number of DAPI stained cells was higher at the experimental sides (distal nerve segment, site of lesion and 15 mm proximal to site of lesion) than in the contralateral nerve at all time points except in the proximal nerve segment (15 mm proximal to suture) after immediate repair.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immunocytochemical staining of ATF3 in motor neurons in spinal cord (a-c) and in sensory neurons in DRG (d-h)</bold>.

NCAM and neurofilament double-staining were analysed in longitudinal sections both at the site of the lesion and in the distal nerve segment. In contralateral control nerves only patchy areas of NCAM staining were seen and large diameter nerve fibres were not associated with NCAM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). In ten days after transection and immediate repair neurofilament stained fibres with positive NCAM staining had increased, but fibres not associated with NCAM were still seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). When the repair was delayed 30 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>), 90 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>) or 180 days after transection almost all regenerating neurofilament stained fibres were associated with NCAM positive staining, although the number of regenerating nerve fibres was reduced at the latter two time points. Thus, the majority of regenerating nerve fibres after delayed nerve repair were associated with non-myelinating Schwann cells (NCAM stained; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation</title><p>The Spearman correlation test revealed a significant correlation between length of axonal outgrowth and the number of ATF3 stained motor neurons (Rho = 0.69, p = 0.005), ATF3 stained sensory neurons (Rho = 0.77, p = 0.002), and in the distal nerve segments [site of lesion (SNL); Rho = 0.76, p = 0.001; nerve segment 15 mm distal to lesion; SND; Rho = 0.71, p = 0.003] when all groups were included.

Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between number of ATF3 stained motor neurons and Schwann cells in the distal nerve segment (Rho = 0.48, p = 0.042).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>ATF3 is a member of the CREB family and its rapid expression after injury in neurons is preceded by a fast upregulation of JNK and phophorylation of c-jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sensory and motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and non-neuronal cells (i.e. Schwann cells; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) in the injured nerve trunk showed a decline in ATF3 response after transection and delayed nerve repair. The reduction of ATF3 stained neurons and Schwann cells correlated to axonal outgrowth. ATF3 expression is long lasting in sensory, but not in motor, neurons if regeneration is prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Progression of axonal outgrowth into the distal nerve segment after a nerve crush decreases the number of ATF3 stained motor and sensory neurons both with time and with reinnervation indicating a complex regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Retransection of the axons at the time of delayed nerve repair, which is necessary for coaptation, may influence expression of ATF3, since the number of ATF3 expressing neurons was lower than that found when a transection was not repaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. ATF3 expression in Schwann cells decreased with time after denervation in the absence of regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, reinnervation of target gives a more rapid decline of ATF3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the number of ATF3 stained neurons and Schwann cells and length of axonal outgrowth correlated when all groups were examined, indicating that delayed nerve repair influences axonal outgrowth and ATF3 expression in neurons and Schwann cells. Therefore, both neurons and Schwann cells are probably of importance for nerve regeneration in delayed nerve repair. Outgrowing axons were associated with ATF3 stained Schwann cells in the distal nerve segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). One may suggest from our and other studies that ATF3 expression in Schwann cells is important for the support of regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As previously shown, ATF3 in neurons promotes neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, particularly of sensory neurons in DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, inhibition of JNK, and thereby ATF3, reduces outgrowth of sensory axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We found a correlation between the number of ATF3 expressing neurons and axonal outgrowth. No data are available for a connection between the expression of ATF3 and the regeneration of motor fibers. However, the number of stained motor neurons in the spinal cord correlated with regeneration distances of axons, indicating that not only sensory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but also motor neurons may be dependent on ATF3 for survival and outgrowth after delayed nerve repair. In the spinal cord, the number of ATF3 stained motor neurons decreased significantly between immediate repair and a repair with a delay of 30 days. Interestingly, the decrease was faster if the nerve was repaired, as in the present study, compared to previous studies when regeneration was not permitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], signifying that expression of ATF3 in motor neurons is dependent on interaction between motor neurons and Schwann cells. One may also suggest that early nerve repair is more important for motor neurons than for sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], particularly with respect to non-myelinated fibers, as there is better functional motor recovery after early repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The number of ATF3 stained sensory neurons, and the length of outgrowing axons decreased between groups with a repair delay of 30 and 90 days. Neurofilament stained axons were only partly associated with NCAM stained areas of Schwann cells after immediate repair, while after repair at 90 and 180 days post injury almost all regenerating nerve fibers were associated with NCAM stained Schwann cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, e, f</xref>). The latter findings point towards a more prominent regeneration of non-myelinated axons after a delayed nerve repair, since NCAM (and L1) is associated with non-myelinating Schwann cells and not myelinating Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, we cannot differentiate with certainty between sensory and sympathetic axons by the neurofilament staining. Staining for the adhesion molecule L1 has been claimed to be present in Schwann cells of sympathetic unmyelinated axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, in clinical practice early nerve reconstruction is more effective than delayed reconstruction in relief of pain after brachial plexus injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; a factor pointing toward a better regeneration of myelinated axons after early repair.</p><p>Non-neuronal cells were also stained by ATF3 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the majority being Schwann cells (characteristics: elongated nucleus, located within basal lamina and S-100 positive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Expression of ATF3 in Schwann cells has been seen rapidly after nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but was significantly decreased if repair was delayed for more than 30 days. Although the total number of DAPI stained (mostly, but not only, Schwann cells) cells in the distal nerve segment increased significantly when the nerve was repaired 180 days after injury, compared to the other groups, only around 13% of the Schwann cells stained for ATF3. Double staining of ATF3 stained Schwann cells and neurofilaments in the distal nerve segment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) showed a close relationship; but the suggestion that ATF3 may be important for differentiation of Schwann cells, myelination and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] has to be proven. ATF3 stained Schwann cells were also seen where there were no regenerating fibers in the distal nerve segment, signifying that contact with regenerating nerve fibers is not completely responsible for the decline in ATF3 in Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The distal nerve segment is important for axonal outgrowth, as shown particularly well in experiments using short term predegenerated nerve grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. ATF3 expression in Schwann cells and Schwann cell proliferation, influenced by Erk1/2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], occurs in the distal nerve segment within a few days of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The number of DAPI stained cells (all type of cells; not only, but mostly, Schwann cells) was also higher in the injured side than in the uninjured nerve trunk at all time points. A distal nerve segment denervated for a prolonged period looses its ability to induce and properly support regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Schwann cells express many regeneration-associated proteins, such as NGFR/p75, GAP43 and extracellular matrix molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The synthesis of NGFR/p75 in denervated Schwann cells has a similar time course as ATF3 expression with a peak at one month. NGFR/p75 is barely detectable six months after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, c-erbB receptors have been investigated in Schwann cells denervated for up to 6 months in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The levels of c-erbB receptor expression by Schwann cells, and the degree to which axons regenerated into the distal stumps both decreased with an increased period of denervation. Addition of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) can modulate Schwann cell survival and improve recovery of motor function after delayed nerve repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], but a clear connection between ATF3 and LIF has not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The number of Schwann cells expressing ATF3 decreased with delayed nerve repair and did not increase after repair when compared with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Schwann cells most probably die in the distal nerve segment with delayed nerve repair (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, nerve repair should be performed as soon as possible to utilise the expression of regeneration associated factors, such as ATF3, in both neurons and Schwann cells.</p><p>After nerve injury there is a loss of neurons, particularly in DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The mechanisms are not completely understood, but ATF3 may determine the cell fate after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. ATF3 as a heterodimer with c-Jun promotes neuronal survival under stress by induction of the anti-apoptotic factor heat shock protein 27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Inhibition of c-jun activation increases the number of apoptotic sensory neurons after injury in the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, ATF3 plays a role in cell survival and cell cycle. If the present data is compared with previous reports of the decline of ATF3 expression after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], one may suggest that a neuron or a Schwann cell that has lost ATF3 will probably not properly recover their ability to express ATF3 after an additional injury with a diminution of supporting nerve regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Delayed nerve repair after an injury impairs the outgrowth of axons in the distal nerve segment. Regeneration distances correlate to the decline of both the number of ATF3 stained neurons and Schwann cells over time. ATF3 stained motor neurons decreased more rapidly than sensory neurons over time. Non-myelinating Schwann cells (NCAM stained) in the distal nerve segment increased when repair was delayed, indicating abundant regeneration of non-myelinated axons after delayed nerve repair. From the neurobiological point of view nerve trunks should, if possible, be promptly repaired.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Twenty Wistar female rats (weight 180&#x02013;200 g) were anesthetized, after approval of the local Animal Ethics Committee of Lund University, with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/ml, Apoteket AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and sodium chloride (9 mg/ml: 1/10, v/v). Adequate measures were taken to minimize pain and discomfort. Experiments were conducted in accordance with international standards on animal welfare and compliant with local and national regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Sciatic nerve transection and repair</title><p>The sciatic nerve in the left hind limb was exposed and transected 10 mm proximal to the branching of the tibial and peroneal nerves. Four different time points were used to study the influence of delay of nerve repair. In one group the nerve was immediately sutured with 9-0 nylon suture with stitches in the epineurium (day 0; n = 5). In the other groups the distal nerve stump was reversed and put between the muscles at a distance of at least 20 mm from the proximal one to avoid spontaneous reconnection. The wound was closed and the rats were housed in cages. At day 30 (n = 5), 90 (n = 5) or 180 (n = 5) after nerve transection, the rats were re-anesthetized and the nerve ends were sutured with application of 9-0 nylon sutures in the epineurium after retransection of both nerve stumps (resection 0.5&#x02013;1 mm) to make coaptation easier. The wound was closed and the rats allowed to recover.</p><p>Ten days after nerve repair (i.e. 10, 40, 100 and 190 days after the nerves were transected initially) the rats were killed by an i.p. injection with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital followed by a heart puncture. The sciatic nerves bilaterally, the dorsal root ganglia (DRG; L4 and L5) bilaterally and the lumbar enlargement portion of the spinal cord were removed.
