In yeast, about 5% of the genome is under the transcriptional control of the UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Induction of this vast set of genes is thought to lead to a restructuring of the secretory pathway to allow an increased protein flux to the cell surface and enable the cell to tolerate protein-folding stress. Hence, the UPR adjusts the secretory capacity of cells by feedback regulation.</p><p>The identification and characterization of the UPR signaling components revealed a unique mechanism of signal transduction whose salient features are conserved among all eukaryotes. The UPR is initiated when the amino-terminal portion of the serine/threonine ER-transmembrane kinase Ire1 detects unfolded proteins within the ER lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Accumulation of unfolded proteins sequesters chaperones and thereby allows Ire1 molecules to oligomerize in the plane of the ER membrane. Oligomerization, in turn, results in <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of the cytosolic kinase domain, providing the means by which the signal is transmitted across the ER membrane.</p><p>Activated Ire1 acts as a site-specific endoribonuclease, cleaving the mRNA encoding the transcription activator Hac1 at two discrete positions, and removing a 252-nucleotide nonclassical intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A second enzyme, tRNA ligase (Rlg1), then joins the severed exons to produce a spliced version of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA, termed <italic>HAC1</italic><sup><italic>i </italic></sup>mRNA (<italic>i </italic>for UPR-induced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA splicing reaction mediated by Ire1 and Rlg1 is spliceosome-independent, and utilizes chemistry that closely resembles pre-tRNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As in pre-tRNA processing, 5' and 3' splice-site cleavage of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA occur independently. In contrast, spliceosome-mediated splicing is a series of two transesterification reactions that have to be strictly ordered: 3' splice-site cleavage cannot occur before 5' splice-site cleavage. Intriguingly, this Ire1-mediated splicing reaction happens on polyribosome-bound <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the unspliced <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA, the intron forms a long-range base-pairing interaction with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) that is responsible for preventing its translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Splicing abolishes translational inhibition, allowing production of the Hac1 transcription factor and induction of UPR target genes. Hence, removal of the intron provides a key regulatory step in the signaling pathway.</p><p>The amino-acid sequence of the nuclease region of Ire1 reveals significant similarities to that of RNase L, a mammalian endoribonuclease that is activated by interferon during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. RNase L functions to eliminate infected cells by nonspecific degradation of cellular RNA. Mutagenesis analysis maps the endoribonuclease activity of both proteins to homologous carboxy-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The nuclease domains in both proteins are preceded by kinase domains, and only the oligomerized forms of each protein appear to be active nucleases. Despite these similarities, the endoribonuclease activity of Ire1 is specific for the <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA, whereas the nuclease activity of RNase L shows no sequence specificity. Previously, to demonstrate the sequence specificity of Ire1, we devised an <italic>in vitro </italic>assay which utilized a purified, recombinant Ire1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This protein, here referred to as Ire1*, is composed of a linker region (bridging between the membrane anchor of full-length Ire1 and the cytosolic kinase domain), the kinase domain itself, and the RNase domain. Ire1* cleaves <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA faithfully at both 5' and 3' exon-intron junctions and thus recapitulates the substrate specificity of full-length Ire1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Other RNAs, including actin mRNA and poly(U) RNA, which has been demonstrated to be an RNase L substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], are not cleaved by Ire1* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In metazoans, multiple parallel pathways originate from the ER and contribute to the UPR. Two <italic>bona fide </italic>Ire1 orthologs IRE1&#x003b1; and IRE1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] are present in higher eukaryotes. In addition, a Hac1 ortholog (XBP1) is activated by a similar nonconventional splicing step that changes the protein's carboxy-terminal sequence by introducing a frameshift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Another transmembrane kinase, PERK, shares structural similarity to Ire1 in its ER-luminal unfolded-protein-sensing domain and is also activated upon accumulation of unfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Activated PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2&#x003b1;, thereby inactivating it. This branch of the pathway leads to a global repression of translation, which is thought to lessen the secretory burden on the ER. In cells with reduced eIF2&#x003b1; activity, mRNAs containing small open reading frames (ORFs) in their 5' UTRs become preferentially translated. One such mRNA codes for the transcription factor ATF4, which collaborates with XBP1 to induce UPR target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A third branch of the metazoan UPR activates the transcription factor ATF6, which is initially synthesized as an ER transmembrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Accumulation of unfolded proteins allows ATF6 to leave the ER and move to the Golgi compartment, where it encounters proteases that release its cytosolic portion as a soluble protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which participates along with XBP1 and ATF4 in executing the transcriptional program of the UPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To date, <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA is the only known RNA substrate for yeast Ire1, prompting the question of whether other substrate RNAs exist or whether Ire1 and <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA function as a matched enzyme-substrate pair that interact exclusively with each other. Here we describe three independent genome-scale methods that address this question. Each approach successfully identifies <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA as a substrate of Ire1; none of the approaches identifies any other mRNA as a qualified candidate. Two of these approaches represent novel applications of cDNA array technology and could be adapted to the study of other signal transduction pathways regulated by RNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We first devised a molecular screen to identify mRNAs cleaved by the Ire1 nuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In brief, we isolated a total poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA fraction from cells and subjected it to <italic>in vitro </italic>cleavage reactions in the presence or absence of Ire1*. Fragments that lost their poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>tails due to cleavage by Ire1* were re-isolated, reverse transcribed, fluorescently labeled and hybridized to genomic cDNA microarrays to identify Ire1 substrates.</p><p>For these experiments, we expressed and purified a recombinant Ire1* tagged with glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST). The GST moiety was removed during the purification by protease cleavage. Upon incubation of Ire1* with <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA, we observed efficient and accurate cleavage at both splice junctions as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We optimized reaction conditions such that <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA contained in a total poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA fraction from yeast would be efficiently cleaved, even in the presence of significant excess of other mRNAs. We incubated total poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA with Ire1* and then fractionated the products using oligo(dT) cellulose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Input RNA and the bound and unbound fractions of the cleavage reaction were analyzed by Northern blotting using a <italic>HAC1</italic>-specific probe covering the 5' exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 1-3). Note that <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA present in the input fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 1) was efficiently converted to a faster migrating species corresponding to the released 5' exon and intron, which, lacking poly(A) tails, were recovered exclusively in the unbound fraction after oligo(dT) chromatography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 3).</p><p>Conversely, analyzing the same RNA fractions with a <italic>HAC1 </italic>probe directed to the 3' exon, the resulting 3' exon (still containing its poly(A) tail) was recovered exclusively in the oligo(dT)-bound fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 5). No significant levels of uncleaved <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA were detectable after Ire1* cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6).</p><p>Using these reaction conditions, we isolated Ire1*-cleaved RNA fragments from total poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA, which were recovered in the unbound fraction after oligo(dT) chromatography. We prepared a mock-treated reference sample using reaction conditions which were identical except that Ire1* was omitted. We reverse-transcribed both samples and fluorescently labeled the resulting cDNA with Cy3 (Ire1*-treated; green) or Cy5 (mock-treated; red), respectively. The two probes were then simultaneously hybridized to yeast microarrays. We expected that contaminating poly(A)<sup>- </sup>RNA or uncleaved poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA would be equally represented in the oligo(dT) unbound fractions of both Ire1*-treated and mock-treated reactions, thus leading to equal representation of both fluorescent probes in the mixture. Indeed, scatter plots generated by quantitating the fluorescence levels of both Cy3 and Cy5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) showed that most spots appeared on a tight diagonal, having hybridized to roughly equal amounts of both the Cy3 and Cy5 probes.</p><p>We expected those mRNAs that are specifically cleaved by Ire1* to be enriched in the oligo(dT) unbound fraction of the Ire1*-treated reaction compared to the unbound fraction of the mock-treated reaction, resulting in a higher Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence ratio in the microarray hybridization. Depletion of particular mRNAs by Ire1* digestion thus provides an enzymological tool to fractionate substrate from nonsubstrate mRNAs. We therefore plotted a histogram of the log<sub>2 </sub>Cy3/Cy5 ratio for all mRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, and see Additional data file 1). The histogram approximates a tight normal distribution (mean = 0.06; &#x003c3; = 0.41) with only one significant outlier: At a log<sub>2 </sub>Cy3/C5 ratio of 2.3, <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA falls 5.6&#x003c3; from the mean of the distribution, clearly identifying this mRNA as an Ire1* substrate. Indeed, under these conditions, <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA is the only substrate for cleavage by Ire1* represented in the poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA fraction. As the Ire1 cleavage sites on other mRNAs could, in principle, be located within the 5' or 3' UTRs, we also hybridized the same probe to genomic microarrays containing yeast intergenic regions in addition to the ORFs. Our results were similar to those observed using ORF-only microarrays, with <italic>HAC1 </italic>being the only significant outlier (data not shown).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that other potential RNA substrates might be hiding in the scatter of the data, our second approach combined the microarray analysis with a bioinformatics approach to search the genome for potential Ire1 cleavage sites. We had previously defined a consensus stem-loop motif by comparing the two splice sites of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA and mutational analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Both cleavages occur between the third and fourth nucleotide of a predicted seven-nucleotide loop bounded by a stem; the first nucleotide of both loops is a C; the third and sixth nucleotide of both loops is a G; and the first nucleotide of the 3' leg of the stem is in both cases a G. The primary and secondary sequence information in this consensus is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Ire1* can cleave short RNA substrates containing only the 5' or 3' stem-loop sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Mutational studies at nucleotide resolution demonstrate that each of the shared primary and secondary sequence elements is essential for efficient cleavage.</p><p>We computationally searched the yeast genome for the presence of sequences fitting the consensus stem-loop motif. In this analysis, we searched ORFs, as well as 1,000 nucleotides upstream and downstream to include potential stem-loop motifs in 5' and 3' UTRs. The search yielded a total of 52 hits (Additional data file 2). In the list of genes identified, only a single gene, <italic>HAC1</italic>, contains two predicted stem-loop structures, consistent with the notion that <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA is the only Ire1-dependent splicing substrate in yeast cells.</p><p>For the remaining 52 predicted stem-loop structures, the possibility remained open that Ire1 would cleave some substrates at only a single site, perhaps to downregulate particular mRNAs. However, in the light of the data obtained from the microarray analysis described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> we consider this possibility unlikely. We would have expected to see the 5' fragments resulting from such cleavage events in the oligo(dT) unbound fraction of Ire1*-treated poly(A)<sup>- </sup>mRNA, resulting in high outlying Cy3/Cy5 ratios; however, none of the genes predicted to bear single <italic>HAC1 </italic>splice consensus sequences fell more than 3&#x003c3; from the mean of the distribution (that is, none fell outside a 99% confidence interval). Because previous <italic>in vitro </italic>analyses have shown that stem-loop structures matching the consensus are sufficient for cleavage, we consider it most likely that the predicted stem-loop structures are either not included in the transcripts or do not fold as predicted in the context of the full mRNA sequences.</p><p>In a third genome-scale approach, we exploited the phenotype of a mutant in tRNA ligase that is defective in UPR induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Characterization of this mutant, <italic>rlg1-100</italic>, previously showed that Ire1-dependent cleavage of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA occurs normally in the absence of ligation, but that the cleavage products are rapidly degraded. We assume that any other mRNA following this pathway should suffer the same fate, and that we could identify substrates of Ire1 by looking for mRNAs whose steady-state levels drop upon UPR induction in the <italic>rlg1-100 </italic>mutant, but not in a wild-type cell. The Ire1-dependent selective disappearance of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA in <italic>rlg1-100 </italic>cells thus provides us with a tool to assess the spectrum of mRNAs that utilize the Ire1-mediated splicing pathway.</p><p>We treated <italic>rlg1-100 </italic>cells with either tunicamycin (to induce the UPR by inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation in the ER) or with no drug as a control, isolated total mRNA, reverse transcribed and fluorescently labeled the cDNA with Cy5 (for the tunicamycin-treated sample) and Cy3 (for the untreated sample) before simultaneous hybridization to genomic microarrays. mRNAs which are depleted during tunicamycin treatment should have Cy3/Cy5 ratios greater than 1 (log<sub>2 </sub>Cy3/Cy5 ratios greater than 0). As shown by the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the steady-state levels of most mRNAs remain unchanged upon tunicamycin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, and Additional data file 3). As before, a histogram of the log<sub>2 </sub>Cy3/Cy5 ratios followed a tight quasi-normal distribution (mean = 0.11, &#x003c3; = 0.27) with a single outlier. <italic>HAC1</italic>, at a log<sub>2 </sub>Cy3/5 ratio of 1.5, <italic>HAC1 </italic>falls 5&#x003c3; from the mean, and is thus successfully identified as a splicing target of the UPR. Once again, no other mRNA clearly satisfied the criteria for identification as an Ire1 substrate. The depletion of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA upon tunicamycin treatment was specific to <italic>rlg1-100 </italic>cells. A similar analysis of wild-type cells showed the expected induction of UPR target genes and no depletion of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA relative to an untreated control (data not shown). Thus, <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA again stands out as the unique substrate for Ire1-dependent cleavage in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The experiments presented in this paper represent three genome-scale approaches for identifying mRNA substrates of the Ire1-dependent mRNA splicing pathway in yeast. Each approach successfully and selectively identifies the <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA as a target of Ire1 nuclease. <italic>In vitro </italic>cleavage of mRNAs by Ire1*, followed by microarray detection of the fractionated mRNAs, identifies <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA as significantly enriched in the population of mRNAs specifically cleaved by Ire1. A computational search for the experimentally determined Ire1 consensus cleavage sites identifies <italic>HAC1 </italic>as the unique gene containing two such sequences. Finally, <italic>in vivo </italic>induction of splicing in a cell containing wild-type tRNA ligase or the mutant <italic>rlg1-100</italic>, and subsequent microarray detection of 'genetically fractionated' mRNAs, identifies <italic>HAC1 </italic>as selectively depleted in the absence of the wild-type ligase. No other mRNA met any of these criteria for identification as an Ire1 substrate. We consider it reasonable to conclude that among the set of robustly expressed genes, <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA is the lone substrate of Ire1.</p><p>In principle, there are many reasons why each of the approaches presented here could have missed identifying an Ire1 substrate other than <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA. For example, a poorly expressed substrate would exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio in the microarray readout of the <italic>in vitro </italic>cleavage assay, or a substrate cleaved close to the 5' end would still hybridize to cDNA arrays with an efficiency comparable to that of the uncleaved mRNA, and hence could have escaped detection. In our computational screen, we might have missed cleavage sites that are significantly divergent from the experimentally defined consensus. Finally, because tRNA ligase would not take part in a cleavage-only reaction on a single-site substrate, we would also not expect our third method to lead to a relative reduction of the abundance of such mRNAs in <italic>rlg1-100 </italic>mutant cells as compared to the wild-type (though we would have expected such substrates to be identified in the <italic>in vitro </italic>Ire1* cleavage experiment). Thus rigorously, we cannot conclude that <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA is the only Ire1 substrate. However, because the potential caveats are noncongruent and because <italic>HAC1 </italic>stands out unambiguously in each of the three methods applied, we consider it highly unlikely that additional substrates exist.</p><p>Previous studies in metazoans have suggested that other RNAs are degraded when Ire1 is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. When overexpressed, wild-type IRE1&#x003b1; mRNA accumulated at levels that were greatly reduced compared to those in which an RNase-dead mutant was overexpressed, raising the possibility that Ire1 might downregulate its own mRNA by degradation. Similarly, overexpression of IRE1&#x003b2; appeared to cause fragmentation of 28S rRNA. In both cases, however, no Ire1 cleavage consensus stem-loop structures were found. It therefore remains questionable at this time whether these degradation events are directly due to cleavage by Ire1 itself or to indirect secondary effects.</p><p>According to the current evidence, therefore, Ire1 has a single identified target in yeast and thus functions solely for the purpose of post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>HAC1</italic>. In contrast, other signaling pathways in the cell are commonly branched, using one enzyme to activate multiple different substrates. The utilization of common principles of protein modification, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, readily allows cross-talk among different signaling pathways that use common components. One phosphatase, for example, can dephosphorylate substrates that have been phosphorylated by several different kinases. In contrast, communication between the ER and nucleus through Ire1 appears to be a very private affair. Ire1-dependent splicing offers unique mechanistic advantages, such as the ability to quickly complete the synthesis of partially made Hac1 transcription factor by releasing the translational arrest of stalled polyribosomes. Given that the ER is a topologically distinct compartment of the cell with metabolic considerations quite distinct from those of the cytosol, a communication route that is wired differently and therefore more insulated from other informational 'chatter' in the cell may be particularly beneficial in the secure passage of information from the ER to the nucleus.</p><p>The linear connectivity (activation of Ire1 &#x02192; production of Hac1) of the two key players of the yeast UPR is supported by genetic analysis. Both <italic>&#x00394;ire1 </italic>and <italic>&#x00394;hac1 </italic>mutant cells display indistinguishable growth phenotypes and highly correlated gene-expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In higher eukaryotes, signaling through the UPR is more complex, with multiple ER-proximal components each activating distinct downstream targets. Metazoan Ire1 exists as two isoforms (Ire1&#x003b1; and Ire1&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; in addition, the transmembrane kinase PERK is activated and the membrane-tethered transcription factors ATF6&#x003b1; and ATF6&#x003b2; are released when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The diversity of these signaling components varies widely between different tissues, and the relative contribution of each of the parallel pathways to the induction of the downstream transcriptional program is currently the subject of intense study. Given this increased complexity, it is possible that there are other metazoan Ire1 splicing substrates in addition to the <italic>HAC1 </italic>ortholog XBP1, and the methods developed here may prove useful in searching for such putative, additional Ire1 substrates in metazoans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>RNA isolation</title><p>RNA samples were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

For the microarray experiments described in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA was isolated from total RNA using the PolyA<sup>+ </sup>Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA used for <italic>in vitro </italic>Ire1* nuclease reactions was prepared by two rounds of purification using the PolyA<sup>+ </sup>Tract system.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis</title><p>Total cellular RNA and RNA recovered from <italic>in vitro </italic>nuclease reactions was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] by separation on 1.5% agarose gels containing 6.7% formaldehyde. Hybridization probes were generated by random labeling of PCR fragments using [<sup>32</sup>P]&#x003b1;-dCTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). All probes prepared from DNA fragments were generated by PCR amplification of yeast genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>Ire1* nuclease reaction</title><p><italic>In vitro </italic>nuclease reactions were performed by incubating yeast poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA with recombinant Ire1* (expressed and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, the reaction mixture was fractionated on oligo(dT) magnetic beads using the PolyA<sup>+ </sup>Tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control nuclease reactions were performed and processed identically, except that Ire1* was omitted from the reaction mixture.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray hybridization of amino-allyl coupled cDNA probe</title><p>General protocols for microarray hybridization and for preparation of probe were as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A sample of oligo(dT) unbound RNA was reverse transcribed with StrataScript (Stratagene) using random primer A (5' GGTTCCCAGTCACGATCNNNNNNNNN 3', where N is any nucleotide) followed by addition of Sequenase to synthesize the second strand. The resulting double-stranded cDNA above was amplified in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (20 cycles) using primer B (5' GGTTCCCAGTCACGATC 3') complimentary to the specific sequence portion of primer A. This extra PCR amplification step was added because of the low abundance of Ire1*-cleaved RNA fragments. After ethanol precipitation, one fourth of these PCR reactions was used to re-PCR in the presence of fluorescently labeled nucleotides (either Cy3 or Cy5 dTTP). The resulting Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined. Unreacted fluorescent dye was quenched. Probes were cleaned up in a QIA-quick PCR purification spin column and hybridized at 50&#x000b0;C for 24 h to glass slide microarrays containing the entire yeast genome. Synthesis of the cDNA for poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) used for the experiment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> was carried out by reverse transcription in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP at 42&#x000b0;C for 2 h. cDNA prepared from untreated cells was coupled with Cy3, and cDNA prepared from tunicamycin-treated cells was labeled with Cy5.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Hybridized microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). GenePix Pro was used to analyze and to display the data. All data points with absolute fluorescence intensity less than 250 in either channel were discarded. Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensities were normalized against one another to adjust for differences in labeling efficiency and scanner gain. Quantitative analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel.</p></sec><sec><title>Stem-loop consensus search</title><p>Pattern searching was performed using the public-domain software scan_for_matches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Cleaved RNA (lacking the poly(A) tail) is separated from uncleaved RNA as the unbound, poly(A)<sup>- </sup>fraction from an oligo(dT) column and used to prepare fluorescent probe by reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification in the presence of Cy3-dTTP. A second control probe, using poly(A)<sup>- </sup>RNA from mock nuclease reactions (identical reactions except for the lack of Ire1*) is prepared similarly, except that PCR amplification was carried out in the presence of Cy5-dTTP. Equal amounts of these probes are mixed and used to probe the yeast DNA microarray. Because RNA fragments generated by Ire1* cleavage are represented only in the Cy3 probe, microarray spots hybridizing to cleaved fragments should appear green, whereas microarray spots hybridizing to molecules common to both probes should appear yellow upon superimposition of green (Cy3) and red (Cy5) channels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2004-6-1-r3-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Efficient cleavage of <italic>HAC1 </italic>mRNA by Ire1* in the presence of cellular mRNA. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic diagram of the Ire1*-cleaved (poly(A)<sup>-</sup>) and uncleaved (poly(A)<sup>+</sup>) RNA fractions separated after an <italic>in vitro </italic>nuclease reaction on yeast poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA. <bold>(b) </bold>Northern blot of the RNA fractions indicated in (a) probed with a PCR fragment encompassing either the 5' exon of <italic>HAC1 </italic>(lanes 1-3) or the 3' exon (lanes 4-6).
