Although most of the components of the iron homeostasis machinery have been described in neurons, little is known about the particulars of their iron homeostasis. In this work we characterized the response of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons to a model of progressive iron accumulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that iron accumulation killed a large proportion of cells, but a sub-population became resistant to iron. The surviving cells evoked an adaptative response consisting of increased synthesis of the iron-storage protein ferritin and the iron export transporter IREG1, and decreased synthesis of the iron import transporter DMT1. Increased expression of IREG1 was further substantiated by immunocytochemistry and iron efflux experiments. IREG1 expression directly correlated with iron content in SH-SY5Y and hippocampal cells. Similarly, a high correlation was found between IREG1 expression and the rate of iron efflux from SH-SY5Y cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Neuronal survival of iron accumulation associates with increased expression of the efflux transporter IREG1. Thus, the capacity of neurons to express IREG1 may be one of the clues to iron accumulation survival.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Because of its intense oxidative metabolism, the brain consumes a high fraction of total oxygen generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although brain antioxidant defenses function properly during most of human life, a number of neurodegenerative processes which involve redox-active iron accumulation become evident with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Iron is a pro-oxidant that in the reductive intracellular environment catalyses hydroxyl radical formation through the Fenton reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At present, the crucial components of the iron homeostasis machinery have been identified. Thus, current efforts should be directed to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cellular iron levels and antioxidant defenses. This is of primary importance for the development of strategies to ameliorate iron accumulation and oxidative damage in neurons.</p><p>In vertebrates, cellular iron levels are post-transcriptionally controlled by the activity of iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2), cytosolic proteins that bind to structural elements called iron-responsive elements (IREs). IREs are found in the untranslated region of the mRNAs of the major proteins that regulate cellular iron homeostasis: the transferrin receptor, involved in plasma-to-cell iron transport, and the iron-storage protein ferritin. IRP2-/- mice are born normal but in adulthood develop a movement disorder characterized by ataxia, bradykinesia and tremor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. IRP1-/- mice are normal with slight misregulation of iron metabolism in the kidney and brown fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, IRP2 seems to dominate the physiological regulation of iron metabolism whereas IRP1 seems to predominate in pathophysiological conditions.</p><p>Iron is internalized into cells by the import transporter DMT1. Four DMT1 isoforms have been identified that differ in both the N-and the C-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Two of the isoforms have a 3' iron responsive element (IRE) in their mRNA. Additional variation is given by exons 1A and 1B in the 5' end. Expression of DMT1 in response to iron availability follows a pattern similar to transferrin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but its control by the IRE/IRP system is not clear [for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]].</p><p>A new iron transporter, IREG1, also known as ferroportin or MTP1, was recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The protein is expressed mainly in enterocytes and macrophages [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]]. In enterocytes IREG1 is responsible for iron efflux during the process of intestinal iron absorption, while in Kupffer cells IREG1 mediates iron export for reutilization by the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The presence of both DMT1 and IREG1 has been described in neurons, glioma cells and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The presence of IREG1 in neurons opens the possibility that they may be able to down-regulate intracellular iron concentration through its expression.</p><p>In this study we examined iron homeostasis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons. We found that iron accumulation killed a large proportion of cells, but a sub-population became resistant to iron accumulation developing an adaptative mechanism intended to decrease intracellular iron content.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Iron accumulation and cell death</title><p>Iron accumulation was determined in SH-SY5Y cells grown to confluence and then cultured for two days in media containing from 1.5 to 80 &#x003bc;M iron (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Total cell iron increased with increasing extracellular iron, reaching a plateau at 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M Fe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The observed increase in cell iron was accompanied by increases in the labile iron pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Iron accumulation indeed caused loss of cell viability, with hippocampal neurons demonstrating higher sensitivity than SH-SY5Y cells to iron treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Nevertheless, a sub-population of cells survived to high iron concentrations. It was of interest to inquire into the processes underlying this adaptation, since they could help to understand iron accumulation observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we characterized the components of the iron homeostasis machine during the process of iron accumulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ferritin and DMT1 regulation</title><p>Ferritin, the main iron-storage protein in mammalian cells, is considered the first line of defense against iron overload. Increasing iron from 1.5 to 5 &#x003bc;M produced a robust 4-fold increase in cell ferritin content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Further increases in iron induced additional increases in ferritin. At 80 &#x003bc;M extracellular iron, ferritin increased 11-fold compared to the basal 1.5 &#x003bc;M iron condition. In molar base, ferritin increased more than iron. The iron to ferritin mol : mol ratio decreased from 1500 at 1.5 &#x003bc;M Fe to 400 at 10 &#x003bc;M Fe to 200 at 80 &#x003bc;M Fe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>We further characterized iron homeostasis in SH-SY5Y cells by examining the expression of the iron importer DMT1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A 3.5-fold decrease in DMT1 protein expression was observed when iron increased from 1.5 to 80 &#x003bc;M. The presence of DMT1 even at high iron concentration explains the sustained iron uptake observed at 80 &#x003bc;M Fe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, DMT1 activity persisted even under conditions of iron accumulation that preceded cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>IREG1 expression and functionality</title><p>Given that the presence of IREG1 in the central nervous system has been reported [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]], it was of interest to examine if it participates in neuronal iron homeostasis. Western blot analysis revealed that SH-SY5Y cells expressed anti-IREG1 reactive bands of 65.3 and 122.1 KDa molecular weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Densitometric analysis revealed a 10-fold increase in the 122.1 KDa band in the 1.5 to 80 mM Fe range while the 65.3 band had a minor increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Both bands were eliminated if the antibody was incubated with the immunogenic peptide before the assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). A similar pattern was obtained with an independent anti-IREG1 antibody (the kind gift of Dr. David Haile). Thus, it is most likely that the 65.3 and 122.1 KDa bands correspond to the monomer and dimer of IREG1. The stability of the 122.1 KDa band was dependent of the concentration of b-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer since increasing b-mercaptoethanol produced a shift in the 122.1 KDa /65.3 KDa band ratios (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). It is possible that in neuronal cells Ireg1 tends to form S-S bridged dimers resistant to the electrophoresis conditions.</p><p>The presence of IREG1 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons was further documented by immunocytochemistry. IREG1 was detected in both types of cells, with a predominantly cytosolic distribution pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The levels of IREG1 expression were directly proportional to the amount of iron in the culture. Thus, it was determined by two independent methods that IREG1 expression in neuronal cells increased with cell iron content.</p><p>Efflux of iron from neurons has never been reported. In view of the presence of IREG1, we tested whether SH-SY5Y cells actually had an iron efflux function. To that end, iron efflux from cells pre-cultured for 2 days with varied iron concentrations was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. This method was preferred to the use of radioisotopic iron since the latter could underestimate a putative iron efflux because of isotope dilution with the pre-existing iron pool (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). SH-SY5Y cells had discrete but measurable iron efflux activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The iron efflux rate increased markedly in the 20&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M Fe range (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Interestingly, the efflux rate correlated closely with the presence of the 122.1 KDa band, while the correlation between efflux activity and the 62.5 KDa band was weaker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The number of neurological diseases associated with iron accumulation in the brain underlines the need for increased knowledge of the mechanisms of brain iron homeostasis. In this study we show that iron accumulation by SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons resulted in cell death of part of the population, while another fraction survived by adapting the expression of iron homeostasis proteins.</p><p>Iron content increased significantly as a function of Fe in the culture up to 20&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;M Fe, increasing very little thereafter up to 80 &#x003bc;M Fe. Cell iron increase was accompanied by increased ferritin content. The increase in ferritin more than compensated for the increase in iron. Iron to ferritin mol ratios of 1500, 260 and 190 were obtained for 1.5, 20 and 80 &#x003bc;M Fe in the culture media. Thus, the IRE/IRP system of SH-SY5Y cells over-responded to iron accumulation in terms of ferritin expression. Despite the increase in ferritin, the LIP increased between 1.5 and 80 &#x003bc;M Fe. This finding clearly indicates that in SH-SY5Y cells the level of labile iron is a function of total iron, even in the presence of ample ferritin supply. It is possible that ferritin-stored iron contributes to the LIP each time that ferritin undergo lisosomal degradation.</p><p>Iron accumulation was accompanied by a marked decrease in DMT1 expression. Nevertheless, some DMT1 persisted even at 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M iron. The persistence of DMT1 at high iron concentrations could underline the continuous iron uptake observed under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This is curious because at 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M Fe cells were dying. Sustained DMT1 expression points to the inability of neuronal cells to shut-off iron uptake and the need for additional defense mechanisms to prevent iron-mediated cell death.</p><p>The discovery of increased IREG1 expression in response to cell iron accumulation is a major break-through in the understanding of cell survival under conditions of iron accumulation. Total IREG1, and especially a putative IREG1 dimer, increased markedly in the 20&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M Fe range. Thus, in SH-SY5Y cells IREG1 is up-regulated by increased cell iron. Expressed IREG1 was functional since it associated with increased iron efflux activity. Iron efflux activity in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and neurons (this work) indicate that iron efflux from brain cells is a dynamic process, and highlights the importance of iron transporters as determinants of iron accumulation.</p><p>The regulation of IREG1 expression is unknown but seems to be cell-specific. In enterocytes, IREG1 expression is induced by iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] while in macrophages iron increases IREG1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The findings reported here indicate that in neuronal cells IREG1 has a macrophage-like regulation. This is certainly the case for cells in the 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;M range that survived to iron accumulation. IREG1's predominantly cytosolic distribution pattern is similar to that of Kupffer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Again, this distribution points to macrophage-like behavior of neuronal IREG1. In examining brain biopsies from Alzheimer's patients an intriguing question arises: Why do some neurons die or present evident signs of degeneration while others in the vicinity show a normal phenotype? Extrapolating on the data presented here, it is tempting to hypothesize that surviving neurons induce IREG1 expression while sick neurons do not. Nevertheless, at present we cannot exclude that other regulatory molecules may play a pivotal role under these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hippocampal neurons and SH-SY5Y cells displayed an active system to regulate iron content. Nevertheless, this system was unable to block iron accumulation which resulted in death of part of the cell population. Another fraction of the cell population developed an adaptative mechanism that includes decreased expression of the import transporter DMT1 and increased expression of ferritin and the efflux transporter IREG1. The finding that neurons regulate the expression of functional IREG1 opens new avenues for the understanding and possible treatment of iron-related neurodegenerative processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and immunodetection</title><p>Antibody D-1, prepared against the C-terminal end of the IRE-containing isoform of DMT1 was used as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

The supernatant was stored at -70&#x000b0;C. For Western analysis, 30 micrograms of protein from each sample were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 1 hr at 25&#x000b0;C with 5% nonfat dry milk in blocking saline (20 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20).
