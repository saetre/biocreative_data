One year later three separate laboratories described low levels of poly(A) RNA in bacteria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c2">2</xref>). In spite of the discovery of a poly(A) polymerase (PAP I) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in 1962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c3">3</xref>) and extensive studies on the catalytic properties of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c4">4</xref>), no function was associated with this activity in bacteria until recently.</p><p>It is now accepted that PAP I adds poly(A) extensions to the 3&#x02032; ends of many kinds of RNA, including mRNA, precursor and mature forms of rRNAs and tRNAs, regulatory RNAs and small RNAs with unknown functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c13">13</xref>). In some cases, polyadenylation was demonstrated to facilitate degradation by 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonucleases. This is the case for RNA molecules whose 3&#x02032; ends are sequestered in stable stem&#x02013;loop structures which cannot be readily attacked by these enzymes. Addition of a 3&#x02032; poly(A) extension offers a toehold for polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) to bind the RNA and initiate its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c17">17</xref>). In contrast, RNase II, which is also able to remove these tails, fails to pass through secondary structures which protect the messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c19">19</xref>). It is generally accepted that repeated steps of poly(A) addition and exonuclease digestion are needed to overcome the resistance of structured RNAs to exonucleolytic decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c20">20</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, it was proposed that PAP I preferentially recognizes single-stranded RNA extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c22">22</xref>). In contrast, <italic>in vivo</italic> poly(A) tails have been mapped to both single-stranded and folded 3&#x02032; termini distributed at several positions within mRNA molecules, suggesting that PAP I shows little or no sequence specificity for the addition of poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c20">20</xref>). Also, PAP I polyadenylates tightly folded mRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c23">23</xref>) and non-coding small RNAs (RNA I, Cop A and Sok) that are mostly degraded by poly(A)-dependent RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c26">26</xref>). The discrepancy between PAP I specificity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> could be explained if cofactors such as unwinding proteins or RNA chaperones were involved in the recognition of 3&#x02032; extremities and adenylation by PAP I. Host factor I (Hfq), which stimulates poly(A) tail elongation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c27">27</xref>) and exhibits chaperone activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c28">28</xref>), may play this role. In the case of Q&#x003b2; RNA, Hfq affects the folding of the 3&#x02032; extremity of the molecule and promotes its replication by the replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c29">29</xref>). We therefore decided to examine whether Hfq affects the occurrence of poly(A) sites and the extent of polyadenylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Degradation of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA, encoding ribosomal protein S15, is initiated by an RNase E cleavage between the coding sequence and the transcriptional terminator. The body of the messenger is then further degraded by the combined actions of PAP I, PNPase and RNase II. Poly(A) tails were detected at the termini of nascent terminated mRNA and at the end of decay intermediates produced by endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c20">20</xref>). In this report, we demonstrate that &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032; extremities harbor oligo(A) tails ranging from one to five A residues in wild-type cells (4 out of 39 clones). To analyze polyadenylation independently of the exonucleolytic nibbling which removes poly(A) tails and of RNase E, which has been shown to initiate the rapid degradation of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c30">30</xref>) and to cleave poly(A) tails from RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c31">31</xref>), we mapped the position and determined the frequency and length of poly(A) tails in <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA in cells deficient for RNase II, PNPase and RNase E, and found that Hfq affects all three parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmid and growth conditions</title><p>Strains MG1693, SK5704 (<italic>rne</italic>-1<sup>ts</sup><italic>pnp</italic>-7 <italic>rnb</italic>-500<sup>ts</sup>) and IBPC922 &#x0005b;<italic>rne</italic>-1<sup>ts</sup><italic>pnp</italic>-7 <italic>rnb</italic>-500<sup>ts</sup><italic>hfq</italic>1::&#x003a9;(Km<sup>R</sup>, BclI)&#x0005d; and the pFB1 plasmid carrying the <italic>rpsO</italic> locus have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c32">32</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c33">33</xref>). After ethanol precipitation, an aliquot of the ligation was annealed to the DEOXY oligo complementary to the linker. cDNA synthesis was performed by incubating the annealing mix with 10 U AMV reverse transcriptase in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.5), 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 mM KCl, 100 mM DTT and 100 mM each dNTP at 42&#x000b0;C. The cDNA was subjected directly to PCR amplification with the same DEOXY oligo and the <italic>rpsO</italic> forward primer, under conditions suggested by the manufacturer. PCR products were digested with PstI and BamHI or HindIII and cloned into vector pT3T718U digested with the same enzymes. Polyadenylated clones are counted as those clones that possess extra A residues at the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA. Since we cannot distinguish between two encoded A residues at the 3&#x02032; end, the addition of one A after an encoded A or two A residues polymerized by PAP I, we assume that we underestimate the number of polyadenylation sites and size of the poly(A) tails.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>About 10&#x00025; of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNAs harbor an oligo(A) tail in wild-type cells</title><p>It is already known that the relative amount of RNA harboring poly(A) tails is low in bacteria. In order to determine precisely the fraction of <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts harboring poly(A) extensions and the length of these tails, we analyzed the 3&#x02032; ends of this particular mRNA species in wild-type cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we end-ligated the RIBOLI oligoribonucleotide to RNA extracted from strain MG1693 transformed with pFB1 and performed an RT&#x02013;PCR using the DEOXYLI and <italic>rpsO</italic> forward oligonucleotides complementary to the end-ligated oligoribonucleotide and <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA, respectively, so as to selectively amplify <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c7">7</xref>). The PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced.</p><p>Most of the 39 3&#x02032; ends analyzed by this method corresponded to transcripts lacking the transcription terminator hairpin and only four of them (10&#x00025;) harbored very short oligo(A) extensions ranging from one to three A residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f1">1</xref>A, square symbols). Because of the low frequency of poly(A)-tailed <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts, we modified the above RT&#x02013;PCR protocol so as to select for mRNA harboring at least two consecutive A residues at their 3&#x02032; ends. For this purpose, we ligated the RIBOFED oligoribonucleotide terminating with 5&#x02032;-GCUU&#x02026; to total RNA. The junction between this oligoribonucleotide and RNAs terminating with two A residues created a HindIII restriction site on the RT&#x02013;PCR products which permitted selective cloning of amplified DNA fragments containing adenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c12">12</xref>). Strikingly, 34 out of 49 3&#x02032; ends analyzed (69&#x00025;) contained at least two terminal A residues corresponding to encoded nucleotides, strongly reinforcing the notion that the relative frequency of RNA harboring post-transcriptionally added poly(A) extensions is very low. On the other hand, the other 15 ends contained non-encoded A residues in stretches ranging from one to five A residues in length, confirming that oligo(A) tails are very short in the wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f1">1</xref>B). Moreover, the identification of poly(A) extensions both upstream (two clones at position 347) and downstream of hairpin structures (two clones at position 417) suggests that PAP I can polymerize AMP downstream of both single-stranded and double-stranded sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f1">1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq affects the frequency of oligoadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts</title><p>The current model of polyadenylation in bacteria postulates that the length of poly(A) tails results from a dynamic equilibrium between the opposite activities of PAP I and 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases, namely PNPase and RNase II, which shorten or completely remove single-stranded nucleotides from the 3&#x02032; end of RNAs. To investigate the role of Hfq in poly(A) synthesis, we compared the frequency of tails in isogenic <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strains deficient for PNPase, RNase II and RNase E. RNase E inactivation has the advantage of increasing the intracellular concentration of the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript. RT&#x02013;PCR of <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts was performed using an oligoribonucleotide ligated to the 3&#x02032; end of total RNA as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c7">7</xref>). Strikingly, sequencing of the amplified <italic>rpsO</italic> cDNAs showed that 57&#x00025; (41 clones out of 72) of 3&#x02032; mRNA extremities were adenylated in an <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> strain compared to only 20&#x00025; (14 clones out of 70) of 3&#x02032; mRNA extremities in the strain lacking Hfq (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f2">2</xref>).

We isolated 71 and 70 oligoadenylated extremities from the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strains, respectively, in the triple mutant background and found polyadenylation at different sites in the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f3">3</xref>).

The fact that this fraction drops to 20&#x00025; in cells containing Hfq suggests that Hfq may facilitate adenylation of the 3&#x02032; end of molecules truncated within the coding sequence of <italic>rpsO</italic> resulting from both endo- and exonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript.

Indeed, the number average lengths calculated from data reported in the histogram in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f4">4</xref>A are 5.6 &#x000b1; 0.9 and 9.1 &#x000b1; 1.2 in the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> and the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> strains, respectively. If tails longer than 14, which seldom occur, are excluded, the number average lengths fall slightly to 5.1 &#x000b1; 0.6 in the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> and 7.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 in the <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> strains.

This was done by northern blotting of RNA fragments corresponding to the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts obtained by RNase H-directed cleavage 50 nt upstream of the transcription termination site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c17">17</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f4">4</xref>B shows that the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript may gain up to three additional nucleotides at its 3&#x02032; extremity (presumably A residues) 4 min after the inactivation of RNase II and RNase E in the strain lacking Hfq compared to seven nucleotides in cells containing Hfq. This elongation suggests that Hfq stimulates the rate of polyadenylation at the end of the primary transcript immediately after the inactivation of RNase E and RNase II in the absence of PNPase. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Hfq may protect <italic>rpsO</italic> RNA tailed at different positions from degradation by ribonucleolytic activities different from RNase II, PNPase and RNase E.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>A minor fraction of <italic>E.coli rpsO</italic> mRNA is adenylated in wild-type cells</title><p>The RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of RNA isolated from wild-type cells strongly reinforces the idea that the fraction of mRNAs harboring a poly(A) tail is very low in <italic>E.coli</italic>; indeed &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNAs are adenylated (4 clones out of 39). More strikingly, no tail longer than five A residues was found even when selecting for adenylated 3&#x02032; extremities harboring at least two terminal A residues. Our results strongly indicate that mRNAs (like mature stable RNAs, their precursors and regulator RNAs) exhibit very short oligo(A) tails at their 3&#x02032; ends. RNAI, Sok RNA, CopA RNA, MS2 genomic RNA, SraL, CI RNA of phage P4, precursors and mature forms of rRNA and tRNAtrp<sup>ts</sup> harbor 3&#x02032; extensions which do not exceed seven A residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c26">26</xref>). No tail longer than 29 A residues was found when RNase E together with RNase II and PNPase, the two 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonucleases which shorten poly(A) tails, were inactive and the vast majority of the tails that were sequenced were homopolymeric; only 5 out of the 176 tails analyzed contained a C or a G residue, probably incorporated by PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c34">34</xref>). It is curious that the long poly(A) tails such as the 45&#x02013;55 A residue long ones that were observed in the wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> strain, containing PAP I and exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c9">9</xref>), were not detected in this study. It is possible that only a few preferentially adenylated RNA species (that do not include the <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA) can acquire poly(A) tails of such length. On the other hand, one could also imagine that these long tails correspond to a very small fraction of all RNA species that have undergone many successive steps of elongation without being attacked by exoribonucleases. This latter hypothesis may explain why an <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA harboring 69 A residues was characterized in an exonuclease-deficient strain by a method selecting for long transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c32">32</xref>). However, the probability of isolating RNAs with stretches of A residues this long is presumably very low. On the other hand, our failure to detect the long heteropolymeric tails containing G, C and U residues that have been detected by others at the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts in wild-type cells suggests that these 3&#x02032; extensions are only synthesized when PNPase is overproduced in strains lacking PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq affects <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation and its polyadenylation</title><p>In a previous work, we showed that Hfq stimulates processive synthesis of poly(A) by PAP I <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c27">27</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that Hfq is also a cofactor of poly(A) metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic> that affects the fraction of polyadenylated molecules, the distribution of adenylation sites and the length of poly(A) tails. In particular, the higher fraction of polyadenylated molecules found in the presence of Hfq suggests that this protein facilitates the recognition of 3&#x02032; ends by PAP I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f2">2</xref>). The scattering of RNA extremities with poly(A) extensions in the presence of Hfq, compared to the preferential adenylation of the primary transcript (position 420) in its absence, suggest that this cofactor improves the polyadenylation of unstructured 3&#x02032; extremities, which probably result from cleavages internal to <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA. Moreover, these data indicate that the 3&#x02032; end of the primary transcript (typical of RNAs terminated at Rho-independent terminators) harboring a U<sub>6</sub>C sequence downstream of a stable hairpin is very efficiently adenylated by PAP I. This result is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showing that the addition of a few single-stranded nucleotides facilitates the adenylation by PAP I of RNAs harboring a terminal stable stem&#x02013;loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c22">22</xref>). Reduction of polyadenylation at this site in the presence of Hfq suggests either that PAP I could be titrated by RNA extremities resulting from ribonucleolytic cleavage which become more accessible to PAP I in the presence of Hfq or that this protein masks the U<sub>6</sub>C terminal motif of the primary transcript. The specificity of eukaryotic Lsm and Sm proteins, belonging to the same family as Hfq, for U-rich motifs and the affinity of Hfq for an oligo(U) polyribonucleotide are consistent with this latter hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c37">37</xref>; M. Folichon, in preparation). Altogether, these data indicate that Hfq reduces the preference that PAP I seems to exhibit towards the 3&#x02032; ends of primary trancripts released at Rho-independent terminators or harboring 3&#x02032; terminal hairpins. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that Hfq protects poly(A) from degradation by 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases remaining in cells deficient for PNPase and RNase II. In this case, the high affinity of Hfq for oligoadenylated RNA may explain why the fraction of polyadenylated molecules is higher when Hfq is present in the cell. Finally, it must be pointed out that the primer anchor method used in these experiments favors the identification of clones containing unstructured mRNA extremities; indeed, ligation of the primer is much less efficient downstream of stable 3&#x02032; hairpins (E. Hajnsdorf, unpublished results). This probably explains why only 20&#x00025; of the oligo(A) tails identified above are located downstream of t1, compared to 52&#x00025; when reverse transcription was initiated from oligo(dT<sub>18</sub>) hybridized to poly(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c20">20</xref>). This implies that the relative number of clones containing RNA extremities mapping downstream of t1 or in the coding sequence likely do not reflect the relative concentrations of full-length and truncated transcripts. However, in spite of this bias, the primer anchor method allows a comparison of the distribution of adenylated and tail-less mRNA extremities and length of tails in cells containing different sets of enzymes.</p><p>We confirm here that Hfq stimulates poly(A) addition. The number average length of tails is greater in an exonuclease-deficient strain containing Hfq and longer tails were found in this strain than in the isogenic <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strain. The fact that the length of poly(A) was analyzed after a heat shock which inactivates thermosensitive RNase E and RNase II of a PNPase-deficient strain suggests that this difference reflects a stimulation of poly(A) elongation by Hfq occurring after the inactivation of exonucleases. Consistent with this idea, we found that longer poly(A) tails are synthesized in the presence of Hfq after inactivation of RNase II and RNase E than in its absence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg456f4">4</xref>B). The fact that PAP I is not among the few polypeptides whose synthesis was reported to be modified by Hfq argues against an effect of this protein on PAP I synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c38">38</xref>). These data are in agreement with our earlier observation that <italic>rpsO</italic> transcripts are more rapidly elongated in the presence of Hfq <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c27">27</xref>). However, experiments presented here show that PAP I, when stimulated by Hfq, synthesizes tails whose number average length is 9.1 A residues <italic>in vivo</italic> (the longest ones are 29 A residues in length), while earlier <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that PAP I can processively synthesize very long tails of nearly 1000 nt in the presence of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c27">27</xref>). This clearly demonstrates that other factors, including exoribonucleases remaining in cells lacking RNase II and PNPase, prevent the appearance of such tails. On the other hand, the poor expression of PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c39">39</xref>), its very low intracellular concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg456c34">34</xref>) and the failure to detect such long tails in the cell raises the possibility that the Hfq-promoted processivity of poly(A) elongation may only affect a small fraction of bacterial RNA or become more efficient under particular physiological conditions.</p><p>The current model of poly(A) metabolism in <italic>E.coli</italic> postulates that the tails synthesized by PAP I are removed by 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonucleases. We clearly demonstrate here that poly(A) tails resulting from this dynamic equilibrium are rare and short in spite of the fact that all accessible RNA extremities that are not masked by proteins, aminoacylated or engaged in strong secondary structures can probably be adenylated by PAP I assisted by Hfq.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg456f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA polyadenylation in wild-type cells.
