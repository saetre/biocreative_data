Although the virus has B cell growth&#x02013;transforming ability, this may not relate to its role in BL since many of the transforming proteins are not expressed in the tumor. Mounting evidence supports an alternative role, whereby EBV counteracts the high apoptotic sensitivity inherent to the c-myc&#x02013;driven growth program. In that regard, a subset of BLs carry virus mutants in a novel form of latent infection that provides unusually strong resistance to apoptosis. Uniquely, these virus mutants use Wp (a viral promoter normally activated early in B cell transformation) and express a broader-than-usual range of latent antigens. Here, using an inducible system to express the candidate antigens, we show that this marked apoptosis resistance is mediated not by one of the extended range of EBNAs seen in Wp-restricted latency but by Wp-driven expression of the viral bcl2 homologue, BHRF1, a protein usually associated with the virus lytic cycle. Interestingly, this Wp/BHRF1 connection is not confined to Wp-restricted BLs but appears integral to normal B cell transformation by EBV. We find that the BHRF1 gene expression recently reported in newly infected B cells is temporally linked to Wp activation and the presence of W/BHRF1-spliced transcripts. Furthermore, just as Wp activity is never completely eclipsed in <italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02013;transformed lines, low-level BHRF1 transcripts remain detectable in these cells long-term. Most importantly, recognition by BHRF1-specific T cells confirms that such lines continue to express the protein independently of any lytic cycle entry. This work therefore provides the first evidence that BHRF1, the EBV bcl2 homologue, is constitutively expressed as a latent protein in growth-transformed cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and, in the context of Wp-restricted BL, may contribute to virus-associated lymphomagenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cancer almost always develops through the cumulative effects of several independent changes in the target cell. For certain tumors, one step in the chain involves infection of the cell with a particular type of virus. The best example is Burkitt lymphoma (BL), a tumor of B lymphocytes which develops through the combined action of a genetic accident leading to uncontrolled expression of the c-myc oncogene and infection with a common herpesvirus, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Recent evidence suggests that, although latent EBV infection can itself drive B cell growth, the virus plays a different role in the context of BL, namely to counteract the naturally poor survival ability of c-myc&#x02013;expressing cells while leaving their c-myc&#x02013;driven growth intact. Here we show that EBV achieves this by unexpectedly switching on a viral protein that was thought never to be seen in latent infection; this viral protein resembles one of the cell's own key survival proteins called bcl2. Furthermore, the work has led us to realise that this virally encoded bcl2-like protein is not only important in the context of BL but, contrary to conventional wisdom, is actually part of EBV's natural strategy for B cell growth transformation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a human tumor of B cell origin whose pathogenesis involves complementation between a defined cellular genetic change, translocation of the c-myc oncogene into an active immunoglobulin (Ig) locus, and a B cell-transforming virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Brady1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most endemic BLs carry a wild-type EBV genome as a Latency I infection involving expression of a single EBV antigen, EBNA1, from the Qp promoter. A subset of 15&#x00025; endemic BLs carries a mutant EBNA2-deleted EBV genome and expresses a Wp-restricted form of latency. This involves expression of EBNAs 1, 3A, 3B, 3C, and in some cases a truncated(tr) EBNA-LP from a highly active Wp promoter. By contrast, when EBV transforms normal B cells into LCLs <italic>in vitro</italic>, the established lines express a wider range of transforming proteins. This typically involves a highly active Cp promoter (plus low-level Wp activity) leading to expression of EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and &#x02212;LP, and expression of LMPs 1, 2A, and 2B from their own EBNA2-dependent promoters.

Most BLs express the EBERs, BARTs and just one protein, EBNA1, from an EBNA1-specific promoter, Qp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Rowe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Nonkwelo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, a form of infection referred to as Latency I.

However, we recently identified another subset (around 15&#x00025;) of BLs where, in addition to EBNA1, the EBNA 3A, 3B, 3C proteins and in some cases also a truncated form of EBNA-LP were expressed, always in the absence of EBNA2 and the LMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This reflected the use of a different transcriptional programme, called &#x0201c;Wp-restricted latency&#x0201d;, where the EBNA transcripts all derive from the Wp promoter. Interestingly, another defining feature of &#x0201c;Wp-restricted&#x0201d; tumors was the presence of a mutant EBV genome with a deletion removing the EBNA2 gene and some adjacent upstream and downstream sequences. Note that, although EBNA2-deletion events are sometimes detectable by PCR amplification at sites of lytic virus infection in the oropharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Walling1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Walling2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, viruses with such a deletion are defective in transformation and have rarely if ever been detected as latent infections of the normal B cell pool. Therefore, detecting such rare mutant genomes in a significant number of BLs strongly suggests that infection with an EBNA2-deletion mutant (or, more likely, the Wp-restricted latency with which such infection is associated) has markedly increased EBV's potential to act as a cofactor in BL development.</p><p>As to what that co-factor role might be, studies of c-myc-driven B cell lymphomagenesis in mouse models have shown that complementary changes often act by counteracting the pro-apoptotic effects of high c-myc expression, thereby giving free rein to myc-driven proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Hemann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Egle1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed the first evidence suggesting an anti-apoptotic role for the virus in BL came from work with a Latency I BL line, Akata-BL, where EBV-positive sub-clones proved to be slightly less sensitive to apoptotic stimuli than sub-clones that had lost the EBV genome during <italic>in vitro</italic> passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This has prompted a large volume of work attempting to identify which Latency I gene products provide a survival advantage to BL cells, with evidence of anti-apoptotic potential being reported for the EBERs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Komano1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Ruf1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, for EBNA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and most recently for a BART-derived mi-RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Choy1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> in different experimental contexts. However the levels of apoptosis protection mediated by Latency I infection <italic>in vitro</italic> are relatively slight and the underlying mechanism remains to be fully resolved. It was therefore notable that Wp-restricted BL cell lines were much more resistant to cell death triggers than either EBV-negative or Latency I BL lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation strongly reinforced the idea that EBV's role in BL pathogenesis was to counteract the pro-apoptotic influence of deregulated c-myc expression. Our objectives in the present work, therefore, were (i) to identify the viral gene expressed in Wp-restricted but not Latency I infection, that was responsible for this large increment in apoptosis protection, and (ii) to determine whether the effect was unique to an EBNA2-deleted virus acting in the context of a BL cell or might be highlighting a Wp-associated function that is a natural feature of wild-type virus infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The standard Latency I BL cell lines, Rael-BL, Sav-BL, Kem-BL and Akata-BL, and the Wp-restricted BL cell lines, Sal-BL, Oku-BL and Ava-BL, have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, as have the Awia-BL cell line and derived single cell clones (EBV-negative, Latency I and Wp-restricted) and the Awia-LCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have previously shown that the cell death being induced in this system is largely via apoptosis, involving caspase cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, the Wp-restricted cells are resistant to triggering doses (10 &#x000b5;g/ml anti-IgM, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml ionomycin) that induce widespread death in Latency I and EBV-negative cells. By comparison, the protection being offered by Latency I infection in such assays is much less marked, with differential survival of Latency I compared to EBV-negative clones only being seen as a partial effect at lower anti-IgM and ionomycin doses. Such results strongly suggested that one or more of the viral genes that were exclusive to the Wp-restricted form of infection were responsible for a pronounced increment in cell survival capacity. Referring back to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the obvious candidates in that respect were the EBNA3 proteins and/or the predicted product of a truncated EBNA-LP coding sequence (i.e. containing the repeat domains encoded by the W1 and W2 exons, but lacking the unique domains encoded by the Y1 and Y2 exons that are always removed by the deletion). In that regard, while Wp-restricted BL lines and clones are consistently EBNA3-positive, many lack detectable expression of EBNA-LP yet still retain strong apoptosis resistance in the anti-IgM and ionomycin assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, even though truncated EBNA-LP has been associated with anti-apoptotic effects in some systems through an interaction with protein phosphatase PP2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Garibal1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, it could not be responsible for the global apoptosis protection observed in Wp-restricted BLs.

Thereafter expression of the gene of choice can be induced in a dose-dependent manner by addition of dox. At the same time, dox-dependent co-induction of GFP allows one to distinguish the plasmid-positive cells by FACS staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Note, we have confirmed that GFP and the inserted EBV gene of interest are co-expressed in the same cells following induction of the bi-directional promoter with dox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000341.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).

To counter the possibility that BHRF1 expression in Wp-restricted BL lines simply reflected the presence of a few cells spontaneously entering lytic cycle, we screened these same lines by QRT-PCR assay for transcription of the immediate early lytic gene BZLF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and by immunoblotting for BZLF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), both sensitive indicators of lytic cycle activity. There was no evidence of such activity, strongly suggesting that BHRF1 is indeed being expressed as a latent protein in Wp-restricted BL cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Inducible BHRF1 expression protects Latency I BL cells from apoptosis</title><p>We then asked whether expressing appropriate levels of BHRF1 protein in Latency I BL cells would be sufficient to confer the marked resistance to apoptotic triggers characteristic of Wp-restricted BL cells. In this regard, recent work has identified three EBV miRNAs whose expression is associated with BHRF1 transcription and whose coding sequences lie close to, but outside, the BHRF1 protein-coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Pfeffer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Cai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Xing1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, to avoid any possible contribution from these or other as-yet-undiscovered miRNAs from this region, the following experiments used an expression construct containing only the BHRF1 cDNA sequence and, as a control, the same construct with a mutation in the initial methionine codon (mut-BHRF1). These constructs were cloned into the dox-regulatable vector and introduced into two Latency I BL lines, Akata-BL and Sav-BL. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g004">Figure 4A</xref> confirms induction of BHRF1 protein expression in Akata-BL cells carrying the wild-type BHRF1 coding sequence; note that with an inducing dose of 1 ng/ml dox, BHRF1 expression was similar to that seen in the Wp-restricted Awia-BL clones whereas, at 1 &#x000b5;g/ml dox, it approached the much higher levels seen in EBV lytic cycle. These BHRF1 transfectants, plus control transfectants carrying either the mut-BHRF1 sequence or an empty vector and also the previously described EBNA3A, 3B, 3C Akata-BL transfectants, were then exposed to different dox concentrations before assaying for sensitivity to a 5 &#x000b5;g/ml ionomycin challenge.

Equally efficient protection from ionomycin- and anti-IgM-induced apoptosis was also mediated by BHRF1 in the Sav-BL cell line (data not shown). To ensure that this effect of BHRF1 was also apparent in an EBV-negative BL cell background, we generated the same panel of transfectants in EBV-loss Akata-BL cells and obtained an exactly similar pattern of results, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000341.s004">Figure S4A</xref>.

In view of the low levels of BHRF1 detected by immunoblotting, we sought to confirm protein expression by another method.

Note that this recognition required <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (rather than antigen acquired from the virus preparation) since DR4-positive B cells assayed immediately after overnight exposure to the virus were not recognised (data not shown). To further check that the BHRF1 effectors were specific, we carried out an equivalent experiment this time using a recombinant EBV (BHRF1KO) in which the BHRF1 gene has been inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Altmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because all of the above experiments had involved recombinant viral strains, we then repeated the work on cells freshly infected with wild-type virus and obtained a similar pattern of results whether assaying for BHRF1 expression by transcription, by immunoblotting or by T cell detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000341.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Given that Wp has been shown to remain constitutively active at a low level in all LCLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Hutchings1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Elliott1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, we went on to ask whether latent BHRF1 expression might persist in the longer term. LCLs were therefore established from a range of donors using both wild-type and BZKO virus strains, then assayed after 2&#x02013;4 months in culture for latent BHRF1 transcripts, as well as for representative early (BMLF1) and late (gp350) lytic cycle RNAs. Latent BHRF1-spliced transcripts were consistently detected in all LCLs, whether transformed with wild-type or BZKO virus; data from the Y2-BHRF1 QRT-PCR assay are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; results from the W2-BHRF1 assay were very similar (data not shown). Sequencing of the W2-BHRF1 RT-PCR products confirmed that they did indeed represent RNAs with the predicted W2-Y1-Y2-BHRF1 splice structure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000341.s003">Figure S3</xref>). By contrast BMLF1 and gp350 transcription was only detected in LCLs carrying wild-type virus, reflecting the presence in these lines of a small percentage of cells spontaneously entering lytic cycle. Interestingly, in all the LCLs, residual Wp activity correlated well with latent BHRF1 transcript levels. However these levels were lower than those seen in freshly-infected cells and, accordingly, BHRF1 protein expression in BZKO LCLs was often at or below the borderline of detectability by immunoblotting (data not shown). However, we reproducibly could detect endogenous expression of the BHRF1 protein in both BZKO and wild-type LCLs by CD4&#x0002b; T cell assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000341-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows the results of such assays conducted on pairs of LCLs generated from three different donors; note that these donors were chosen because they were positive both for HLA-DR4, the restricting allele for the BHRF1-specific T cells, and for HLA-DR15, the restricting allele for a CD4&#x0002b; T cell clone specific for gp350, a late lytic cycle protein. As expected, only wild-type LCLs with some cells in lytic cycle could be recognised by the gp350-specific effectors. However, BHRF1-specific CD4&#x0002b; T cells consistently recognised both the wild-type and the BZKO LCLs at remarkably high levels, up to 33&#x00025; of that seen on cells pre-pulsed with cognate peptide.</p><fig id="ppat-1000341-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000341.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>BHRF1 expression in LCLs transformed with either wild-type or BZKO rEBV.</title><p>(A) Gene expression analysis using QRT-PCR assays to detect Wp-initiated, Cp-initiated, and Y2-BHRF1 latent cycle transcripts, the BMLF1 early lytic cycle transcript and the gp350 late lytic cycle transcript in LCLs transformed either with wild-type EBV or the lytic cycle-deficient BZKO virus.

The fact that this is also accompanied by a marked increase in the tumor cell's resistance to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> immediately helps to explain why such a rare virus mutant had been captured within a disproportionately large number of tumors. This, in turn, greatly strengthens the argument <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> that EBV's role in BL pathogenesis is anti-apoptotic rather than growth-promoting. Here we show that this marked resistance is mediated by Wp-driven expression of the viral bcl2 homologue, BHRF1, a protein hitherto mainly associated with the virus lytic cycle. Furthermore we find that the Wp/BHRF1 connection, though discovered in the context of a mutant virus in BL cells, is also an integral feature of normal B cell infection with wild-type virus. This link with Wp not only explains the burst of BHRF1 expression observed in B cells immediately post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Altmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> but has also led to the finding that BHRF1 remains constitutively expressed as a latent protein in all EBV-transformed LCLs.</p><p>We initially focused on the EBNA3 proteins as the most likely mediators of protection from anti-IgM- and ionomycin-induced apoptosis since, at the time, these were the only viral antigens consistently found in Wp-restricted and not in Latency I BL cells. Furthermore in a recent report where EBV-negative BL cells had been stably infected with recombinant viruses (rEBVs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Anderton1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, the protection offered by wild-type rEBV infection against cell death induced by nocodazole (which disrupts mitotic spindles), cisplatin (a DNA cross-linking agent) and roscovitine (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) was lost with virus strains from which either the EBNA3A or EBNA3C gene had been deleted, suggesting that EBNA3A and 3C can act cooperatively to influence the BL phenotype. As a preliminary to the present study, we performed similar infection experiments with EBNA3-knockout viruses on several EBV-negative BL backgrounds but, in our hands, the apoptosis assay results on infected lines proved difficult to interpret because such protocols do not faithfully reproduce Wp-restricted latency. Thus, after the drug selection that is required to establish stable infectants, the selected cells expressed variable levels of viral and cellular anti-apoptotic proteins, namely LMP1 and bcl2, that are never seen in Wp-restricted BL lines (G.L. Kelly, unpublished results). This emphasised the importance of establishing a more controlled experimental system in which to study the effects of specific latent antigens on the apoptosis phenotype. We therefore turned to a novel ori-p-based vector system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Bornkamm1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> that allows candidate genes, alone or in combination, to be introduced into Latency I BL lines in silent form and then expression induced to physiologic or supra-physiologic levels by graded doses of dox. This avoids subjecting cells to any drug selection prior to apoptosis assays, and has the added advantage that both vector-positive and control cells exist within the same culture, the former being identified by dox-induction of GFP from the same vector. Using this system, we induced expression of EBNA3A, EBNA3B and/or EBNA3C in two different Latency I cell backgrounds and in an EBV-negative BL backgound, then assayed these cells for sensitivity to triggers of apoptosis (anti-IgM and/or ionomycin) known to distinguish between Latency I and Wp-restricted BL cells. We saw no protection by the EBNA3 proteins, whether expressed individually or together, and whether induced at physiologic levels or much higher.</p><p>We therefore began to search for other possible mediators of the anti-apoptotic effect, starting from the observation that all cases of BL presenting with a Wp-restricted pattern of gene expression carried an EBNA2 gene-deleted virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Close inspection of the different deletions found in individual Wp-restricted tumors showed that each placed a copy of the Wp promoter immediately upstream of the gene encoding BHRF1, a viral bcl2 homologue hitherto thought to be expressed predominantly in lytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Pearson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed a W2-BHRF1-spliced RNA could be amplified from all Wp-restricted BL cell lines tested, but never from Latency I lines in which Wp was silent. Moreover a BHRF1 protein could be detected by immunoblotting in all Wp-restricted lines, though at levels much weaker than seen in lytic cycle. Interestingly BHRF1 protein expression and levels of Wp-initiated and W2-BHRF1-spliced transcripts were lower in Awia-BL than in other Wp-restricted lines, perhaps reflecting the single EBV genome copy number in Wp-restricted Awia-BL clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kelly4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These results implied that, if ectopic expression of BHRF1 were to explain the apoptosis resistance of these cells, the protein must be active at much lower concentrations than hitherto appreciated. Thus earlier studies had shown that BHRF1 can protect B cells from apoptosis induced by a number of different triggers including growth factor withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Henderson1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, TRAIL death receptor signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Kawanishi1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, &#x003b3; irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-McCarthy1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such experiments frequently involved vectors giving high level expression. We therefore used the dox-inducible vector system to express BHRF1 in Latency I BL lines at levels ranging from that seen in the Awia-BL clones up to those typical of lytic infection. Remarkably, BHRF1 was fully protective against anti-IgM- and ionomycin-induced apoptosis even at the very lowest level, strongly supporting the view that BHRF1 expressed as a latent protein from the Wp promoter is responsible for the apoptosis resistance of Wp-restricted BLs.</p><p>We then went on to ask whether the Wp/BHRF1 connection was unique to the EBNA2-deleted viruses selected for in BL pathogenesis or a hitherto-unrecognised facet of Wp usage in wild-type virus infections. This latter possibility was raised by a recent study showing that BHRF1 was expressed in the first few days following B cell infection with wild-type virus and that this was important for optimal transformation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Altmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. There the transient expression of BHRF1 and of a second viral bcl2 family member BALF1, which together appear to protect recently-infected B cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Altmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, was ascribed to opportunistic transcription from the virus genome following its delivery to the cell nucleus as linear unmethylated DNA. However we found that BHRF1 expression in recently-infected cells was temporally linked to Wp activity and to the detectability of BHRF1 transcripts passing through W2 and Y2 upstream exons. Thus, transcript levels measured by the total Wp, W2-BHRF1 and Y2-BHRF1 QRT-PCR assays all peaked around 12 hrs post-infection and then started to decline as promoter usage switched from Wp to the upstream Cp promoter. These findings suggest that BHRF1 expression is a specific consequence of Wp activation in newly-infected cells and not simply opportunistic transcription from an unmethylated virus genome.</p><p>Finally, given recent work showing that Wp is never completely eclipsed by Cp in growth-transforming infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Hutchings1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Elliott1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined established LCLs for evidence of BHRF1 expression. Both W2-containing and Y2-containing BHRF1 transcripts were consistently detected, whether cells had been transformed with wild-type or lytic cycle-deficient (BZKO) virus. Interestingly some of the earliest analyses of EBV transcription, including work on the tightly latent IB4 LCL, had isolated rare cDNA clones that included W1,W2 and BHRF1 sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Bodescot1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Pfitzner1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the apparent absence of detectable BHRF1 as a latent cycle protein, the significance of the above findings remained obscure. With the advent of more sensitive enhanced chemiluminescent methods for immunoblot detection, we now find that BHRF1 protein is consistently detectable in recently-infected B cells (at times immediately following the peak of Wp activity) and is often just detectable at trace levels in immunoblots of established, tightly-latent, LCLs. The possibility of confirming these observations using T cells, rather than an antibody, as the probe came with the description of CD4&#x0002b; T cells specific for a defined BHRF1 peptide epitope that recognise target cells endogenously expressing cognate antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Landais1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we used the greater sensitivity of these BHRF1-specific CD4&#x0002b; T cells to show that the protein is indeed constitutively expressed in all established LCLs, even in lines devoid of lytically-infected cells. This puts BHRF1 in a special category of EBV antigens that straddle the lytic/latent divide. Thus it is abundantly expressed from its own promoter in early lytic cycle and also constitutively expressed from a latent cycle promoter in growth-transforming infections.</p><p>Setting the present work in its wider context, it is now known that herpesviruses from several different genera have acquired bcl2-homologous genes during their evolution, and express these genes during lytic virus replication, thereby extending survival of the infected cell and maximising virus production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Polster1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Cuconati1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of EBV, and presumably the other gamma-1-herpesviruses of Old World primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Rivailler1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, the vbcl2 homologue has also been recruited as part of the B cell growth-transforming programme that is unique to these viruses and appears to be important in virus colonisation of the na&#x000ef;ve host. This has been achieved by placing BHRF1 under a promoter, Wp, that both initiates transformation and remains constitutively active at some level in transformed cells. While the Wp/BHRF1 connection increases the overall efficiency of B cell transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Altmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, it also brings the risk that in other situations inappropriate activation of Wp will lead to unscheduled BHRF1 expression and enhanced survival of the affected cell. We suggest that this is indeed the case in the subset of endemic BLs studied here, where the presence of an EBNA2-deleted virus genome results in high Wp activity and constitutive BHRF1 expression. This draws a direct parallel between the pathogenesis of EBV-positive BL and that seen in mouse models of c-myc-driven lymphomagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Hemann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000341-Egle1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, where the drive towards full malignancy occurs only when a target cell expressing a deregulated c-myc oncogene acquires complementary changes that counteract c-myc-driven apoptosis. The present work suggests that, in a subset of EBV-positive BLs, the complementary factor can be BHRF1. In so doing, it provides the first evidence implicating a herpesvirus bcl2 protein in viral oncogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000341.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Latent antigen expression and sensitivity to cell death triggers among Awia-BL clones.
