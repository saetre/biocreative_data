However, few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms through which such important function is exerted. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme that synthesizes long-chain fatty acids and is involved in both embryogenesis and cancer, has been recently proposed as a direct target of p53 family members, including p63 and p73. Here we show that knockdown of either total or &#x00394;N-specific p63 isoforms in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC9) or immortalized prostate epithelial (iPrEC) cells caused a decrease in cell viability by inducing apoptosis without affecting the cell cycle. p63 silencing significantly reduced both the expression and the activity of FASN. Importantly, stable overexpression of either FASN or myristoylated AKT (myr-AKT) was able to partially rescue cells from cell death induced by p63 silencing. FASN induced AKT phosphorylation and a significant reduction in cell viability was observed when FASN-overexpressing SCC9 cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor after p63 knockdown, indicating that AKT plays a major role in FASN-mediated survival. Activated AKT did not cause any alteration in the FASN protein levels but induced its activity, suggesting that the rescue from apoptosis documented in the p63-silenced cells expressing myr-AKT cells may be partially mediated by FASN. Finally, we demonstrated that p63 and FASN expression are positively associated in clinical squamous cell carcinoma samples as well as in the developing prostate. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that FASN is a functionally relevant target of p63 and is required for mediating its pro-survival effects.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>p63 (TP73L/TP63) is a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and represents the most ancient member of the p53 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Osada1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the presence of two promoters, p63 encodes two major classes of proteins: those containing a transactivating (TA) domain homologous to the one present in p53 (i.e. TAp63), and those that lack the TA domain (i.e. &#x00394;Np63) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Schmale1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, alternate splicing at the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) generates at least three p63 variants (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;) in each class.</p><p>Although p53 and p63 share high sequence and structural similarities, there are striking differences between their function and expression profiles. In physiological conditions, the expression of p63 is mostly restricted to the basal cell compartment of both stratified and glandular epithelia, with &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; being the predominant isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-DiComo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The analysis of p63-deficient mice unequivocally demonstrated that p63 plays a very critical role in the development of epithelial organs/tissues, including the epidermis and other squamous epithelia, salivary, lachrymal, mammary, and prostate glands and the bladder urothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Signoretti1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Signoretti2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Mills1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence that p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells both in the thymus epithelium and the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Senoo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to p53, p63 is rarely mutated in human tumors, and its role in cancer appears to be complex and needs to be further clarified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Urist1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Flores1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Current data suggest that TA and &#x00394;N isoforms might have opposite effects and support a role for &#x00394;Np63 in promoting tumorigenesis.</p><p>&#x00394;Np63 is highly expressed in up to 80&#x00025; of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), as well as in malignancies of other squamous epithelia origin, including lung and esophageal cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Hibi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Choi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Its overexpression is frequently associated with the amplification of the genomic locus at 3q27 that harbors the p63 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Hibi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it has been proposed that aberrant p63 expression may be an early event in the pathogenesis of HNSCC, as extension of p63 expression is observed from normal basal cells into suprabasal levels in mucosal specimens displaying dysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Choi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ectopic expression of &#x00394;Np63 isoforms has been initially reported to inhibit p53 transactivation, leading to the early speculation that overexpression of &#x00394;Np63 might simply be a mechanism to inactivate p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Chan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, p63 inhibition has been shown to induce apoptosis by upregulating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Noxa</italic> through a mechanism that is independent of the p53 status of the cells but requires p73 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Rocco1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Most importantly, subsequent studies have provided evidence that &#x00394;Np63 also functions by directly activating the transcription of specific target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Barbieri1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms mediating p63 function both during development and tumorigenesis remain to be fully characterized.</p><p>Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a multifunctional enzyme that is essential for the endogenous synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from its precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Wakil1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, has been recently shown to be a direct target of &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-DErchia1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the increasing evidence that FASN is critical for cell survival and might act as a metabolic oncogene, we studied the functional relevance of FASN regulation by p63. We find that the pro-survival activity of p63 activity is significantly mediated by FASN in both transformed and immortalized epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All research involving human subjects has been conducted on anonimized, discarded tissues collected from patients during the course of their therapy.

These results suggest that the resistance to apoptosis conferred by FASN overexpression in p63-silenced cells could be at least in part due to activation of AKT signaling. In an attempt to better understand whether AKT plays a role in this process, we studied the effects of AKT inhibition in FASN overexpressing cells silenced for p63 expression. We observed a significant reduction in cell viability when FASN-SCC9 cells were treated with a specific AKT inhibitor (AKTi, 3 &#x000b5;M) after p63 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005877-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, AKT signaling appears to play a role in FASN-mediated survival.</p><p>Overexpression of myr-AKT or blockade of PI3K/AKT pathway (LY and AKT inhibitor) in the same cell line significantly modulated phospho-AKT levels but did not cause any alteration in the FASN protein levels, suggesting that AKT does not play a central role in the regulation of FASN expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005877.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Surprisingly, however, FASN activity was significantly increased by overexpression of myr-AKT and decreased by AKT inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005877.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This result raises the possibility of post-translational regulation of FASN by AKT and suggests that the rescue from apoptosis documented in the p63-silenced cells expressing myr-AKT may be partially mediated by FASN signaling. Moreover, this finding indicates that the reduction in viability caused by AKTi treatment in FASN-SCC9 cells could involve the inhibition of FASN activity. Of note, the effects of AKTi treatment on FASN-SCC9 cells appeared to be largely independent of p63 levels (i.e. similar reduction in viability was seen in p63-silenced and control FASN-SCC9 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005877-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Since ATKi inhibits both AKT and FASN activities, the observation that p63 levels have limited impact on the viability of FASN-SCC9 cells treated with ATKi is consistent with the hypothesis that AKT and FASN are important mediators of p63 pro-survival function.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>p63 and FASN expression are positively associated in human SCC tissues</title><p>Our cell-based assays indicate that FASN is a functionally relevant target of p63 in SCC cells.

The observation that the pro-survival role of p63 in the prostate basaloid iPrEC cells depends on FASN, prompted us to investigate a possible association between p63 and FASN expression in the developing prostate. To this end, transversal sections of the UGS from a mouse embryo at day E18.5 were double-immunostained for p63 and FASN. Co-localization of the two proteins was observed in the lower and intermediate layers of the UGS epithelium as well as in the prostate buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005877-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that FASN may be an important mediator of p63 function during prostate development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is increasing evidence that p63, and specifically &#x00394;Np63, plays a critical role in both development and tumorigenesis by promoting epithelial cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yang2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Mills1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Senoo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Hibi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Lopardo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Koster1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, very few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms through which such important function might be exerted. In this respect, it has been suggested that &#x00394;Np63 counteracts apoptosis by repressing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and by activating a cell adhesion program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Wu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Barbieri1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Carroll1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we find that p63 is indispensable for the survival of both iPrEC and SCC9 cells and provide substantial evidence that this process is mediated by the regulation of lipid metabolism, and specifically the function of FASN. Our findings show that p63 not only induces the expression of FASN at both the mRNA and the protein level but also enhances its enzymatic activity. Most importantly, stable overexpression of FASN is able to rescue cells from cell death induced by p63 downregulation.</p><p>FASN is a key enzyme that synthesizes long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and is essential for embryonic development. Indeed, FASN knockout mice and most of the FASN heterozygous mice die in utero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Chirala1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The up-regulation of FASN expression in numerous types of cancer and its association with poor outcome have long suggested its role in human malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Visca1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Agostini1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with this hypothesis, inhibition of the FASN pathway by either FASN inhibitors including C75 or Cerulenin, or by silencing FASN expression with RNAi result in G1 arrest and/or induction of apoptosis in various cancers cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Pizer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, recent findings from our group indicate that FASN functions as a metabolic oncogene in prostate cancer by inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Migita1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the newly uncovered regulation of FASN activity by p63 establishes a novel functional link between this p53 family member and cellular metabolism. Moreover, it suggests that maintenance of fatty acid synthesis is one of the mechanisms through which p63 acts as a pro-survival molecule in both development and cancer.</p><p>D'Erchia et al. recently reported that FASN harbors two p53 responsive elements (REs) in its promoter site, and that TAp73&#x003b1;, and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, but not p53, TAp73&#x003b2; or TAp63&#x003b1; directly bind to these elements and modulate expression of FASN at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-DErchia1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. These data indicate that FASN is a direct target of &#x00394;Np63 and are in agreement with our observation that p63 modulates both FASN transcript and protein levels. Moreover, in our experiments silencing of either total or &#x00394;Np63 isoforms produced overlapping cell phenotypes, implying that &#x00394;Np63 is the major player in controlling cell survival and FASN activity in epithelial cells.</p><p>The finding that p63 silencing decreases phosphorylation of AKT and of its downstream target S6 suggested that signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in p63 function. This hypothesis was confirmed by the demonstration that ectopic expression of myr-AKT conferred protection from apoptosis induced by p63 loss. Our results are in line with those recently reported by Ogawa et al. demonstrating that activation of the AKT pathway is necessary for &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; protection against UV induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A positive feedback loop between FASN and AKT activation has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Wang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-VandeSande1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed that FASN sustains AKT activation, raising the possibility that AKT could function downstream of FASN in promoting cell survival. In line with this hypothesis, we found that blocking of the AKT pathway altered FASN-mediated rescue of cell death in the context of p63 silencing, Thus, AKT appears to be a critical mediator of FASN signaling, at least in our model system.</p><p>Activated AKT has been shown to increase the expression of FASN in several types of tumors including ovarian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Wang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-VandeSande2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway with LY 294002 has been shown to reduce the expression of FASN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-VandeSande1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, there is evidence that the transcription activator SREBP-1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c), which is a known regulator of FASN expression, is modulated by both AKT and MAPK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Wang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-VandeSande1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Porstmann1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Menendez2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Bandyopadhyay1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, we didn't observe any significant changes in FASN protein levels either by activating or blocking of the AKT pathway. Thus, the effects of the AKT pathway in regulating FASN levels might be cell type specific. In spite of this result, it is notable that forced expression of myr-AKT did significantly increase FASN activity, suggesting that additional and perhaps more general effects of the AKT pathway on post-transcriptional modification of FASN may be involved.</p><p>Overall, the findings that FASN induces AKT phosphorylation and is activated downstream of AKT highlight the presence of a positive-feedback loop between FASN and ATK signaling. Additional experiments are required to unravel the molecular mechanisms through which AKT signaling modulates FASN enzymatic activity without affecting its protein levels. It will also be important to determine whether p63 can induce AKT activation through mechanisms other than FASN signaling.</p><p>Overexpression of FASN as well as p63 has been previously demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas from various organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Hibi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Parsa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Choi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Menendez3">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of the hypothesis that p63 function is mediated by FASN, we observed that the expression of FASN and p63 were positively associated in human HNSCC tissues. Interestingly, FASN expression levels appeared to be highest in non-keratinizing poorly differentiated tumors with basaloid morphology that also expressed very high p63 levels. Moreover, in a number of well- to moderately-differentiated HNSCCs, p63 and FASN tended to co-localize in the least differentiated cells at the periphery of the lesion while more differentiated cells in the central part of the tumor nodules were mostly negative for the expression of both proteins. While these results are compatible with current data indicating that FASN is under the control of multiple oncogenic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Menendez2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-Menendez3">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005877-KumarSinha1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, they seem to support a model in which p63 sustains FASN expression in the undifferentiated stem cell-like population of human HNSCC.
