Comprehensive identification of mRGCs and knowledge of their specific roles in image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses are currently lacking. We used a Cre-dependent GFP expression strategy in mice to genetically label the mRGCs. This revealed that only a subset of mRGCs express enough immunocytochemically detectable levels of melanopsin. We also used a Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) expression approach to express the DTR in mRGCs. mRGCs develop normally, but can be acutely ablated upon diphtheria toxin administration. The mRGC-ablated mice exhibited normal outer retinal function. However, they completely lacked non-image forming visual responses such as circadian photoentrainment, light modulation of activity, and PLR. These results point to the mRGCs as the site of functional integration of the rod/cone and melanopsin phototransduction pathways and as the primary anatomical site for the divergence of image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses in mammals.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rod/cone photoreceptors of the outer retina signal via multisynaptic pathways to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the inner retina.

Subsequent acute cell ablation with local or systemic DT administration circumvents any potential developmental compensation. Systemic DT injection in the adult mice with DTR expressing mRGCs triggers a profound loss of mRGCs. The mRGC-ablated mice lose non-image forming visual responses while maintaining largely intact image-forming functions. This demonstrates a central role of the mRGCs as the site of integration of melanopsin and rod/cone initiated photoresponses for generating adaptive light responses in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fluorescent tagging of mRGCs</title><p>To comprehensively tag mRGCs with transcriptionally active <italic>melanopsin</italic> locus, we generated a mouse line which carries a Cre recombinase and a Cre-dependent <italic>&#x003b2;Tau</italic>-Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) expression cassette knocked-in to the native <italic>melanopsin</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002451-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

From immunostaining, parallel loss of circadian photoentrainment and other adaptive ocular photoresponses, it is clear that DT can successfully cross the blood-retina barrier in sufficient quantity to trigger ablation of DTR expressing cells. However, we found up to 10&#x00025; of melanopsin expressing cells escaped cell death due to potential stochastic noise in CRE or DTR expression. It is interesting to note that these surviving cells are unable to generate AOPs. This implies that the SCN and OPN require a strong photic input to reset intrinsic activity. Alternatively, the surviving cells could represent a distinct mRGC population that does not play a role in relaying light information to the SCN or OPN.</p><p>Our finding that mRGCs do not overtly disrupt image-forming processes implies a divergence of signals at the level of the retinal ganglion cells. Although the tests employed here did not find any profound loss of image forming function of the retina in acute tests, we cannot rule out the possibility that mRGCs play a subtle direct or indirect role in sculpting the image-forming function of the retina.

Our results show a central non-redundant role for mRGCs in the relay of photic input to two brain regions that generate adaptive photoresponses. Rod/cone and melanopsin initiated photo signals converge at the level of the mRGCs before relaying to oscillator neurons in the SCN. Similarly, mRGCs appear to serve as the sole functional relay for photic input to the OPN. These results highlight an important cellular design feature of the mammalian circadian system. The mammalian clock, like that of plants, invertebrates and lower vertebrates, uses multiple, mutually compensating photopigments to adapt to the ambient light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002451-Panda4">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mammalian circadian time keeping system recruits non-cell autonomous multiple photoreceptors, including rod, cones and melanopsin. The complete loss of light entrainment in mRGC ablated mice firmly establishes a unique mammalian-specific cellular network design to integrate light information from these photopigments to the circadian clock. The mRGCs in this design serve as the principal site of signal integration and therefore, have now emerged as a unique cellular target for therapeutic intervention in circadian clock related disorders. The complete loss of non-image forming photoresponses also highlights the role of mRGCs as the principal cellular node where photic information for image-forming and non-image forming responses diverge.</p><p>During the course of this study, another manuscript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002451-Guler1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> describing specific ablation of mRGCs was published. That study employed direct expression of an attenuated diphtheria toxin from the melanopsin locus, which caused slow degeneration of the mRGCs over several months, as assessed by the loss of a Tau:LacZ transgene expression or melanopsin immunostaining.

After three washes in PBS, the retinas were incubated in a 1:5,000 dilution of rabbit anti-OPN4 antiserum (against a peptide consisting of the 15 N-terminal amino acids of mouse melanopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002451-Pulivarthy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>) or in 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Cat# A11122, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the blocking solution for overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and rinsed with PBS. Melanopsin immunoreactivity was visualized with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Cat# 711-165-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:20, Cat# 401314, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in blocking solution. Finally, retinas were washed with PBS and mounted with PermaFluor (Cat# IM0752, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Fluorescent images were captured using an Olympus Fluoview500 confocal microscope or Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. For Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining, eyes were removed and eyecups were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde for 2 h, washed three times with PBS, and embedded in paraffin. Five micron thick paraffin sections were used for H&#x00026;E staining. Stained slides were visualized under a Leica microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Anterograde tracing with cholera toxin</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (70 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and one drop each of 1&#x00025; tropicamide and 0.5&#x00025; proparacaine (Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Tampa, FL) were applied to their eyes. An incision was made with a 30 gauge needle below the limbus region and 1 &#x003bc;l of 1&#x00025; Cholera Toxin-B subunit (CTB) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat# C34775, Invitrogen, CA) was injected into the vitreous. After 48 h, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine (70 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), perfused with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in 1&#x000d7;PBS.

The eyes were applied with 1&#x00025; tropicamide, 0.5&#x00025; proparacaine and Genteal lubricant eye gel (CIBA vision, Duluth, GA, USA). Electrodes were connected under dim red light. ERGs were recorded from both eyes with an ERG system (Model LE-2000, Tomey, Nagoya, Japan). White LED light embedded in contact lens recording electrodes were used as light sources. ERG recordings were done following the standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iscev.org/standards/erg1999.html">http://www.iscev.org/standards/erg1999.html</ext-link>).

Then mice were further dark adapted for 3 min and maximal combined (rod and cone) response and oscillatory potential were determined from the average of responses to four flashes of 6,000 cd.m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000d7;0.5 msec at &#x0003e;10 sec inter-stimulus interval.

Half of a 31 cm length&#x000d7;45 cm width&#x000d7;50 cm tall clear acrylic box had a black and white checkerboard pattern on the top (the &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; side) and the other side had a clear top (the &#x0201c;unsafe&#x0201d; side/cliff side). The unsafe side had a checkerboard pattern on the bottom to give an illusion of added depth. Black paper was placed on the inside of the walls to reduce reflections. A block of 31 cm length&#x000d7;3.5 cm width&#x000d7;2.5 cm height was placed at the center of the box to separate these two sides. The mouse was placed on the block and allowed to make a spontaneous step down between the safe side and the unsafe side. Data was measured as positive when the mouse chose to step down onto the horizontal checkered surface (the safe side) and as negative onto the clear side (the unsafe side). Each mouse was tested for 10 consecutive trials. Fifty percent positive indicated that the mouse moved off the ridge onto the two sides with random chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>PLR</title><p>PLR was assessed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002451-VanGelder1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> with some modification. Mice were dark adapted for at least an hour prior to PLR assessment. Unanaesthetized mice were hand restrained with the left eye apposed to one of the outlets of an integrating sphere. The pupil of right eye was video monitored under infrared light with a consumer grade digital video camera. An additional &#x0002b;2 diaptor lens and an infrared filter were fitted to the light path of the camera to improve the image quality. After collecting images of dark adapted pupils, the contralateral eye was exposed to light from the integrating sphere. Light from a 300 Watt Xenon Arc lamp light source (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) was filtered, collimated and delivered to the integrating sphere through a liquid light guide. An inline 470 nm filter, a filter wheel with a series of neutral density filters, and a Lambda 10-3 optical filter changer with SmartShutter&#x02122; were used to control the spectral quality, intensity and duration of light. Light intensity was measured with a Melles Griot power meter. Video images of pupil constriction were analyzed by ViewPoint EyeTracker&#x02122; software (Arrington Research Inc., Scottsdale, AZ). Dark adapted pupil area prior to light pulse and pupil area after 30 sec of light were measured and pupil constriction was defined as 1-(dark adapted pupil width)^2/(pupil width after 30 sec of light)^2. The squares come in to account for the calculation of pupil area. Pupil area constriction was plotted against the log of irradiance. Data was fitted to a sigmoidal dose response curve with the lower asymptote fixed to y&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0 using Origin lab 8 software.</p><p>For tracking the gradual changes in PLR response following DT injection, pupil area constrictions over 8 days were normalized to maximum constriction taken as 100&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Locomotor activity measurement</title><p>Daily locomotor activity of mice individually housed in wheel running cages was measured as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002451-Siepka1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Typically, 6&#x02013;10 week old mice were individually housed in wheel running cages placed inside light tight boxes with independent illumination. During the light phase, the mice received &#x0223c;150 lux of white light from fluorescent light source. Wheel running activity in 1 min bins was continuously collected and later analyzed by Clocklab software (Actimetrics, Evanston, IL, USA). All routine animal husbandry practices during the dark phase were performed under dim red light.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Ari Waisman for providing <italic>R26<sup>iDTR/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mouse strain, Van M.
