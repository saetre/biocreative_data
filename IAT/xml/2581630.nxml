In particular, SP-D appears to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling functions. At present, the molecular mechanisms involved in switching between these functions remain unclear. SP-D differs in its quaternary structure from SP-A and the other members of the collectin family, such as C1q, in that it forms large multimers held together by the N-terminal domain, rather than aligning the triple helix domains in the traditional &#x0201c;bunch of flowers&#x0201d; arrangement. There are two cysteine residues within the hydrophobic N terminus of SP-D that are critical for multimer assembly and have been proposed to be involved in stabilizing disulfide bonds. Here we show that these cysteines exist within the reduced state in dodecameric SP-D and form a specific target for <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation both in vitro and by endogenous, pulmonary derived nitric oxide (NO) within a rodent acute lung injury model. <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation is becoming increasingly recognized as an important post-translational modification with signaling consequences. The formation of <italic>S-</italic>nitrosothiol (SNO)-SP-D both in vivo and in vitro results in a disruption of SP-D multimers such that trimers become evident. SNO-SP-D but not SP-D, either dodecameric or trimeric, is chemoattractive for macrophages and induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The signaling capacity of SNO-SP-D appears to be mediated by binding to calreticulin/CD91. We propose that NO controls the dichotomous nature of this pulmonary collectin and that posttranslational modification by <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation causes quaternary structural alterations in SP-D, causing it to switch its inflammatory signaling role. This represents new insight into both the regulation of protein function by <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation and NO's role in innate immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cells of the lung lining secrete a microbe-binding molecule called surfactant protein D (SP-D) that helps activate the inflammatory system against invading pathogens. In the absence of infection, SP-D is important in limiting inflammation, demonstrated by the fact that mice lacking the SP-D gene have chronic inflammation and emphysema. SP-D has two structural features&#x02014;a lectin-like head domain and a collagenous tail domain&#x02014;that, respectively, inhibit and stimulate inflammation. Here we define a mechanism for generating the active &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; version of SP-D. SP-D is held together in its multimeric state by interacting cysteine residues, which are susceptible to modification by the gaseous second messenger, nitric oxide, to form <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols. In this multimeric state, the tail domains are buried, limiting the ability of SP-D to activate inflammation. <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation causes the multimers to fall apart into trimers, exposing the tail domain. <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylated SP-D induces inflammatory cell activation as determined by chemotaxis, calcium influx, and phosphorylation state. This activity is dependent upon both the <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiol and the disruption of SP-D's multimeric structure. These modifications are observed in an in vivo model of inflammation and form a critical part of the process. A model is proposed in which nitric oxide operates as a molecular switch for SP-D.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Nitric oxide is shown to control the pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of surfactant protein D by altering its quaternary structure via<italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Guo C-J, Atochina-Vasserman EN, Abramova E, Foley JP, Zaman A, et al.

How the pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of SP-D are regulated is unknown. However, it has been suggested that pro-inflammatory functions are mediated by the tail domains, via binding to CD91 and calreticulin, and anti-inflammatory by the head domains, via binding to SIRP-1&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. SP-D has a fairly complex quaternary structure in which monomers (43 kDa) are assembled into tetramers of trimers thus forming dodecamers. Dodecamers may be further assembled into large multimeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Different from SP-A, the oligomerization of SP-D results in the burial of the tail domains while the head domains are exposed. Oligomerization is dependent upon the cysteine residues at positions 15 and 20 within the N-terminal tail region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, overexpression of the mutant protein in <italic>SP-D</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> results in the appearance of activated macrophages in the airspace. These observations strongly imply that oligomerization of SP-D is critical to its control of the inflammatory response of the lung.</p><fig id="pbio-0060266-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SP-D Structure</title><p>(A) A model of SP-D structure. (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Upper panel</named-content>) The SP-D monomer (43 kDa) consists of a carbohydrate recognition domain which forms the globular head structure. This domain is connected to the collagen-like helical tail domain by a short, 30&#x02013;amino acid, neck domain. At the end of the tail domain is the amino terminus in which cysteines 15 and 20 are positioned (shown as yellow projections). (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Lower panel</named-content>) Stylized representation of SP-D multimer assembly (note tail domains are shown shortened for ease of visualization). The head and neck domains drive the aggregation of the SP-D monomer to form a trimer of &#x0223c;130 kDa. These trimers associate to form a dodecamer (&#x0223c;520 kDa). The forces holding this dodecamer together are unclear, although there is a dependency upon the amino-terminal cysteines as mutant lacking these cysteines do not form dodecamers. These dodecamers can assemble to a multimer of greater than 1 MDa. It is unclear whether the dodecamer is an essential intermediate in multimer formation. It should be noted that neither the trimer nor the dodecamer are globular proteins, due to the presence of the long collagen tail and thus under native conditions will behave as molecules with greater molecular radius.</p><p>(B) Hydropathy plot of SP-D. A Kyle Doolittle hydropathy plot for the SP-D sequence was constructed using a window size of nine residues. A positive value indicates a region of hydrophobicity.

As one can see, this is the most hydrophobic portion of the molecule.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060266.g001"/></fig><p>Cysteines 15 and 20 are located within the most hydrophobic region of the SP-D protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

We propose that SP-D is a target for NO reactivity and that such chemistry may alter the oligomeric structure of SP-D and thus regulate its inflammatory function. We examined the forces involved in maintaining the dodecameric structure of SP-D. Furthermore, we have found that SP-D is <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylated by NO both in vivo and in vitro and that this modification is associated with alterations in quaternary structure. Furthermore, we show that nitrosylation results in a functional switch, activating the pro-inflammatory capabilities of SP-D. Thus, NO-mediated modification may explain the dichotomous nature of SP-D within innate lung immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The oligomerization of SP-D into its dodecameric form is dependent upon the cysteines 15 and 20 in the hydrophobic tail of the monomer. This has led to the suggestion that the dodecamer may be held together via a series of disulfide bonds between the cysteines. To investigate this possibility, we chose to examine the reductive state of these cysteines via reaction with the alkylating agent N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, we were able to label rat recombinant SP-D (rSP-D) with NEM linked biotin; however, we were unable to label rSP-D in which the cysteines 15 and 20 had been mutated to serine (ser 15/20 SP-D). These data indicate that within the recombinant protein, these two cysteines exist at least partially within a reduced state, but that the other cysteines located in the head domain are oxidized. Examination of these two proteins by SDS-PAGE further demonstrates the nature and importance of these cysteines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). With rSP-D, SDS-PAGE in the absence of thiol reductants results in a single band at the molecular size equivalent to a trimer. Treatment with either dithiothreitol or &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol reduced rSP-D to a monomer. Interestingly ser15/20 SP-D was a monomer in SDS-PAGE analysis irrespective of thiol reduction. These data indicate that these two cysteines are critical in SP-D structure and that disulfide bonds involving them are critical in the trimeric structure but not in the dodecamer. Indeed, few inter-trimeric disulfide bonds exist in rSP-D, as shown by the single predominant band seen in nonreducing electrophoresis.</p><fig id="pbio-0060266-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Role of Cysteine Residues 15 and 20 in Formation of SP-D Trimers</title><p>(A) Recombinant rat SP-D (RrSP-D) or a mutant in which cysteines 15 and 20 have been mutated to serine (Ser15/20) were denatured under reducing (using mercaptoehtanol or dithiothreitol as the reductant) and non-reducing conditions.

Having established that these two cysteines were critically important to the dodecameric structure of SP-D and that this is not through the formation of disulfide bonds, we investigated whether they were targets for <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation. We examined both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and rSP-D following transnitrosation with <italic>S</italic>-nitrosocysteine (SNOC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g003">3</xref>B). As evidenced by the biotin-switch assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, SP-D, both within BAL and in recombinant form, was readily <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylated by SNOC. Analysis of BAL by native electrophoresis demonstrates that the multimeric/dodecameric forms are so large that they can barely enter the gel. However, following in vitro <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation of BAL from mice overexpressing SP-D or rSP-D, the size of the SP-D complex is reduced such that lower molecular weight forms are visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In parallel, we analyzed BAL from mice overexpressing SP-D by gel filtration revealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) that native SP-D exists in a complex &#x02265;1 MDa in size (corresponding to the either the dodecamer or higher-order multimers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Treatment of this BAL with SNOC reduces the complex size to below 720 kDa (corresponding to the trimer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Lower&#x02013;molecular weight SP-D (&#x0223c;120 and 50 kDa, monomer and potentially dimer, respectively) is visible with and without SNOC treatment. Further native electrophoresis of the gel filtration fractions reveals that the &#x0003e;1-MDa fraction does consist of complexes that are too large to enter the gel, such as multimers and dodecamers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, while the trimers are found in the 720-kDa fraction. The lower two fractions contain smaller forms of SP-D which may be an artifact resulting from the use of overexpressing mice. In summary, it appears that in vitro transnitrosation results in the formation of SNO-SP-D and alters the quaternary structure of SP-D such that its multimeric size is reduced.</p><fig id="pbio-0060266-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>SNO-SP-D Formation In Vitro and Its Effect on Multimerization</title><p>(A) (<italic>Top</italic>) SNO-SP-D formation in BAL.

By using a modified Boyden chamber with RAW 264.7 cells as the target, BAL and rSP-D, both before and after treatment with SNOC, were assessed for their ability to induce chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Both SNO-BAL and SNO-SP-D induced significantly greater RAW cell chemotaxis than their respective controls; furthermore, there was clearly a dose dependence to this induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g004">4</xref>B). This chemoattractant function of SNO-SP-D did not result from NO release and activation of guanylate cyclase, because the classical inhibitor ODQ, did not reduce the effect of SNO-SP-D (unpublished data). Because there are multiple potential cysteine containing proteins within BAL that could be transnitrosated by SNOC, one cannot from these data infer that the effect within BAL depends on the formation of SNO-SP-D. Therefore, the effect of SP-D immunoprecipitation upon SNO-BAL&#x02013;induced chemotaxis was examined. Removal of SNO-SP-D from SNOC treated BAL ablates the chemotactic response mediated by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

In rats, the peak inflammatory response is observed 7 d after injury. This inflammatory response resolves by day 14 and resultant fibrosis occurs around day 21. Within mice, this timeline is slightly extended with the inflammatory response extending out beyond 14 d. We examined the BAL fluid from control, saline-treated, and bleomycin-treated rats and mice for evidence of SP-D nitrosylation over the 21 d following treatment. In control and saline-treated rats, SNO-SP-D was either undetected or seen in marginal quantities; however, SNO-SP-D was readily detected following bleomycin-treatment peaking at day 2 and day 4 after bleomycin injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Therefore, SNO-SP-D formation precedes the peak inflammatory response, suggesting that nitrosylation may be an early event.

A word of caution is worthy, as one cannot confirm the effects of SP-D immunoprecipitation upon other chemotactic factors, such as cytokines, in these experiments; and thus the entire reduction observed may not result from SP-D removal.

One of the main events that occurs during the induction of chemotaxis within a macrophage is the influx of extracellular calcium. To examine whether SNO-SP-D had an effect on intracellular calcium levels, RAW cells were loaded with the calcium responsive fluorescent dye, Fura-2. Control BAL had little effect upon the intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), as there was no increase in fluorescence upon addition. However, SNO-BAL resulted in a significant calcium influx with a peak response approximately 2 min after its addition to the medium. Similar results were obtained with rSP-D, although the time constant of induction was much lower, as by 100 s, intracellular calcium levels had returned to normal. In addition to inducing chemotaxis, a predicted downstream consequence of such a calcium influx is the phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g008">Figure 8</xref>B shows that SNO-BAL from wild-type mice, but not control BAL or SNO-BAL from <italic>SP-D</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, was capable of inducing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK.

Further, they demonstrate that this nitrosylation is associated with disruption of the multimeric structure of native SP-D and that these modifications result in a pro-inflammatory signaling activity with macrophages. From these observations, we propose an extension of the model of Gardai et al. specifically for SP-D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Within this model, SP-D exists within the lung lining fluid in large multimers, such that only the head domain, the carbohydrate recognition domain, is exposed. These multimers are capable of interacting either with invading pathogens or to the cell surface receptor, SIRP-1&#x003b1;. SP-D binding to SIRP-1&#x003b1; results in suppression of p38 phosphorylation via SHP-1. Thus multimeric/dodecameric SP-D could reduce inflammatory signaling via SHP-1&#x02013;mediated inhibition of p38 and reduced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Presumably the interaction of the head domain with pathogenic molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), results in SP-D subunits, probably trimers, being pulled from the multimer resulting in tail domain exposure. Exposed tail domains are then available for interaction with CRT/CD91, resulting in activation of p38 phosphorylation and potentially NF-&#x003ba;B and its downstream inflammatory consequences. It is important to note that the data here do not address NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and this part of the model remains a proposal at this time.</p><fig id="pbio-0060266-g009" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>A Model of the Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory Functions of SP-D</title><p>Under non-inflammatory conditions, SP-D remains in large multimeric or dodecameric forms in which the tail domains remain buried.

SHP-1 activation inhibits p38 activations, potentially resulting in the blockaged of NF-&#x003ba;B action and the inhibition of infammatory function. Under inflammatory conditions the production of NO leads to the formation of SNO-SP-D and the disruption of the multimeric structure. The tail domains now become exposed and bind to calreticulin. This results in p38 phosphorylation via CD91, potentially leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Presumably other actions which result in disruption of SP-D multimeric structure may also be pro-inflammatory.</p><p>(Image credit: Kirk Moldoff)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060266.g009"/></fig><p>NO can be produced throughout the lung either from nNOS, which is present throughout the pulmonary epithelium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, or from iNOS, whose synthesis is induced in either pulmonary epithelial cells or alveolar macrophages by pro-inflammatory cytokines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of two reactive cysteines within the hydrophobic tail domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g001">Figure 1</xref>) makes SP-D a prime target for NO-mediated post-translational modification, resulting in the formation of SNO-SP-D. As a consequence of this nitrosylation the multimeric structure of SP-D is disrupted and trimers are released. The resulting exposure of the tail domains allows for interaction with CRT/CD91 and the activation of p38 phosphorylation and potentially downstream pro-inflammatory signaling. In this way, pro-inflammatory signaling of SP-D can be induced by either the presence of pathogens or chemically via NO production. Previously it has been demonstrated in hemoglobin that changes in protein structure can affect the ability of cysteine residues to be nitrosylated or not &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

We have not at this time determined whether the association of SNO-SP-D with CRT requires the presence of the NO group or if it is merely the tail domain exposure that is required. In the later instance, one can see that other chemical modifications could also result in pro-inflammatory SP-D signaling. For instance, primary oxidation of these same cysteine residues would result in sulfenic acid formation, which can reasonably be predicted to also cause multimer disassembly. In regard to this question, recombinant SP-D, which is often in the trimeric state, can induce neutrophil chemotaxis; although it should be noted that in the studies presented here recombinant SP-D had a minimal chemotactic effect upon RAW cells. Also the ser 15/20 mutant, in which the tail domains are exposed, does not induce chemotaxis implying that there is a greater level of complexity to this signaling.</p><p>In the original model of Gardai et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, which was primarily based upon studies with SP-A, the association of the collectin with a pathogen was the required step to initiate CRT binding. It was proposed that the tail domains had a low affinity for CRT and thus the aggregation of collectin molecules upon a pathogen was required to provide sufficient binding energy. Within our model, one would predict that SNO-SP-D is not required to be associated with any other macromolecule in order to bind CRT, as CRT-mediated effects can be produced by SNO-SP-D alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, it is implied within this model that the tail domain of SP-D has a higher affinity for CRT than that of SP-A. This could result from the presence of the nitrosothiol moiety upon the modified SP-D or be simply a feature of the exposed SP-D tail domain. The precise mechanism of SP-D and CRT interaction warrants further investigation.</p><p>Examination of the BAL samples from the bleomycin-treated rats and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060266-g004">Figure 4</xref>) reveals that, although nitrosylation of SP-D occurs and that there is disruption of the multimeric structure, much of the SP-D is unaffected. Therefore, one can safely assume that SP-D is binding to both SIRP-1&#x003b1; and to CRT, and that the balance of this binding determines what is the final consequence of cellulare association with SP-D. In other words, SP-D may operate as an integrator of the status of the lung lining, initiating inflammatory responses under a variety of pathological conditions, such as infection or nitrosative stress, while maintaining a quiescent state in the absence of stress. It is important to note that SP-D is only one of a number of potential target proteins that can be nitrosylated within the airway, including channel proteins, G proteins, and transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. This is of particular relevance when one considers the effects of inhaled NO, whose effects could be either pro- or anti-inflammatory, depending upon the conditions of its administration and the subject's lung. For instance, in our model, SNO-SP-D would initiate a pro-inflammatory response via NF-&#x003ba;B activation; however, SNO formation on NF-&#x003ba;B itself has been shown to inhibit activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060266-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, one can see that the potential effects of NO inhalation on pulmonary inflammation will be condition dependent.</p><p>In summary, the studies outlined here reveal that SP-D function can be controlled through post-translational modification by NO; and this modification alters the quaternary structure of SP-D by disrupting its multimeric state such that trimers are formed. In addition, the formation of SNO-SP-D trimers initiates a pro-inflammatory response through CRT/CD91 and p38 activation. This is a novel mechanism of regulation for both NO and collectins and allows for the consideration of a novel mode of action for NO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>SNO-protein synthesis.</title><p>In order to generate <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylated proteins, BAL (300 &#x003bc;g/ml of total protein) or recombinant rat SP-D (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) was exposed to L-CysNO (200 &#x003bc;M) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.
