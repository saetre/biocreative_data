Supplementing culture medium with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) partially alleviates this problem by increasing microglial yield. However, GM-CSF has also been reported to transition microglia into a dendritic cell (DC)-like phenotype and consequently, affect their immune properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Although the concentration of GM-CSF used in our protocol for mouse microglial expansion (0.5 ng/ml) is at least 10-fold less compared to doses reported to affect microglial maturation and function (&#x02265; 5 ng/ml), in this study we compared the responses of microglia derived from mixed glial cultures propagated in the presence/absence of low dose GM-CSF to establish whether this growth factor significantly altered the immune properties of microglia to diverse bacterial stimuli. These stimuli included the gram-positive pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(<italic>S. aureus</italic>) and its cell wall product peptidoglycan (PGN), a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist; the TLR3 ligand polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), a synthetic mimic of viral double-stranded RNA; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a TLR4 agonist; and the TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide (CpG-ODN), a synthetic form of bacteria/viral DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Interestingly, the relative numbers of microglia recovered from mixed glial cultures following the initial harvest were not influenced by GM-CSF. However, following the second and third collections of the same mixed cultures, the yield of microglia from GM-CSF-supplemented flasks was increased two-fold. Despite the ability of GM-CSF to expand microglial numbers, cells propagated in the presence/absence of GM-CSF demonstrated roughly equivalent responses following <italic>S. aureus </italic>and PGN stimulation. Specifically, the induction of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2/CXCL2), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD80, CD86 expression by microglia in response to <italic>S. aureus </italic>were similar regardless of whether cells had been exposed to GM-CSF during the mixed culture period. In addition, microglial phagocytosis of intact bacteria was unaffected by GM-CSF. In contrast, upon <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulation, CD40 expression was induced more prominently in microglia expanded in GM-CSF. Analysis of microglial responses to additional pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs) revealed that low dose GM-CSF did not significantly alter TNF-&#x003b1; or MIP-2 production in response to the TLR3 and TLR4 agonists polyI:C or LPS, respectively; however, cells expanded in the presence of GM-CSF produced lower levels of both mediators following CpG-ODN stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate that low levels of GM-CSF are sufficient to expand microglial numbers without significantly affecting their immunological responses following activation of TLR2, TLR4 or TLR3 signaling.

GM-CSF was originally defined based on its ability to stimulate the differentiation and function of granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, previous studies have established that GM-CSF promotes the survival and proliferation of neonatal rat, mouse, and human microglia in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on these observations, GM-CSF is commonly used as a culture medium supplement to obtain sufficient numbers of microglia to conduct downstream <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, recent studies have suggested that microglia are not terminally differentiated and that GM-CSF can induce their functional maturation and expression of dendritic cell (DC) markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which has raised concerns with investigators who are examining the immunological functions of primary microglia in various CNS pathologies. For example, GM-CSF has been reported to induce the transcription of genes important for T cell activation, chemotaxis, antigen processing, innate immunity, and immunosuppression, suggesting the transition of microglia into a more professional antigen presenting cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, other studies have utilized GM-CSF to induce DC maturation from myeloid progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Overall, these studies suggest that microglia can transition into a DC-like phenotype when cultured in the presence of adequate levels of GM-CSF.</p><p>During the preparation of our mouse primary mixed glial cultures, we routinely supplement culture medium with low levels of GM-CSF (0.5 ng/ml) to increase microglial yields. Despite the fact that this concentration is approximately ten-fold lower than what has been reported to modulate microglial function and transition into a DC phenotype (i.e. 5&#x02013;50 ng/ml), we are often questioned regarding the consequences of microglial exposure to GM-CSF during the mixed glial culture period and whether this introduces artifacts in the activation profiles of these cells in subsequent <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments. Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate whether low dose GM-CSF leads to alterations in microglial morphology and/or functional activation in response to a wide variety of PAMPs commonly associated with various CNS infections, namely <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(<italic>S. aureus</italic>) and its cell wall component peptidoglycan (PGN), LPS, polyI:C, and CpG-ODN. Our results demonstrate that low dose GM-CSF led to a significant expansion in microglial numbers without affecting their phagocytic activity or cytokine production profiles in response to the majority of PAMPs examined, with the exception of the TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN. However, we did observe a phenotypic transformation of microglia expanded in the presence of low dose GM-CSF, namely a transition to a DC-like morphology typified by numerous dendrites; however, the functional implication(s) of this change remain to be determined. Therefore, low dose GM-CSF can be successfully utilized as a culture medium supplement to enhance microglial recovery without overtly compromising normal responsiveness to microbial stimuli. Importantly, these findings exclude any potential GM-CSF-induced artifacts in the read-outs of microglial activation routinely used in our studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Primary microglia cell culture and reagents</title><p>Primary microglia were isolated from inbred neonatal C57BL/6 mice as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, age-matched litters (postnatal day 2&#x02013;5) were euthanized using an overdose of inhaled Halothane (Halocarbon Laboratories, River Edge, NJ) to obtain mixed glial cultures. Cerebri were collected under aseptic conditions and the meninges removed. Tissues were minced, resuspended in trypsin-EDTA (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in complete DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, Mediatech Inc.) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 200 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml fungizone (all from Mediatech Inc.), OPI supplement (oxalacetic acid, pyruvate, insulin; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 0.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse GM-CSF (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The cell suspension was further triturated and filtered through a 70 &#x003bc;m cell strainer. Subsequently, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in complete medium, and seeded into 150 cm<sup>2 </sup>flasks. To minimize variation between microglia expanded in the presence/absence of GM-CSF, mouse pups were procured from litters born on the same day and primary cultures propagated with or without GM-CSF were derived from the same initial mixed glial population (i.e. half of the mixed glial cells recovered were cultured with GM-CSF (+) medium while the other half was cultured without GM-CSF).</p><p>Upon confluence (7&#x02013;10 days), flasks were shaken overnight at 200 rpm at 37&#x000b0;C to recover microglia. Microglia from both (+) GM-CSF- and (-) GM-CSF-treated flasks were collected and plated in medium without GM-CSF for all subsequent experiments. The purity of microglial cultures was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against CD11b and GFAP to identify microglia and astrocytes, respectively, and was routinely greater than 95%. Each experiment presented in this paper was initially performed with microglia collected after the first shake and repeated with cells collected after a second shake to confirm that the responses were comparable. Based on our findings that microglial responses were similarly affected in all experiments regardless of when they were harvested, we concluded that microglial responsiveness to microbial stimuli does not significantly differ in cells collected from the first versus subsequent shakes.</p><p>Heat-inactivated <italic>S. aureus </italic>(strain RN6390) was prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and PGN derived from <italic>S. aureus</italic>, poly I:C, and the synthetic CpG oligonucleotide ODN1826 were obtained from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>O11:B1 LPS was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA).

Therefore, the use of this cytokine during the mixed glial culture period reduces the number of neonatal mice required to obtain sufficient numbers of microglia for subsequent studies. We routinely supplement our culture medium with a relatively low dose of GM-CSF; however, to date, we have not yet performed a detailed analysis regarding the efficacy of this dose on microglial expansion or more importantly, whether GM-CSF alters the subsequent responsiveness of microglia compared to cells that have never been exposed to exogenous growth factor. This became an essential issue to address since we are often questioned about the consequences of GM-CSF treatment on downstream microglial responses, thus forming the impetus for the current study. Work by others had demonstrated that GM-CSF led to the transition of microglia into macrophage and/or dendritic-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; however, the doses of cytokine used to drive this differentiation (i.e. 10&#x02013;50 ng/ml) ranged anywhere from 20- to 50-fold higher than the concentration used to expand microglia numbers in our experiments (i.e. 0.5 ng/ml). In addition, other important factors to consider include whether microglia are procured from neonatal versus adult animals or if microglia are expanded as mixed glial cultures or as purified cells.</p><p>To initiate our analysis of low dose GM-CSF effects on microglia, we quantified the relative percentages of microglia recovered from mixed glial cultures continuously propagated in the presence/absence of recombinant mouse GM-CSF (0.5 ng/ml). Upon reaching confluence, mixed glial cultures were collected at three consecutive harvests separated by an interval of 7&#x02013;10 days. The number of microglia collected after the first harvest was not significantly influenced by GM-CSF; however, after the second and third harvests the number of microglia collected from GM-CSF-negative flasks was significantly lower compared to those supplemented with GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and data not shown). This finding demonstrates that even at very low levels, GM-CSF is still capable of expanding microglial numbers, obviating the need for large numbers of neonatal animals to achieve sufficient cell yields.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>GM-CSF improves microglial yields from primary cultures</bold>. Mixed glial cells were prepared in culture medium supplemented with (+) or without (-) GM-CSF (0.5 ng/ml). Upon confluence (7&#x02013;10 days), flasks were shaken overnight and the following day, supernatants were collected and microglial cell counts performed. Flasks were shaken once a week and following the second shake the relative percentage of microglia recovered from flasks cultured without GM-CSF was significantly reduced (**, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). For reporting differences in microglial recovery, we normalized (i.e. divided) the numbers of microglia recovered from GM-CSF (-) flasks by those collected from GM-CSF (+) cultures to express the former as a percentage of GM-CSF (+)-containing conditions (set to 100%).

However, in response to injury or infection, microglia become activated and transition into an ameboid morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, ameboid microglia are rounded cells flattened to the substratum and have been reported to function as phagocytic antigen presenting cells [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. This ameboid morphology observed <italic>in vitro </italic>is likely a consequence of the isolation procedure where, in general, ameboid characteristics are more typical of neonatal microglia, whereas adult cells normally exhibit a more quiescent ramified phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nonetheless, ramification of ameboid microglia can be achieved by either growing cells on an astrocyte monolayer, culturing microglia in astrocyte-conditioned media, or treating with M-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Although it is well established that GM-CSF induces microglial proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding its effects on microglial morphology. For example, GM-CSF (5 U/ml for 72 h) has been shown to increase the number of ameboid microglia by 5- to 6-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas another study reported that GM-CSF induced microglial ramification and LPS treatment transformed cells to an ameboid phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To further complicate matters, recent studies have reported that exposure of purified adult microglia to GM-CSF led to their transformation into a macrophage- or DC-like morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the relative concentrations of GM-CSF used in these studies were relatively high (i.e. 5&#x02013;50 ng/ml) compared to our experiments (0.5 ng/ml). Therefore, to establish the effect of low dose GM-CSF on microglial morphology we investigated cells derived from our culture conditions by phase-contrast microscopy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, unstimulated microglia expanded in the absence of GM-CSF appeared as single rounded or clustered cells that were relatively small in size. In contrast, microglia propagated in the presence of GM-CSF were more flattened, enlarged, and displayed a sizeable number of dendritic processes reminiscent of DCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, when stimulated with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, microglial morphology was virtually indistinguishable between cells that had been expanded in the presence/absence of GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic>-activated microglia appeared heterogeneous in shape compared to unstimulated cells typified by the presence of round, elongated, and flattened cells that exhibited the characteristic homotypic adhesion we have observed in our previous studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and unpublished observations). Collectively, these results indicate that exposure of mixed glial cultures to low dose GM-CSF leads to morphological alterations in purified "resting" microglia that are reminiscent of DCs, in agreement with studies by other groups using high concentrations of GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Although our previous studies using primary neonatal mouse microglia expanded in the presence of low dose GM-CSF did not detect significant constitutive proinflammatory mediator expression under resting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we have not yet performed a detailed side-by-side comparison of activation profiles of microglia propagated in the presence/absence of GM-CSF during the mixed glial culture period. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated proinflammatory mediator expression by microglia expanded with or without GM-CSF in response to a diverse array of PAMPs to establish the utility of low dose GM-CSF for microglial expansion without affecting downstream cellular responsiveness. The PAMPs evaluated included the gram-positive bacterium <italic>S. aureus </italic>and its cell wall component PGN, as well as polyI:C, LPS, and CpG-ODN. Similar to our previous results we found that propagating microglia in the presence of GM-CSF did not alter any constitutive proinflammatory mediator production or significantly affect the degree of responsiveness to either <italic>S. aureus </italic>or PGN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Specifically, TNF-&#x003b1;, MIP-2, and IL-12 p40 were produced to equivalent extents upon <italic>S. aureus </italic>and PGN activation by microglia expanded in the presence/absence of GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and data not shown). To further examine the effects of low dose GM-CSF on microglial responses, we broadened our analysis to investigate several PAMPs acting through TLRs other than TLR2, in particular, polyI:C, LPS, and CpG-ODN, which stimulate microglia via TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Of all of the PAMPs examined, responses to CpG-ODN were most affected by whether microglia had been expanded in the presence of low dose GM-CSF. Specifically, both TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 production were significantly reduced in CpG-ODN treated cells that had no prior exposure to GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, responses to polyI:C and LPS remained unchanged or modestly affected, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that low dose GM-CSF does not drastically alter microglial responsiveness to these PAMPs, in terms of the proinflammatory mediators examined here. Interestingly, polyI:C was not able to induce MIP-2 production in microglia above baseline levels regardless of GM-CSF exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Importantly, the concentrations of all stimuli used in this study did not adversely affect microglial viability, indicating that the exposure of microglia to GM-CSF during the expansion period did not sensitize cells to activation-dependent toxicity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Low dose GM-CSF does not alter microglial cytokine/chemokine responses to <italic>S. aureus </italic>and PGN</bold>.

In our culture system, microglia are exposed to GM-CSF for a period of longer than 10 days and this was not sufficient to induce CD11c expression since, when compared to isotype control staining, none of the CD11c signal detected could be attributed to specific binding in either the "resting state" or following <italic>S. aureus </italic>exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

The amount of GM-CSF released by these cells could be sufficient to induce a proinflammatory state of local microglia and/or their transformation into a DC- or macrophage-like cell. Although numerous studies have been performed examining the effects of GM-CSF on microglial morphology and function, often times these reports have produced conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This likely stems from differences in GM-CSF treatment paradigms, species of microglial origin, and/or whether adult or neonatal cells are used. All of these issues coupled with the fact that the doses of GM-CSF applied to microglia have shown tremendous variability among individual studies, makes it quite difficult to compare results and arrive at general conclusions regarding the effects of GM-CSF on primary microglia. When we reviewed the literature we found that GM-CSF was mainly evaluated in two ways. In the first, GM-CSF was provided as a supplement during the initial mixed glial culture period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], whereas in another group of studies, GM-CSF was added as a stimulus to purified microglia that had otherwise not been previously exposed to the growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Another variable is the dose of GM-CSF examined which has been tested over a very broad range, namely from 0.05&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/ml or 1- 200 U/ml, which can be expected to have dramatic effects on the results obtained. In addition, the species from which primary microglia are procured and their maturational state, for example, mouse or rat newborn pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], adult animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], or even human fetal microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have been examined. Therefore, it is essential that the results obtained from these diverse experimental settings should be evaluated within the constraints of these parameters.</p><p>One main reason why scientists studying primary microglia have supplemented culture medium with GM-CSF is to procure sufficient numbers of microglia for downstream analysis, since GM-CSF has been shown to induce microglial proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed, this modification has resulted in accelerated cell growth and increased cell yields, saving time and animal utilization. In our <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, we typically isolate primary mixed glial cells from newborn mice and culture them in medium supplemented with a relatively low dose of GM-CSF (0.5 ng/ml). Importantly, upon recovery of microglia from these cultures, cells are never exposed to exogenous GM-CSF again and are not utilized in experiments for at least 2 days following low dose GM-CSF withdrawal. With this modification, we were able to collect sufficient numbers of microglia for our experiments even after the third harvest, effectively reducing the need for additional microglia cultures. In addition, the main inflammatory responses of microglia following <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulation, namely proinflammatory mediator production and phagocytosis, were not affected by propagating cells in the presence of GM-CSF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Interestingly, exposure of microglia to GM-CSF modestly influenced proinflammatory mediator production following LPS stimulation, whereas responses to polyI:C were not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has been well established that both of these PAMPs activate microglia via TLR4 and TLR3, respectively, leading to GM-CSF production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], as well as the priming ability of GM-CSF to augment LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production in monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] and alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current study represents the first report investigating the effects of low dose GM-CSF on microglial responses to TLR4 and TLR3 ligands. Importantly, based on the finding that low dose GM-CSF does not dramatically alter microglial proinflammatory mediator expression in response to a diverse array of PAMPs, we propose that our cell culture procedure may be applicable to a wide range of studies investigating the immune properties of primary mouse microglia without concerns of drastically transforming cellular responsiveness. However, a word of caution must be mentioned, in that not all PAMP recognition is resilient to low dose GM-CSF, as demonstrated by our CpG-ODN findings discussed below.</p><p>Several researchers have reported that microglia express TLR9 and respond to the TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN with the robust production of numerous proinflammatory mediators as well as increased expression of immune receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Moreover, recent evidence demonstrating that CpG-ODN stimulated microglia induce neuron cell death in a co-culture paradigm has suggested a link between TLRs and neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. On the other hand, we have reported that alternative TLR agonists such as <italic>S. aureus</italic>, PGN and LPS lead to a time-dependent decrease in TLR9 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which might be explained as a compensatory mechanism for microglia to downregulate cellular activation pathways. A recent study has shown that GM-CSF (20 ng/ml) in combination with either CpG- or non-CpG-ODN was capable of inducing several chemokines in primary human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], as well as in lymphoma and neuroblastoma models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Although the methods used in these studies are quite distinct compared to our experimental design, they still support our findings that GM-CSF exacerbates microglial activation following CpG-ODN stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our results highlight the importance of experimental culture conditions and the potential effects of GM-CSF, even at very low doses, should be considered while investigating the consequences of GpG-ODN on microglial activation. The mechanism(s) responsible for this observed synergistic effect between GM-CSF and CpG-ODN remain to be clarified with further studies. Importantly, in this study microglia expanded in the presence/absence of GM-CSF expressed equivalent levels of TLR9 mRNA under resting conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the impaired responsiveness of GM-CSF (-) microglia to subsequent ODN stimulation is likely not the result of reduced TLR9 expression.</p><p>One of the main concerns reported with GM-CSF treatment of primary microglia cultures is its ability to induce microglial differentiation towards a DC phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. GM-CSF can be produced by glial cells following inflammatory or infectious diseases of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]; therefore, it was postulated that GM-CSF may modulate the generation and maturation of DCs from microglia in the context of CNS disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although our experiments demonstrate that low dose GM-CSF does not lead to overt alterations in the functional properties of microglia to diverse bacterial stimuli, cytokine treatment does induce morphological changes characteristic of DC-like cells. Specifically, we found that unstimulated microglia expanded in the presence of GM-CSF displayed an increased number of dendritic processes and were enlarged and more adherent compared to cells that had not been exposed to exogenous growth factor. Despite these phenotypic differences, we were not able to uncover any functional implications for these changes and no CD11c induction on GM-CSF exposed microglia could be demonstrated. Therefore, additional studies are warranted to further investigate the consequences, if any, of this morphological transformation of microglia following low dose GM-CSF exposure. A general consensus that can be inferred from the literature, and is in partial agreement with the results presented here, is that GM-CSF can lead to the transition of microglia into a DC-like phenotype, although the magnitude of these changes appears to be influenced by the dose of GM-CSF cells are exposed to.</p><p>The expression of other surface molecules including MHC class II, CD80, and CD86 were not affected by exposure of microglia to low dose GM-CSF. The expression of these molecules has been shown by others to be elevated in neonatal microglia, where cells exhibit a partially activated phenotype in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In <italic>ex vivo </italic>isolated adult microglia, GM-CSF stimulation did not alter the expression of MHC class II, CD40, or CD86 but did induce morphological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In contrast to our previous report demonstrating that <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulation induced MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression in the N9 microglial cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we found in the present study that the levels of MHC class II, CD80, and CD86 were not augmented in primary microglia following <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulation. However, CD40 expression was dramatically upregulated following <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulation in microglia that were expanded in the presence of GM-CSF. We propose that one explanation for these contradictory findings may lie in the nature of the cell types examined. For example, primary neonatal microglia in culture may inherently express higher constitutive levels of these molecules such that further activation will not result in an obvious increase in their expression. Alternatively, the length of time required to detect activation-dependent increases in surface marker expression in primary microglia may be longer than that observed for the N9 cell line; however, this possibility seems less likely. Another potential explanation is that the concentration of <italic>S. aureus </italic>required to increase MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression may differ between primary microglia and the N9 cell line. Since we only examined one dose of <italic>S. aureus </italic>in the present study it remains possible that titration of higher bacterial concentrations may have elicited an increase in surface marker expression, although this possibility remains speculative. The finding that MHC class II levels did not increase in <italic>S. aureus </italic>stimulated microglia when assayed using two independent approaches (i.e. immunofluorescence and flow cytometry staining) provides additional support to establish the validity of our findings.</p><p>Another important factor to consider is the nature of how primary microglia are propagated during <italic>in vitro </italic>culture. Specifically, in our studies, microglia and astrocytes are maintained as mixed cultures during the expansion period. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that the coordinated effects of endogenous astrocyte-derived factors in combination with exogenous GM-CSF may influence the properties of recovered microglia. As an extension, it is not surprising that different microglial phenotypes are observed when cells are directly purified from the brain parenchyma and cultured in isolation. In addition, compounded with the addition of high levels of exogenous GM-CSF used in other studies, it is not unexpected that microglia assume different biological and functional properties. We propose that the maintenance of primary microglia initially as mixed cultures with astrocytes is more reminiscent of the natural milieu these cells are exposed to <italic>in vivo </italic>and represents an acceptable model to study the immunological properties of microglia, although we clearly recognize the potential for any <italic>in vitro </italic>findings to not directly equate to <italic>in vivo </italic>responses due to the artificial nature of the former. However, the examination of microglia in isolation provides a more simplified approach to investigate the effector functions of these CNS phagocytes in the absence of confounding effects by surrounding cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that supplementation of neonatal mouse mixed glial cultures with low dose GM-CSF successfully maintained microglial expansion and did not lead to overt alterations in the functional responses of microglia following stimulation with several PAMPs of importance during CNS bacterial and viral infections including PGN, LPS, polyI:C, as well as <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This suggests that our culture paradigm may be successfully used as a method to procure larger quantities of microglia without significantly affecting their downstream responses to microbial stimuli. However, it is important to note that differences in CpG-ODN responsiveness as well as the transition towards a DC-like phenotype were observed in microglia propagated in the presence of low dose GM-CSF, the functional implications of which are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APC (antigen presenting cell); CD (cluster of Differentiation); CFU (colony-forming units); CNS (central nervous system); DC (dendritic cell); DMEM (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium); ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay); FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting); FBS (fetal bovine serum); FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate); GFP (green fluorescence protein); IFN-&#x003b3; (interferon gamma); IL-12 p40 (interleukin-12 p40); GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor); LPS (lipopolysaccharide); M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor); MHC (major histocompatibility complex); MIP-2/CXCL2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2); MTT (3- [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide); ODN (oligonucleotide); OPI (oxalacetic acid, pyruvate, insulin); PAMP (pathogen associated molecular pattern); PGN (peptidoglycan); PBS (phosphate buffered saline); polyI:C (polyinosine-polycytidylic acid);<italic>S. aureus </italic>(<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>); TLR (Toll-like receptor); TNF-&#x003b1;(tumor necrosis factor-alpha).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Both NE and TK directed the work and prepared the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Thuang Shwe for preparation of primary glial cultures, Dr. Mohsin Md.
