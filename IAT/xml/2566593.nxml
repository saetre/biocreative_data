RTX opens the cation channel inflammatory pain/vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) permanently and selectively removes nociceptive neurons by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-cytotoxicity. Paradoxically, not only nociceptors, but non-neuronal cells, including keratinocytes express full length TRPV1 mRNA, while patient dogs and experimental animals that underwent topical treatment or anatomically targeted molecular surgery have shown neither obvious behavioral, nor pathological side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To address this paradox, we assessed the vanilloid sensitivity of the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line and primary keratinocytes from skin biopsies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Although both cell types express TRPV1 mRNA, neither responded to vanilloids with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-cytotoxicity. Only ectopic overproduction of TRPV1 rendered HaCaT cells sensitive to low doses (1&#x02013;50 nM) of vanilloids. The TRPV1-mediated and non-receptor specific Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-cytotoxity (&#x0005b;RTX&#x0005d;&#x0003e;15 &#x000b5;M) could clearly be distinguished, thus keratinocytes were indeed resistant to vanilloid-induced, TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-entry. Having a wider therapeutic window than capsaicin, RTX was effective in subnanomolar range, but even micromolar concentrations could not kill human keratinocytes. Keratinocytes showed orders of magnitudes lower TRPV1 mRNA level than sensory ganglions, the <italic>bona fide</italic> therapeutic targets in human pain management. In addition to TRPV1, TRPV1b, a dominant negative splice variant was also noted in keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TRPV1B expression, together with low TRPV1 expression, may explain the vanilloid paradox: even genuinely TRPV1 mRNA positive cells can be spared with therapeutic (up to micromolar) doses of RTX.

TRPV1 is a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>channel that, triggered by algesic endo-, and exovanilloids, moderate heat, inflammatory mediators and tissue acidification, transduces pain signals in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Caterina1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. TRPV1 is the cognate receptor of capsaicin (CAP), resiniferatoxin (RTX) and various other vanilloid-like analogous phytotoxins/irritants evolved as defense molecules in modern plants against mammalian herbivores. Contrary to mammals, avians, descendents of the dinosaurs can live a normal life without capsaicin sensitive V1 type TRP channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Jordt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, avian seed dispersers are favored, whereas, mammalian herbivores are repelled by plants producing fruits with CAP or other toxic vanilloids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Levey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>TRPV1 positive nociceptors are an intermingled subset of primary sensory afferent neurons residing in cranial and spinal sensory ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Caterina1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. From the ganglia TRPV1-immunoreactive fibers project to the sub-epidermis and intraepidermis in normal skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Gopinath1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously proposed that vanilloids, especially RTX, the most potent agonist of TRPV1, can be used to remove TRPV1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons via specific Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-cytotoxicity (i.e. necrosis) occurring within minutes, sparing other nociceptive neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Olah1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Karai1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Brown1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Tender1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and the procedure had little or any side-effect in these mammals.</p><p>Expression of TRPV1 has recently been noted in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Mezey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and various non-neuronal tissues, such as pneumocytes, urothelium, gut epithelium, vascular endothelium, thymocytes, dendritic cells, mastocytes, smooth muscle, fibroblast and keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Nagy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Szallasi2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a number of these cell types claimed to be immunopositive to TRPV1 later turned out to be resistant to RTX. Vanilloid-elicited chemical knock-outs and TRPV1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice do not show functional abnormalities other than loss of TRPV1-related moderate heat- and pain sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Caterina2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Davis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, except for somewhat impaired motility of the bladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Birder1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, creating &#x0201c;chemical knock-outs&#x0201d; by either systemic CAP or RTX injection of newborn animals eliminates TRPV1 expressing neurons in the PNS, but beyond the neurological abnormalities noted in TRPV1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, no other gross abnormalities have been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Szallasi3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. All these fact point to a lack of vanilloid-responsive TRPV1 in non-neuronal cell, while the eventual non-neuron-specific function of the receptor or its possible splice variants remains to be clarified.</p><p>Vanilloid sensitivity of non-neuronal cells is likewise a key question in the case of local vanilloid treatment. Topical application of capsaicin cream for the treatment or prurigo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Stander1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, HIV neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Simpson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and other forms of neuropathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Argoff1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> was found to be an effective therapeutic intervention. A systematic review revealed that capsain, beside being the less expensive of the available therapeutic options, was among the most effective ones in treating post-herpetic neuralgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Alper1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In the skin, beside the C-, and A&#x003b4; fibers, epidermal keratinocytes were also found to be TRPV1 immunopositive in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Southall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Inoue1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our functional approach with both systemic and local RTX treatment, however, has determined these cells again to be resistant. In order to further address the vanilloid resistance paradox and to better characterize the treatment of topical application of capsaicin cream and RTX-mediated neurosurgery, we employed different diagnostic and functional assays in HaCaT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Olah2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, an immortalized human keratinocyte line. To compare and validate results in the established HaCaT cell line, some experiments were repeated in primary keratinocytes from skin biopsies and primary rat DRG culture.</p><p>To complicate functionality (i.e. vanilloid inducibility) of TRPV1 in keratinocytes, some previous reports claimed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Southall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Inoue1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Bodo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> but another contradicted the inductive function of vanilloids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Chung1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to vanilloid resistance, we also addressed this contradiction in this paper. Neither our short (minutes scale) functional assays (<sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-uptake, Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-uptake, of fluorimetric assays), nor long term (24 hr) cell survival assays showed keratinocytes to be responsive to TRPV1 mediated CAP/RTX effects. Nevertheless, cell survival assays show the non-TRPV1 mediated cell death elicited by high dose of CAP/RTX. The different concentrations of CAP/RTX between the TRPV1 mediated and non-TRPV1 mediated cell death clearly show that the therapeutic window is larger in the case of RTX. These results support our view that topical use of RTX containing creams may evolve into an effective pain relief option.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Capsaicin (CAP), N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA), agonists of TRPV1, capsazepine, a well characterized antagonist of TRPV1, and ionomycin (IONO), a calcium ionophore, were dissolved in DMSO (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Cells were seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips or on multi-well microtiter plates. Surfaces were coated with poly-D-lysine. The cultures were selected in this medium for 2 day, at which point well differentiated neurons and nondividing cells dominated the population. Human trigeminal ganglion neurons were collected from human cadavers after obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional ethical committee.

Thus, high doses of vanilloids (i.e. 20&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M) do not require expression of TRPV1 for the cytotoxic effect.

The dose of CAP concentrations causing non TRPV1 mediated cytotoxicity was &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> fold higher than the dose (1 nM) necessary to induce TRPV1-dependent cytotoxicity in TRPV1 transfected cell lines. All together, this means that RTX has a broader therapeutic window than CAP, making it a more desirable candidate for human clinical application.</p><p>We showed evidences that agonist-dependent, receptor-mediated cytotoxic effect requires a threshold-level expression of TRPV1. Prolonged exposure to relatively high concentration of RTX (i.e. low micromolar) is definitely tolerated by keratinocytes in cell culture.

Functional TRPV1 is most likely a homotetramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Kedei1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, although the existence of hetero-multimers of TRPV1 with other members of the TRPV subfamily is possible. TRPV1 is reportedly co-expressed with other isotypes with variable stochiometry in keratinocytes and other vanilloid resistant cells. For example, TRPV2 co-expression was reported in rat DRG and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Liapi1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, and TRPV4 in a subset of nociceptive neurons where it sensitizes effects of prostaglandin PGE<sub>2</sub> in inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-AlessandriHaber1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. These isotypes obviously do not have dominant negative effect in C-type sensory neurons localized in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system or at least not at that stochiometry and levels they are expressed. Occurrence of TRPV3 and TRPV4 has been reported in keratinocytes; TRPV4 in suprabasal keratinocytes, whereas TRPV3 selectively in the basal layers of the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Guler1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Peier1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of these receptors might have interfered with heat sensitivity assays assessing TRPV1 functionality in earlier studies. Their different chemical sensitivity makes these TRP receptors easily distinguishable from TRPV1. Importantly, due to their different ligand specificity, they might not play a role in the response to transdermal vanilloids. On the other hand, TRPV1 might be capable of forming hetero-oligomeric complexes either with TRPV3 or TRPV4, as demonstrated in ectopic expression systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Hellwig1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, yet functionality of these receptor/channels not entirely known. Co-localization of TRPV1 and TRPV1b, its splice variant in the same cell confers a dominant negative effect and receptor inactivation in the nervous system as well as in other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Vos1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and this rule may apply to TRPV1&#x0002b; keratinocytes, in which we determined unequivocal presence of TRPV1b. Alternatively, resistance to vanilloids can appear due to lack of cyclin dependent kinase 5 signal transduction pathway, a protein kinase upstream to TRPV1 that might also necessary for channel opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Pareek1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Last but not least, the discrepancy between our results and observation of others' could be caused by false positive signals produced by antibodies that not entirely specific to TRPV1 and can cross-react with other TRP isotypes. Commercially, up till now, only polyclonal antibodies were available that prepared against peptide antigens. Linear epitopes frequently results in antibodies of suboptimal specificity and selectivity and not even ideal for semi-quantitative determination of the TRPV1 protein. Dendritic cells seem to be an example of such false positive determination of TRPV1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Basu1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-OConnell1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, in a number of other papers, keratinocytes show negative TRPV1 immuno-staining, such as immuno-positive nerve endings surrounded by apparently unstained keratinocytes, suggesting that their anti-peptide polyclonal TRPV1 antibody does not recognize the protein (or its tissue-specific splice form) in non-neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Gopinath1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Guo1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Facer1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To fully characterize functionality, we have to take into consideration that there are two pools of TRPV1 in a cell: one in the plasma membrane (TRPV1<sub>PM</sub>) and the other in the endoplasmic reticulum (TRPV1<sub>ER</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Olah1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>- or Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-uptake assays can reveal the function of TRPV1<sub>PM</sub> alone, while, flourometric Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-imaging depicts the combinations of the TRPV1<sub>PM</sub> and TRPV1<sub>ER</sub> receptor populations. In keratinocytes we neither have found vanilloid-induced TRPV1 mediated response in our short term <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>- or Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-uptake assays nor any positive evidence of intracellular free Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization. Previous studies with comparable means demonstrated that a minor fraction of keratinocytes may exhibit a CAP-induced fluorometric Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx signal similar to that demonstrated by one of us in TRPV1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DRG neurons. However, majority of the population showed a rather spontaneous Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signal, again a typical biomarker of false positive membrane activity, neutral to either presence or absence of a vanilloid agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Southall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Inoue1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In whole-cell voltage clamp functional bioassays carried out in mouse keratinocytes CAP has evoked little if any Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-response, even concentration raised up to 10 &#x000b5;M (i.e. CAP's ED<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3 &#x000b5;M in TRPV1&#x0002b; DRG neurons) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Chung1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> Nevertheless, the CAP-evoked intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> increase is not a specific marker for TRPV1 function, especially if applied in high doses. TRPV1 negative cell lines, such as activated T-lymphocytes, and Jurkat cells show readily intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-elevation upon treatment with 200 &#x000b5;M CAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Macho1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, obviously, a mechanism distinct of vanilloid-induced receptor mediated cation uptake. Endogenous activation of TRPV1 has been suggested to lead to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent production of proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Southall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experiments in keratinocytes suggest that the increase of pro-inflammatory mediators is attributable to a TRPV-independent, yet not fully characterized cell necrotic pathway.</p><p>Our validated, high sensitivity and specificity bioassays proved keratinocytes completely vanilloid resistant. Importantly, the functional TRPV1 in keratinocytes could have made them a problematic target seemingly able to generate unwanted side effects and prevent future use of either transdermal capsaicin or RTX. Based on our data here, together with the lack of effect in skin determined in knockout or RTX-treated mice <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Caterina2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Davis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> keratinocytes can be safely spared from vanilloid-induced, receptor-mediated cytotoxicity and cell death, even when the most potent agonist RTX will be employed in molecular neurosurgery as proposed previous to these studies. The skin side effects of transdermal capsaicin observed in clinical practice thus seem to be entirely caused by the affected sensory nerves, especially to to the CGRP and substance P liberated in an entirely TRPV1- and sensory nerve dependent manner, not separable from the therapeutic effect. Two approaches might be envisageable for alleviating these side effects &#x02013; one is substitution of capsaicin with more potent vanilloids that would rapidly kill the sensory nerves, thus paradoxically decreasing the pain sensation and local inflammation. The second is concomitant use of local anesthetic agents (lidocain) acting downstream of the TRPV1 receptor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Simpson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>It is important to note that, in spite of the assumed presence of TRPV1 receptor in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Mezey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Roberts1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Toth1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, capsaicin (100 nM&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M) and RTX (100 nM) failed to alter the basal intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-levels in the rat hippocampal nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003419-Kofalvi1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, the presence of TRPV1 transcript as shown here and reported in cases of other cell types not necessarily means sensitivity to potent vanilloid phytotoxins. Immunoreactivities that have recently reported in number of diverse cell types and identified in various central nervous system neurons can be misleading and are only just another false positive biomarker of TRPV1. Since our Western-blotting using protein extract from keratinocytes was negative to TRPV1, we can not exclude the possibility that keratinocytes do not express TRPV1 at a meaningful protein level at all. Therefore, study of functionality in addition to diagnostics is needed for better understanding of the <italic>in vivo</italic> status of TRPV1. All together these results may explain the relatively modest neural/non-neuronal side effects of the RTX-mediated molecular neurosurgery that systemically can create &#x0201c;chemical knockout&#x0201d; with lack of major behavioral deviances. Our observations here are also corroborated by the lack of obvious phenotype in TRPV1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
