Growth cones display dynamic, actin-based lamellipodial protrusions ringed by filopodia that together guide the growth cone to its target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Arp2/3 complex is a seven-member protein complex that nucleates actin filaments from the sides of pre-existing actin filaments. In cultured cells, the Arp2/3 complex is necessary to form the network of branched actin filaments underlying lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The Arp2/3 complex has been implicated in axon pathfinding <italic>in vivo</italic>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Arp2/3 complex and its regulators WAVE/Scar and Kette are required for proper axon pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the Arp2/3 regulators WAVE-1/WAVE, WASP-1/WASP, GEX-2/Sra-1, and GEX-3/Kette are required for proper axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, in these studies, the effects of Arp2/3 on growth cone outgrowth were not described. The role of the Arp2/3 complex in growth cone morphology has been controversial. In two studies using cultured hippocampal neurons, inhibition of Arp2/3 activity resulted in increased axon length with little or no effect on growth cone filopodia or morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Another recent study using cultured hippocampal neurons and neuroblastoma cells showed that Arp2/3 knock-down resulted in defective actin organization and defective lamellipodia and filopodia formation in the growth cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Studies reported here show that Arp2/3 is indeed required for growth cone morphology and filopodia formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that Arp2/3 is required specifically for the rate of filopodia initiation but not filopodial stability or length. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Arp2/3 is required for growth cone filopodia formation and extend these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, explaining the axon pathfinding defects observed in Arp2/3 mutants. Furthermore, UNC-115/abLIM has been implicated in axon pathfinding in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but its role in growth cone dynamics and morphology during outgrowth is not understood. Our results here show that UNC-115/abLIM is also involved in the initiation of growth cone filopodia.</p><p>Experiments described here in <italic>C. elegans </italic>show that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the Arp2/3 complex (<italic>arx </italic>genes) cause defects in axon guidance, and that Arp2/3 is required cell-autonomously in neurons for proper axon guidance. Analysis of growth cones during outgrowth <italic>in vivo </italic>revealed that <italic>arx </italic>mutants displayed reduced numbers of growth cone filopodia and also reduced growth cone size. Time-lapse analysis of growth cones in living animals indicated that the Arp2/3 complex controlled the rate of growth cone filopodia initiation but not filopodia stability or length. These results indicate that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Arp2/3 complex is a key regulator of growth cone filopodia initiation during outgrowth.</p><p>The actin modulatory proteins UNC-34/Enabled and UNC-115/abLIM have been shown previously to affect axon guidance in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Larvae were synchronized by washing adults and larvae from a plate with many eggs and allowing the eggs to hatch. Newly hatched larvae were washed from the plate at 0.5 h intervals and allowed to develop for the following times before imaging: 6 h, 6.5 h, 7 h, 7.5 h, and 8 h. Animals were imaged using a Leica DMR microscope with a Qimaging Retiga EXi camera.

Filopodia length was measured using ImageJ software. Growth cone translocation speed was determined by measuring the distance from the distal tip of the lamellipodial portion of the growth cone to a fixed reference point along the axon, often a point at which the axon has crossed a lateral axon tract, which can cause a slight bulge in the axon.

Also at this time, the cell bodies of the PQR neurons began to resemble a typical neuronal cell body: they became smaller in size and oval-shaped with fewer filopodial extensions.

The role of Arp2/3 in growth cone morphology has been controversial, based on studies in cultured neurons. Some studies concluded that Arp2/3 was not involved in growth cone filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], while another demonstrated a role for Arp2/3 in growth cone filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our results presented here clearly demonstrate that Arp2/3 is required for growth cone filopodia formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The previous study that found no role of Arp2/3 in cultured hippocampal growth cone filopodia formation used expression of a dominant negative WAVE construct to inhibit Arp2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], whereas the study that found an effect of Arp2/3 in hippocampal growth cones used small interfering RNA knockdown of the p34-Arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Possibly, the dominant-negative WAVE construct did not inhibit Arp2/3 as well as the small interfering RNA. In any case, our studies of <italic>C. elegans </italic>growth cones <italic>in vivo </italic>demonstrate that Arp2/3 is a key regulator of growth cone filopodia formation.</p><p>A previous study using cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] showed that Arp2/3 was present in the growth cone at branch points of actin filaments as observed in other cell types, and filaments with Arp2/3 at their base contributed to filopodial bundles, suggesting that Arp2/3 provides a source of actin filaments for filopodial formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The nature of the growth cone cytoskeletal defects in <italic>arx </italic>mutant growth cones is difficult to discern, as the growth cones are very small compared to those of cultured hippocampal neurons (&#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m in diameter compared to approximately 20 &#x003bc;m for cultured hippocampal neurons). However, it is possible that there is reduced nucleation of lamellipodial actin filaments in <italic>arx-7 </italic>mutant growth cones, resulting in less availability of lamellipodial actin filaments to contribute to filopodial bundles. This idea is consistent with the time-lapse analysis of growth cone filopodia, which showed that <italic>arx </italic>mutants had reduced filopodial initiation rates compared to wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). <italic>arx-7 </italic>mutant PQR growth cones also displayed a reduction in the size of the growth cone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), consistent with a role of Arp2/3 in the nucleation of growth cone lamellipodial actin filaments. Interestingly, once filopodia formed in <italic>arx-</italic>7 mutants, they had characteristics similar to wild type, including time of persistence/stability and maximal length. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex might primarily affect the initiation of filopodia and have only a minor role in filopodial stability or extension once a filopodium has initiated. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that filopodia initiate and collapse before they are visible as filopodia in our imaging assays.</p></sec><sec><title>The Arp2/3 complex is required for axon guidance</title><p>As a growth cone navigates its environment, filopodia are thought to act as sensors of extracellular cues and have a role in guiding the growth cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consistent with this idea, we found that <italic>arx </italic>mutants have defects in the guidance of the PDE and VD/DD axons and of the PQR dendrite.

Through a combination of genetic analysis and time-lapse imaging of growth cones during outgrowth, we show that the Arp2/3 complex acts cell autonomously in the initiation of new growth cone filopodia during growth cone outgrowth, possibly explaining the axon guidance defects observed in <italic>arx </italic>mutants. We show that two other actin modulatory molecules, UNC-115/abLIM and UNC-34/Enabled, also affect growth cone filopodia initiation, which might explain the genetic redundancy of Arp2/3, UNC-115/abLIM, and UNC-34/Enabled in axon guidance. Arp2/3 and UNC-115/abLIM, but not UNC-34/Enabled, also affect the size of the growth cone, possibly reflecting a role in the formation of growth cone lamellipodium. Thus, multiple actin regulatory molecules have shared roles (filopodia initiation) and distinct roles (lamellipodia formation) in the growth cone during axon outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ERM: Ezrin/radixin/moesin; GFP: green fluorescent protein; Pvl: protruding vulva; VNC: ventral nerve cord.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ADN, JOC, and EAL conceived of and designed the experiments, EAL and ADN performed the experiments, and JOC performed the cell-autonomous rescue of <italic>arx-4</italic>.
