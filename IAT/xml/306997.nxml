Of 319 open reading frames (ORFs) found in this 338.5 kb segment, 147 (46%) are potential new genes. The positions of several genes which had been previously located here by mapping or partial sequencing have been confirmed. Several ORFs have functions suggested by similarities to other characterised genes but cannot be assigned with certainty. Fifteen of the ORFs of unknown function had been previously sequenced. Eight transfer RNAs are encoded in the region and there are two grey holes in which no features were found. The attachment site for phage P4 and three insertion sequences were located. The region was also analysed for chi sites, bend sites, REP elements and other repeats. A computer search identified potential promoters and tentative transcription units were assigned. The occurrence of the rare tetramer CTAG was analysed in 1.6 Mb of contiguous E.coli sequence. Hypotheses addressing the rarity and distribution of CTAG are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2105"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2106"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2107"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2108"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2109"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2110"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2111"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2112"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2113"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2114"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2115"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2116"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2117"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2118"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2119"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
