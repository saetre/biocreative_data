It is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with about one million new cases diagnosed annually, and almost an equal number of deaths. It is predominant in China, most parts of South East Asia, and South Africa, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The last decade has seen no major advances in the treatment of HCC. Approximately 10-25% of HCC patients are candidates for surgical resection and liver transplantation; the majority of patients have limited treatment options due to the lack of effective chemotherapy against this intrinsically resistant tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. New pharmacological interventions that offer even modest improvements in efficacy and disease outcome are eagerly sought.</p><p>The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway plays an important role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Secreted proteins of the Wnt family bind to specific Frizzled (FZD) receptors on the surface of target cells to activate distinct intracellular pathways, resulting in the accumulation and nuclear localization of the &#x003b2;-catenin protein. Nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin binds to T-cell factor 4 (Tcf4) to drive activation of specific target genes including cyclin D1, c-Myc, and survivin, which have been characterized to be critical for cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Clinical studies have reported that abnormal activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway is frequently involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. About 33-67% of HCC tissues show accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas no accumulation was observed in the corresponding normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, FZD7, a receptor for Wnt ligands, was reported to be involved in HCC development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The Wnt-1 ligand has been reported to be abnormally expressed in a variety of human cancers including HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In HCC, proteomics results suggested that enhanced Wnt-1 expression associated with NF-kB might be an important mechanism underlying hepatocarcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, transgenic mice model suggested that high expression of Wnt-1 could be the major cause for nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin, which subsequently contributes to c-myc/E2F1-driven hepatocarcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Elevated levels of tumor Wnt-1 protein in HBV- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC has recently been shown to be a prognostic indicator of HCC recurrence after surgical resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Because of the functional importance of Wnt-1 in HCC development and progression, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of blocking Wnt-1 mediated signaling through the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in human HCC. By using a polyclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody, we studied the effects of Wnt-1 blockade on HCC cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the effects on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in HCC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Over-expression of Wnt-1 protein in HCC tissue specimens and cell lines</title><p>To confirm the expression of Wnt-1 protein in HCC, we used the anti-Wnt-1 antibody to detect its expression in seven pairs of HCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues. These tissues were obtained with informed consent from seven HCC patients undergoing surgical resection at Stanford Hospital. Expression of Wnt-1 in HCC tissues was at least 1.5 fold greater than in paired non-tumor tissues in four out of the seven tissue pairs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Despite the small sample size, our data closely reflect that reported recently by Lee <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], who observed that 26 of 63 HCC patients had tumor/non-tumor Wnt-1 expression ratio of &#x02265; 1.5, whereas 37 of 63 had a ratio of &#x0003c;1.5. Wnt-1 protein expression was in general higher in human HCC cell lines (Huh7, Hep40, and HepG2), but was undetectable in normal hepatocytes cultured from three different donors (Hu4122, Hu4074, Hu0910) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In general, our observations corroborate with published reports that Wnt-1 is upregulated in HBV- and HCV-related HCC tissues and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Wnt-1 protein in human HCC tumors and cell lines</bold>.

We therefore further studied its potential as a therapeutic target for HCC treatment. After 72 hr exposure, the anti-Wnt-1 antibody dose-dependently decreased cell viability in Huh7 and Hep40 cells, but not in HepG2 cells and normal hepatocytes from three different donors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The lack of activity against HepG2 cells may be due to the presence of truncated &#x003b2;-catenin (with loss of the GSK-3&#x003b2; regulatory site) in these cells, which therefore escapes regulation by upstream events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As a specificity control, we examined the effect on cell proliferation of overnight pre-incubation of the anti-Wnt-1 antibody with its specific blocking peptide (at 20-fold concentration over the antibody). The anti-proliferative effect of anti-Wnt-1 antibody on Huh7 and Hep40 cells were blocked by pre-treatment with the blocking peptide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), suggesting that the anti-Wnt-1 antibody can bind specifically to the native form of the Wnt-1 protein in these cells, and that the observed anti-proliferative effect is mediated by inhibition of Wnt-1 protein functions by the anti-Wnt-1 antibody.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of anti-Wnt-1 antibody on human HCC cell lines</bold>.

The anti-Wnt-1 antibody dose-dependently decreased &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcriptional activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and also reduced the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the nuclei of Huh7 and Hep40 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). No effects on &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcriptional activity or &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation were observed in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Control IgG had no effect on transcriptional activity or nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin levels. Consistent with these observations, the endogenous levels of &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 regulated proteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1, and survivin) were reduced after 48 hr treatment with the anti-Wnt-1 antibody (2 &#x003bc;g/ml), but not after treatment with control IgG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

The expression of the Wnt-1 ligand in mammalian cells results in the accumulation of steady-state levels of cytosolic and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which contributes to the development of many types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently, several Wnt proteins, including Wnt-1, have been shown to be over-expressed in HCC tumor compared with the corresponding non-tumor tissue from hepatitis B and C-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>in vitro </italic>models have been used to study how the over-expression of Wnt-1 is involved in HCV-induced Huh-7 cell proliferation and HBV X protein-induced &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcription activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consistent with these recent findings, we have shown that Wnt-1 protein is over-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, but not in adjacent non-tumor liver tissues or cultured normal hepatocytes. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>data further support the use of an anti-Wnt-1 antibody as a new treatment option for HCC, since it blocks Wnt-1 mediated &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcription, which in turn leads to reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and down-regulation of important downstream target oncoproteins in HCC.</p><p>Wnt-1-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcription is an important cellular survival pathway that promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cellular transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Because Wnt proteins are indispensible for cancer cell growth and survival, we studied the potential anti-tumor effect of anti-Wnt-1 antibody in HCC cells. Compared to the control goat IgG, anti-Wnt-1 antibody decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in Huh7 and Hep40 cell lines over-expressing Wnt-1 protein (and with wild type &#x003b2;-catenin). These effects were blocked by pre-treatment with the Wnt-1 blocking peptide, demonstrating that they were mediated by specific binding of the anti-Wnt-1 antibody to the native form of Wnt-1 protein in these cells. However, the anti-Wnt-1 antibody had no effect on HepG2 cells (with high expression of Wnt-1 protein, but harbors both wild type and truncated &#x003b2;-catenin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and normal hepatocytes from three different donors (with undetectable Wnt-1 expression). Truncation of &#x003b2;-catenin in HepG2 cells is caused by a large gene deletion (loss of amino acids 20-140) involving loss of the GSK-3&#x003b2; regulatory site, which leads to failure of the protein to be phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b2;. Thus, &#x003b2;-catenin constitutively accumulates in the nucleus of HepG2 cells and may escape regulation by the anti-Wnt-1 antibody acting upstream. Similar results were observed by Shih <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], who found that the restoration of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs; extracellular signaling glycoproteins that antagonize Wnt signaling) attenuated Wnt signaling in Huh6 cells (with a &#x003b2;-catenin point mutation), but not in HepG2 cells with truncated &#x003b2;-catenin. However, as the incidence of similar &#x003b2;-catenin truncation is low in human HCC (only 1 out of 26 HCC patients had &#x003b2;-catenin truncation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the anti-Wnt-1 antibody has potential wide applicability in the majority of HCC patients.</p><p>Activation of &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf4 transcription by Wnt-1 has been reported to be responsible for Wnt-1-mediated cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] also demonstrated that Wnt-1 caused 3T3-L1 cells to resist apoptosis in response to serum deprivation through inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity and stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin. Conversely, blockade of Wnt-1 signaling using Wnt-1 antibodies have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cell lines, including non small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer mesothelioma, and sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Additionally, the over-expression of survivin promotes proliferation in HCC by initiating cell cycle entry (a decrease in the G0/G1 phase and an increase in the S phase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Its inhibition led to cell cycle arrest, an effect which can augment the sensitivity of HCC tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These three oncoproteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1, and survivin) have important functional roles in the development of HCC, and the ability to regulate them simultaneously offers a powerful way to intervene with HCC progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that targeting Wnt-1 mediated Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling (which is frequently activated in HCC) may be a feasible and novel therapeutic option. The specific and effective blockade of this signaling pathway using an anti-Wnt-1 antibody inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Correspondingly, suppression of HCC tumor xenograft growth and apoptosis were also observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ability of the anti-Wnt-1 antibody to down-regulate the expression of downstream targets of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, and survivin, suggest that a broad spectrum of cellular mechanisms can be triggered in concert to halt HCC tumor growth. Lastly, since Wnt-1 is often deregulated in HCC with underlying HBV or HCV (the main risks factors of HCC), we propose that interference with Wnt-1 mediated signaling offers a potent and selective therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of a substantial proportion of HCC patients with Wnt-1 over-expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples and cell lines</title><p>Paired (HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver) tissues were obtained from seven patients who underwent liver resection for HCC at Stanford Hospital, Stanford University, California.

Anti-Wnt-1 antibody and control IgG were added at desired final concentrations (range from 0-20 &#x003bc;g/ml), and further incubated for 72 h before cell viability and proliferation were assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) or .CellTiter 96<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for the .CellTiter-Glo assay, the assay regents (a combination of detergent and luciferase-based enzyme) were directly added to cultured cells, resulting in cell lysis and the production of a bioluminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. Luciferase activity was measured on a luminometer (Berthold LB-96V) and values were normalized to the ATP activity and compared with their respective PBS control value, which was set at 100. Three independent experiments were done, each in triplicates. For proliferation assay, optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm using a SAFIRE microplate reader (TECAN, Research Triangle Park).
