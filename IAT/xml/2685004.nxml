INI1/hSNF5 is a component of the SWI/SNF complex that interacts with HIV-1 IN, is selectively incorporated into HIV-1 (but not other retroviral) virions, and modulates multiple steps, including particle production and infectivity. To gain further insight into the role of INI1 in HIV-1 replication, we screened for INI1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that SAP18 (Sin3a associated protein 18 kD), a component of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex, directly binds to INI1 in yeast, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, we found that IN also binds to SAP18 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. SAP18 and components of a Sin3A-HDAC1 complex were specifically incorporated into HIV-1 (but not SIV and HTLV-1) virions in an HIV-1 IN&#x02013;dependent manner. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we found that HIV-1 (but not SIV) virion preparations harbour significant deacetylase activity, indicating the specific recruitment of catalytically active HDAC into the virions. To determine the requirement of virion-associated HDAC1 to HIV-1 replication, an inactive, transdominant negative mutant of HDAC1 (HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup>) was utilized. Incorporation of HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> decreased the virion-associated histone deacetylase activity. Furthermore, incorporation of HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> decreased the infectivity of HIV-1 (but not SIV) virions. The block in infectivity due to virion-associated HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> occurred specifically at the early reverse transcription stage, while entry of the virions was unaffected. RNA-interference mediated knock-down of HDAC1 in producer cells resulted in decreased virion-associated HDAC1 activity and a reduction in infectivity of these virions. These studies indicate that HIV-1 IN and INI1/hSNF5 bind SAP18 and selectively recruit components of Sin3a-HDAC1 complex into HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, HIV-1 virion-associated HDAC1 is required for efficient early post-entry events, indicating a novel role for HDAC1 during HIV-1 replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The interaction between the host and HIV-1 virus is a dynamic process. While some host cellular proteins mount antiviral response, HIV-1 utilizes other host proteins for its propagation. It is crucial to understand the role of host proteins in HIV-1 replication for successful development of strategies to combat AIDS. INI1/hSNF5 is a cellular protein that directly binds to an HIV-1 protein, integrase (IN). It is selectively encapsidated into HIV-1 virions and is required for the subsequent viral replication. However, how INI1 mediates its effects is not completely understood. Here we report a novel finding that INI1 as well as IN directly binds to SAP18 (Sin3a-associated protein of 18 kD), a component of the cellular Sin3a/HDAC (Histone Deacetylase) complex. The HDAC complexes are multiprotein epigenetic modifiers known to affect cellular transcription. In this report we find that along with INI1, SAP18 and the components of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex are specifically recruited into HIV-1 virions. In addition, we find that virion-associated deacetylase activity is required for efficient reverse transcription in target cells. These studies indicate that HIV-1 IN protein may recruit HDAC1 complex into the virions for utilizing them in the subsequent stages of replication. Our findings provide new insight into the roles of cellular HDAC1 complex in HIV-1 replication and provide a novel paradigm to understand host-virus dynamic interaction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 replication is characterized by a dynamic interplay between the host and the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Sorin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While host restriction factors inhibit HIV-1 replication at various steps, HIV-1 actively engages cellular proteins for its own replication and for subversion of antiviral effects. Several host factors that either restrict or promote HIV-1 replication have been identified in recent years. A high-throughput screening of siRNA mediated knock-down of cellular proteins identified several hundred host proteins that played activating or inhibitory roles in HIV-1 replication highlighting the importance of studying host-virus interaction during HIV-1 replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Brass1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. While the high through-put screen allows the identification of proteins whose loss of function is not lethal to cells, it is likely that many host factors that are both essential for cellular function and play a role in HIV-1 replication were not identified in such a screen. Several host factors including INI1/hSNF5 and LEDGF, both of which directly bind to HIV-1 integrase (IN), a virally encoded protein required for insertion viral cDNA into host chromosomal DNA, have been identified using the yeast two hybrid system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Cherepanov1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Kalpana1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. LEDGF appears to be involved in tethering integrase to transcriptionally active regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Poeschla1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, INI1/hSNF5 appears to play dual roles in HIV-1 replication in that while INI1/hSNF5 present in the producer cells appears to be required for HIV-1 replication, INI1/hSNF5 present in the target cells may be inhibitory. Our previous studies have indicated that ectopic (cytoplasmic) expression of a dominant negative mutant of INI1, harboring the minimal IN-binding domain, inhibits HIV-1 p24 release in a manner dependent on IN-INI1 interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Yung1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Knock-down studies suggested that INI1 is antiviral and inhibits early events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Maroun1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. One possibility is that cellular INI1 may play a different role than the virally incorporated INI1 explaining the observed effects on HIIV-1 replication.</p><p>The complex role of INI1 during HIV-1 replication necessitates deciphering of its cellular function. INI1/hSNF5 also known as BAF47 or SMARCB1, is a component of the human chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. SWI/SNF is an evolutionarily conserved, multi-subunit, high molecular weight (&#x0003e;2 MDa) complex that remodels chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner. The SWI/SNF complex consists of at least nine subunits that are conserved among eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Martens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these are four core subunits that are required for chromatin remodelling, including the key ATPase subunit (BRG1, BRM, SWI2/SNF2), INI1/hSNF5, BAF170 and BAF155. There are two functionally distinct classes of SWI/SNF complexes in mammalian cells, hSWI/SNF-A or BAF and hSWI/SNF-B or PBAF, and three additional complexes that consist of a mixture of components derived from HDAC (histone deacetylase complex) and SWI/SNF including hBRM, hBRG1 (I) and hBRG1 (II) complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Martens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It is important to note that INI1/hSNF5 is present in each of these SWI/SNF complexes, suggesting multiple functions for this protein in mammalian cells. The stoichiometry, sub nuclear distribution and exact functions of SWI/SNF complexes have yet to be clearly defined in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Martens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. INI1 is also a tumour suppressor biallelically deleted in highly malignant paediatric tumours known as rhabdoid tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Versteege1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We have found that INI1 causes G0&#x02013;G1 arrest, and represses <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> transcription by directly recruiting HDAC1 (histone deacetylase) to its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that INI1 can mediate both repression and activation of cellular transcription. But the exact mechanism by which INI1 recruits HDAC1 to the promoters to mediate transcriptional repression is unknown.</p><p>Here we report that INI1 and IN directly associate with SAP18, a component of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex. We report a surprising finding that components of Sin3a-HDAC1, but not the core components of the SWI/SNF complex are specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, we found that incorporation of a dominant negative mutant of HDAC1 decreases the HDAC1 activity associated with the HIV-1 virions and that this decrease in HDAC1 activity is correlated to a decrease in infectivity of these virions. Finally, we demonstrate that HDAC1 activity is required for modulating a post-entry step at or before reverse transcription during HIV-1 replication. These results indicate an unanticipated role of IN and INI1 in recruiting the HDAC1 complex, independent of SWI/SNF complex, into HIV-1 virions and provide new insights into the role of INI1/hSNF5 and Sin3a-HDAC1 complex in HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>INI1 directly interacts with SAP18, a component of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex</title><p>Since INI1/hSNF5 is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Yung1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Yung2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, we tested to determine if other core components of SWI/SNF complex such as BRG1, BAF155, and BAF170, were present in the virus particles.

The results indicated that &#x003b1;-HA and &#x003b1;-HDAC1 antibodies were able to co-immunoprecipitate HA-INI1/hSNF5 and HDAC1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3, 5, 9, and 11), while the control antibodies did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 4, 6, 10, and 12). Additionally, &#x003b1;-HA antibodies co-immunoprecipitated BRG1, consistent with INI1 being part of the SWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 9). We probed the above co-immunoprecipitates with antibodies against CHD3, an exclusive component of NuRD complex. While &#x003b1;-HDAC1 antibody co-immunoprecipitated CHD3, &#x003b1;-HA antibody did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 5 and 11). Furthermore, another component of NuRD complex, MTA1 was also not pulled down by HA-INI1 in the same immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These results suggested that INI1/hSNF5 specifically associates with the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex.</p><p>To further establish that components of Sin3a-HDAC1 complex associate with INI1, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence and absence of HIV-1 vectors, and a plasmid expressing FLAG-INI1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies indicated an association of SAP18 and HDAC1 with INI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 5). Interestingly, association of these components and Sin3A was enriched when cells were cotransfected with HIV-1 vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 7). This enrichment was not due to an increase in the level of these components in the presence of HIV-1 vector, as the input control from cells expressing Flag-INI1 with or without co-transfection of HIV-1 vectors indicated identical levels of expression of INI1, BRG1, SAP18, HDAC1 and Sin3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2, in the presence and absence of HIV-1). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies resulted in similar amounts of FLAG-INI1 both in the presence and absence of viral vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 7). These results suggested that association of SAP18, HDAC1 and Sin3a is preferentially increased in the presence of HIV-1, despite the presence of similar levels of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 5 to 7). This is consistent with the idea that HIV-1 IN also binds to SAP18. Since both IN and INI1 bind to SAP18, it is possible that association of INI1 with SAP18-Sin3a-HDAC1 complex is increased upon HIV-1 infection. In fact, we have found that co-expression of IN with INI1 increases the ability of INI1 to co-immunoprecipitate HDAC1, consistent with our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000463.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, we found that co-expression of GFP-IN with FL-SAP18 in INI1&#x02212;/&#x02212; MON cells results in weak association of IN with SAP18 in the absence of INI1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000463.s003">Figure S3</xref>). As a control, we demonstrate that BRG1, a known protein associated with INI1, co-immunoprecipitates equally well in the presence and absence of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 7).</p><p>There are at least four classes of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, grouped according to their homology to yeast histone deacetylases. Class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8) are homologous to yeast Rpd3 and are localized in the nucleus, with the exception of HDAC3, which localizes to both nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Hildmann1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are part of the Sin3A-HDAC1 complex. To further test the specificity of association of various HDACs with INI1, we probed the INI1 co-immunoprecipitates with HDAC3, a class I HDAC, not present in the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex. Our results indicated that HDAC3 was not co-immunoprecipitated by FLAG-INI1 in the presence or absence of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 5 and 7). Furthermore, the specificity of &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies to pull down FLAG-INI1 was indicated by the fact that no co-immunoprecipitation of components of Sin3a-HDAC1 complex was obtained by &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies in cells expressing HA-INI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 9). These results together indicate a selective association of INI1 with the components of SIN3a-HDAC1, and enhancement of this association in the presence of HIV-1 proteins.</p><p>To further confirm that IN, INI1 and SAP18 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation studies using cells transiently transfected with combinations of either YFP-IN and HA-INI1, HA-INI1 and FLAG-SAP18, YFP-IN and FLAG-SAP18 or all the three proteins simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2D&#x02013;G</xref>). The antibodies to FLAG, HA, or GFP (as they are cross reactive with YFP) were used for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. We found that &#x003b1;-FLAG antibodies could co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-SAP18 and HA-INI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), &#x003b1;-HA antibodies could co-immunoprecipitate HA-INI1 and YFP-IN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and &#x003b1;-GFP antibodies could co-immunoprecipitate YFP-IN and FLAG-SAP18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), confirming the interaction of pairs of these proteins, <italic>in vivo</italic>.

To further establish the stringency of our immunoprecipitation reactions, we subjected the &#x003b1;-GFP immunoprecipitates from the cells transfected with YFP-IN to silver staining. We found that only a select set of protein bands specific to &#x003b1;-GFP lane was observed, indicating the stringency of immunoprecipitation reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000463.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Components of the Sin3A-HDAC1 complex are specifically incorporated into HIV-1 but not SIV<sub>mac</sub> particles in an IN-dependent manner</title><p>Since INI1 is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions and the other components of SWI/SNF complex are not, we examined the possibility that INI1-associated components of SIN3a-HDAC1 complex could be recruited to HIV-1 virions. HIV-1 virions were purified, treated with subtilisin and subjected to sequential immunoblot analysis using antibodies to components of SWI/SNF complex and that of Sin3a-HDAC1 complex. The results of these analyses indicated that while INI1/hSNF5, SAP18, SAP30, and HDAC1 were incorporated into virions, the components of the SWI/SNF complex were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2).

To our knowledge, specific recruitment of HDAC proteins to virions has not been documented before, either for HIV-1 or any other virus. Therefore, we decided to further investigate specifically the role of virion-associated HDAC1 in HIV-1 replication.</p><p>We first examined for the presence of deacetylase activity in HIV-1 virion preparations to ensure that the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex is catalytically active. A fluorescence-based assay was used to detect the presence of deacetylase activity in two different preparations of virions including HIV-1<sub>R3B</sub>, and three-plasmid based HIV-1 vectors, using histones as substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The results indicated the presence of HDAC activity that was above background and directly proportional to the amount of virus assayed. This activity was sensitive to 4 &#x000b5;M TSA (trichostatin A), a non-specific inhibitor of deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000463-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The HDAC activity present in mock varied from batch to batch (perhaps due to the presence of cellular HDACs). Therefore, the HDAC activity of each virus preparation was normalized by subtracting mock activity. Furthermore, to eliminate the contaminating cellular HDAC proteins, we treated both virion and mock preparations with subtilisin and found that virion preparations have subtilisin-resistant HDAC1 activity, while mock preparations do not, indicating that HDAC1 activity is incorporated specifically within the virion cores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000463.s005">Figure S5</xref>). It should be noted that deacetylase activities of different virion preparations varied considerably depending on the type of virus, the HDAC1 activity kit and sample preparation.

Interaction of the SWI/SNF complex with components of the HDAC1 complex has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Martens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Sif1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results demonstrate that INI1/hSNF5 and IN directly interacts with SAP18, a component of Sin3a-HDAC1 complex. Furthermore, for the first time, we find that components of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex are selectively recruited into HIV-1 virions. It is also interesting to note that core components of the SWI/SNF complex such as BRG1, BRM, BAF155 and BAF170 are absent from HIV-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report where association of INI1 with components of an HDAC1 complex has been demonstrated in the absence of the SWI/SNF complex. We believe that further analysis of this association will lead to uncovering novel biological functions of INI1 and the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex.</p><p>The recruitment of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex appears to be specific to HIV-1 and dependent on IN. However, more experiments are needed to determine if IN alone can recruit the complex into virions and if INI1 is required for this function. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that HIV-1 virions harbour deacetylase activity, which is reduced when a catalytically inactive mutant, HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup>, is incorporated into virions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an HDAC1 activity associated with HIV-1 particles. Expression of HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> in producer cells leads to two distinct effects: (i) enhancement of p24 release; and (ii) a statistically significant decrease in the infectivity of the particles produced. These effects appear to be specific to HIV-1 and not SIV. Furthermore, knocking down HDAC1 in the producer cells also resulted in decrease of virion-associated HDAC1 activity and reduction in infectivity of those particles, consistent with the results of the HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> mutant.</p><p>We surmise that the increase in particle production observed when HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> is expressed is due to the derepression of viral and/or cellular transcription. We found that intracellular p24 was indeed increased when HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> mutant was expressed (data not shown), consistent with this idea. The decrease in infectivity of HIV-1 virions harbouring HDAC1<sup>H141A</sup> is directly correlated to a decrease in virion-associated deacetylase activity. While the HIV-1-associated deacetylase activity is not required for entry into target cells, it appears to be required for early reverse transcription. These results suggest that virion-associated Sin3a-HDAC1 complex is required for either efficient reverse transcription or uncoating after entry. It is interesting to note that virions produced in <italic>INI1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells are defective for reverse transcription, and that INI1 is associated with the HIV-1 reverse transcription complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Sorin2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Iordanskiy1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, many laboratories including ours, have demonstrated that IN directly interacts with RT and that mutants of IN affect RT function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Engleman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Zhu1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations raise the possibility that one mechanism by which IN influences RT function is via the recruitment of the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex through its direct interaction with SAP18 and INI1. Future experiments to address the relationship between binding of IN to INI1 and SAP18, and its influence on RT function, are likely to shed new light on the dynamic and functional interaction between HIV-1 RT, IN and IN-associated complexes.</p><p>Our results also parallel an earlier report where, it was demonstrated that cellular Sin3a protein was required for retrotransposition of <italic>Schistosaccharomyces pombe</italic> transposon, Tf1. In the Tf1 system, Sin3a appears to be required for a post reverse transcription event and mutations in <italic>Sin3a</italic> block a step before nuclear entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Dang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This genetic study indicated that the Sin3a-HDAC1 complex is required for a step other than viral transcription in retroviral/retrotransposon replication. However, in the case of HIV-1, we have found that the Sin3A-HDAC1 complex is required for early reverse transcription. Future experiments are required to uncover the exact mechanism by which virion-associated HDAC1 modulates post entry events of HIV-1.</p><p>INI1 appears to play a complex role in HIV-1 replication due to its multitude of effects. Studies using INI1 dominant negative mutants as well as p24 release in <italic>INI1</italic>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) cells indicated that INI1 is required for HIV-1 replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Yung1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Sorin2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, particle produced in INI1&#x02212;/&#x02212; MON cells were defective for infection and were blocked at the stage of reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Sorin2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. These latter results are consistent with the current report in that virion-associated HDAC1 activity is required for efficient early events of HIV-1. On the contrary, Maroun et al reported that while knocking-down INI1 in the producer cells has no effect, knocking-down INI1 in the target cells increases infection of the virus, indicating that it is an anti-viral protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Maroun1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, virions produced in the INI1 knock-down cells were not analyzed for the presence of INI1 and hence the data is not interpretable. Furthermore, it is possible that INI1 was not completely knocked-down in the producer cells and that INI1 in the target cells plays different roles to INI1 in the producer cells.</p><p>Studies on siRNA-mediated knock-down of INI1 is complicated due to the fact that INI1 is a tumour suppressor and it is required for the survival of many cell types.

Because of these reasons, it is important to first to segregate multiple effects of INI1 on cellular and viral functions to fully comprehend its effect on HIV-1 replication.</p><p>Based on our current study, we hypothesize that while the virion-associated INI1-Sin3a-HDAC1 complex may affect early reverse transcription, cellular INI1 associated with the SWI/SNF complex may have antiviral effects in target cells. It is possible that deacetylation of a substrate (an acetylated viral or cellular protein) by virion-associated HDAC1, is required to mediate efficient early reverse transcription of HIV-1. The acetylated viral or cellular protein may block early post-entry events and deacetylation may be necessary to overcome this block. Alternatively, a viral or cellular protein required for an early event may need deacetylation to become active. While histones are classic substrates that are modified by acetylation and deacetylation, an increasing list of non-histone proteins that are similarly modified have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Kuo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively, other viral proteins or unidentified cellular proteins could be substrates for deacetylation by the virion-associated Sin3a-HDAC1 complex.</p><p>While our studies investigate the virion encapsidation and functional significance of Sin3A-HDAC1 complex in HIV-1 replication, a recent report illustrated the association of NURD, another HDAC1 complex, with the HCMV viral protein UL38. In this case, association of UL38 with HDAC1 complex leads to inhibition of host stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Moorman1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether association of IN, INI1 with the SAP18-HDAC1 complex also serves to inhibit host stress response remains to be determined. We have recently found that INI1 is involved in inducing an interferon response in rhabdoid tumour cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000463-Morozov1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. By binding to INI1 and SAP18, HIV-1 IN may inhibit anti-viral interferon response during infection. Future experiments to determine such interference of the host innate immune response (due to the binding of viral and cellular proteins such as IN, INI1, and the SAP18-HDAC1 complex), are likely to shed novel insight into complex host-virus interactions. Furthermore, we believe that strategies involving disruption of IN-INI1-SAP18-HDAC1 interactions or selective targeting of virion-associated HDAC complexes may lead to novel methods to inhibit HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids</title><p>pGEX-SAP18 expressing GST-SAP18 was generated by cloning into pGEX3xPL, a BamH1-EcoRI fragment obtained by PCR amplification of a full length <italic>SAP18</italic> EST clone (IMAGE 364760, GenBank accession number AA025356) using primers <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTGACGGAAAATGAATTCAAC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGCCGTAAGAGGATCCTGGCGGTC-3&#x02032;</named-content>.
