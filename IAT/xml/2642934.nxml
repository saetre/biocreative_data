Transgenic mice that overexpress IGF-1 in the lens have been previously described. To further understand the ocular functions of this growth factor family, the in vivo effects of insulin expression on lens development were investigated using transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Expression of insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in mouse lens was examined by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Transgenic mice that overexpress insulin in the lens were generated using two different promoters: a fiber-cell specific &#x003b1;A-crystallin (&#x003b1;A) promoter and a modified &#x003b1;A-promoter linked to the chicken &#x003b4;1-crystallin enhancer (called the &#x003b4;en&#x003b1;A promoter). The &#x003b4;en&#x003b1;A promoter is active in both lens epithelial and fiber cells. The lens phenotypes were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Protein expression was examined by western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Normal mouse lenses express both the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and their expression is highest at the lens periphery where the germinative and transitional zones are located. In transgenic mice, insulin expression in the lens induced cataract formation. The severity of the cataracts reflected the level of transgene expression, independent of the type of promoter used. In severely affected families, the spherical shape of the lens was altered and the lenses were smaller than normal. Histological analysis showed no evidence of premature differentiation of the anterior epithelial cells. In contrast to the IGF-1 mice, insulin transgenic mice exhibited an anterior shift in the location of the germinative and transitional zones, leading to a reduction of the lens epithelial compartment. Additional alterations included expansion of the lens transitional zone, variable nuclear positioning in the lens bow region, and inhibition of fiber cell denucleation and terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Elevated intraocular insulin does not enhance proliferation nor induce differentiation of mouse lens epithelial cells. Since an increase in IGF-1 causes a posterior shift of the lens geminative and transitional zones, while an increase in insulin causes an anterior shift of these zones, our results suggest that these two growth factors may work together to control the location of this structural domain during normal lens development. Our data also suggest that increased insulin-signaling activity in the lens can antagonize the endogenous signals that are responsible for fiber cell maturation and terminal differentiation.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lens is a highly organized and polarized tissue. Growth and development of the lens depend on proper spatial regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. The central lens epithelial cells are relatively quiescent while the epithelial cells near the periphery (the germinative zone) show a higher proliferative index. As the epithelial cells in the germinative zone proliferate, cells posterior to this zone are pushed into the transitional zone where they are induced to elongate and differentiate into the lens fiber cells. The newly differentiated fiber cells accumulate in a concentric manner on top of the previously differentiated fiber cells in the bow region. As the immature fiber cells migrate toward the lens core, their nuclei and intracellular organelles degrade to result in mature fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p>Growth factors have been implicated as regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation during lens development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Gain-of-function studies in mice show that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) can function as differentiation inducers, while platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) function mainly as mitogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The function of insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) is unclear. Experiments in chicken lens epithelial explants show that insulin and IGFs can induce epithelial-to-fiber differentiation, as measured by cell elongation and an increase in &#x003b4;-crystallin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In contrast, insulin and IGFs were weak differentiation factors for rat lens epithelial cells in explant cultures. However, these growth factors appeared capable of enhancing or maintaining the differentiation phenotype induced by FGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. In transgenic mice generated to overexpress IGF-1 in the lens by means of the mouse &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], lens epithelial cells were found to not undergo premature differentiation, which is consistent with the observation that IGF-1 itself is not a differentiation inducer in rodent lens explants. Interestingly, the lens growth pattern in IGF-1 mice was perturbed and the lens epithelial compartment was extended more posteriorly than in normal mice.</p><p>Insulin and IGF-1 act through two related cell surface receptors, insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. These two receptors have a high degree of sequence similarity and both are expressed in most mammalian cell types, although at different levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Each receptor has a high affinity for its cognate ligand, whereas the binding affinities of insulin to IGF-1R and IGF-1 to IR are about 100 fold lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, although IR and IGF-1R are highly conserved from a structural standpoint and share common intracellular signaling pathways, their in vivo physiological functions are quite distinct. IR is primarily important for fuel metabolism, while IGF-1R is primarily important for cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. There are two main intracellular pathways that are activated by insulin and IGF-1 receptors: the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. The IRS-PI3K pathway leads to the activation of the three Akt isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Activated Akt can phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], pro-apoptotic protein BAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], and transcription factor FOXO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], leading to stimulation of glycogen synthesis, cell survival, and gene expression, respectively. Activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway occurs through the recruitment of the SH2-domain proteins Shc, Grb2, and the exchange factor SOS (son of sevenless) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The current consensus, which probably constitutes an oversimplified model, is that the acute metabolic effects of insulin require activation of the IRS-PI3K pathway, while stimulation of cell growth and proliferation requires the Ras-MAPK cascade.</p><p>Gene knockout experiments have provided further evidence that IR and IGF-1R have overlapping yet diverse functions in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Mice lacking either IR or IGF-1R are born with growth retardation of different severity. IGF-1R-null newborn mice are 45% of normal weight, whereas IR-null mice are 90% of normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. IGF-1R null mice are born with multiple abnormalities, including hypoplastic muscles, delayed bone development, and thin epidermis, and die immediately after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. In contrast, IR null mice develop severe diabetes at an early postnatal age and die of diabetic ketoacidosis, suggesting that IR action is essential for postnatal fuel metabolism and this function cannot be substituted by IGF-1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Lens defects have not been reported in these gene knockout mice.</p><p>Lens epithelial cells in explants respond to either IGF-1 or insulin in a similar fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. To gain further understanding of the function of these growth factors in lens development, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress insulin in the lens with two different promoters: the mouse &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter and the newly developed &#x003b4;en&#x003b1;A-promoter. With the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter, transgene expression was restricted to the lens fiber cells, whereas the &#x003b4;en&#x003b1;A-promoter directed expression in both lens epithelial and fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Analysis of the transgenic mice has revealed that the severity of the lens defects was dependent on the transgene expression level rather than the cell-specific expression pattern. Like IGF-1, insulin expression did not induce premature differentiation of lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, insulin expression caused an anterior shift and expansion of the transitional zone and an inhibition of fiber cell terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RNA isolation and RT-PCR</title><p>All animals were used in accordance with the Association of Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, which is comparable to the animal care guidelines of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research. Wild type (FVB/N) mouse lenses were obtained at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) or at birth (P0), and homogenized in TRI REAGENT (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to extract total RNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on 10 ng total lens RNA using the OneStep RT-PCR kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). For mouse IGF-1R (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molvis.org/molvis/external.cgi?gbdna=NM_010513">NM_010513</ext-link>), sense (5'-GAG GAC TGT CAT CTC CAA CC-3') and antisense (5'-CGA TTC TTT CAC GCA TAC TTG C-3') primers were used to amplify a 778 base pair (bp) cDNA fragment. For mouse IR (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molvis.org/molvis/external.cgi?gbdna=NM_010568">NM_010568</ext-link>), the sense (5'-GAA GAT CAC CCT TCT TCG AG-3') and antisense (5'-CAG TGA GTC TCT CTG GAC AG-3') primers generated a fragment of 736 bp. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization under ultraviolet (UV) light. The PCR fragments were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced to verify their identities. These plasmids were also used to generate riboprobes for in situ hybridization to detect the expression patterns of IR and IGF-1R in the mouse lens.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>Embryonic heads and postnatal eyes were removed from mice and fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin.

After overnight hybridization, the slides were washed, digested with RNase A, and washed again to remove unhybridized probes. Slides were coated with Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed at 4 &#x000b0;C for a week. After developing the slides in the Kodak D-19 developer, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Briefly, tissue sections were incubated with blocking solution (5% non-immune serum in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) for 30 min at room temperature and then with primary antibodies overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The source and dilution ratio for each primary antibody are as follows: anti-BrdU (1:100; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), anti &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- or &#x003b3;-crystallins (gifts from Dr. Samuel Zigler at the National Eye Institute; 1:500, 1:1000, or 1:2000, respectively), anti-cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I (catalog number A6403, 1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, 1:200; Stressgen, Victoria, BC Canada), anti-phospho-ERK (pERK) and anti-Shc (1:100; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated (Vector Laboratories) or fluorescein-conjugated (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS twice. For immunofluorescent staining, cell nuclei were stained with 300 nM 4',6-diaminino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed twice with PBS, mounted in coverslips with 50% glycerol in PBS, and examined under UV illumination. Alternatively, for color detection of immunogens, an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method was used (kit PK-4002; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with diaminobenzidine-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a substrate (Sigma).

Protease inhibitors (Set III kit from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and phosphatase inhibitors (Set II kit from Calbiochem) were added freshly each time. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and an aliquot was taken for protein determination using the BCA method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. For crystallin assays, 10 &#x003bc;g of protein were denatured in 2X SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading. For other antigens reported in this study, 100 &#x003bc;g of total lens protein were used. Proteins were separated on 4-12% gradient gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Invitrogen). The blots were immersed in blocking buffer for 1 h, and then incubated with the primary antibody at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight. The dilution ratios for anti &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallin primary antibody were 1:3000, 1:6000, and 1:10,000, respectively. Antibodies against ERK, pERK, Akt, pAKT (Cell Signaling), and PDI (Stressgen) were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and the antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).

In many different cell types, IR activation turns on downstream signaling pathways involving Ras and PI3K, which subsequently activate the Akt kinase and/or the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. To explore insulin-activated signaling in the mouse lens, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). The levels of phosphorylated (active) ERK (both pERK1 and pERK2) were increased 2-3 fold in the transgenic lenses while the total ERK protein level was unchanged. Surprisingly, phosphorylated and total Akt protein levels in the transgenic lenses were the same as those in the wild type lenses. These results suggest that the phenotypic changes in the insulin transgenic lenses are mediated through the ERK, rather than the Akt, signaling pathway.</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>ERK and Akt protein and phosphorylation levels.

The pERK staining pattern was altered in the transgenic lenses, with the lens cortex showing more pERK-positive fiber cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Transgenic mice that overexpress IGF-1 in the lens have been previously generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. IGF-1 by itself did not function as a differentiation factor, but it did modify the architecture of the lens by causing the germinative and transitional zones to extend toward the posterior pole of the lens. In the current study, we have generated transgenic mice that overexpress insulin in lens fiber cells and in both lens epithelial cells and fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. We found that insulin and IGF-1 transgenic mice have similar yet distinct phenotypes. Neither insulin nor IGF-1 was sufficient to induce premature differentiation of the lens epithelial cells in vivo. This result was consistent with the findings in rat lens explants where neither IGF nor insulin alone induced epithelial-to-fiber differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Elevated levels of insulin or IGF-1 produced slight modifications of the cell proliferation pattern, but the lens epithelium in both genotypes remained as a monolayer. This result is different from the effect of PDGF-A on lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>].</p><p>In both the insulin and IGF-1 transgenic mice, fiber cell maturation was perturbed and the transitional zone was expanded. An interesting difference was the location of the lens germinative and transitional zones. In the IGF-1 mice, the lens epithelial compartment was expanded and the germinative zone was localized more posterior than in the wild type lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. In contrast, the lens transitional zone was moved anteriorly in the insulin transgenic mice. These changes correlated with slight changes in BrdU-labeling in the IGF-1 and insulin mice. Our data suggest that IGF and insulin are not direct inducers of fiber cell differentiation. Instead, members of the insulin growth factor family may play supportive roles in fine tuning lens growth and differentiation to achieve a normal lens structure and shape.</p><p>It has been shown that one role of Shc in cells is to promote the formation of a Shc-Grb2-SOS complex, which can activate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated that cell proliferation during lens development depends on the activity of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. Thus, the slightly enhanced cell proliferation signal in IGF-1-overexpressing transgenic mice could be explained by an increase in Ras-ERK signaling activity. In the lenses of the insulin transgenic mice, we showed that ERK activity and Shc expression were enhanced in the differentiating fiber cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylated Akt and IRS-1 expression were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>, and data not shown). It is possible that IR activates additional signaling pathways, which override the Shc-ERK proliferation signal and initiate an early epithelial-to-fiber transition. Analyzing additional signaling pathways may help resolve this paradox.</p><p>In most of the transgenic families (except LR20), fiber cell differentiation was disrupted by insulin overexpression. Fiber elongation was incomplete and cell nuclei, mitochondria, and ER were retained in the central fiber cells. Our data suggest that insulin signaling may antagonize the endogenous signals that are required for late-stage fiber differentiation. At present, the molecular mechanisms that regulate fiber cell terminal differentiation, such as denucleation and organelle degradation, have not been defined. Apoptosis-related proteins may have a role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. It was recently suggested that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might be involved in the breakdown of intracellular organelles during fiber differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. We have not investigated whether these activities are affected in the transgenic lenses. Based on studies in other systems, IGF and insulin are known to be inhibitors of cell death. Our western blot analysis and immunostaining showed that ERK phosphorylation was increased, whereas the pAkt level was unaffected in the insulin transgenic lenses. Therefore, the increased ERK activity could be contributing to the disruption of the fiber differentiation program.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that insulin overexpression in the lens is not sufficient to initiate epithelial-to-fiber cell differentiation, but it can alter lens growth and fiber cell maturation. Combined with the previous study of the IGF-1 transgenic mice, our data suggest that insulin and IGF-1 could have overlapping yet distinct functions in lens development. We propose that, during lens development, neither IGF-1 nor insulin is a differentiation inducer. Instead, they function as modifiers of fiber cell morphology. The balance between IGF-1 and insulin signaling in the lens may help to finely tune lens growth and maturation. Additionally, our study suggests that fiber cell terminal differentiation requires downregulation of insulin-activated signaling pathways. Elevated ERK activity may antagonize the endogenous apoptotic-like or proteolytic activities that are involved in late stage fiber cell differentiation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Sam Zigler for the anti-crystallin antibodies, Shanyu Ho and Denise Chang for assistance in animal husbandry and genotyping, and Sharon Morey for editing the manuscript.
