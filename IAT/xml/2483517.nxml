Loss of <italic>Dicer2</italic>, a key enzyme in the RNAi pathway, not only results in decondensation of heterochromatin but also leads to accumulation of extrachromosomal circular (ecc) repeated DNAs. Ligase IV, an essential regulator of nonhomologous end joining, and perhaps other DNA damage repair machinery, participate in ecc DNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peng and Karpen, 2007</xref>). This suggests that, in addition to increased accessibility of DNA repair and recombination proteins to repeated DNA caused by heterochromatin decondensation, activation of the DNA damage response may also contribute to the formation of ecc DNA in <italic>Dicer2</italic> mutant cells. DNA replication timing is tightly regulated and correlates with chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donaldson, 2005</xref>), and the timing of satellite DNA replication is misregulated in <italic>Dicer</italic>-deficient embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2007</xref>). Stalled and collapsed replication forks elicit the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sancar et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, RNAi is postulated to function as the genome's immune system that defends against molecular parasites such as transposons and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Plasterk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fire, 2005</xref>), and loss of Dicer may activate transposons, which in turn leads to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasior et al., 2006</xref>). These observations collectively suggest that DNA damage response may be elicited in <italic>Dicer</italic>-deficient cells.</p><p>Innate immunity genes are misregulated in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> deficient in <italic>Dicer</italic>, <italic>RDE-4</italic>, or <italic>RDE-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Welker et al., 2007</xref>). Mouse and human NKG2D ligands are up-regulated in nontumor cell lines by genotoxic stress and stalled DNA replication, conditions known to activate a major DNA damage checkpoint pathway initiated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that loss of Dicer elicits a DNA damage response, which in turn induces expression of NKG2D ligands.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To test whether loss of Dicer causes DNA damage, we knocked down Dicer in HEK293T cells and human hepatoma HepG2 cells using two different siRNAs. The frequency of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) was measured by immunostaining for the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (&#x003b3;-H2AX), a widely used marker for DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foster and Downs, 2005</xref>). Compared with mock-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells, intense &#x003b3;-H2AX staining was observed in Dicer knockdown HEK293T cells. Quantification of the data revealed an &#x0223c;10-fold increase in the number of Dicer knockdown HEK293T cells positive for &#x003b3;-H2AX compared with mock-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). These results suggest that DSBs accumulate in the absence of Dicer. Similar results were obtained with HepG2 cells. To confirm these results, we used immunofluorescence in Dicer knockdown, mock-transfected, and control siRNA-transfected cells to examine the distribution of replication protein A 70 (RPA70), a protein involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair, that becomes phosphorylated and forms intranuclear foci upon exposure of cells to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zou et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with &#x003b3;-H2AX staining, a much higher percentage of Dicer knockdown cells also displayed intense RPA foci, further indicating the accumulation of DNA damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murchison et al. (2005)</xref> found that Dicer-deficient embryonic stem cells displayed only a slight increase in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>0</sub> cells and a corresponding decrease in cells in G<sub>2</sub> and M phase. We also found that the cell cycle profile was not significantly affected by knocking down Dicer (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1</ext-link>), which excludes the possibility that increased &#x003b3;-H2AX and RPA foci are simply the consequence of an increased percentage of cells in S phase. Furthermore, an increase in checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) phosphorylation on S345, an event associated with DNA damage, was found in Dicer knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As a more direct assessment of DNA damage, comet assay revealed that knockdown of Dicer resulted in accumulation of DNA breaks, as indicated by formation of a comet-like tail after single-cell gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Upon exposure of cells to DNA damage, growth arrest&#x02013; and DNA damage&#x02013;inducible gene &#x003b1; (GADD45A), growth arrest&#x02013; and DNA damage&#x02013;inducible gene &#x003b2; (GADD45B), p21, B cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), and early growth response 1 (ERG1) are up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thyss et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">G&#x000e9;vry et al., 2007</xref>). Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA levels of these genes were increased in Dicer knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Loss of Dicer compromises miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hutv&#x000e1;gner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murchison et al., 2005</xref>). miRNAs regulate the expression of target mRNAs by repressing translation and/or by promoting mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006</xref>), therefore, up-regulation of these genes may be the result of compromised miRNA biogenesis rather than the result of DNA damage. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-RNA polymerase II antibody (RNAPol-ChIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sandoval et al., 2004</xref>) to check transcription of these DNA damage&#x02013;induced genes. Our results demonstrated that transcription of these genes was increased in Dicer knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), which suggests that increased stability of these transcripts caused by reduction of miRNAs is not the only, if any, reason to explain their elevated mRNA levels. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of IFN-&#x003b2;1, stat1, ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT2, OSA2, and UL16-binding protein (ULBP) 1, 2, and 3 were not up-regulated in Dicer knockdown cells compared with mock-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. S2 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted), which excludes the possibility that heterochromatin decondensation induced by Dicer knockdown leads to general up-regulation of transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DNA damage accumulation in Dicer knockdown cells.</bold> (A) DNA damage assayed by immunostaining for &#x003b3;-H2AX and RPA70.

Therefore, we tested whether NKG2D ligands were up-regulated in Dicer knockdown cells. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed markedly increased levels of major histocompatibility complex class I&#x02013;related molecules A and B (MICA and MICB) mRNAs in Dicer knockdown cells compared with mock-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), whereas the levels of ULBP1, -2, and -3 mRNAs were not significantly regulated by inhibiting the expression of Dicer (not depicted). Up-regulation of MICA and MICB was confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Lysis was partially inhibited by anti-NKG2D antibody, which indicated that up-regulated NKG2D ligands induce elevated lysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

The roles of ATR, ATM, and Chk1 in Dicer knockdown&#x02013;induced MICA and MICB up-regulation were investigated. Up-regulation of MICA and MICB in response to Dicer knockdown was blocked by caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR and ATM, and by staurosporine, an inhibitor of Chk1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801169/DC1</ext-link>). As a more specific test, expression of ATM, ATR, and Chk1 was repressed using siRNAs (Fig. S3, E and F). Up-regulation of MICA and MICB induced by Dicer knockdown was inhibited by cotransfection of Dicer siRNAs with ATR siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and S3 B). In contrast, cotransfection with control siRNA did not significantly affect Dicer knockdown&#x02013;induced up-regulation of MICA and MICB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of ATM and Chk1 expression by siRNAs also blocked MICA and MICB up-regulation in response to Dicer knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and S3, C and D). In addition, we demonstrated that DNA damage progressed in parallel with the kinetics of up-regulation of MICA and MICB in Dicer knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These data suggest that up-regulation of MICA and MICB is a consequence of DNA damage response activation. Compared with ATR suppression, ATM suppression had larger effects on MICA and MICB expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and S3, B and C), which suggests that MICA and MICB up-regulation is predominantly in response to DSBs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of DNA damage response prevents MICA and MICB up-regulation in Dicer knockdown cells.</bold> Dicer knockdown-induced MICA and MICB up-regulation was prevented by incubation with caffeine (C) or staurosporine (S) and by cotransfection with ATR siRNA (R), ATM siRNA (M), or Chk1 siRNA (K).

This raises the question whether up-regulation of MICA and MICB is the consequence of nonspecific activation of the mammalian immune system by Dicer-specific siRNAs. To address this question, we checked the phosphorylation status of PKR. Western blotting demonstrated that there was no increase in PKR phosphorylation in Dicer knockdown cells compared with mock-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. S2 A). In addition, Dicer knockdown did not affect the expression of IFN-&#x003b2;1, stat1, ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT2, and OSA2 (Fig. S2 B), six genes nonspecifically induced by a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) siRNA due to activation of the IFN system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sledz et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that up-regulation of MICA and MICB was an indirect consequence of nonspecific activation of the mammalian immune system by Dicer siRNAs. Although RNAPol-ChIP indicated that the transcription of MICA and MICB was increased in Dicer knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), further studies are necessary to determine whether up-regulation of MICA and MICB is also the consequence of increased stability due to reduction of miRNAs.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that suppression of Dicer expression leads to cellular clearance via DNA damage, and the subsequent DNA damage response up-regulates the expression of MICA and MICB, which in turn induces the NK-mediated destruction. RNAi constitutes a key component of the innate immune response to viral infection in both plants and invertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cullen, 2006</xref>) and has been postulated to act constitutively to silence the innate immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Welker et al., 2007</xref>). Our study suggests that RNAi is indirectly linked to the human innate immune system via the DNA damage pathway.</p><p>We propose the following model for how DNA damage is elicited in Dicer knockdown cells. Dicer is essential for heterochromatin formation and restricts the accessibility of DNA repair and recombination proteins to repeated DNA. Loss of Dicer leads to decondensation of heterochromatin and causes ecc DNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peng and Karpen, 2007</xref>), which may activate the DNA damage response. Furthermore, heterochromatin decondensation results in misregulation of DNA replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">J&#x000f8;rgensen et al., 2007</xref>) and causes DNA replication stress, which elicits DNA damage responses. In addition, heterochromatin decondensation may activate transposons and cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasior et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>DNA damage activates cell cycle checkpoints that prevent progression through the cell cycle. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murchison et al. (2005)</xref> and our study found that the cell cycle profile was not significantly changed in <italic>Dicer</italic>-deficient cells (Fig. S1). This conflict can be reconciled by the fact that Ago1 binds to 14-3-3 proteins and inhibits nuclear import of the mitosis-inducing phosphatase Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stoica et al., 2006</xref>). Because Ago1 interacts strongly with Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doi et al., 2003</xref>), the latter may also interact with 14-3-3 proteins and repress nuclear import of Cdc25. Therefore, knockdown of Dicer, on one hand, induces DNA damage and activates Chk1, which in turn phosphorylates Cdc25. 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated Cdc25 and induce export of this phosphatase from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lopez-Girona et al., 1999</xref>). Nuclear exclusion of Cdc25 correlates with an inability to enter mitosis because the phosphatase no longer has access to its substrate, the Cdc13&#x02013;Cdc2 complex, which is located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lopez-Girona et al., 1999</xref>). On the other hand, knockdown of Dicer may facilitate nuclear import of Cdc25 and induce cells to enter mitosis. This scenario may also explain why <italic>dcr1</italic> mutant <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells are defective for the DNA damage&#x02013;induced cell cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carmichael et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HepG2 and HEK293T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

Then cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti&#x02013;mouse IgG (F0102; R&#x00026;D Systems) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Finally, the fluorescence was detected with FACSAria (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with WinMDI software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://facs.scripps.edu/software.html">http://facs.scripps.edu/software.html</ext-link>). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in cold ethanol, stained with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACSAria.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular cytotoxicity assay</title><p>HEK293T cells express several other activating ligands besides NKG2DL that are recognized by the various activating receptors on polyclonal NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Welte, et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we used the NKL cell line, which has been well characterized for its NKG2D expression and NKG2D-mediated effector functions, to study NKG2D-mediated recognition of Dicer knockdown cells. Target cells were labeled with 100 &#x003bc;Ci Na2 51CrO4 (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C and washed three times. In blocking experiments, anti-NKG2D (MAB139; R&#x00026;D Systems) were added at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml to the target cells during the labeling procedure. Cells were washed, and effector cells were titrated on the target cells and incubated for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Maximum release was determined from target cells lysed in 1% Triton X-100. The percentage of lysis was calculated as follows: 100 &#x000d7; (experimental release &#x02013; spontaneous release)/(maximum release &#x02013; spontaneous release). Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Total protein was measured using the Bradford protein assay. Samples were denatured at 100&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded to each well for electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membranes (Millipore). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;linked secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies included anti-Dicer (ab14601; Abcam), anti-phospho-PKR (Thr 451; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Chk1 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-GAPDH (KC-5G4; Kangchen Biotech).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were fixed and stained with anti&#x02013;phospho-histone H2AX (S139) antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems) and anti-RPA70 (Cell Signaling Technology). Images were acquired with identical exposure conditions and analyzed with a confocal microscope (TCS-SP5 AOBS) using a 63&#x000d7; HCX PL APO 1.4 NA lens and LAS AF software (all from Leica). 100&#x02013;300 cells were screened for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and incubated with RNase-free Dnase I (Fermentas) for 30 min.
