Pol &#x003b8; has the ability to conduct translesion DNA synthesis opposite an AP site or thymine glycol, and it was recently proposed to be involved in base excision repair (BER) of DNA damage. Here, we show that Pol &#x003b8; has intrinsic 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose phosphate (5&#x02032;-dRP) lyase activity that is involved in single-nucleotide base excision DNA repair (SN-BER). Full-length human Pol &#x003b8; is a &#x0223c;300-kDa polypeptide, but we show here that the 98-kDa C-terminal region of Pol &#x003b8; possesses both DNA polymerase activity and dRP lyase activity and is sufficient to carry out base excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic>. The 5&#x02032;-dRP lyase activity is independent of the polymerase activity, in that a polymerase inactive mutant retained full 5&#x02032;-dRP lyase activity. Domain mapping of the 98-kDa enzyme by limited proteolysis and NaBH<sub>4</sub> cross-linking with a BER intermediate revealed that the dRP lyase active site resides in a 24-kDa domain of Pol &#x003b8;. These results are consistent with a role of Pol &#x003b8; in BER.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA sequences homologous to the mus308 gene of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were identified in human genome database, and the corresponding cDNA was cloned and mapped to chromosome 3q13.31. As the partial human cDNA encoded a 1762-amino-acid DNA polymerase with a molecular mass of 198 kDa, this new polymerase was designated DNA polymerase &#x003b8; (Pol &#x003b8;), and the corresponding vertebrate locus was named POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Subsequently, a full-length cDNA for POLQ was cloned and shown to encode a 2592-amino-acid polypeptide with an amino-terminal helicase domain, a carboxy-terminal polymerase domain and an intervening spacer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The mammalian POLQ and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mus308 gene products have similar domain arrangements. In addition to these orthologs, vertebrates have paralogs of the POLQ gene, HEL308 and POLN. The HEL308 gene product has homology to the helicase domain of POLQ but does not have a polymerase domain, whereas the POLN gene product has homology to the polymerase domain of POLQ, but does not contain a helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>DNA polymerase &#x003b8; belongs to the family A polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) typified by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Biochemical studies showed that purified full-length human Pol &#x003b8; exhibited template-directed DNA polymerase activity on nicked double-stranded DNA and on a single-primed DNA template. Consistent with family A DNA polymerases, this activity was resistant to aphidicolin and inhibited by dideoxynucleotides. In addition, Pol &#x003b8; exhibited a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Fidelity measurements of human Pol &#x003b8; revealed that the polymerase generates single base pair substitutions at a rate 10- to 100-fold higher than other characterized family A DNA polymerases, making it one of the least faithful member of the family A DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Pol &#x003b8; is capable of conducting translesion DNA synthesis by inserting bases opposite an AP site or thymine glycol residue in the template strand. It also can extend an unpaired primer base opposite these lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, Pol &#x003b8; is sufficient for both the insertion and extension steps required for bypass of an abasic site. In contrast, Pol &#x003b8; cannot insert bases opposite a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or a (6&#x02013;4) photoproduct, but is able to extend primers after DNA polymerase &#x003b9; had inserted a base opposite these UV-induced photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A role for Pol &#x003b8; in somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes has been proposed where the excision of uracil by uracil&#x02013;DNA glycosylase (UDG) during SHM generates an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that is repaired by either translesion bypass or a base excision repair (BER) process involving several DNA polymerases and accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>). Recently, Takeda and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) suggested that Pol &#x003b8; and Pol &#x003b2; are involved in BER of DNA damage in DT40 cells. They reported that POLQ<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells exhibited no significant increase in sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or HmdUrd, but deletion of the genes for both POLQ and Pol &#x003b2; resulted in cells more sensitive to these base-damaging agents. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies demonstrated that Pol &#x003b8; is rapidly recruited to sites of base damage that are induced by laser-delivered irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These data along with extract-based <italic>in vitro</italic> repair assays suggested that Pol &#x003b8; participates in BER in mammalian cells under certain conditions.</p><p>To understand the potential involvement of Pol &#x003b8; in BER in mammalian cells, we cloned, overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity the C-terminal 98-kDa region of Pol &#x003b8;, corresponding to the core polymerase domain. We also prepared a polymerase-deficient variant of the enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis, and assessed activities associated with BER. Our results reveal that the Pol &#x003b8; polymerase domain possesses both 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase and DNA polymerase activities that function together during single-nucleotide BER <italic>in vitro</italic>. The 5&#x02032;-dRP lyase activity was also fully active in the polymerase-deficient mutant. Our observation that Pol &#x003b8; exhibits DNA polymerase and 5&#x02032;-dRP lyase activities <italic>in vitro</italic> lends credence to the argument that Pol &#x003b8; may have a role in BER <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were from Oligos Etc, Inc.

Expression of the 2.7-kbp cDNA fragment, corresponding to the 98-kDa polymerase domain at the C-terminus of Pol &#x003b8; (amino acids 1712&#x02013;2590), produced soluble protein with the highest yield (data not shown). A (His)<sub>6</sub> affinity tag was added to the N-terminus by transferring this fragment to the pQE80L expression plasmid, and protein was overproduced in the <italic>E. coli</italic> host BL21-CodonPlus-RP cells. As described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section, recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential passage over a Ni&#x02013;NTA affinity column, a buffer exchange column, and a Mono S cation exchange column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 2). As a control for analysis of the polymerase activity, a mutant variant of the Pol &#x003b8; polymerase domain was constructed that abolished DNA polymerase activity. This was achieved by altering critical carboxylate residues that bind active site Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Similar alterations in other DNA polymerases are known to abolish DNA polymerase catalytic activity without dramatically affecting the overall structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Asp829 and Glu830 (corresponding to residues 2540 and 2541 in the full-length Pol &#x003b8;) in motif C were changed to Asn and Gln, respectively. This mutant of the Pol &#x003b8; domain harboring D829N and E830Q substitutions was overexpressed and purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type 98-kDa Pol &#x003b8; preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 3). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Purification of the 98-kDa Pol &#x003b8; from <italic>E. coli</italic>.

For example, SHM of immunoglobulin variable region genes is triggered by the action of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which deaminates deoxycytosine to deoxyuracil. The abasic sites could be processed by AP endonuclease and Pol &#x003b2; in an error-free pathway, but such a repair system would not be beneficial for SHM. Several lines of evidence support the idea that faithful repair mediated by Pol &#x003b2; is suppressed during SHM. First, using a mouse model Rajeswky and his associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) demonstrated that Pol &#x003b2; is not required in SHM. Second, we recently showed that the expression of Pol &#x003b2; in the SHM-proficient human BL2 cell line was strongly down regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Third, Maizels and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) reported that during immunoglobulin gene diversification in B cells, AP sites were preferentially processed by the MRE11-RAD50-NSB1 nuclease complex rather than by AP endonuclease.</p><p>Although Pol &#x003b8; is a family A DNA polymerase, it exhibits unusual properties that permit efficient bypass of abasic sites. In fact, Pol &#x003b8; is able to synthesize through these damaged sites with an efficiency that is comparable to that displayed on a corresponding undamaged template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The unique ability of Pol &#x003b8; to insert and extend mispaired nucleotides opposite AP sites suggests an important role for Pol &#x003b8; in SHM consistent with the observation that deletion of the Pol &#x003b8; gene in mice decreased mutations in the Ig H chain by more than 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). While these studies suggested involvement of Pol &#x003b8; in translesion bypass during SHM, recent observations with DT40 cells also support some role for Pol &#x003b8; in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In this report we established that Pol &#x003b8;, primarily known as a lesion bypass DNA polymerase, also possesses 5&#x02032;-dRP lyase and single-nucleotide gap-filling activities that are usually associated with BER. The dRP lyase activity is independent of polymerase activity, since a polymerase inactive mutant retained full dRP lyase activity. Using limited proteolysis and sodium borohydride cross-linking techniques, we demonstrated that the dRP lyase activity resides in a 24-kDa domain in the 98-kDa carboxy-terminal region of Pol &#x003b8;. This 24-kDa domain contains the three conserved motifs (A, B and C) found in all family A and B polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the 24-kDa domain Lys2383, near motif B, is conserved in Pol &#x003b8; from vertebrate species as well as in other family A polymerases, and this residue could represent a candidate nucleophile for the dRP lyase activity. In investigating roles for the N-terminal 2/3 of the enzyme, it will be of interest to determine how the full-length enzyme influences overall BER efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, Pol &#x003b8; is highly expressed in germinal center B cells, where SHM and class switch recombination occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Identification of protein partners or cofactors that interact with full-length Pol &#x003b8; may help to assign roles for Pol &#x003b8; in these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Research Project Numbers Z01-ES050159-12 (to S.H.W.) and Z01-ES065078 (to W.C.C.), in the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
