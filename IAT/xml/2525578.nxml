We explored mechanisms leading to this change in EBV-specific immunity in untreated patients with MS and healthy virus carriers matched for MS-associated HLA alleles. MS patients showed selective increase of T cell responses to the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), the most consistently recognized EBV-derived CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell antigen in healthy virus carriers, but not to other EBV-encoded proteins. In contrast, influenza and human cytomegalovirus&#x02013;specific immune control was unchanged in MS. The enhanced response to EBNA1 was mediated by an expanded reservoir of EBNA1-specific central memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T helper 1 (Th1) precursors and Th1 (but not Th17) polarized effector memory cells. In addition, EBNA1-specific T cells recognized myelin antigens more frequently than other autoantigens that are not associated with MS. Myelin cross-reactive T cells produced IFN-&#x003b3;, but differed from EBNA1-monospecific cells in their capability to produce interleukin-2, indicative of a polyfunctional phenotype as found in controlled chronic viral infections. Our data support the concept that clonally expanded EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells potentially contribute to the development of MS by cross-recognition of myelin antigens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, believed to be initiated and mediated by autoreactive T cells directed against myelin antigens. It develops in young adults with a complex genetic predisposition and is thought to require an inciting environmental insult such as a viral infection to trigger the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). So far, EBV stands out as the infectious agent for which there is the most compelling evidence for an association with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>The evidence implicating EBV in MS development includes the observation that individuals with a history of symptomatic primary EBV infection or infectious mononucleosis have a more than twofold increased risk of developing MS compared with subjects who acquired EBV without symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Adults and children with MS are universally, i.e., nearly 100%, seropositive for EBV compared with seropositivity rates of 90&#x02013;95% in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and &#x0003c;85% in age-matched pediatric cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In addition, a marked increase in serum antibody titers to EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) several years before the onset of first symptoms suggests an involvement of EBV early in the pathogenesis of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Finally, EBV-infected B cells have recently been found to be significantly enriched in tertiary lymphoid tissues in postmortem brain samples from patients with MS, but not in other inflammatory central nervous system diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>EBV-specific immunity in MS and the mechanisms by which EBV infection increases the risk for MS are not well characterized and are poorly understood. We investigated cellular and humoral immune responses to a broad panel of EBV-encoded proteins, as well as to other ubiquitous viruses, i.e., human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and influenza A virus in 24 untreated patients with MS and 24 healthy EBV carriers. Our data indicate that EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1 cells are selectively expanded in MS and that some of these have the ability to cross-recognize MS-associated myelin antigens.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Selective increase of EBNA1-specific T cell responses in MS</title><p>To evaluate T cell responsiveness to EBV latency gene products in untreated patients with MS versus healthy virus carriers (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1</ext-link>), PBMCs were separately infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs expressing the latent EBV nuclear antigens EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), LMP2A, and the lytic EBV-encoded protein BZLF1. Responses were assessed by IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;specific ELISPOT assays and compared with the virus vector backbone (rVV-TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) to influenza A virus (A/Aichi/68; H3N2) infection and to superantigen stimulation (SEB).</p><p>Among all rVV-EBV antigen constructs and influenza products tested in 24 MS patients and 24 healthy EBV carriers, EBNA1 was the only differentially recognized T cell antigen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). rVV-EBV nuclear antigens were consistently recognized by both MS patients (20/24 for EBNA3 and 14/24 for EBNA1) and healthy virus carriers (18/24 for EBNA3 and 10/24 for EBNA1). The hierarchy of T cell&#x02013;mediated latent EBV antigen recognition was preserved in patients and controls. EBNA3C-, EBNA3B-, and EBNA3A-specific T cells showed estimated precursor frequencies of (means &#x000b1; SD) 0.023 &#x000b1; 0.01%, 0.014 &#x000b1; 0.01%, and 0.011 &#x000b1; 0.004% of PBMCs, respectively. EBNA1-specific IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing T cells were detected at frequencies of 0.008 &#x000b1; 0.002% of PBMC in patients with MS and 0.005 &#x000b1; 0.001% of PBMC in healthy virus carriers (P &#x0003d; 0.005). Depletion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by magnetic cell separation resulted in a substantial decrease or abrogation of most rVV-EBNA3 antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses, but had only a minimal effect on rVV-EBNA1&#x02013;specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses in both patients and controls (P &#x0003d; 0.003; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Table S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1</ext-link>). In line with this, rVV-EBNA1&#x02013;specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses were substantially decreased after CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell depletion in a subgroup of 12 patients and 12 controls, whereas rVV-EBNA3C&#x02013;specific responses were still detectable in most donors that showed reactivity to rVV-EBNA3C in PBMCs (Fig. S1). Altogether, these data indicate a predominant expansion of the EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell compartment in MS.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Selective increase in rVV-EBNA1 recognition in MS.</bold> PBMCs from 24 MS patients and 24 healthy virus carriers were separately infected with rVV constructs expressing the EBV latent antigens EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, LMP1, and LMP2A, as well as the lytic EBV-encoded protein BZLF1.

We found the frequencies of EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to be twofold higher in MS patients than healthy virus carriers (0.149 and 0.073% of total CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Similar to other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), we did not detect significant differences in EBV-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell frequencies.

In this study, we extended our previous finding to a broad panel of EBV-encoded antigens, showing that EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are indeed selectively expanded in MS.</p><p>To further characterize if enhanced T cell responses selectively target EBNA1 in MS, we compared these to reactivities against other ubiquitous viral antigens. Using a flow cytometry-based CFSE-dilution assay, we analyzed EBNA1, HCMV-encoded phosphoprotein 65 (pp65)-antigen&#x02013; and influenza A virus-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses in patients and healthy virus carriers matched for expression of MS-associated HLA-DR alleles. Both HCMV and influenza are ubiquitous pathogens; HCMV induces a latent infection with continuous virus production, and both HCMV-pp65 stimulation and influenza infection are known to elicit robust CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Consistent with our data on IFN-&#x003b3; secretion to rVV-EBNA1 infection, patients with MS showed significantly higher proliferative responses to the C-terminal domain of EBNA1 (aa 400&#x02013;641), toward which most of the T cell responses of healthy virus carriers are directed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses were detectable in 75% (18/24) of MS and 66% (16/24) of healthy donors, with mean proliferating T cell frequencies of 6.12 &#x000b1; 3.2% (MS) and 3.38 &#x000b1; 1.2% (HD; P &#x0003d; 0.004). CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses to an overlapping peptide library covering the entire sequence of the HCMV-encoded pp65 protein (aa 1&#x02013;561) were detectable in 25% (6/24) of MS and 29% (7/24) of healthy donors with similar frequencies of 1.87 &#x000b1; 1.1% (MS) and 1.76 &#x000b1; 0.7% (HD).

IgG1 was the most frequently detected isotype in all individuals tested, reflecting the Th1 polarization of EBNA1-specific T cell immunity. IgG2 and IgG4 responses to EBNA1 were detected in a minor subgroup of patients and controls with no statistically significant differences between both cohorts. There were also no differences in the IgG-response to HCMV.

CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> selected B cells from 16 patients with MS and 16 healthy virus carriers were infected with EBV supernatant overnight and incubated for 12 d with increasing concentration of CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effector cells.

Thus, although high viral loads that occur during symptomatic primary infection are associated with an increased risk of developing MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), our data do not provide evidence for an increased viral replication or impaired immune control of EBV infection in MS during chronic infection.</p></sec><sec><title>EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells recognize myelin antigens</title><p>EBV-derived epitopes have previously been identified as molecular mimics of immunodominant myelin T cell antigens. Wucherpfennig and Strominger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and Lang et al.

However, it is not known whether BALF5-specific immune responses are part of the EBV-specific immune control in humans, and whether they qualitatively or quantitatively differ in patients with MS. Because we found that EBNA1-specific T cells are expanded in MS, we determined the frequency of myelin-recognizing EBNA1-specific T cells using a limiting dilution approach as outlined in Fig. S5 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072397/DC1</ext-link>).

Single-cell precursor plates were restimulated after 10 d and expanded for an additional 12 d in the presence of low-dose IL-2 (10 IU/ml) and IL-7 (10 ng/ml). At day 22 of culture, EBNA1-specific T cells were transferred to a new plate and stimulated either with EBNA1, myelin antigen-derived peptides (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15), or peptides (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 30) covering the entire sequence of the human proinsulin precursor protein (PIP, aa 1&#x02013;110) at equimolar concentrations (1 &#x003bc;M).

These data indicate that the expanded EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell repertoire in MS shows two distinct functional signatures, and that the myelin-reactive population can be distinguished by its ability to produce large amounts of IL-2 and less MIP-1&#x003b1; and -1&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In healthy individuals, elevated IgG titers to EBNA1, but not to EBNA2, EBV-encoded early antigens, the viral capsid antigen, or other lytic antigens, are the strongest predictor of MS risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The presence of oligoclonal IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid is a hallmark of MS, and the two most frequent MS-specific and high-affinity epitopes recognized by oligoclonal CSF IgG are both derived from EBV, i.e., EBNA1 and a lytic, less well characterized structural EBV protein (BRRF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), suggesting that EBNA1-specific antibodies are not only systemically elevated in MS, but also enriched in the CSF. The functional relevance of EBNA1-specific antibodies is, however, unclear because EBNA antigens are only expressed intracellularly in infected proliferating B cells. In contrast, T cells specific for EBNA1 are considered to be a crucial component of EBV-specific immune control. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of healthy EBV carriers consistently respond to EBNA1, are Th1 in function, recognize autologous EBV-transformed B cell lines (B-LCL), and have the capacity to kill EBNA1-expressing targets via CD95/CD95L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In this study, we provide evidence that EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1 cells are selectively expanded in MS patients, and that these have the ability to cross-recognize MS-associated myelin antigens. Although the frequency of cross-reactive T cells within the EBNA1-specific compartment is similar in MS patients and controls, we found that the overall number of EBNA1-specific T cells is increased in MS. Because both patients and controls were matched for expression of MS-associated HLA alleles, it is tempting to speculate that risk alleles such as HLA-DRB1&#x0002a;1501 predispose for selection of EBNA1 cross-reactive epitopes and that an increased total number of cross-reactive EBNA1-specific T cells, generated in a susceptible HLA background, might contribute to the development of MS.</p><p>The distinct cytokine signature of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones is indicative of polyfunctional T cells, which are invariably found in individuals with effective immune control of chronic HIV-1 or EBV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Polyfunctional T cells, which probably constitute recent recruits from the central memory compartment, differ from further differentiated effector T cells in their ability to produce IL-2, to retain their antigen-specific proliferation capacity and their lower functional antigen avidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Being equipped with a low-avidity TCR, it has been assumed that they are particularly important under conditions of antigen persistence and high antigen load because they are less susceptible to exhaustion or activation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Consistent with these considerations, a more extensive priming of polyfunctional and lower avidity T cells during symptomatic primary EBV infection with high levels of viral load, and continuous restimulation caused by antigen presence in MS brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), might establish a larger cross-reactive T cell compartment, which could predispose for MS. Such mechanisms could explain the observation that individuals with a history of infectious mononucleosis are at greater risk to develop MS compared with subjects who acquired the virus without symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). This scenario might not be restricted to, but become most evident, in the context of MS and EBV as a prototypic pathogen that requires strong and sustained T cell&#x02013;mediated immune control to prevent the occurrence of EBV-associated malignancies.</p><p>Although our study provides evidence for a selective deregulation of EBNA1-specific T cell responses in MS and a potential pathogenic significance of polyfunctional EBNA1-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, we are still far from understanding the mechanisms leading to disease development and progression. Further investigations will be necessary to clarify whether targeting EBV and EBV-specific immune compartments may become therapeutic options in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Patients and healthy donors.</title><p>24 untreated MS patients (23 with clinically definite, and 1 with clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome fulfilling the revised &#x0201c;McDonald&#x0201d; criteria for diagnosing MS) and 24 age-, sex-, and MHC class II&#x02013;matched healthy donors were enrolled to study EBV-specific T cell responses (Table S1).

Virus-containing supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and passed through a 0.45-&#x003bc;m filter. The same supernatant was used to infect B cells from both patients with MS and healthy blood donors. After 24 h, EBV-infected B cells were washed twice and added to CD19- cells at effector to target ratios of 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50. After 12 d, transformation and regression of transformed B cells were quantified by determining the ratio of CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD23<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells to live CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells by flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer. Gating and calculations were performed with FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) software.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>T cell cross-recognition.</title><p>To obtain single-cell, EBNA1-specific T cell precursors, we adapted a modified limiting dilution protocol that has initially been described for mixed lymphocyte cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). The experimental setup for this assay is outlined in Fig. S5. PBMCs were isolated from blood samples via density centrifugation and seeded in increasing cell concentrations of 0.125 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>, 0.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>, and 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well together with autologous irradiated (3,000 rad) feeder cells resulting in a total cell number of 10<sup>5</sup> per well in 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates in T cell medium (RPMI; Invitrogen) containing 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from Whittacker Bioproducts), and 5% pooled human AB serum, and enriched with 10 ng/ml IL-7 (PeproTech). 50 wells were stimulated with EBNA1 peptides (aa 400&#x02013;641), and 10 wells did not receive any antigens. All peptides were used at a final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M. After 7 d of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C and in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, each culture was resuspended and half of the total volume (100 &#x003bc;l) was transferred into new plates, which were pulsed with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine (GE Healthcare) for 16 h at 1 &#x003bc;Ci/well. T cell medium enriched with 10 IU/ml IL-2 was added to the remaining nonpulsed wells to propagate the cultures. The incorporated radioactivity (cpm) in &#x0201c;daughter&#x0201d; plates was measured by scintillation counting (1450 Microbeta; Wallac/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Individual wells were considered positive if their stimulation index (SI &#x0003d; cpm of wells with antigen/mean cpm of 10 negative control wells) was &#x0003e;2. Positive cultures were identified on the corresponding &#x0201c;mother&#x0201d; plates and restimulated on day 10 with 10<sup>5</sup> autologous irradiated antigen-pulsed (1 &#x003bc;M per peptide) PBMCs. IL-2 (10 U/ml) and IL-7 (10 ng/ml)-enriched medium was added on day 11, and again 5 d later. After 12 d of expansion, 4 &#x000d7; 40 &#x003bc;l of a total of 200 &#x003bc;l were transferred to a new daughter plate and stimulated with EBNA1, myelin antigens, and PIP-derived antigens (1 &#x003bc;M per peptide) or without antigen (negative control). <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine was added 40 h later at 1 &#x003bc;Ci/well, and cells were harvested 60 h after stimulation (day 25). Again, individual wells were considered positive if SI was &#x0003e;2. T cell cultures identified as cross-reactive were restimulated once with EBNA1 peptides in the presence of autologous feeders and 20 IU/ml IL-2 and analyzed for TCR V&#x003b2; expression after 8&#x02013;14 d. Precursor frequencies of cross-reactive and non&#x02013;cross-reactive TCLs were determined by the number of positive wells compared with number of seeded cells in single precursor plates, which were restimulated after primary proliferation. Corresponding positive cultures on the mother plate were restimulated with autologous feeders and further expanded in the presence of 20 IU/ml IL-2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Luminex assay.</title><p>Cell supernatants from cultures obtained from myelin antigen-reactive and only EBNA1-specific T cells were analyzed at day 1 after the second restimulation for cytokines and using the human cytokine 25-plex antibody bead kit (Invitrogen/Biosource) as per the manufacturer's protocol. This kit comprises analyte specific components for the quantification of the following 25 cytokines and chemokines: IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, GM-CSF, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, IP-10, MIG, Eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-1. Multiplex beads were vortexed and sonicated for 30 s, and 25 &#x003bc;l was added to each well and washed two times with wash buffer. The samples were diluted 1:1 with assay diluent and loaded onto a Multiscreen BV 96-well filter plate (Millipore) with 50 &#x003bc;l of incubation buffer already added to each well. Serial dilutions of cytokine standards were prepared in parallel and added to the plate. Samples were then incubated on a plate shaker at 600 rpm in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was applied to a Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold (Millipore) and washed twice with 200 &#x003bc;l of wash buffer. 100 &#x003bc;l of biotinylated anti&#x02013;human Multi-Cytokine Reporter (Biosource International) was added to each well. The plate was incubated on a plate shaker at 600 rpm in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. The plate was applied to a Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold and washed twice with 200 &#x003bc;l of wash buffer. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin was diluted 1:10 in wash buffer, and 100 &#x003bc;l was added directly to each well. The plate was incubated on a plate shaker at 600 rpm in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The plate was then applied to the vacuum manifold, washed twice, and each well was resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l wash buffer and shaken for 1 min. The assay plate was then transferred to the Bio-Plex Luminex 100 XYP instrument (Millipore) for analysis. Cytokine concentrations were calculated using Bio-Plex Manager 3.0 software with a 25-parameter curve-fitting algorithm applied for standard curve calculations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Statistics were performed using commercial software (PRISM 4; GraphPad Software).
