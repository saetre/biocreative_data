The beneficial health properties of tomatoes have been attributed to the action of various compounds including dietary fiber, folates, vitamins and carotenoids. Among these, carotenoids have received much attention due to their ability to quench singlet oxygen and scavenge peroxyl radicals which is associated with the above mentioned health benefits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Krinsky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since lycopene is the major carotenoid present in tomatoes and their by-products, this phytochemical has been the focus of intense research to determine its impact of various disease states.

Although the etiology of IBD is currently unknown, converging evidence suggests that a pathological synergy exists between defective innate immune responses and uncontrolled lamina propria mononuclear (LPMNC) and T cell activation, playing a central role in disease pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Fiocchi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Xavier1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Key to this dysregulated host response is the presence of intestinal microbiota, which in a genetically susceptible host, activates intestinal immune cells to release a number of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Sartor1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we reasoned that TLE-fed mice could have increased IEC apoptosis in response to DSS-induced injury due to impaired NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Thus, we next sought to investigate the impact of TLE on intestinal apoptosis following DSS-induced injury. Since molecular alterations likely precede clinical signs of colitis and histopathological evidence of inflammation, (which occurred at around d 4&#x02013;5 in our model) signs of apoptosis were evaluated 3 d after the start of DSS. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a strong increase of activated caspase-3 positive cells in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed mice compared to DSS-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004562-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Moreover, western blot analysis performed on either isolated intestinal epithelial cells or total colon samples confirmed an increase in caspase-3 processing in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed mice compared to those isolated from DSS control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004562-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>).

TLE prevented LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity both in IEC-18 cells and splenocytes through blockade of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, RelA nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. TLE comprised of numerous components including vitamin C, polyphenols and carotenoids. Though our study has not directly identified the active ingredients responsible for this effect, TLE-mediated inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity was replicated using pure lycopene (data not shown). Therefore this carotenoid is at least partially responsible for this inhibitory activity.</p><p>Despite its inhibitory effect in vitro, DSS-induced acute colitis was exacerbated in TLE fed NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice. Mice fed with a TLE rich diet and exposed to DSS lost more weight than mice fed the control diet. This weight loss was not observed in non DSS treated fed TLE, indicating that the diet alone is not responsible for the phenotype. Fluorescent macro-imaging of the colon of TLE-fed, DSS-exposed NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice showed a strong increase in EGFP expression compared to control diet mice, indicating enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activity in these mice. Of note, EGFP expression was not increased in control diet-fed, DSS-exposed mice at d 4, which correlated with minimal weight loss. In contrast, increased EGFP expression in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice correlated with pronounced weight loss and histological evidence of intestinal damage. Moreover, increased levels of the NF-&#x003ba;B dependent genes IL-6, TNF&#x003b1; and MCP-1 were detected in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice. Consequently, exacerbated colitis correlated with enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice. The 2&#x00025; diet utilized in this study corresponds to 12 mg lycopene/day. This amount falls within the range comsumed in a typical human diet, with for example, spaghetti sauce (21 mg/serving), watermelon (11 mg/serving), tomatoes (14 mg/serving) and tomato juice (19 mg/serving) providing from 10&#x02013;40 mg of the phytochemical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The deleterious effect of TLE on DSS-induced colitis is likely specific to the model on intestinal injury. Indeed bacteria-induced EGFP expression was reduced in TLE-fed IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice compared to control diet fed mice, with a concomitant attenuation of cecal and proximal colonic inflammation. These findings suggest that the deleterious effects of TLE relates to the injury-based mechanism of the DSS model, which cause disruption of the epithelial cell layer resulting in breakdown of intestinal barrier function. This breach of barrier function would likely result in increased uptake of luminal antigens (bacteria and bacterial products) as well as activation of lamina propria immune cells and inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Karrasch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Sartor1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis reconciles the apparent discordance between enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the colon of TLE-fed, DSS exposed mice and the inhibitory action of the phytochemical in vitro and in the IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> model.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B drives expression of target genes that function to protect IEC from signal-induced apoptosis as well as promoting restitution of the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Karrasch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. A potential explanation for exacerbated colitis in TLE-treated, DSS-exposed mice may be that TLE impair barrier function thereby increasing the susceptibility of IEC to undergo apoptosis. This possibility is supported by our immunohistochemical and western blot analysis showing that the colon of TLE-fed mice displayed enhanced caspase-3 processing. Increased caspase-3 processing has been previously associated with DSS-induced colonic tissue damage and colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004562-Paul1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, higher number of TUNEL positive IEC were observed in TLE-fed, DSS-exposed mice. In contrast, the number of TUNEL positive cells was similar between control diet and TLE fed IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;NF-&#x003ba;B<sup>EGFP</sup> mice (data not shown). In addition, TNF-induced apoptosis increased in IEC-18 cells exposed to TLE. These findings support the notion that TLE interferes with NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated pro-survival signals leading to increased apoptosis in the injured epithelium, thereby compromising barrier integrity. Since irradiation therapy, bacterial infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure is associated with intestinal injury, a diet rich in lycopene could potentially interfere with repair mechanisms implicated in the restoration of the epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Maureen Bower and Silmara Camargo at the Gnotobiotic Core Facility of the Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease for their expert help in germ-free rodent technology.
