Its sequence, covering codons -5 to 162 and therefore encompassing the complete V-D-J region, was determined. Surprisingly, the sequence of the VH gene-encoded region was almost identical with that of the BALB/c VH anti-HNP (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl VH region, suggesting that the same VH germ-line might be used to encode two heavy chains contributing to antibodies of discrete specificities. A specific VH probe was derived and annealed to Eco RI and Bg1 II restriction fragments of liver (unrearranged) DNA extracted from the BALB/c, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mouse strains that differ in their H chain allotypes. Under stringent conditions, only a few bands were identified by Southern blotting. The different patterns observed suggest that the VH anti-GAT repertoire differs between these strains even though their various anti-GAT antibodies express the same public idiotypic specificities.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0167-a" xlink:role="4012"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4007"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4008"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4009"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4010"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4011"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4012"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4013"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4014"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4015"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4016"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4017"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
