All three techniques suggested that FRET occurred between RPTP&#x003b1; -CFP and -YFP fusion proteins, and thus that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerized in living cells. RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization was constitutive, extensive and specific. RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization was consistent with cross-linking experiments, using a non-cell-permeable chemical cross-linker.

Our insight into the function of PTPs - in contrast to the PTKs - is limited. However, in recent years evidence is emerging that PTPs play important and specific roles in biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Transmembrane PTPs, tentatively called receptor PTPs, RPTPs, are interesting, because their diverse extracellular domains may function as ligand binding domains. Recently, Pleiotrophin was identified as a ligand of RPTP&#x003b2;/&#x003b6;, and binding of Pleiotrophin led to inactivation of RPTP&#x003b2;/&#x003b6; activity, resulting in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of its substrate, &#x003b2;-Catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The crystal structure of RPTP&#x003b1;-D1, which is highly homologous to other PTPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], showed that an amino-terminal helix-turn-helix wedge-like segment interacts with the dyad-related monomer, in such a manner that both catalytic sites in the dimer are occluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It should be noted that the crystal structures of RPTP&#x003bc;-D1 and of the complete cytoplasmic domain of LAR do not show dimers like RPTP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Functional experiments with EGFR/CD45, a chimeric protein, consisting of the extracellular domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the intracellular domain of the RPTP, CD45, demonstrated that ligand-induced dimerization leads to functional inactivation of CD45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mutation of a single residue in the wedge of CD45 abolishes dimerization-induced functional inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The importance of tight regulation of CD45 was demonstrated by the introduction of a targeted point mutation in the wedge in mice. The CD45 E613R mutation causes lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity in mice, resulting in death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. RPTP&#x003b1; dephosphorylates and activates the PTK c-Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] via a phosphotyrosine displacement mechanism, involving Src pTyr529 and RPTP&#x003b1; pTyr789 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that forced dimerization of RPTP&#x003b1; by introduction of a disulfide bridge in the extracellular domain leads to inactivation of RPTP&#x003b1; as assessed by analysis of c-Src Tyr529 phosphorylation and activity. Similar to CD45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], dimerization-induced inactivation of RPTP&#x003b1; was dependent on an intact wedge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is clear that RPTPs can be regulated by dimerization. Experiments with chemical cross-linkers indicated that RPTP&#x003b1; forms dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The use of chemical cross-linkers to analyze protein-protein interactions has many disadvantages due to the fact that detection of the interaction is indirect. Here we report the analysis of RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization in living cells using a non-invasive, non-destructive method, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).</p><p>FRET is a method to assess distances at the molecular level. FRET is a direct radiation-less transfer of energy from the excited donor fluorophore to the acceptor fluorophore, which occurs if the two fluorophores are in very near vicinity of each other, usually less than 60&#x000c5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The FRET results were consistent with experiments using chemical cross-linkers. Finally, using deletion mutants, we mapped a site of interaction to the transmembrane domain, and demonstrate that the transmembrane domain is sufficient to drive dimerization. Our results provide strong support for the model that RPTPs are regulated by dimerization, and may be useful for analysis of factors that modulate RPTPalpha dimerization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FRET between RPTPalpha-GFP fusion proteins</title><p>In order to determine whether RPTP&#x003b1; formed dimers in living cells, we generated RPTP&#x003b1;-fusion proteins by substitution of RPTP&#x003b1;-D2 with CFP or YFP, a good donor-acceptor fluorophore pair for FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-516-YFP (individually, or in combination) were transiently transfected into SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells. RPTP&#x003b1;-516-YFP localized to the cell membrane as assessed by confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Similarly, RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP localized to the cell membrane (data not shown). The excitation spectra were determined in single living cells, using two filter sets, confirming that the excitation maxima are 452 and 514 nm for CFP and YFP, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and that there was little overlap between the two excitation spectra (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The excitation spectrum of a cell that coexpressed RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-516-YFP suggested that FRET occurred, since a strong signal was detected at the YFP emission wavelength (curve 4, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) upon excitation below 440 nm (predominantly exciting CFP), whereas this signal was nearly absent in single RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP or RPTP&#x003b1;-516-YFP transfected cells (compare with curves 2 and 3). FRET between RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-516-YFP suggested that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerized under these conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression and spectral properties of chimeric fluorescent RPTP&#x003b1; proteins.

Initially, we used RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP/-YFP, human EGFR-CFP/-YFP as a negative control, and constitutively dimeric RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C-CFP/-YFP as a positive control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio consists of three terms: direct YFP emission, direct CFP emission, and sensitized emission (directly proportional to FRET efficiency (<italic>E</italic>) and dimerization (&#x003b1;), two terms that cannot be separated from each other (see Materials and Methods). We have calculated the theoretical values of <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> under conditions of no dimerization (<italic>E</italic><sup>*</sup>&#x003b1; = 0), and substantial dimerization (<italic>E</italic><sup>*</sup>&#x003b1; = 0.5), and plotted these values against the ratio of the CFP- and YFP-concentrations <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). It is clear from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> that <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> is substantially higher under conditions of dimerization and FRET (<italic>E</italic><sup>*</sup>&#x003b1; = 0.5) than under conditions of no FRET and/or dimerization (<italic>E</italic><sup>*</sup>&#x003b1; = 0). In addition, it is clear that changes in the CFP:YFP expression ratio affect <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic>. We have indicated the theoretical <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> levels under conditions of no dimerization and/or FRET with <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) = 0.5 (<italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> = 0.25) and <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) = 1.5 (<italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> = 0.37) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bottom and top dashed lines, respectively). We have analysed protein expression of the CFP- and YFP-fusion proteins by immunoblotting and found roughly similar expression levels for all the fusion proteins that we used, which was expected since the only difference between these proteins is a limited number of point mutations (six) that affect the fluorophore. The ratio of concentrations of CFP and YFP was close to 1.0 for all fusion protein pairs, and certainly 0.5&#x0003c;<italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) &#x0003c;1.5. Hence, if the experimental <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> for any CFP/YFP fusion protein pair is 0.25 or less, there is no dimerization and/or FRET. If <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> &#x0003e; 0.37, our simulations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) indicate that FRET and hence a physical interaction (dimerization) occurs. If 0.25 &#x0003c;<italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> &#x0003c; 0.37, one cannot distinguish whether the increased value is caused by a high CFP:YFP expression ratio in the cells or by dimerization-induced CFP to YFP FRET with this method. We postulate that under our experimental conditions with similar amounts of CFP and YFP fusion proteins expressed in the total cell population, an average <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio value &#x0003e;0.37 for a large group of individual cell measurements is the result of FRET and dimerization.</p><p>The <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio of coexpressed RPTP&#x003b1;-516-CFP and -YFP was 0.46&#x000b1;0.07 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), while the expression levels were similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), suggesting constitutive dimerization and FRET. As a control, we determined the <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio of EGFR-CFP and -YFP, which was 0.20&#x000b1;0.05, suggesting there was no dimerization and/or FRET (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). To induce constitutive dimerization, we substituted Pro137 in the extracellular domain of RPTP&#x003b1; with cysteine. RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C formed a disulfide bridge, thus inducing constitutive homodimerization, and more than 80% of RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C was detected in the dimeric form by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions [23] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio of constitutively dimeric RPTP&#x003b1;- P137C-CFP/-YFP was 0.50&#x000b1;0.07 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) with similar expression of the -CFP and - YFP fusion proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

FRET causes a decrease in the donor (i.e. CFP) fluorescence lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, the CFP-fluorescence lifetimes (&#x003c4;&#x003c6;) were lower in case of the RPTP&#x003b1;-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP coexpressing cells than in control cells, coexpressing RPTP&#x003b1;-CFP and EGFR-YFP. The decrease in the CFP-fluorescence lifetime from 2.6 ns to 2.2 ns clearly demonstrated CFP to YFP FRET due to close proximity of the two fluorophores, which cannot be explained by variation in CFP:YFP expression ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The control CFP-lifetime of 2.6 ns was identical to that of cells expressing cytosolic (unfused) CFP which has a &#x003c4;&#x003c6; lifetime of 2.6 ns at the employed modulation frequency (data not shown, see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). Because the reduction in CFP lifetime was rather low, we correlated the lifetime data with the SPIM data (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). A clear negative correlation was observed between the emission ratios and the CFP fluorescence lifetimes (both &#x003c4;&#x003c6; and &#x003c4;<sub>M</sub>). These data confirm the notion that the increased YFP fluorescence for the RPTP&#x003b1;-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP coexpressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) indeed reflects sensitized emission resulting from FRET. Furthermore, the experiments in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> also show that the FRET is not due to nonspecific RPTP&#x003b1; interactions as a result of high concentrations in the plasma membrane, since the control with EGFR-YFP did not show sensitized YFP emission. Hence these FRET experiments demonstrate a specific RPTP&#x003b1;-RPTP&#x003b1; interaction (i.e. dimerization) in the plasma membrane of living SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-linking of RPTPalpha using a chemical cross-linker</title><p>We used the non-cell-permeable irreversible chemical cross-linker, bis- [sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>), on intact cells to confirm that RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP dimerized. A considerable proportion of RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP, designated long form (L) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), migrated with an apparent molecular weight that was consistent with dimerization following treatment of the cells with BS<sup>3</sup> (indicated by LL) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The proportion of cross-linked dimers appeared to be low. It is noteworthy that - similar to RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP - less than 10% of the constitutively dimeric RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C was cross-linked by BS<sup>3</sup> (data not shown), suggesting that the efficiency of cross-linking was low under these conditions. These results are similar to previously published results with wild type RPTP&#x003b1;, lacking GFP derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], indicating that the GFP-derivatives neither enhanced nor interfered with RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP dimerization. We tested dimerization of a deletion mutant of RPTP&#x003b1;, enabling us to investigate whether RPTP&#x003b1; homodimerized, or merely interacted with another protein of similar size. RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP, lacking almost the entire cytoplasmic domain, including the wedge, had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa, and was designated short form (S) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP migrated as a dimer following treatment of the cells with BS<sup>3</sup> (indicated by SS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Dimerization of the short form appeared to be more efficient than of the long form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that this is due - in part - to an artefact as a result of more efficient blotting of smaller proteins. Co-transfection of RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP (L) and RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP (S) followed by treatment with BS<sup>3</sup> led to the formation of LL-dimers, SS-dimers, and a novel intermediate form, LS-heterodimers. Mixing of lysates from BS<sup>3</sup>-treated cells transfected with only RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP or RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP illustrated that the LS heterodimer was only detected after BS<sup>3</sup>-treatment of cells co-expressing RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, BS<sup>3</sup>-mediated cross-linking confirmed the FRET measurements, and the heterodimerization results of the long and short forms demonstrated that RPTP&#x003b1; homodimerized specifically.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Homodimerization of RPTP&#x003b1; as assessed using a chemical cross-linker.

Initially, we focussed on the region that is involved in dimerization in the crystal structure of RPTP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Subtle mutations and deletions of (part of) the wedge diminished RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization as assessed using the chemical cross-linker BS<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, neither subtle mutations, nor deletion of the entire wedge reduced FRET significantly (data not shown). Therefore, we generated additional deletion mutants and determined the <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). Neither deletion of D2 (RPTP&#x003b1;-516), D1 and D2 (RPTP&#x003b1;-250), nor deletion of the wedge, D1 and D2 (RPTP&#x003b1;-200) reduced the <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio significantly. Expression of all the different CFP and YFP fusion protein pairs was similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Some transmembrane domains are sufficient for dimerization, e.g. the transmembrane domain of glycophorin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. To test whether the transmembrane domain of RPTP&#x003b1; was involved in dimerization, we deleted the extracellular domain of the RPTP&#x003b1;-200-CFP and -YFP constructs, rendering fusion proteins that consisted of little more than the RPTP&#x003b1; transmembrane domain and CFP or YFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio in cells transfected with RPTP&#x003b1;-200&#x00394; ED-CFP and -YFP demonstrated that deletion of the extracellular domain did not reduce dimerization significantly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), indicating that the extracellular domain was not required for dimerization. To test the specificity of transmembrane domains in dimerization, we replaced RPTP&#x003b1;'s transmembrane domain with the transmembrane domain of the EGFR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and found that the <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio of cells coexpressing RPTP&#x003b1;-200-YFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-EGFR-200-CFP was close to the theoretical minimum (bottom dashed line) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The chimeric RPTP&#x003b1; EGFR-200-CFP and -YFP proteins did not homodimerize either (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

We have successfully used FRET to detect RPTP&#x003b1; dimers and dimerization was consistent with cross-linking experiments. Our results provide strong support for the model that dimerization is involved in regulation of RPTPs.</p><p>FRET was detected between RPTP&#x003b1;-CFP and RPTP&#x003b1;-YFP using three different techniques: dual wavelength excitation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), SPIM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and FLIM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The excitation-ratio method for determining FRET suffers from uncertainties when the CFP:YFP expression ratios, <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP), are not exactly known. Simulations show that high excitation ratios can be caused either by FRET or by an unfavorable (high) <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Although for the entire cell population <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) expression ratios were close to 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), one cannot determine the expression ratio independently from FRET at the single cell level. Using the SPIM-method, FRET can be mimicked by unfavorable CFP/YFP expression ratios, but, in contrast to the excitation-ratio method, only when the <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) is very low. The most reliable (but less sensitive) technique is FLIM. In conclusion, ratiometric analysis of FRET by dual wavelength excitation is a sensitive method for detection of FRET, which is reliable when similar levels of the two fluorophores are expressed.</p><p>We also demonstrated that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerized by chemical cross-linking, a technique that is fundamentally different from FRET analysis. BS<sup>3</sup>-mediated chemical cross- linking is a two-step chemical reaction, leading to a covalent bond, while FRET is only dependent on the distance between the two fluorophores. Dimerization, detected by chemical cross-linking appeared to be much less efficient than with FRET. However, this apparent difference is caused by the relatively low efficiency of the cross-linker, BS<sup>3</sup>. Only &#x0223c; 10% of RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C was detected in dimeric form following BS<sup>3</sup>-mediated cross-linking, like wild type RPTP&#x003b1; (data not shown), while &#x0223c; 80% of RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C dimerized according to non-denaturing gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). According to the FRET analysis dimerization was extensive, since similar FRET levels were detected in wild type RPTP&#x003b1; as in constitutively dimeric RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Taken together, both FRET and cross-linking experiments indicate that dimerization of RPTP&#x003b1; is extensive. Subtle changes, for instance in the wedge, did not affect dimerization detected by FRET, but did lead to detection of reduced dimerization according to the cross-linking experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This discrepancy may be explained by the difference in detection of dimerization. The extracellular domain may dimerize, without an interaction intracellularly. Therefore, extracellular cross-linkers may allow detection of these dimers, while FRET analysis does not, due to the topology of the two fluorophores in the intracellular domains. Importantly, the requirements for detection of dimerization are more stringent for cross-linkers than for FRET, since the linker between the two reactive groups in BS<sup>3</sup> is only &#x0223c; 12&#x000c5;, while FRET allows distances up to &#x0223c; 60&#x000c5; between the two fluorophores. It is noteworthy that a distance of 60&#x000c5; or less between the two fluorophores is only achieved when the two proteins are in a protein complex, not when they merely colocalize subcellularly. Taken together, both cross-linking and FRET analysis show that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerizes extensively.</p><p>FRET analysis demonstrated that the transmembrane domain was sufficient to drive dimerization of RPTP&#x003b1; which is consistent with cross-linking experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Other regions in RPTP&#x003b1; may be involved in dimerization of the full length protein as well. For instance, cross-linking experiments demonstrated that the extracellular domain dimerized by itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. By contrast, the extracellular domain of RPTP&#x003b1; fused to the EGFR transmembrane domain did not show FRET (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), suggesting that this fusion protein did not dimerize. This may be explained by the difference between cross-linking and FRET, as described above. Yet other regions in RPTP&#x003b1; may be involved in dimerization as well. We have evidence that RPTP&#x003b1;-D2 binds to RPTP&#x003b1;-D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Similarly, CD45 and RPTP&#x003bc; may be engaged in intra-or intermolecular interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition, we and others found heterodimerization between RPTP-D1s and RPTP-D2s from different RPTPs, suggesting cross-talk between RPTPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the wedge is not required for dimerization, since deletion of the wedge did not abolish dimerization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, data not shown). Nevertheless, the wedge may be involved in stabilization of the dimer, since mutations in the wedge decreased the cross-linking efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, whereas the EGFR transmembrane domain by itself was not sufficient to mediate dimerization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), introduction of the juxtamembrane domain and D1 of RPTP&#x003b1; (residues 200-516) induced dimerization (data not shown). Taken together, multiple regions in RPTP&#x003b1; contribute to dimerization.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerizes constitutively in living cells. Previously, indirect detection of protein-protein interactions using chemical cross-linkers demonstrated that CD45 homodimerizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, RPTP&#x003b1; elutes from gel filtration columns as a large protein complex, suggesting dimerization or multimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Regulation of dimerization is ill-understood. Like dimerization of RPTKs, dimerization of RPTPs may be regulated by ligand binding. RPTPs have diverse extracellular domains, and several RPTPs bind ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, GPI-linked Contactin binds laterally to the extracellular domain of RPTP&#x003b1;, i.e. <italic>in cis</italic> on the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Whether Contactin functions as a ligand, or as a ligand-binding moiety remains to be determined. Pleiotrophin, a ligand of RPTP&#x003b2;/&#x003b6; inactivates RPTP&#x003b2;/&#x003b6; activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Whether ligand binding affects dimerization of any of these RPTPs remains to be determined. RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization was constitutive and extensive. The transmembrane domain of RPTP&#x003b1; by itself was sufficient to drive dimerization, suggesting that ligands are not required for dimerization. However, ligand binding may modulate the extent of RPTP&#x003b1; dimerization. Analysis of RPTP dimerization using FRET may provide a powerful means to screen for factors that modulate dimerization or monomerization, and FRET may facilitate analysis of the dynamics of RPTP dimerization.</p><p>Dimerization of RPTPs may negatively regulate their activity. Ligand-induced dimerization of EGFR/CD45 led to functional inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mutation of a single residue in the wedge of CD45 abolished ligand-induced inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], strongly supporting the model that dimerization leads to wedge-mediated occlusion of the catalytic sites. We have demonstrated that constitutively dimeric RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C was inactive, since it failed to dephosphorylate and activate c-Src <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mutation of the wedge rendered RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C active, while it did not affect dimerization, demonstrating that inactivation of RPTPs by dimerization was dependent on the wedge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. RPTP&#x003b1;-F135C with a disulfide bridge at position 135 dimerized constitutively, like RPTP&#x003b1;-P137C, but was still active, like wild type RPTP&#x003b1;. Apparently, dimerization-induced inactivation requires a specific rotational coupling, i.e. the monomers in the inhibited dimer need to be oriented in a specific geometry with respect to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain may induce rotation of the monomers, relative to each other, thus leading to activation or inactivation of RPTP&#x003b1;, similar to ligand-induced rotation that has been suggested to activate RPTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we found that phorbol ester treatment of cells led to activation of RPTP&#x003b1;, and to phosphorylation of RPTP&#x003b1; Ser180 and Ser204 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. These serine phosphorylation sites are localized close to the wedge, suggesting that phosphorylation of these sites may interfere with interactions of the wedge. Phosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204 may not affect dimerization <italic>per se</italic>, but still may lead to opening up of the catalytic site and thus to activation of RPTP&#x003b1;.</p><p>Since the crystal structures of RPTP&#x003bc;-D1 and LAR did not show dimers like RPTP&#x003b1;-D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the model that RPTPs are regulated by dimerization has been the subject of debate. The transmembrane domain of RPTP&#x003b1; was sufficient to drive dimerization. It will be interesting to see whether the transmembrane domains of other RPTPs, including RPTP&#x003bc; and LAR, drive dimerization as well. We propose that dimerization via the transmembrane domain of RPTP&#x003b1; provides a conformational basis for regulation by dimerization. Whether the dimer is inactive depends on the exact topology of the intracellular domain, which may be regulated by phosphorylation, by interaction with other proteins, or by rotational coupling for instance as a result of ligand binding to the extracellular domain. Here we demonstrate that RPTP&#x003b1; dimerized in living cells for the first time, providing strong support for the model that dimerization is involved in regulation of RPTP activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, plasmids and transfections</title><p>SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum.

The ratio of <italic>F</italic>(440) and <italic>F</italic>(490) was determined using the FRET filter and consists of three terms: direct excitation of YFP, residual CFP fluorescence, and FRET, as indicated in the following formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-2-8-i1.gif"/></p><p>In this formula, &#x003b3; is a correction factor consisting of the relative transmission efficiencies of the microscope and the reflection efficiencies of the dichroic mirror at both excitation wavelengths. In our microscope &#x003b3; was 1.0. The molar extinction coefficients, &#x003b5;<sub>CFP</sub>(440), &#x003b5;<sub>YFP</sub>(440), and &#x003b5;<sub>YFP</sub>(490) are respectively, 32.5, 10.5 and 55.3 x 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. <italic>QE</italic>(CFP/YFP) is the detection efficiency ratio for CFP to YFP detection, and we estimated the ratio <italic>QE</italic>(CFP/YFP) to be 0.2, based on the emission spectra of CFP and YFP, and on the filter set used. <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) is the molar expression ratio in the cells of CFP and YFP-tagged fusion proteins. <italic>E</italic> is the FRET efficiency in a CFP and YFP labelled receptor dimer, which is dependent on the distance and orientation of the fluorophores. &#x003b1; is the degree of dimerization, ranging from 0 (no dimerization) to 1 (100% dimerization). The <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ratio of cells expressing YFP fusion proteins only, was 0.16&#x000b1;0.04, consistent with the theoretical value (terms 2 and 3 of the formula are 0). In case there is no dimerization and/or FRET does not occur, term 3 in the formula above is 0 (&#x003b1; and/or <italic>E</italic> is 0), and <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> is directly proportional to the <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> ranges from 0.25 to 0.37 if <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) ranges from 0.5 to 1.5, and <italic>E</italic><sup>*</sup>&#x003b1; = 0 (no FRET and/or dimerization) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). If <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic>&#x0003e;0.37 and <italic>R</italic>(CFP/YFP) is close to 1.0, then term 3 in the formula above must be &#x0003e;0, indicating that FRET occurs between CFP and YFP in dimers of RPTP&#x003b1; fusion proteins. Therefore, we set the threshold level of <italic>F(440)/F(490)</italic> for FRET and dimerization at 0.37.</p></sec><sec><title>FLIM and SPIM</title><p>Both the SPIM and FLIM detector units were built on a Leica DMR upright epifluorescence microscope. Both detector systems are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Briefly, FLIM was implemented in the frequency domain using a homodyne detection scheme and a (wide field) RF-modulated image intensifier-CCD-coupled detector unit, and the SPIM detector unit consisted of an f/4 image spectrograph coupled to a back-illuminated chilled CCD camera.</p><p>For SPIM, excitation was provided by a 100 W Hg Arc lamp of which the 435 nm line was selected by inserting an Omega (Brattleboro, VT, USA) 435DF10 bandpass filter in the excitation light path. The excitation light was reflected onto the sample by an Omega 430DCLP dichroic mirror. A Leica 63x PL Apo water objective (NA = 1.2) was employed, using no coverslip, and immersing with HEPES buffered saline buffer (see above) at 20&#x000b0;C. Residual excitation light was rejected using a Schott (Mainz, Germany) GG455 longpass filter. In the spectrograph (Chromex 250 is (Chromex Inc., Albuquerque, NM, USA)) a 150 grooves/mm grating was used with a central wavelength of 500 nm. Single cells were positioned by aligning them across the entrance slit of the spectrograph (set at 200 &#x003bc;m width corresponding with a line of 3 &#x003bc;m width in the object plane). Acquisition time was 1-2 s. Regions of the image spectrum corresponding to the plasma membrane of labeled cells were distance averaged (typically 5-10 rows of pixels) and the resulting fluorescence spectra were corrected for background fluorescence and camera bias by background subtraction using an extracellular region just next to the plasma membrane region from the same spectral image.</p><p>For FLIM, the cells were excited with the 457 nm argon-ion laser line modulated at 60.116 MHz and the CFP fluorescence was selectively imaged using an Omega 470 DCLP dichroic mirror and an Omega 487RDF42 bandpass emission filter. 20 phase images (1-3 s each) were taken (10 with increasing and 10 with decreasing the phase allowing correction for photobleaching (which was less than 10% in all cases)). Reference phase settings and modulation were calibrated approximately every 30' by measuring a glass microcuvette filled with an erythrosine-B solution in water (single component fluorescence decay with a lifetime of 0.08 ns). The microscope setup, lifetime-image calculation and image processing are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Following transient transfection the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 u/ml aprotinin, 1 &#x003bc;M pMSF, 200 &#x003bc;M sodium orthovanadate), and the amount of protein in the lysates was determined. Subsequently, cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels (7.5 - 12.5%, depending on the size of the construct). The material on the gels was blotted onto PVDF membranes by semi-dry blotting. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h, incubated with antibody in milk for 1.5 h, washed extensively and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Following extensive washing in TBS-T, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. We used anti-GFP MAb (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), anti-HA-tag MAb (12CA5), and affinity purified anti-RPTP&#x003b1; antibodies, raised against the complete cytoplasmic domain (#5478) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] as primary antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemical cross-linking</title><p>Prior to cross-linking, transiently transfected SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells were washed twice with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 2 mg/ml bis [sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate, BS<sup>3</sup> (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS for 1 h on ice. Following cross-linking, the cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS, and the cross-linker was quenched with 50 mM Tris for 15 min. The cells were lysed and aliquots of the lysates were run on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted and probed, using anti-HA-tag antibodies as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>The abbreviations used are: RPTK, receptor protein-tyrosine kinase; RPTP, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; SPIM, spectral imaging microscopy; FLIM, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Roger Y.
