This study shows that mouse NXF7 exhibits heterologous localization, i.e. NXF7 associates with translating ribosomes, stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies), the latter two of which are believed to be cytoplasmic sites of storage, degradation and/or sorting of mRNAs. By yeast two-hybrid screening, a series of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) were identified as possible binding partners for NXF7. Among them, hnRNP A3, which is believed to be involved in translational control and/or cytoplasmic localization of certain mRNAs, formed a stable complex with NXF7 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although hnRNP A3 was not associated with translating ribosomes, it was co-localized with NXF7 in P-bodies. After exposing to oxidative stress, NXF7 trans-localized to SGs, whereas hnRNP A3 did not. In differentiated neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, NXF7 was co-localized with hnRNP A3 in cell body and neurites. The amino terminal half of NXF7, which was required for stable complex formation with hnRNP A3, coincided with the region required for localization in both P-bodies and neuronal RNA granules. These findings suggest that NXF7 plays a role in sorting, transport and/or storage of mRNAs through interactions with hnRNP A3.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shuttling transporters are essential for gene expression, since RNA transcription and protein translation occur at two cellular locations in eukaryotes. The nucleus is the site of transcription of mRNAs, while translation of mRNAs into protein occurs in the cytoplasm. Nuclear RNA eXport Factor 1 (NXF1), originally named Tap, is a non-importin-&#x003b2; type shuttling mRNA transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Tap/NXF1 is a member of the NXF protein family, which is evolutionarily conserved across species from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">5&#x02013;12</xref>). In metazoa, the gene family is structurally and functionally divergent and some members do not participate in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In humans and mice, at least four different NXF family gene products are expressed in different tissues. Among them, the Tap/NXF1 and NXF2 proteins of both human and mouse origin exhibit nuclear mRNA export activity, while others, including human and mouse NXF3, human NXF5, and mouse NXF7 do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In neuronal cells, both mouse NXF7 and human NXF5, as well as mouse NXF2, show prominent cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Such unique localization distinguishes theses factors from other family members. It has been proposed that mouse NXF2 and NXF7 are components of cytoplasmic mRNA granules in neuronal cells and possess additional cytoplasmic functions via interactions with microtubule-associating proteins such as cytoplasmic motor proteins and MAP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>During or soon after transcription, mRNAs undergo various maturation steps including capping, splicing, and 3&#x02032;-end formation in the nucleus. Throughout these processes, mRNAs are associated with various proteins, thus forming messenger ribonucleoproteins particles (mRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The most abundant components of mRNPs are the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which consist of more than 20 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, a series of mRNA-binding proteins, including Aly/REF, Y14, magoh, Upf3 and so on, bind mRNAs during splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>). Subsequently, on mature mRNAs, these proteins are recognized by Tap/NXF1. The bound mRNPs are then transported into the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) via the affinity of Tap/NXF1 for FG-repeat containing nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">21&#x02013;26</xref>). It has also been shown that a subset of proteins containing serine-arginine rich (SR)-domain bind mRNAs, in this case most likely independent of splicing. These proteins are recognized by Tap/NXF1 and, therefore, also play an important role in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). It appears that these proteins act as adaptor molecules that tag fully matured mRNAs, thus exporting only functional mRNAs out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). After transport to the cytoplasm, peripheral components of mRNPs, such as Aly/REF, dissociate from mRNAs; whereas, the core components of exon-junction complex (EJC) and certain hnRNPs may remain bound, contributing to downstream events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). For example, EJC components including the Y14-magoh heterodimer, as well as non-EJC components such as hnRNP A/B family proteins, MARTA1/KSRP and their orthologues, are involved in cytoplasmic mRNA localization in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38">31&#x02013;38</xref>). In addition, Upf3 triggers degradation of aberrant mRNAs containing premature stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>This study demonstrates that NXF7 associated with translating ribosomes, processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs), the latter two of which are proposed to be the sites of storage, degradation and/or sorting of translationally repressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43">40&#x02013;43</xref>). In addition, NXF7 interacted with a series of shuttling hnRNPs, including hnRNP A3. We show that the amino-terminal region together with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NXF7 is responsible for the abilities to bind hnRNP A3 and to be targeted to P-bodies and cytoplasmic processes in cultured neuronal cells. These data indicate that NXF7 may recognize mRNAs through interaction with hnRNPs and may participate in cytoplasmic mRNA storage and/or localization in P-bodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>A cDNA encoding full-length NXF7 was isolated from pEGFP-NXF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and subcloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech) to obtain a bait plasmid (pGBKT7-NXF7) for yeast two-hybrid screening.</p><p>A mammalian expression vector comprised of full-length NXF7 with a carboxyl-terminal GFP-tag was constructed by inserting the NXF7 cDNA into the pEBO-GFP vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), which had been linearlized by Xho I and Nru I digestion.</p><p>Mammalian expression vectors for fusion proteins consisting of CFP and various NXF7 domains were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA fragments, synthesized by PCR using full-length NXF7 as the template, into the pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech).</p><p>Bacterial expression vectors for mouse KSRP and hnRNP E1 were constructed by inserting full-length cDNAs for the corresponding proteins, which had been isolated by RT-PCR from a mouse cDNA library, into the pET-NH<sub>6</sub> vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

To gain further insight into the cytoplasmic function of NXF7, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. Since expression of NXF7 was observed early in embryonic development, especially in extra-embryonic tissues (see supplementary Figure S1), a mouse 7-day embryo cDNA library was used for screening. Of the 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> independent clones screened, 20 positive candidates were obtained.

Therefore, to test the possibility that NXF7 is directly involved together with hnRNPs in mRNA translation, NXF7 association with ribosomes was examined. The subcellular distribution of NXF7 was analyzed by fractionating cytoplasmic extracts prepared from L929 cells stably expressing the NXF7-FLAG fusion protein, using sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, NXF7 was recovered in the polyribosome-containing heavy fractions. Addition of EDTA in extraction buffer and gradient media causes dissociation of ribosomes into the subunits. Under the ribosome dissociating condition, NXF7 was recovered in the upper fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), indicating that NXF7 was associated with ribosomes. When the cells were treated with puromycin, a peptide chain elongation inhibitor that causes loss of translating polyribosomes, NXF7 was recovered in the upper fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B lower left panel). This observation excludes a possibility that NXF7 is involved in Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent large RNPs that are not associated with polyribosomes. It was also found that association of NXF7 to polyribosomes was RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B lower right panel). Similar behavior of NXF7 was confirmed in another cell line (e.g. human 293F) stably expressing GST-tagged NXF7 (data not shown), as well as in cystic embryoid bodies (CEBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, which express NXF7 endogenously (see supplementary Figure S1). In contrast to NXF7, hnRNP A3 was not detected in polyribosome-containing fractions of these cell lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B upper panel, for CEBs see supplementary Figure S1). These results indicate that NXF7 associated with translating ribosomes independently of hnRNP A3, and that the NXF7-hnRNP A3 complex was not directly involved in mRNA translation. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>NXF7 is localized in polyribosomes containing fractions.

To examine whether the dot-like structures were in fact P-bodies, HeLa cells expressing NXF7-GFP were immunostained with an antibody against Dcp1a, a protein marker for P-bodies. The NXF7-GFP fusion protein was expressed as a single band with a molecular weight approximately equal to the expected value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

Since the N-fragment alone (aa 1&#x02013;210) did not exhibit the P-body localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), it was concluded that the N-and LRR-domains, arranged in <italic>cis</italic>, were required for P-body targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Identification of domains required for P-body and SG localization.

Thus, the role of the observed interactions with hnRNP A/B family molecules in the localization of NXF7 in P-bodies was examined. When intracellular localization of hnRNP A3 in HeLa cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using a monospecific antibody (for specificity see Supplementary Figure S2), cytoplasmic dot-like signals and strong nuclear staining were observed. NXF7-GFP co-localized with the hnRNP A3-containing foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The hnRNP A3-containing cytoplasmic foci were observed in other cell lines such as MDCK, Neuro2a and 293 cells (data not shown, see also below). To the contrary, hnRNP A2/B1, which binds weakly to NXF7, did not show such cytoplasmic signals (data not shown). To determine if the hnRNP A3-containing cytoplasmic foci were P-bodies, mRFP-Dcp1a-expressing cells were stained with the anti-hnRNP A3 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, the mRFP-Dcp1a signals almost completely overlapped those of hnRNP A3 in the cytoplasm. When immunostaining with anti-hnRNP A3 was performed in mRFP-Dcp1a and NXF7-GFP double positive cells, all three signals overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Endogenous NXF7 in CEB showed similar localization pattern (i.e. diffuse as well as dot-like cytoplasmic signals). In many cases, NXF7-containing foci were also positive for Dcp1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) and hnRNP A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Thus, one simple interpretation of these results is that NXF7 was localized in P-bodies as a complex with hnRNP A3. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>NXF7 is co-localized with hnRNP A3 in P-bodies.

Even when NXF7-GFP was over-expressed, re-localization of hnRNP A3 to arsenite-induced SGs was hardly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Although enlargement of the Dcp1a-containing foci was observed in the present study, as was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), Dcp1a did not re-localize to arsenite-induced SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E).

Therefore, co-localization of hnRNP A3 and NXF7 in RNA granules in neurites was examined. NXF7-GFP was transiently expressed in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a. Upon exposure to differentiation condition, a fraction of the cells extended cytoplasmic processes. As reported, NXF7-GFP was localized in cell bodies, as well as in the distal cytoplasmic processes. As shown previously, the NXF7-containing granules in neuronal cells were positive for both poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs (see Supplementary Figure S4) and co-transfected mRFP-Staufen (J. K. and T. M., unpublished data). Moreover, endogenous hnRNP A3 was often co-localized with NXF7-GFP at both sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) and NXF7-GFP-containing granules also contained Dcp1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data, the N+LRR (aa 1&#x02013;374), but not the M+C (aa 375&#x02013;620), domain of NXF7 showed co-localization with hnRNP A3, as did wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D).

It already has been shown that NXF7 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of non-neuronal cells where it forms aggregates of unknown nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). By examining heterologous localization patterns, it was found that NXF7 localized in translating ribosomes, P-bodies, neuronal mRNA granules and SGs under various conditions. In addition, a series of hnRNPs that were able to bind NXF7 were identified by yeast two-hybrid screening.</p><p>Since a fraction of NXF7 was found to associate with polyribosomes, the possibility that NXF7 plays a direct role in protein translation was examined. Direct tethering of an MS2 phage coat-NXF7 fusion protein did not alter the expression level of a luciferase reporter gene containing MS2-binding sites at the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) (see Supplementary Figure S5). In addition, there was no effect on bulk translation, as judged from ribosome profiles, in different cell lines stably expressing NXF7 (J.K. unpublished observation). These findings suggest that NXF7 was not directly involved in translation process.</p><p>Among the binding partners of NXF7 identified in this study, the focus was on hnRNP A3, because hnRNP A3 may be involved in translational control and/or cytoplasmic localization of certain mRNAs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Since hnRNP A3 was never co-fractionated with NXF7 in polyribosomes-containing fractions, it was concluded that the complex, as well as NXF7 alone, does not play a direct role in translation. In contrast, a fraction of hnRNP A3 was co-localized with NXF7 in P-bodies and in cytoplasmic processes of neuronal cells, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Since the mutant truncated at the N-terminus (aa 91&#x02013;374) of NXF7 exhibited weaker binding to hnRNP A3 and did not localize in P-bodies, the simplest interpretation for our observations is that the interaction with hnRNP A3 was required for targeting of NXF7 to P-bodies.</p><p>It has been proposed that translational repression and degradation of mRNA occur in P-bodies. On the other hand, it has been postulated that the cytoplasmic fates of different mRNAs are defined during their biogenesis in the nucleus. Specific sequences and/or structures within mRNAs, such as &#x02018;ZIP-code&#x02019; in the 3&#x02032;-UTRs and EJCs, function as primary determinants of mRNA fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56 B57 B58">56&#x02013;58</xref>). Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling mRNA binding proteins that recognize these determinants play key roles in downstream events. Indeed, a subset of EJC components, such as magoh/Y14, and non-EJC components, including hnRNP A/B family proteins from various species (i.e. Hrp48 and squid from fruit fly and hnRNP A2/B1 from mammals), play key roles in translational control and localization of bound mRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37">31&#x02013;37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). In addition, other shuttling hnRNPs such as hnRNP I from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and Vera/ZBP/KSRP from <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chicken and mammals also are implicated in translational control and localization of specific mRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60 B61 B62 B63 B64 B65">60&#x02013;65</xref>). It remains unclear, however, how the localized mRNAs are sorted and separated from the pool of translating mRNAs and then are packed within cytoplasmic granules, such as P-bodies and neuronal mRNA granules. Based on the results of the present study, a plausible mechanism is that attachment of NXF7 to translating ribosomes allows for co-translational scanning of newly exported mRNAs and that NXF7 sorts mRNA through binding to hnRNP A3. Once target mRNAs bound to hnRNP A3 are picked up, NXF7 may stabilize the mRNAs in a conformation that suppresses translation, as proposed for <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This &#x02018;scanning model&#x02019; resembles &#x02018;Pioneer round of translation&#x02019;, a model which was first proposed for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Generally, proteins involved in cytoplasmic mRNA localization and translational control show heterologous localization like NXF7. Such proteins, including FMRP and Staufen, also are localized in translating ribosomes and SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68 B69 B70 B71 B72">68&#x02013;72</xref>) and some of them are localized in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that these proteins are recruited on target mRNAs by a similar co-translational scanning mechanism.</p><p>Localization of NXF7 in SGs was observed in both arsenite-treated and NXF7-overexpressing cells. It is believed that storage or sorting of translationally dormant mRNAs occurs in SGs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). However, re-localization of hnRNP A3 in SGs was not observed and spontaneous formation of SGs did not occur in cells expressing endogenous NXF7 (e.g. CEB, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) or stable cell lines exogenously expressing low level of NXF7 (J. K. unpublished data). Therefore, it is possible that NXF7 may be non-specifically captured within SGs because of its affinity for both ribosomes and mRNAs and that over-production of NXF7 by transient transfection may disturb bulk translation by binding to mRNAs and ribosomes non-specifically, inducing the formation of SGs. The <italic>cis</italic> arrangement of RNP motifs and the LRR domain was required for binding of Tap/NXF1 to the viral CTE RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>) as well as to non-specific RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The observation that targeting of NXF7 to SGs required the same domain organization, which exhibited non-specific interaction with RNAs as does Tap/NXF1 (J. K. unpublished data), but not the full binding activity to hnRNP A3, is consistent with this explanation.</p><p>As reported in this and previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) studies, the expression of NXF7 appears to be restricted in a spacio-temporal manner, although hnRNP A3 is expressed ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Tight regulation of NXF7 expression may be important to avoid inappropriate formation of SGs and to efficiently regulate cytoplasmic mRNA transport. Furthermore, it is highly probable that NXF7 plays non-essential roles in mRNA localization and/or storage, by modulating the functions of hnRNP A3, including the return of target mRNAs from storage sites to the translation pool. Such non-essential functions of NXF7 may allow for tighter regulation such as is required in specific tissues or during development. To validate these or other possibilities and to fully understand the functional role of NXF7, identification of endogenous target mRNAs is essential.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm556_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm556_nar-00982-w-2007-File003.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm556_nar-00982-w-2007-File004.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Drs Jens Lykke-Andersen, Monika Rehbein, Douglas Black, Bryan Cullen and Ross Smith for their generous gifts of reagents.
