Cell lines derived from melanoma tumors at varying stages revealed that RhoA is selectively activated in cells of metastatic origin. We describe a functional proteomics strategy to identify proteins regulated by RhoA and report a previously uncharacterized human protein, named &#x0201c;mediator of RhoA-dependent invasion (MRDI),&#x0201d; that is induced in metastatic cells by constitutive RhoA activation and promotes cell invasion. In human melanomas, MRDI localization correlated with stage, showing nuclear localization in nevi and early stage tumors and cytoplasmic localization with plasma membrane accentuation in late stage tumors. Consistent with its role in promoting cell invasion, MRDI localized to cell protrusions and leading edge membranes in cultured cells and was required for cell motility, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and modulation of actin stress fibers. Unexpectedly MRDI had enzymatic function as an isomerase that converts the <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine catabolite 5-methylribose 1-phosphate into 5-methylribulose 1-phosphate. The enzymatic function of MRDI was required for methionine salvage from <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine but distinct from its function in cell invasion. Thus, mechanisms used by signal transduction pathways to control cell movement have evolved from proteins with ancient function in amino acid metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">R01-CA118972</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">R01-AI060841</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">R01-CA126240</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">P50-CA058187</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">T32-GM008759</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">F32-CA112847</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">F32-CA105796</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cutaneous malignant melanoma has doubled in incidence over the past 30 years. Stages involved in progression of melanocytes to melanoma based on clinical and histopathological features include nontumorigenic nevi, dysplastic or atypical nevi, primary radial growth phase and vertical growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Metastatic melanomas are often resistant to treatment; therefore therapeutic strategies require a more complete understanding of molecular determinants of this disease, particularly those involved in the invasive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Rho GTPases control a wide range of cellular responses including cell movement, morphogenesis, and coordinated migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These pathways are implicated in malignant cell transformation and metastasis based on <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence showing tumorigenic and invasive responses to enhanced signaling in cell lines. Studies have demonstrated that overexpression of RhoC enhances invasion and metastasis in mouse xenografts of human melanoma and lung cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In addition, some human tumors show elevated expression of Rho GTPases and exchange factors and/or reduced expression of GTPase-activating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Signaling through RhoA promotes actin polymerization and stress fiber formation, providing cells with contractile force needed for cell movement. Rho-GTP interacts with various effectors, including Rho-activated kinase, which promotes actin-myosin assembly via phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), or diaphanous-related formins, which nucleate actin filaments and stabilize microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Studies of cultured melanoma cells have revealed an &#x0201c;amoeboid&#x0201d; invasion mechanism involving RhoA-dependent Rho-activated kinase activation and inactivation of Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>RhoA also controls the formation and turnover of focal adhesion contacts, which mediate interactions between extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Signaling involves activation of Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins recruited to integrin receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Embryonic cells from FAK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lose motility and cannot be rescued with FAK harboring a Y397F autophosphorylation site mutation not because they fail to form focal adhesions but because they are unable to disassemble focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, Rho controls cell movement by modulating the turnover of focal adhesion complexes via FAK. However, the mechanisms by which Rho GTPases control FAK are incompletely understood.</p><p>In this study, we report that RhoA was constitutively activated in melanoma cells in a stage-specific pattern with elevated activity in cells from metastatic tumors. We present a functional proteomics screen for molecular targets of RhoA from which we identified a previously uncharacterized human protein induced in response to constitutive RhoA activation. This protein promoted Rho-dependent cell invasion and cell motility and provided a novel link for regulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by RhoA. Thus, we refer to it as &#x0201c;mediator of Rho-dependent invasion (MRDI).&#x0201d; Although human MRDI has not been studied previously, it shows close sequence similarity to a methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase, which functions in methionine salvage pathways characterized in bacteria and yeast. We demonstrated that MRDI indeed has methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase activity and is required for methionine salvage in human cells. We further demonstrated that the catalytic activity of MRDI is independent of its role in cell invasion. Thus, MRDI is a dual function protein with promiscuous roles both as a metabolic enzyme and as an effector of signaling and cancer cell invasion.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Melanoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC or from Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute) and maintained in 10% FBS, RPMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

In a nonmetastatic melanoma cell line in which the activity of RhoA is normally low (WM35) expression of RhoA-V14 caused elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr<sup>397</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Moreover in a metastatic cell line in which RhoA is normally activated (A375), FAK-Tyr(P)<sup>397</sup> was constitutively high and was reduced upon inhibiting RhoA with C3 transferase. Importantly inhibiting MRDI expression by RNAi eliminated FAK-Tyr(P)<sup>397</sup> in metastatic cells. This demonstrates that FAK autophosphorylation is RhoA-dependent and that MRDI is required for this regulation. Previous studies have shown that cells from FAK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lose motility and cannot be rescued with mutant FAK-Y397F because they fail to disassemble focal adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that MRDI might enhance focal adhesion turnover, which would repress stress fiber formation. We examined this prediction and found that knockdown of MRDI in cells from a metastatic tumor caused a significant increase in actin stress fibers compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). Taken together, the results suggest that MRDI promotes cell invasion in response to constitutive RhoA activation in part by promoting FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and stress fiber turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>MRDI Has Dual Function as a Metabolic Enzyme</title><p>MRDI has never been characterized in human systems and in the human database is often annotated as a hypothetical protein.

The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> structure confirmed cocrystallization of the product, MTRu-1-P, within this site (Protein Data Bank code <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2YRF">2YRF</ext-link>; Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The residues coordinating the sulfate ion form an interface between solvent and a deep hydrophobic pocket containing Asp and Cys residues that are conserved throughout the subfamily and correspond to Cys<sup>168</sup> and Asp<sup>248</sup> in human MRDI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900178-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Fig. S10B</ext-link>). We therefore constructed the mutations C168S and D248A in human MRDI and tested their effects on <italic>in vitro</italic> isomerase activity. Either mutation inhibited turnover of MTR-1-P to MTRu-1-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). This identified Cys<sup>168</sup> and Asp<sup>248</sup> as active site residues required for MTR-1-P isomerase catalytic activity.</p><p>To test the cellular function of MRDI in methionine salvage, we measured the dependence of cell growth on MTA. Cells incubated in medium lacking methionine failed to grow, consistent with a requirement for this essential amino acid in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). In contrast, methionine-free medium supplemented with MTA supported cell growth to levels reaching 25% of that in full medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900178-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Fig. S11</ext-link>). Importantly stable knockdown of MRDI completely prevented cell growth in the presence of MTA, and the phenotype was rescued by stable expression of MRDI-WT harboring silent mutations to bypass the shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). In contrast, expression of MRDI-C168S or -D248A mutants failed to rescue the growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). This confirms that MTA is a precursor of methionine in human cells and that the catalytic activity of MRDI as an MTR-1-P isomerase is necessary for metabolic flux through the methionine salvage pathway.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Catalytic activity of MRDI is required for methionine salvage but not cell invasion.</bold><italic>A</italic>, A375 cells grown in the absence of methionine (&#x025b2;) show growth arrest due to lack of an essential amino acid in the medium.

A375 cells were grown as spheroid colonies embedded in collagen, an assay that mimics 3D growth and invasion by melanoma cells surrounded by the main extracellular matrix protein found in human dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Knockdown of endogenous MRDI had no effect on spheroid growth rate but significantly blocked cell invasion into collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Expression of MRDI-WT in the stable knockdown cells rescued the cell invasion phenotype, confirming the specificity of the shRNA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). The key finding was that neither C168S nor D248A mutations affected the ability of MRDI to rescue the knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic>). The results confirm that MRDI promotes melanoma cell invasion in 3D culture and demonstrates that its catalytic activity as an isomerase is not necessary for its function in RhoA signaling and invasion.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our study provides novel insights into how the RhoA pathway controls the cancer phenotype of cell invasion. In melanoma cell lines, MRDI represents a novel target of Rho signaling, functioned in cell invasion, and was necessary for autophosphorylation of FAK, a key mediator of focal adhesion turnover. MRDI showed targeting to membranes in advanced human melanoma specimens and localizes at the leading edge of cells in culture. A role in regulating membrane events was also suggested in cultured cells by live cell imaging and findings that link MRDI to FAK phosphorylation and stress fiber destabilization consistent with its role in promoting cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that MRDI promotes cell invasion under conditions of RhoA pathway dysregulation by regulating molecular events key to the control of membrane dynamics and cell adhesion. A working model is presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900178-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Fig. S12</ext-link>.</p><p>Our proteomics screening strategy involved profiling protein responses to RhoA activation in cells in which the pathway was normally &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; and then carrying out a second screen to filter for targets uniformly regulated across cell lines in which RhoA was constitutively &#x0201c;on.&#x0201d; Only one of the five RhoA targets identified initially in premetastatic cells turned out to be highly correlated with constitutive RhoA activation across many cell lines. The fact that MRDI was validated as a regulator of RhoA-dependent cellular responses and correlated with melanoma stage illustrates the utility of prioritizing functional targets by filtering out bystanders that vary between cells because they have no regulatory function.</p><p>Our study also showed that the activation state of RhoA is differentially elevated in melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic tumors, revealing a role for RhoA signaling that is distinct from the previous characterization of RhoC in promoting melanoma metastases. The results underscore the importance of monitoring Rho-GTP levels given that the pathway activation in metastatic cell lines was not reflected by Rho protein expression. Rho activity assays are not routinely measured in cancer samples because of difficulties in performing GTP binding assays on tissue specimens. Future studies are needed to examine whether MRDI is a useful marker for Rho activation in clinical samples.</p><p>A completely unexpected finding was that MRDI has promiscuous function, acting both as a metabolic enzyme and a regulator of signal transduction. Enzymatic pathways involved in catabolism of MTA are ancient, having been delineated in bacteria and Archaea where they convert MTRu-1-P to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate as a precursor of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In contrast, pathways for methionine salvage in humans are incompletely defined, and many of the enzymes that make up these pathways have not been mapped in mammalian genomes. Thus, metabolic conversion of MTR-1-P to MTRu-1-P has been demonstrated in rat cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), but the isomerase responsible for this conversion has not been identified until now. By showing that MRDI catalyzes the conversion of MTR-1-P to MTRu-1-P and demonstrating the dependence of activity on residues Cys<sup>168</sup> and Asp<sup>248</sup>, we identified the human MTR-1-P isomerase as well as confirmed residues in the enzyme active site. By showing that MRDI is required for growth in MTA in methionine-free medium and that growth depends on the Cys and Asp residues, we confirmed that MRDI functions as a necessary component in the pathway for methionine salvage from decarboxylated <italic>S</italic>-AdoMet. Thus, MRDI joins a handful of metabolic enzymes with &#x0201c;moonlighting&#x0201d; function in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>MTR-1-P isomerase is not the only methionine salvage enzyme to be implicated in cancer. MTA phosphorylase, which catalyzes the conversion of MTA + P<sub>i</sub> &#x02192; MTR-1-P + adenine, is deficient in many cancer types including melanoma, often accompanying co-deletion in the chromosome 9q21 region with p19INK4/CDKN2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). MTA phosphorylase is a target for development of inhibitors, which induce apoptosis in head and neck cancer cells, and loss of enzyme enhances cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The mechanisms for cell toxicity have been variously ascribed to suppression of MTA recycling to <italic>S</italic>-AdoMet via methionine or inhibition of purine salvage initiated by the adenine product of MTA phosphorylase. MTA phosphorylase also has tumor suppressor function in certain cancer cells ascribed to autocrine effects of MTA buildup on growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Our results are in contrast to the example of MTA phosphorylase because we showed unequivocally that MRDI controls cancer cell behavior in a manner that is independent of its catalytic function. We speculate that MRDI elevates cell invasion via protein-protein interactions mediated by surface residues distal to the enzyme active site. Thus, MRDI provides unique evidence that some of the processes regulating control of cell adhesion and motility by signal transduction pathways have evolved from protein scaffolds with ancient metabolic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M900178-MCP200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M900178-MCP200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" xlink:href="M900178-MCP200_movieS1.mov"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" xlink:href="M900178-MCP200_movieS2.mov"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to Lucy Ghoda, Indranil Basu, Vern Schramm, Channing Der, Joan Heller Brown, and Amy Abell for reagents and advice with assays and to Emily Anderson, Carrie Croy, and Anastasia Khvorova for help in facilitating RNAi experiments.
