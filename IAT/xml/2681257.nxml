For example, Gq/phospholipase (PL)C&#x003b2; signaling by TP&#x003b1; is directly inhibited by the vasodilators prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) whereas that signaling by TP&#x003b2; is unaffected. Herein, we investigated whether TP&#x003b1; and/or TP&#x003b2; regulate G<sub>12</sub>/Rho activation and whether that signaling might be differentially regulated by prostacyclin and/or NO. Both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; independently regulated RhoA activation and signaling in clonal cells over-expressing TP&#x003b1; or TP&#x003b2; and in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (1&#x000b0; AoSMCs). While RhoA-signaling by TP&#x003b1; was directly impaired by prostacyclin and NO through protein kinase (PK)A- and PKG-dependent phosphorylation, respectively, signaling by TP&#x003b2; was not directly affected by either agent. Collectively, while TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; contribute to RhoA activation, our findings support the hypothesis that TP&#x003b1; is involved in the dynamic regulation of haemostasis and vascular tone, such as in response to prostacyclin and NO. Conversely, the role of TP&#x003b2; in such processes remains unsolved. Data herein provide essential new insights into the physiologic roles of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; and, through studies in AoSMCs, reveal an additional mode of regulation of VSM contractile responses by TXA<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>HA, hemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>IP, prostacyclin receptor</kwd><kwd>IP<sub>3</sub>, inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate</kwd><kwd>NO, nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase</kwd><kwd>PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</kwd><kwd>PG, prostaglandin</kwd><kwd>PK, protein kinase</kwd><kwd>PL, phospholipase</kwd><kwd>sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, HCl</kwd><kwd>TP, TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor</kwd><kwd>TX, thromboxane</kwd><kwd>VSM, vascular smooth muscle.</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Thromboxane receptor</kwd><kwd>RhoA</kwd><kwd>Nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>Prostacyclin</kwd><kwd>Protein kinase</kwd><kwd>Heterologous desensitization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The phosphorylation status of myosin light chain (MLC) of the actomyosin complex plays a central role in regulating the various types of cytoskeletal reorganizations that widely occur within the vasculature including in platelet shape change and aggregation, tonic- or agonist-induced contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), cell migration, cell proliferation and stress fibre formation <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many of the physiologic regulators of platelets and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction, including thromboxane (TX) A<sub>2</sub>, thrombin, ADP, prostaglandin (PG) I<sub>2</sub> or PGD<sub>2</sub>, act through specific G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) -effector systems <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While agents such as TXA<sub>2</sub> and thrombin that promote platelet activation or SMC contraction induce Gq-dependent phospholipase (PL)C&#x003b2; activation to evoke calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) -dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>, they may also engage the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pathway involving receptor co-coupling to G<sub>12</sub> and RhoA signalling <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. G<sub>12</sub> members, particularly G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, activate RGS (regulators of G protein signaling)-box containing members of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) family, such as p115 RhoGEF, PDZ RhoGEF or LARG, to activate RhoA and its key effector in this system Rho kinase 1 (also known as p164 ROK&#x003b1;/ROCK2) and 2 (p160 ROK&#x003b2;/ROCK1), herein termed Rho kinase/ROCK <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[3&#x02013;5]</xref>. Rho kinases, in turn, phosphorylate, and inactivate, myosin phosphatase, MLC itself and the myosin phosphatase inhibitor CPI-17 resulting in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent increase in overall levels of phosphorylated MLC through a Rho/Rho kinase-mechanism <xref rid="bib2 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[2,4,5]</xref>. Other targets of Rho kinase include its phosphorylation-dependent activation of LIM kinases which, in turn, phosphorylate and inactivate the actin depolymerizing agent cofilin <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The central importance of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent mechanism of contraction within the vasculature has been highlighted through findings that disorders of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway are major underlying causes of hypertension, vascular spasm and atherosclerosis making Rho kinase an important therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[1,2,6]</xref>.</p><p>The prostanoid TXA<sub>2</sub> plays an essential role within the vasculature inducing a diversity of cellular responses including platelet shape change, secretion and aggregation, VSMC contraction and migration and is widely implicated in a number of cardiovascular disorders including thrombosis, hypertension, vessel remodelling and atherosclerotic progression <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. As a predominantly Gq/PLC&#x003b2;-coupled GPCR, the TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor or TP can induce both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and G<sub>12/13</sub>-mediated RhoA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent responses platelets and VSMCs <xref rid="bib1 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[1,8]</xref>. For example, platelets from G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>-deficient mice do not undergo RhoA-dependent shape change in response to low levels of TXA<sub>2</sub> but retain the ability to undergo Gq/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent shape change and aggregation at higher agonist concentrations <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similarly, both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent/PLC&#x003b2; and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent/RhoA mechanisms contribute to TXA<sub>2</sub>-induced contraction in isolated bovine aortic (Ao) SMCs and in VSM tissue from various other species <xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[10&#x02013;12]</xref>. Notably however, in humans, but not in non-primates, TXA<sub>2</sub> actually signals through two distinct TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor isoforms termed TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; that arise through alternative splicing and differ exclusively in their carboxyl-terminal (C tail) domains <xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[13&#x02013;15]</xref>. Whilst it is currently unknown whether TP&#x003b1; or TP&#x003b2; independently or indeed differentially modulate RhoA activation and downstream signaling, there is substantial evidence that the TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms can differentially regulate other cellular effectors raising that possibility <xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[16&#x02013;21]</xref>.</p><p>While both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; are predominantly coupled to Gq/PLC&#x003b2; activation <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, they can independently regulate other secondary effector systems including opposite regulation of adenylyl cyclase via Gs and Gi, respectively <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Additionally, TP&#x003b1;, but not TP&#x003b2;, couples to PLC&#x003b4; activation via Gh/tissue transglutaminase <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Whereas both TPs are expressed in VSMCs, TP&#x003b1; is the predominant isoform expressed in human platelets <xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[25,26]</xref>. Consistent with this, in studies investigating intermolecular cross talk between the pro-aggregatory TXA<sub>2</sub> and the inhibitory prostanoid prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>), it was established that Gq/PLC&#x003b2; coupling and signaling by TP&#x003b1;, but not TP&#x003b2;, undergoes prostacyclin- induced desensitization mediated through direct cAMP-protein kinase (PK) A phosphorylation of TP&#x003b1; at Ser<sup>329</sup> within its unique C-tail domain <xref rid="bib21 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[21,27]</xref>. Moreover, Gq/PLC&#x003b2; signaling by TP&#x003b1;, but not TP&#x003b2;, is also desensitized by the platelet antagonist /vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), involving direct NO/cGMP-dependent PKG phosphorylation of TP&#x003b1; also within its unique C-tail <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> The implication from these studies is that TP&#x003b1; plays a critical role in vascular haemostasis acting as the major TP target for regulation/inhibition by prostacyclin and NO, such as within the anucleate platelet that predominantly expresses TP&#x003b1;. However, the impact of such direct inhibitory effects of prostacyclin and NO mediated by PKA and PKG, respectively, on signaling by TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; through other effector systems, such as through RhoA, is currently unknown but, clearly, any differential regulatory effects by either prostacyclin or NO on such TXA<sub>2</sub> signaling may have direct clinical implications, for example within human VSMCs that express both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms. Hence, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether TP&#x003b1; and/or TP&#x003b2; independently regulate G<sub>12</sub>/Rho activation and signaling and to establish whether that signaling is differentially regulated by the inhibitory prostacyclin/cAMP/PKA and NO/cGMP/PKG systems. These studies provide essential new insights into the physiologic roles of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; and, through studies in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (1&#x000b0; AoSMCs), reveal an additional mode of regulation of VSM contractile responses by the potent autocoid TXA<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>U46619, SQ29,548, BW245C, FK409, FURA2/AM were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company; SIN-1 and Y-27632 from Calbiochem; 3F10 <italic>anti</italic>-HA, 3F10 <italic>anti</italic>-HA-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody and chemiluminescence detection kit from Roche; <italic>anti</italic>-RhoA 26C4 (Sc-418), <italic>anti</italic>-phospho-RhoA<sup>Ser188</sup> (Sc-32954-R), <italic>anti</italic>-G&#x003b1;<sub>12/13</sub> H-300 (Sc-28588), <italic>anti</italic>-G&#x003b1;q C15 (SC-392), HRP-conjugated goat <italic>anti</italic>-mouse (Sc-2005), HRP-conjugated mouse <italic>anti</italic>-goat (Sc-2354) and HRP-conjugated goat <italic>anti</italic>-rabbit (Sc-2004) antibodies from Santa Cruz; Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and FITC conjugated goat <italic>anti</italic>-rabbit antibody from Sigma; <italic>anti</italic>-cofilin (# 3312) and <italic>anti</italic>-phospho-cofilin (phospho<sup>Ser3</sup>, # 3311) were from Cell Signaling; Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 488 phalloidin (A12379; Excitation / Emission A<sub>495/518&#x000a0;nm</sub>) from Molecular Probes; <italic>anti</italic>-HDJ2 antibody from Neomarkers; Opti-MEM&#x000ae; and Oligofectamine&#x000ae; were from Invitrogen.

Additionally, RNA<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> directed to Lamin A/C, acting as a control, had no effect on either TP&#x003b1; or TP&#x003b2; expression in either cell line (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A). Moreover, pre-incubation of HEK.TP&#x003b1; cells with siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> significantly impaired U46619-induced RhoA activation but had no significant effect on such signaling in HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B). Conversely the <italic>anti</italic>-TP&#x003b2; siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> significantly impaired U46619-induced RhoA activation in HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells but had no effect on such signaling in HEK.TP&#x003b1; cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B). RNA<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> directed to Lamin A/C had no effect on either TP&#x003b1;- or TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B). Consistent with these findings, siRNAs directed to TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; also impaired U46619-mediated F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation in HEK.TP&#x003b1; and HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells, respectively, and in an entirely isoform specific manner (data not shown).</p><p>Having established the specificity of the siRNA reagents to impair expression and RhoA-dependent signaling by both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; in HEK 293 cells, we next examined their ability to affect expression and signaling by the individual TP isoforms in h.AoSMCs. The effective delivery and utility of the latter siRNAs in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs was initially confirmed whereby the siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> impaired expression of TP&#x003b1; but not of TP&#x003b2; while siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> reduced expression of TP&#x003b2; but not of TP&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>A). Consistent with the reduced expression of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; following incubation of the 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs with the isoform-specific siRNAs, there were reductions in U46619-induced Rho activation and cofilin phosphorylation in the presence of RNA<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> directed to either TP but not directed to Lamin A/C (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>B). Moreover, incubation of the 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs with both siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> and siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> led to a further significant reduction in U46619-induced Rho activation and cofilin phosphorylation. Hence, these data clearly suggest that both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; contribute to the Rho activation in h.AoSMCs.</p><p>We next examined the effect of the inhibitory vasodilatory agents SIN-1 and Cicaprost on U46619-mediated RhoA activation and signaling in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs in the presence of the respective TP-isoform specific siRNA reagents. In the absence of siRNA, SIN-1 and Cicaprost significantly impaired U46619-mediated RhoA activation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>C) consistent with our earlier findings in both 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A and B) and in HEK.TP&#x003b1; cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and C). Following 72&#x000a0;h incubation with siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub>, the NO donor SIN-1 specifically impaired U46619-mediated RhoA activation in h.AoSMCs to levels greater than that observed in vehicle treated cells. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of SIN-1 on U46619-mediated RhoA activation in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs was significantly less in the presence of siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> at 72&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>C). Similarly, SIN-1 impaired U46619-mediated cofilin phosphorylation in the presence of siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> to levels similar to those observed in vehicle-treated cells but its ability to impair U46619-signaling in the presence of siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> was almost fully abolished (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>D). Moreover, the prostacyclin analogue Cicaprost significantly impaired Rho activation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>C) and cofilin phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>D) in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs pre-treated with siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> to levels similar to that observed in the control, vehicle-treated cells while its ability to impair that signaling in cells pre-treated with the siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> was almost completely abolished.</p><p>Hence, we conclude that, similar to that which occurs for TP-mediated Gq/PLC&#x003b2; activation, both the NO and prostacyclin analogues SIN-1 and Cicaprost impair TP-mediated cytoskeletal changes involving RhoA activation and cofilin phosphorylation in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs and that they do so, at least in part, by specifically and directly targeting TP&#x003b1;, impairing its downstream signaling. On the other hand, neither vasodilatory agent directly target TP&#x003b2;. Hence, TP&#x003b1;- and TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA signaling functionally diverge at the point at which prostacyclin and NO affect the RhoA signaling cascade.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Much of the molecular events that underlie the complex physiologic processes of platelet aggregation and thrombosis, VSM contraction, migration, proliferation involve the fundamental reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Throughout these studies, TP-mediated RhoA signaling was determined by monitoring its activation-dependent interaction with the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of its effector rhotekin in GST-RBD pulldown assays in response to the TXA<sub>2</sub> mimetic U46619. Moreover, we also investigated the ability of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; to regulate events downstream of RhoA: effector coupling by monitoring U46619-induced F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation. The ubiquitously expressed actin-depolymerising factor cofilin readily undergoes Rho/Rho kinase-dependent phosphorylation at Ser<sup>3</sup> either by the LIM kinase 1/2 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and was used herein as a monitor of events downstream of Rho kinase in the Rho signaling cascade. Our conclusions are several-fold. Both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; expressed in HEK 293 cells readily induced RhoA activation, F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation in response to U46619. In general, GPCR-mediated RhoA activation largely occurs through a G<sub>12</sub>, mainly G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, -dependent mechanism but in certain settings, particularly at higher agonist concentrations, may also occur through a Gq-mechanism through the specific involvement of the LARG (Leukemia-associated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor), but not the p115- or PDZ-, member of the RGS-containing RhoGEF family <xref rid="bib1 bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr">[1,31&#x02013;33]</xref>. Hence, herein, we sought to clarify the involvement of G<sub>12</sub> and Gq on TP-mediated RhoA signaling and found that dominant negative forms of G&#x003b1;<sub>12</sub> (G&#x003b1;<sub>12</sub><sup>G228A</sup>), not of G&#x003b1;q (G&#x003b1;q<sup>Q209l,D277N</sup>), significantly impaired U46619-mediated RhoA activation and cofilin phosphorylation. Collectively, these data confirmed that both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; can independently couple to Gq/PLC&#x003b2; activation and G&#x003b1;<sub>12</sub>/G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>/RhoGEF-RhoA activation and are in agreement with a host of studies in mouse platelets whereby the single TP in that species couples to Gq/PLC&#x003b2; and to G<sub>12</sub>/RhoA activation to independently regulate platelet activation (aggregation and secretion) and platelet shape change responses, respectively <xref rid="bib1 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[1,8]</xref>.</p><p>Thereafter, we investigated the effect of the selective prostacyclin analogue Cicaprost and the NO donor SIN-1 on TP-mediated RhoA activation and signaling. Consistent with our previous reports <xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[20,21,27]</xref>, Gq/PLC&#x003b2;-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b1;, but not by TP&#x003b2;, was desensitized in response to both Cicaprost and NO stimulation. In keeping with this, TP&#x003b1;-mediated RhoA activation, F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation was also specifically impaired by Cicaprost and SIN-1 while neither agent affected Rho-mediated signaling by TP&#x003b2;. As stated, while both prostacyclin and NO desensitize TP&#x003b1;-mediated Gq/PLC&#x003b2; signaling, they do so by entirely independent mechanisms involving direct PKA- and PKG- mediated phosphorylation of TP&#x003b1; at Ser<sup>329</sup> and Ser<sup>331</sup>, respectively, within its unique C-tail domain <xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. Hence, we next compared the effect of SIN-1 and Cicaprost on Rho-signaling by TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329A</sup>, TP&#x003b1;<sup>S331A</sup>, TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329,331A</sup>, variants of TP&#x003b1; defective in the prostacyclin-sensitive PKA (at Ser<sup>329</sup>), NO-sensitive PKG (at Ser<sup>331</sup>) or both (at Ser<sup>329,331</sup>) phospho-target sites <xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. While SIN-1 and the alternative NO-donor FK409 impaired U46619-induced RhoA activation, cofilin phosphorylation, F-actin polymerization as well as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329A</sup>, they had no affect on signaling by TP&#x003b1;<sup>S331A</sup> and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329,331A</sup>. Conversely, both Cicaprost and the PGD<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist BW245C impaired RhoA activation, cofilin phosphorylation, F-actin polymerization and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S331A</sup> but had no affect on signaling by TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329A</sup> and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329,331A</sup>. Collectively, these data suggest that both Gq/PLC&#x003b2;-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization and G<sub>12</sub>/RhoGEF -dependent RhoA activation of its effector rhotekin and cofilin phosphorylation by TP&#x003b1;, but not by TP&#x003b2;, are specifically impaired by the potent vasodilators SIN-1 and Cicaprost in this cellular context, at least. Of course the inhibitory effects of both prostacyclin and NO, and other agents that signal through cAMP and cGMP, on RhoA signaling are widely documented and form an essential component of the homeostatic regulatory mechanism that determines the balance between activation and inhibition, particularly within the vasculature <xref rid="bib1 bib6 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[1,6,36]</xref>. Hence, it is arguable that the effects of Cicaprost and SIN-1 on TP&#x003b1;-mediated Rho signaling in HEK 293 cells are perhaps somewhat predictable. However, the fact that RhoA-mediated signaling by TP&#x003b1;<sup>S331A</sup> and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329,331A</sup> is unaffected by SIN-1 while that signaling by TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329A</sup> and TP&#x003b1;<sup>S329,331A</sup> is unaffected by Cicaprost clearly suggest that the observed effects of SIN-1 and Cicaprost on TP&#x003b1;, in the HEK 293 over-expression system at least, are due to direct effects on TP&#x003b1; itself, namely through site specific prostacyclin-induced PKA (at Ser<sup>329</sup>) and NO-induced PKG (at Ser<sup>331</sup>) phosphorylation rather than at some other intermediary in the RhoA signaling cascade. Moreover, in keeping with that hypothesis, the finding that agonist-induced G<sub>12</sub>/RhoA signaling by TP&#x003b2; is not affected by either prostacyclin or NO again suggests that the effects of both vasodilators are due to direct effects on TP&#x003b1; itself and is entirely consistent with previous findings involving both prostacyclin- and NO-mediated desensitization of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; signaling through the Gq/PLC&#x003b2; effector system <xref rid="bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. The fact that we do not observe any measurable inhibitory effects on TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA signaling by either Cicaprost or SIN-1, such as might be expected to occur at a later point in the signaling cascade <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, could in theory be due to the fact that the level of TP receptor expression in the HEK 293 stable cell lines produces an overriding forward signal, overwhelming any inhibitory effects of prostacyclin or NO.</p><p>Therefore, we extended our studies by investigating TP-mediated Rho activation and cytoskeletal signaling in the more physiologically relevant primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. As expected, stimulation of cultured 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs with U46619 led to a concentration-dependent RhoA activation, F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation. Moreover, Cicaprost (IP agonist) and BW245C (DP agonist) and the NO donors SIN-1 and FK409 each significantly impaired such U46619-induced RhoA activation, F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs. Hence, collectively, both NO-donors and the vasodilatory prostanoids prostacyclin and PGD<sub>2</sub> readily desensitize TP-mediated Rho activation and cytoskeletal signaling in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs, findings entirely predicted from and in keeping with outcomes from other systems <xref rid="bib6 bib8 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[6,8,35,36]</xref>. However, as stated, our data generated in the HEK 293 cell lines over-expressing the individual TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms suggest that such inhibitory responses of prostacyclin and NO are mediated, at least in part, directly at the level of TP&#x003b1; itself rather than at the level of other well documented targets of cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG on Rho signaling <xref rid="bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref>. Human AoSMCs express both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms <xref rid="bib26 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[26,30]</xref>. Hence, through the use of TP isoform-specific siRNA, we sought to determine whether TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; independently contribute to U46619-induced RhoA activation and signaling in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs and to ascertain whether the inhibitory effects of NO and/or Cicaprost may directly target TP&#x003b1;, or indeed TP&#x003b2;, at the level of the receptor itself and/or in addition to other downstream targets <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Under optimized experimental conditions, the specificity and utility of the siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> and siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> reagents were validated whereby we observed effective isoform-specific knock-down of both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; expression and RhoA-mediated signaling in their respective HEK 293 cell lines. Moreover, the effective delivery and utility of the latter siRNAs in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs was confirmed whereby the siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> reduced expression of TP&#x003b1; but not of TP&#x003b2;, while siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> reduced expression of TP&#x003b2; but not of TP&#x003b1;. It was notable that the level of siRNA-mediated impairment of TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; expression in the 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs was significantly higher than observed in HEK.TP&#x003b1; or HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is simply owing to the fact that the stably transfected HEK 293 cell lines express TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; in abundance (~&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;pmol/mg protein) relative to that expressed in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs (20&#x02013;50 fmol/mg protein) and hence, the inability of the siRNA to completely konckdown TP&#x003b1; or TP&#x003b2; expression in HEK.TP&#x003b1; or HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells was not surprising. Consistent with their reduced expression in the 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs, there was a significant reduction in U46619-mediated Rho activation and cofilin phosphorylation in the presence of RNA<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> directed to either TP&#x003b1; or TP&#x003b2; but not to Lamin A/C confirming that both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; contribute to the RhoA activation in h.AoSMCs. While SIN-1 and Cicaprost significantly impaired U46619-mediated RhoA activation in the presence of the siRNA directed to Lamin A/C to levels similar to that in vehicle-treated cells, the inhibitory action of both agents on RhoA activation and cofilin phosphorylation in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs exposed to the siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b1;</sub> was substantially impaired. On the other hand, in the presence of siRNA<sub>TP&#x003b2;</sub> both SIN-1 and Cicaprost reduced U46619-mediated RhoA, F-actin polymerization (data not shown) and cofilin phosphorylation to levels not significantly different to those observed in vehicle-treated cells. Hence, both the NO and prostacyclin impair TP-mediated cytoskeletal changes involving RhoA activation, F-actin polymerization and cofilin phosphorylation in 1&#x000b0; h.AoSMCs and they do so, at least in part, by specifically and directly targeting TP&#x003b1; impairing its downstream signaling. On the other hand, neither vasodilatory agent directly target TP&#x003b2;.</p><p>As stated, it is widely held that agents that signal through either cAMP- or cGMP-second messenger systems play a critical counter-balancing/inhibitory affect on RhoA-mediated signaling cascades <xref rid="bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref> as well as regulating Rho-mediated transcriptional responses through the serum response factor <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In fact within the vasculature, there is a critical reciprocal relationship between RhoA signaling and expression and that of NO-signaling and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) <xref rid="bib6 bib36 bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr">[6,36,41,42]</xref>. Moreover, in platelets there is a differential effect whereby cAMP/PKA inhibits both the Gq/PLC&#x003b2;-mediated aggregation and secretion and the G<sub>12</sub>/Rho-mediated shape change while cGMP/PKG signaling inhibits the former Gq/Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanism but does not affect the latter RhoA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent mechanism <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Clearly many of the actions of cAMP and cGMP on RhoA signaling are mediated through their respective second messenger kinases PKA and PKG, respectively <xref rid="bib6 bib35 bib36 bib43" ref-type="bibr">[6,35,36,43]</xref> and more recently it has been established that this may largely occur through their direct phosphorylation of RhoA itself at an identical site, namely Ser<sup>188</sup> within its hypervariable region <xref rid="bib36 bib42 bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr">[36,42,44,45]</xref>. Whilst phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser<sup>188</sup> does not apparently alter its association with either RhoGEFs or RhoGAPs (GTPase activating proteins), it significantly increases its interaction with RhoGDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) thereby reducing the level of membrane bound RhoA and impairing its ability to activate its key effectors including Rho Kinases <xref rid="bib36 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[36,46]</xref>. Moreover, in a recent study investigating NGF-mediated RhoA responses in neuronal PC12 cells, Nusser et al. provided <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence to suggest that Ser<sup>188</sup> phosphorylation of RhoA impairs activation of Rho kinase (ROCK 1/2), but does not affect its ability to activate other Rho effectors including rhotekin, mDia-1 and PKN <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. From their studies, they proposed that Ser<sup>188</sup> phosphorylation of RhoA may act as a &#x02018;secondary molecular switch&#x02019; capable of overriding GTP-elicited activation of certain RhoA effectors, such as ROCK, but directing it to signal with (an)other subset of Rho effectors, perhaps in a cell specific manner. Returning to studies herein on TP&#x003b1;- and TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA signalling, both NO and prostacyclin directly target RhoA phosphorylation at Ser<sup>188</sup> through their regulation of PKG and PKA signaling, respectively (data not shown). Hence, RhoA-mediated signaling by TP&#x003b1; is subject to regulation by both direct prostacyclin/PKA and NO/PKG-inhibition mediated through their respective phosphorylation of Ser<sup>329</sup> and Ser<sup>331</sup> within the unique C-tail domain of TP&#x003b1; in addition to the more general type of regulation through Ser<sup>188</sup> phosphorylation of RhoA. On the other hand, TP&#x003b2; is not a direct target for either PKA or PKG phosphorylation or inhibition, but its RhoA-mediated signaling would be sensitive to RhoA phosphorylation by either second messenger kinase. Whilst it has not as yet been established whether the &#x0201c;molecular switch mechanism&#x0201d; resulting from RhoA<sup>S188</sup> phosphorylation proposed by Nusser et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> to exist in neuronal cells can be extended to other cell/tissue types, such as smooth muscle, it is tempting to speculate.</p><p>Hence, as presented in our model (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>), we propose that as TP&#x003b1; is directly targeted for inhibition by prostacyclin and NO, its signaling would be fully impaired by either vasodilator beginning at the level of the receptor itself. On the other hand, as TP&#x003b2; is not subject to direct PKA or PKG phosphorylation, its signaling by prostacyclin or NO may only be regulated at downstream intermediary level(s), such as at the level of RhoA phosphorylation. In the event that the &#x02018;phospho-RhoA<sup>Ser188</sup> switch mechanism&#x02019; exists within TXA<sub>2</sub>-responsive VSM or indeed in platelets, RhoA signaling through TP&#x003b2; may be directed away from one effector system, such as ROCK signaling, in the direction of another effector(s), such as rhotekin, mDia-1 and PKN (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) as proposed by Nusser et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> in the neuronal system, or indeed toward other subset(s) of the many diverse RhoA effectors, perhaps in a cell specific manner. Final clarification as to whether such a mechanism exists will require further detailed investigation.</p><p>Hence, in summary TP&#x003b1;- and TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA signaling functionally diverge at the point at which prostacyclin and NO affect the RhoA signaling cascade. These data further support the hypothesis that TP&#x003b1; is the major regulatory TP isoform involved in vascular hemostasis being a direct target for inhibition of both its Gq/PLC&#x003b2;/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and G<sub>12</sub>/RhoA/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling by prostacyclin and NO within the vasculature. On the other hand, as TP&#x003b2; remains unaffected by either agent, at the interface of the receptor at least, the functional role of TP&#x003b2; remains to be further clearly defined. The data herein highlight further critical differences between the TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; receptor isoforms in terms of their regulation of Rho signaling that are likely to be physiologically relevant in human tissues such as SM and suggest that selective targeting and impairment of TP&#x003b1;-mediated signaling may offer a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of certain vascular diseases such as systemic- and pulmonary-hypertension in which both TXA<sub>2</sub> and RhoA dysfunction has been implicated <xref rid="bib2 bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[2,48,49]</xref>. Moreover, the data also suggests that for effective impairment of TP&#x003b2;-mediated RhoA activation and signaling in such clinical settings, it may be necessary to fully antagonize it at the level of the TP&#x003b2; receptor itself rather than at a later downstream step, such as most typically at the level Rho kinase/ROCK inhibition <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="app1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix A</label><title>Supplemental figures</title><p><fig id="N0x19d4360N0x2cb4e90" position="anchor"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cicaprost- and SIN-1-induced Desesitization of TP-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic>i</italic> Mobilization.

Panels A and B: Agonist (TXA<sub>2</sub>/U46619)-activated TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; couples to G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>/PLC&#x003b2;, yielding increases in IP<sub>3</sub>, mobilization of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> leading to sequential Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent activation of MLCK, MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation and actomyosin formation resulting in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent F actin polymerization. Agonist-activated TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; can simultaneously co-couple to G<sub>12</sub>/RhoGEF to activate RhoA and a host of its effectors including Rho kinase (ROCK), mammalian diaphanous protein (mDIA), Rhotekin, protein kinase (PK)N, amongst many others. ROCK phosphorylates: (i) the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase (MPTase), inhibiting its activity; (ii) and activates CPI-17, a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor of MPTase; (iii) MLC<sub>20</sub> itself; (iv) LIM kinase (LIMK) which, in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates the actin depolymerizing agent Cofilin. These combined actions of ROCK contributes to the Rho A/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent mechanism for regulating stress fibre formation in non-muscle cells, smooth muscle contraction and platelet shape change. Panel A: The second messenger kinases cAMP-dependent PKA and cGMP-dependent PKG, activated in response to prostacyclin and NO signalling, respectively, cannot only impair TP&#x003b1;-mediated Gq-PLC&#x003b2; signaling and G<sub>12</sub>-RhoGEF signaling through direct phosphorylation of TP&#x003b1; at Ser<sup>329</sup> and Ser<sup>331</sup>, respectively, but may also impair that TP&#x003b1;-mediated signalling, such as at the level of RhoA itself through Ser<sup>188</sup> phosphorylation. Panel B: On the other hand, as TP&#x003b2; is not subject to direct PKA or PKG phosphorylation, its signaling by prostacyclin or NO may only be regulated at downstream intermediary level(s), such as at the level of RhoA (Ser<sup>188</sup>) phosphorylation. Y27632 is a selective inhibitor of Rho kinase.
