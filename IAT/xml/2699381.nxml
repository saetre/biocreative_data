We find that while T cell help for all antibody isotypes (including IgG2c) is impaired in ICOS knockout (ICOS-KO) mice, the IFN-&#x003b3; response is little affected, indicating a defect in helper function that is unrelated to cytokine production. In addition, the ICOS-negative T cells do not accumulate in B cell follicles. Secondary (memory), but not primary, clonal proliferation of antigen-specific B cells is impaired in ICOS-KO mice, as is the generation of secondary antibody-secreting cells. Analysis of endogenous CD4 memory cells in ICOS-KO mice, using MHC class II tetramers, reveals normal primary clonal expansion, formation of memory clones and long-term (10 wk) survival of memory cells, but defective expansion upon reactivation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The data point to a role of ICOS in supporting secondary, memory and effector T cell responses, possibly by influencing cell survival. The data also highlight differences in ICOS dependency of endogenous T cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to that of adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>Cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>Costimulation</kwd><kwd>Memory</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Inducible costimulator (ICOS) is a costimulatory molecule in the CD28 family, whose expression is induced during the activation of CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Most notably, it is expressed on the T cell subset found in B cell follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. It is also associated with the production of IL-10 by T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. ICOS ligand (ICOSL), also known as B7RP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>], B7-H2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], or B7h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], is expressed on resting B cells, dendritic cells (DC) and activated monocytes. Genetic deletion of ICOS in mice has clarified some of the issues concerning ICOS function, while confusing others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. For instance, it became clear that in the absence of ICOS the T-dependent B cell response was impaired such that development of germinal centers was minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>] and the secretion of switched isotype antibody responses following immunization was defective. Initially, the defect in the production of cytokines by T cells in the knockout mice was shown to be in the Th2 arm of the response (<italic>e.g.</italic> reduced IL-4), as well as a lack of IL-10, while IFN-&#x003b3; was relatively unaffected and in some cases increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. It was surmised that ICOS costimulated for the differentiation of Th2 cells. Subsequently, the Th2 bias has come into question, with clear evidence that ICOS costimulation is required for both Th1 and Th2 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. The association with the IL-10 response still holds and has strengthened, with the development of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> being found to be ICOS dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>].</p><p>The confusing picture with respect to the role of ICOS in cytokine responses may be related to the assays used; however, a recent paper by L&#x000f6;hning <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] offers an attractive explanation. First, these authors showed clearly that ICOS is expressed by effector T cells of all types, irrespective of the cytokine they secrete. However, importantly, they also show that the level of ICOS expression is correlated with the cytokines produced; thus, T cells expressing high levels of ICOS made IL-10, intermediate ICOS expressors made Th2 cytokines, while those expressing only low amounts made cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3; or GM-CSF.</p><p>Other contradictions also exist, for instance, some authors have found that the migration of T cells into B cell follicles is independent of ICOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>], while others find that the development of the follicular helper T<sub>FH</sub> population requires ICOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. More fundamentally, the role of ICOS in primary clonal expansion of CD4 T cells is still contentious. Most initial studies, using <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation, showed little effect of ICOS blockade or absence. However, more recently, Smith <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] have shown that primary antigen-driven clonal expansion of adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic T cells is susceptible to ICOS blockade. In contrast to the primary response, the role of ICOS in the restimulation and clonal expansion of memory B and T cells during secondary responses has received relatively little attention. To address this, we tracked the antigen-specific B and T cell responses in ICOS-deficient mice using fluorescent antigen, phycoerythrin (PE; B cells) or MHC class II tetramers (T cells). We show that while primary expansions are relatively independent of ICOS, the secondary expansion is dependent on ICOS. We also found that although primary expansion of endogenous (polyclonal) CD4 T cells did not require ICOS, the expansion of naive TCR-transgenic T cells after adoptive transfer and immunization was ICOS dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>T-dependent antibody responses are impaired in these ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice</title><p>The ICOS locus was targeted with the dual aim of inserting a reporter (&#x003b2;-gal) and also to knockout the gene in mice homozygous for the deletion.

Our data suggest that it is not required for the proliferative response, but that it is necessary for the development of the capacity to help B cells make antibody. We have also addressed the role of ICOS costimulation in B and T cell memory responses: The generation of memory B cells and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the secondary response is much more affected than the primary response, which is relatively normal. Tracking of the CD4 T cell memory response with MHC class II tetramers shows no impairment of the primary clonal expansion, or long-term survival, but does show impaired secondary expansion. Our data also highlight critical differences in the response requirements of endogenous, polyclonal T cells and adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic T cells.</p><p>At first glance, it is tempting to associate the lack of helper function development in ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> T cells with the defect in cytokine production (especially Th2). However, we are not convinced that differences in cytokine secretion by ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> T cells underlie this helper defect, for two reasons: First, in the helper assay used here, we are not testing whether the T cells support antibody isotype switching, as this will already have occurred <italic>in vivo</italic> during priming of the B cells in their ICOS-sufficient donor mice. Second, there is a profound lack of both IgG1 and IgG2c (IgG2a equivalent in C57BL/6 mice), the latter being associated with Th1 (IFN-&#x003b3;) responses, which are quite normal in these mice. What is missing in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay seems to be the ability to support reactivation and differentiation of the antigen-specific memory B cells to become antibody secretors. This conclusion is supported by the phenotype of the SAP<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>], which have no particular defect in T cell cytokine production but exhibit reduced IgG1 and IgG2a humoral responses and, interestingly, display impaired expression of ICOS.</p><p>What do ICOS-deficient T cells lack as helpers? It could be that they fail to make a particular cytokine (<italic>e.g.</italic> IL-10, IL-6 or, possibly, IL-21) or, possibly, they fail to express surface molecules that provide help/survival signals for B cells. However, ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> T cells might themselves fail to survive as effector T cells. For instance, the failure of ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> T cells to populate B cell follicles may not be due simply to a defect in migration of the cells to the follicle, but rather a failure to survive there as a stable population of T<sub>FH</sub> cells. It will be interesting to see if the helper defect (and follicular colonization) can be rescued by constitutive expression (after retroviral transfection) of survival genes such as bcl-2 or bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. It is worth noting that our current understanding of the sequence of events that lead to follicular localization of T cells does not require ICOS: CD40/CD154 interactions up-regulate OX40L on DC leading to up-regulation of CXCR5 (and down-regulation of CCR7) and hence migration to follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>]. A role in survival of activated or effector T cells is consistent with the utilization by ICOS of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway <italic>via</italic> serine/threonine kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB) to regulate apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>]. In this regard, there may be convergences in both function and signaling between ICOS and OX40, which mediates survival of effector T cells <italic>via</italic> the PI3K-PKB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. This scenario is supported by observations that ICOS blockade <italic>in vivo</italic> is particularly effective when given during the late (effector) phase of Th1/Th17-mediated EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] or Th2-mediated airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. It has also been observed in less complex <italic>in vivo</italic> models using immunization with nominal antigen that the expansion of already differentiated Th1 or Th2 cells is considerably affected by blocking ICOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. Further evidence comes from studies of Th2 responses in worm infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>] or in lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>], in which ICOS costimulation is needed for the inflammatory response but not for the development of the responding Th2 cells.</p><p>The blockade of ICOS in the models of inflammatory disease discussed above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] was not effective when given during the early priming phase, and there is general agreement that ICOS signaling does not significantly contribute to clonal expansion of naive T cells. However, some experiments have indicated an effect of early ICOS blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. These studies analyzed the response of adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic cells. Our own analysis of the clonal expansion of small numbers of ICOS-deficient OT-II TCR-transgenic cells transferred into C57BL/6 mice and then immunized with OVA peptide in alum (or CFA) also showed impaired proliferation. In contrast, our analysis using MHC class II tetramers of the primary expansion of endogenous, polyclonal CD4 T cells revealed no defect in ICOS knockout mice. We are left with the conclusion that the requirements for optimal expansion of the transferred population of TCR-transgenic cells are different from those of the endogenous naive T cells. The most likely explanation for this is the difference in initial clone size. Despite transferring only a small number (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) of transgenic cells, the frequency of antigen-specific naive cells (all with the same TCR idiotope) is at least 100-fold higher than in the endogenous T cell population. It seems likely that stimulatory and/or survival signals (antigen + costimulation) at response initiation are normally limiting and that to support an abnormally large initiating T cell population requires excessive costimulation. We, and many others, have found this TCR-transgenic transfer system problematic with respect to studying memory: The cells do not survive well and cannot be reactivated. Jenkins and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>] recently showed that the reason for this is the abnormally large clone size of transferred cells and that, when physiologically appropriate numbers of TCR-transgenic CD4 T cells were transferred, the memory clones became stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>]. The behavior of CD8 memory T cells also seems to be influenced by the original clone size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. The results we present here suggest caution in interpreting the data from the TCR-transgenic adoptive transfer models even in the primary response.</p><p>To analyze the T cell memory response in ICOS-deficient mice, we utilized MHC class II tetramers and followed the frequency of antigen-specific CD4 T cells over time since primary immunization and then after boosting. There was no difference in the ability of CD4 memory T cells to survive over a 10-wk period in ICOS-deficient or-sufficient mice. However, secondary expansion in ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice was impaired. Likewise, the secondary expansion of memory B cells and secondary ASC in T-dependent responses is much more ICOS dependent than in the primary response. As discussed above, the importance of ICOS in memory responses may simply reflect the increased need for costimulation when antigen-specific precursor frequency is high. However, this interpretation does not fit with the general idea that memory cell restimulation requires less costimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>]. Indeed, we recently showed that the proliferation of memory CD4 T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> did not require CD40-CD154 interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>]. Thus, ICOS may well be a costimulus that is used preferentially in memory T cell responses. Taken as a whole, our data strongly point to roles for ICOS in supporting effector and memory T cell responses. It will be of future interest to see if these roles utilize a similar mechanism or if they are mechanistically separate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>, C57BL/6, OT-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>] and OT-II ICOS<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK).

The medium containing the antigen was removed 2 days later and replaced with fresh medium. The culture supernatant was harvested after 5 days and DNP-specific immunoglobulin isotypes were measured by ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of antigen-specific immunoglobulins by ELISA</title><p>Anti-DNP antibodies in the serum of immunized mice or in the culture supernatants of help assays were measured by ELISA. ELISA plates (Dynex Technologies Inc.) were coated with 50 &#x000b5;g/mL DNP-BSA. Doubling dilutions of serum or supernatant were made and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following washing in PBS/0.05% Tween-20, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3 (all from Southern Biotechnology Associates). Antibody binding was detected by addition of PNPP substrate (SouthernBiotech) to the washed plates and the OD at 405 nm was measured using an ELISA reader (Labsystems). Titers were calculated by plotting serum/supernatant dilution against OD, and taking the half-maximal OD, compared to standard positive serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cytokine by ELISA</title><p>Maxisorb plates (96-well; NUNC) were coated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with antibodies against IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-&#x003b3; (Sigma-Aldrich). After blocking for 2 h with 10% FCS-PBS, culture supernatant and recombinant cytokine standards (Peprotech or Pharmingen) were added and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. After washing, cytokine-specific biotin-conjugated antibodies were added (BD Pharmingen) for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was then added followed by the substrate TMB. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and the amount of cytokine was measured by interpolation from a standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Enumeration of antigen-specific ASC by ELISPOT</title><p>Nitrocellulose plates (96-well; Millipore) were coated with DNP-BSA and blocked with 10% FCS-PBS. After washing, spleen and bone marrow cell suspensions were added in triplicate, over the range of 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> total cells per well. Following overnight incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, plates were washed thoroughly: three times with PBS, three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, then three times again with PBS. The secondary antibody, AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, IgG, or IgG1 was added in PBS-5% BSA, 4 h at room temperature, then washed. Spots were developed using 5-bromo 4-chlorophosphate (BCIP; Sigma-Aldrich). Spots were scored by eye using a dissection microscope, and the average number of spots per well was used to calculate the frequency of DNP-specific ASC. Spleen and bone marrow from non-immunized control mice consistently gave no spots for IgG, although in one experiment IgM spots were noticed in control mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA).
