It is well-established that chronic inflammation that is driven by extrinsic factors promotes several types of cancer, including gastric, hepatic and gastrointestinal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, inflammation has also been correlated with the development of cancers that are not typically associated with chronic inflammatory states, such as breast cancer. There has been ongoing interest in the concept that intrinsic factors, such as activation of an oncogene within epithelial cells, induce a state of localised inflammation that subsequently promotes tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recent epidemiological studies support a role for anti-inflammatory drugs in the reduction of breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, and other mediators of inflammation have been linked to breast cancer formation and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 is a primary downstream target of inflammatory cytokines and has been linked to proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, induction of genomic instability, resistance to treatment and angiogenesis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although Cox-2 is commonly associated with inflammatory cells, studies have also demonstrated that Cox-2 is induced by activation of oncogenes within breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, Cox-2 is likely to represent an important component of intrinsically induced inflammation in breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms by which intrinsic factors, such as oncogenes, induce inflammation is critical for successfully developing and using anti-inflammatory strategies to target breast cancer formation and recurrence.</p><p>Using an inducible mouse model of mammary tumourigenesis, we previously demonstrated that activation of an inducible fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (iFGFR1) transgene within epithelial cells resulted in the formation of hyperplastic budding structures within 48 hours of iFGFR1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These early structures were characterised by increased proliferation and lack of formation of a proper lumen surrounded by the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Longer-term activation demonstrated that iFGFR1 activation promoted a loss of myoepithelial cells, and increased angiogenesis, formation of locally invasive lesions and, ultimately, mammary tumour formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Further studies of this model demonstrated that iFGFR1 activation in the mammary gland induced a rapid, localised inflammatory response, characterised by recruitment of macrophages to the epithelial structures and induction of inflammatory genes by microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Activation of iFGFR1 has been shown to promote proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, FGFR1 is amplified in 10% of human breast tumours and has been linked to a poor response to treatment in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which FGFR1 activation in epithelial cells induces pro-tumourigenic effects in the microenvironment are only beginning to be understood.</p><p>Our current studies focus on the ability of iFGFR1 activation to promote an intrinsic pathway of inflammation using a transgenic mouse model. We have found that activation of iFGFR1 within mammary epithelial cells results in the expression of proinflammatory genes, such as IL-1&#x003b2; and Cox-2, and that these mediators are important for iFGFR1-induced early-stage tumourigenesis. These studies demonstrate that activation of an oncogenic growth factor signalling pathway within mammary epithelial cells induces a localised inflammatory response that promotes the formation of early-stage mammary lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-iFGFR1 transgenic mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the mice were obtained from Dr Jeff Rosen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA). Animal care and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Minnesota and were in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of mice</title><p>For iFGFR1 activation, six-week-old female mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 mg/kg AP20187 (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) twice weekly. Mice were sacrificed at 48 hours and four weeks post-injection and mammary glands from at least three mice were analysed per time point. For the IL-1&#x003b2; neutralisation studies, the mice were treated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Briefly, mice were injected i.p. with 4 &#x003bc;g/g IL-1&#x003b2; antibody (AB-401-NA, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) 24 hours prior to AP20187 treatment and in conjunction with AP20187 for an additional 48 hours. Control mice were injected with isotype control total immunoglobulin (Ig) G (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for the same time frame. For inhibition of Cox-2 by celecoxib, four-week-old female MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermate control mice were fed standard mouse chow (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA) enriched with celecoxib (obtained as 200 mg capsules) at a concentration of 1000 mg/kg (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA). Celecoxib-treated mice and control mice, given standard mouse chow only, were fed for one week. All mice were then injected i.p. with 1 mg/kg AP20187. Mice were maintained on the celecoxib or control diets and were sacrificed 48 hours post-injection. Mammary glands from five mice per treatment group were removed for whole mount and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mammary gland whole mounts, histology and measurement of epithelial budding</title><p>Whole mounts were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For embedding, sectioning and immunohistochemistry, mammary glands were fixed for two hours in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. For histological analysis, the glands were sectioned and stained with H&#x00026;E using standard histological protocols. To quantify epithelial budding structures, six images were taken per mammary gland section at 10&#x000d7; magnification. Five sections were analysed per gland, each approximately 100 &#x003bc;m apart, to compensate for variability within the gland. In addition, only epithelial structures distal to the lymph node were included in the analyses due to the predominant localisation of the hyperplastic phenotype along ducts leading to terminal end buds. The total number of epithelial structures was counted and expressed as a percentage of structures that contain epithelial buds. At least three mice and 200 epithelial structures were analysed for each genotype and treatment. All statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired student's t-test to compare two means (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The following antibodies and dilutions were used for immunohistochemistry: rabbit polyclonal IL-1&#x003b2; (sc-7884), 1:100, goat polyclonal Cox-2 (sc-1747), 1:100, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse monoclonal phospho-histone H3 (pH3; 05-806, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Immunostaining was performed either with (IL-1&#x003b2;, pH3) or without (Cox-2) sodium citrate antigen retrieval, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. pH3 and Cox-2 positive cells were counted and calculated relative to the number of total epithelial cells. At least 2000 cells from a total of three mice per treatment group were counted for each dataset. All statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired student's t-test to compare two means.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Transgenic and non-transgenic six-week mice were treated for 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours with AP20187, IgG isotype control and/or IL-1&#x003b2; blocking antibody as indicated. Mammary glands were isolated, the lymph nodes were removed and the mammary glands were ground under liquid nitrogen and lysed in 2 mls of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was extracted from monolayer cells using Trizol as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA was generated using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). One-tenth of the final reaction volume was used in quantitative SYBR (Synergy Brands) green RT-PCR reactions as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] using the Bio-Rad iQ5 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Relative quantification of the expression of each gene was calculated and normalised to averaged cyclophilin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression levels as indicated using the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct </sup>method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The following primer sequences were used: IL-1&#x003b2; 5'-GCAACTGTTCCTGAACTCAAC-3' and 5'-ATCTTTTGGGGTCCGTCAACT-3', Cox-2 5' TGAGCAACTATTCCAAACCAG-3' and GCACGTAGTCTTCGATCACTATC, cyclophilin 5'-TGAGCACTGGGGAGAAAGG-3' and 5'TTGCCATCCAGCCACTCAG-3', GAPDH 5'-TGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC-3' and 5'-GACGGACACATTGGGGGTAG-3'.

The cells were lysed in radio immuno precipitation assay buffer and protein-containing supernatants were generated by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein were analyaed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis was performed with the following antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000: phospho-p65 (3033), p65 (4764), Cox-2 (4842) and &#x003b2;-tubulin (2146) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).

The cells were incubated overnight in serum-free RPMI media and treated with either 30 nM AP20187 or an equal amount of ethanol as a solvent control. Following eight hours of treatment, the cells were harvested in Trizol and IL-1&#x003b2; expression levels were analysed as described above. Following 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested and was analysed using an ELISA to quantify the amount of IL-1&#x003b2; in the media following the manufacturer's protocols (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired students t-test to compare two means.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration assays</title><p>Migration assays were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, HC-11/R1 cells were grown to confluence and incubated overnight in serum-free medium. A p20 pipet tip was used to make a scratch down the centre of the well and pictures were taken of the scratch prior to treatment of cells with 30 nM AP20187 and/or 5 ng/ml recombinant IL-1&#x003b2;. After 18 hours, pictures were taken again and the area of the gap closure was quantified using Leica LAS software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). All statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired student's t-test to compare two means.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activation of iFGFR1 in mammary epithelial cells induces expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; in the mammary gland</title><p>FGFR1 is amplified in approximately 8 to 10% of human breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, due to lack of a ligand that specifically activates FGFR1 without activating the other FGFRs, a model was developed to study the effects of FGFR1 activation specifically in mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this model, a modified, membrane-targeted FGFR1 (iFGFR1) that lacks an extracellular domain is activated by treatment of cells with a lipid-soluble dimeriser, AP20187. Upon binding, AP20187 induces homodimerisation and activation of the receptor. The effects of activating this FGFR1 construct in mammary epithelial cells in cell culture and <italic>in vivo </italic>using the MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mouse model have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Specifically, iFGFR1 activation in the mammary gland results in the rapid formation of hyperplastic epithelial structures within 48 hours accompanied by an inflammatory response, characterised by rapid macrophage recruitment and increased expression of several inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>To identify inflammatory genes that contribute to the iFGFR1-induced inflammatory response, we used quantitative RT-PCR analysis to examine the expression of several candidate genes in the mammary gland following treatment of mice with AP20187, which activates iFGFR1. Interestingly, we found a significant induction of IL-1&#x003b2;, which is a critical cytokine in the inflammatory response that has also been linked to breast cancer invasiveness and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, expression of IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA increased significantly in the mammary gland within eight hours and remained elevated following 24 hours of iFGFR1 activation. Treatment of non-transgenic littermates with AP20187 did not induce a similar increase in IL-1&#x003b2; expression, demonstrating that this response was not a general inflammatory reaction to either the AP20187 dimeriser or the solvent used for the injections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). In addition to gene expression levels, immunohistochemical analysis of mammary gland sections demonstrated an increase in IL-1&#x003b2; protein expression following 48 hours of iFGFR1 activation in comparison to non-transgenic littermates treated with AP20187 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b,c</xref>). Analysis of a four-week time-point revealed sustained expression of IL-1&#x003b2; associated with iFGFR1-induced hyperplastic lesions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d,e</xref>). These results demonstrate that activation of iFGFR1 in mammary epithelial cells results in expression of the key inflammatory mediator, IL-1&#x003b2;, in the mammary gland.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>iFGFR1 activation induces IL-1&#x003b2; expression in the mammary gland. <bold>(a) </bold>Mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) inducible fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (iFGFR1) transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermate controls were treated with AP20187 for 8 and/or 24 hours.

Therefore, we utilised <italic>in vitro </italic>assays to determine whether iFGFR1 directly induces expression of IL-1&#x003b2; in mammary epithelial cells. For these studies, we used a derivative of the HC-11 cell line, which is a mouse mammary epithelial cell line derived from a mid-pregnant Balb/c mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To study the consequences of iFGFR1 activation in these cells, clones of HC-11 cells were previously generated that stably express iFGFR1 (HC-11/R1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Published studies have demonstrated that activation of iFGFR1 in these cells promotes proliferation, survival, migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, these cells represent a relevant <italic>in vitro </italic>model with which to examine iFGFR1-mediated mechanisms of mammary tumourigenesis.</p><p>To determine the effects of iFGFR1 activation on IL-1&#x003b2; expression, the cells were treated with 30 nM AP20187 and IL-1&#x003b2; expression was analysed using both quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Although we detected a small increase in IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>), this induction was not statistically significant. Furthermore, no IL-1&#x003b2; protein was detected in conditioned media using an ELISA assay (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesised that activation of iFGFR1-induced expression of IL-1&#x003b2; requires the presence of other cell types. We had previously observed a rapid accumulation of macrophages around the hyperplastic epithelial structures following iFGFR1 activation in the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, macrophages are known to secrete high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; in response to inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we analysed IL-1&#x003b2; expression levels following activation of iFGFR1 in epithelial cell/macrophage co-cultures. Interestingly, significant increases in both IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA and protein were detected in the co-cultures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f,g</xref>). Similar results were found when the HC-11/R1 cells were co-cultured with mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (data not shown). These results suggest that interactions between epithelial cells and macrophages may be required to induce IL-1&#x003b2; following iFGFR1 activation in the mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>IL-1&#x003b2; promotes the formation of iFGFR1-induced hyperplasias <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Based on the increased expression of IL-1&#x003b2; following FGFR1 activation and the link between IL-1&#x003b2; and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we hypothesised that IL-1&#x003b2; may be an important factor in the formation of iFGFR1-induced proliferative lesions. To examine this hypothesis, we used a systemic IL-1&#x003b2; neutralisation strategy similar to that described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For these experiments, either an IL-1&#x003b2; neutralising antibody or an equivalent amount of an isotype control goat IgG antibody was administered i.p. to six-week-old female transgenic mice 24 hours prior to iFGFR1 activation. The mice were then treated with AP20187 to activate iFGFR1 in conjunction with daily treatments of either IL-1&#x003b2; blocking antibody or an isotype control goat IgG for 48 hours. Following the treatments, the mammary glands were analysed by whole mount analysis and sections were analysed for the percentage of budding epithelial structures, proliferation and macrophage recruitment. Analysis of whole mounts revealed that IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition led to an overall decrease in hyperplastic budding, particularly associated with the terminal-end buds and the subtending ducts (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Further studies were performed to validate these alterations in histological sections. We found that although inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; did not completely abolish hyperplastic budding of the epithelium, there was a significant decrease in the total number of budding structures present within mammary glands from mice that had been treated with the IL-1&#x003b2; blocking antibody (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Furthermore, there was a corresponding decrease in the percentage of proliferating epithelial cells as measured by quantification of pH3 immunofluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of macrophage recruitment revealed that inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; activity did not affect iFGFR1-induced recruitment of macrophages to the epithelium (data not shown). Together, these studies suggest that although IL-1&#x003b2; may not be critical for the recruitment of macrophages observed in this model, IL-1&#x003b2; activity contributes to epithelial proliferation during the formation of the iFGFR1-induced lateral budding phenotype.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of mammary glands from iFGFR1 transgenic mice following activation of iFGFR1 and treatment with an IL-1&#x003b2; neutralising antibody.

Therefore, initial studies were performed to ascertain the ability of mammary epithelial cells to respond to IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation by examining activation of downstream signalling pathways using the HC-11/R1 cell line described previously. Initial studies using both quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the HC-11/R1 cells express the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) (data not shown). Further studies were performed using both dose-response and time-course analyses to examine the activation of nuclear factor (NF) &#x003ba;B, which is a key downstream target of IL-1&#x003b2; in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Therefore, we examined the ability of IL-1&#x003b2; to promote these properties in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and scratch wounding assays, respectively. In contrast to studies of breast cancer cells, treatment of HC-11/R1 cells with rmIL-1&#x003b2; alone did not promote either proliferation (data not shown) or migration (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c,d</xref>). Because IL-1&#x003b2; can promote these properties in breast cancer cells, we hypothesised that IL-1&#x003b2; may act cooperatively with another oncogenic stimulus to promote tumourigenic changes. Therefore, we stimulated HC-11/R1 cells with AP20187, which activates iFGFR1, and rmIL-1&#x003b2; either alone or in combination. Addition of IL-1&#x003b2; to the media did not significantly affect iFGFR1-induced proliferation of the HC-11/R1 cells (data not shown).

These studies suggest that although treatment of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells with IL-1&#x003b2; alone does not promote the acquisition of tumourigenic properties, IL-1&#x003b2; may act cooperatively with other oncogenic stimuli to promote these properties during tumour formation.</p></sec><sec><title>IL-1&#x003b2; and iFGFR1 induce expression of Cox-2, which promotes migration of HC-11/R1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To identify downstream targets of IL-1&#x003b2; in mammary epithelial cells, we asked whether IL-1&#x003b2; could induce expression of Cox-2, a known IL-1&#x003b2; target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], in the HC-11/R1 cells. For these studies, HC-11/R1 cells were treated with rmIL-1&#x003b2; and Cox-2 expression was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a modest induction of both Cox-2 mRNA and protein following four and six hours of IL-1&#x003b2; treatment, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,c</xref>). Because Cox-2 is a known downstream target of growth factor signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we explored the possibility that activation of iFGFR1 also induces Cox-2 expression. HC-11/R1 cells were treated with AP20187 to activate iFGFR1 and Cox-2 expression was analysed by both quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, Cox-2 mRNA and protein expression were rapidly induced in the HC-11/R1 cells following iFGFR activation. Because Cox-2 is induced by both iFGFR1 and IL-1&#x003b2; in the HC-11/R1 mammary epithelial cells, we predicted that activation of both growth factor and cytokine-induced signalling pathways would result in a cooperative induction of Cox-2 expression. In agreement with this prediction, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed an additive increase in Cox-2 expression following activation of both iFGFR1 and IL-1&#x003b2; signalling pathways in comparison with either stimulation alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). These results suggest that signalling pathways induced by growth factors and cytokines cooperate to promote increased levels of expression of inflammatory mediators. To determine whether iFGFR1-induced expression of Cox-2 is dependent on IL-1&#x003b2;, an IL-1&#x003b2; blocking antibody was added to the media at the time of AP20187 stimulation and Cox-2 expression was analysed by immunoblot analysis.

Analysis of mammary glands following four weeks of treatment demonstrated sustained increased levels of Cox-2 associated with hyperplastic lesions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, c</xref>). To correlate the expression of Cox-2 with IL-1&#x003b2; activity, we examined Cox-2 expression in mammary gland sections from the mice treated with the IL-1&#x003b2; neutralising antibody. In comparison with mammary glands from mice treated with the IgG isotype control antibody, inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; activity resulted in decreased Cox-2 expression in epithelial structures following 48 hours of treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b, c</xref>).

Therefore, to examine the role of Cox-2 in this model, mice were provided with standard mouse chow supplemented with celecoxib for one-week prior to treatment with AP20187 to activate iFGFR1. Mice were then injected i.p. with AP20187 for 48 hours before mammary glands were removed for further analysis. Tissue samples were then stained with H&#x00026;E for quantification of budding epithelial structures. As expected, mammary glands from mice treated with AP20187 in the absence of celecoxib exhibited increased extensive budding epithelial structures in comparison to mammary glands from non-transgenic mice treated with AP20187 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).

Epidemiological studies have suggested that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can decrease the relative risk of developing breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

However, the origins of inflammation in breast cancer are still not well understood. Unlike other cancers in which chronic inflammation is associated with extrinsic factors such as bacterial or viral infection, breast cancer has not been linked to extrinsically induced inflammatory stimuli. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which inflammation might be induced in the breast will lead to important insights into developing anti-inflammatory strategies that may prevent the development and recurrence of invasive breast cancer.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that activation of iFGFR1 in mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vivo </italic>induced a rapid inflammatory response characterised by induction of inflammatory genes and recruitment of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have further used this model to explore the role of inflammation in promoting the formation of iFGFR1-induced hyperplastic lesions. For the current studies, we have focused on IL-1&#x003b2;, which is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that has been linked to breast cancer invasiveness and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Studies of IL-1&#x003b2; in breast cancer have demonstrated that IL-1&#x003b2; expression is increased in 90% of oestrogen receptor-negative invasive breast carcinomas, and that it is localised to both tumour cells and stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies of breast cancer cells have demonstrated the ability of IL-1&#x003b2; to promote proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which IL-1&#x003b2; acts on tumour cells and/or cells within the stroma to promote breast cancer <italic>in vivo </italic>are not well understood.</p><p>Because our results clearly demonstrate increased IL-1&#x003b2; expression in the mammary gland following iFGFR1 activation, we were interested in identifying the cell types responsible for IL-1&#x003b2; production following iFGFR1 activation. Although activation of oncogenes has been shown to induce expression of IL-1&#x003b2; in tumour cells, we were unable to detect secreted IL-1&#x003b2; in the media of HC-11/R1 cells following iFGFR1 activation (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of HC-11/R1 cells with an IL-1&#x003b2; blocking antibody at the time of AP20187 stimulation did not affect expression of Cox-2, suggesting that iFGFR1-induced expression of Cox-2 through an IL-1&#x003b2; independent pathway. However, co-culture of HC-11/R1 cells with either RAW 264.7 cells or bone marrow derived macrophages with HC-11/R1 cells resulted in a significant increase in IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA and protein secretion. Based on these studies, we propose that the majority of the IL-1&#x003b2; being produced <italic>in vivo </italic>is coming primarily from the macrophages, which are known to express high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; during inflammatory reactions. However, it is possible that IL-1&#x003b2; is also secreted by other cell types in the mammary gland, such as fibroblasts. Further studies are required to delineate the mechanisms by which IL-1&#x003b2; expression is induced in this model.</p><p>It is clear that iFGFR1 activation promotes an increase in IL-1&#x003b2; within the microenvironment, which can then act on the epithelial cells to promote tumourigenesis. Therefore, further studies were performed to examine the specific effects of exogenous IL-1&#x003b2; on epithelial cells to mimic the increased levels of IL-1&#x003b2; within the microenvironment. Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines have profound effects on mammary epithelial cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. For example, treatment of breast cancer cells with IL-1&#x003b2; has been reported to activate the NF&#x003ba;B pathway and induce both cell migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; on normal mammary epithelial cells have not been described. Therefore, we initially evaluated the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; on NF&#x003ba;B activation, proliferation and migration. IL-1&#x003b2; alone activated NF&#x003ba;B, suggesting that the IL-1R signalling pathway is intact in mammary epithelial cells. However, treatment of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; did not promote either migration or proliferation of the HC-11/R1 cells. Interestingly, we found that activation of iFGFR1 in the presence of exogenous IL-1&#x003b2; resulted in increased migration compared with iFGFR1 activation alone. In contrast to the lack of effect of IL-1&#x003b2; on iFGFR1-induced proliferation of the HC-11/R1 cells, the IL-1&#x003b2; neutralising studies suggested that IL-1&#x003b2; promotes mammary epithelial cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, it is important to consider that inflammatory mediators may have different effects on epithelial cells depending on the context of the microenvironment. In addition, it is possible that IL-1&#x003b2; affects mammary epithelial cell proliferation indirectly by acting on other cell types in the mammary gland. Further studies in which IL-1&#x003b2; signalling is impaired in specific cell types in the mammary gland would be required to elucidate these interactions.</p><p>Because Cox-2 is a downstream target of IL-1&#x003b2;, further studies focused on the ability of IL-1&#x003b2; to promote expression of Cox-2 in mammary epithelial cells. Cox-2 is expressed in human breast tumours and has been found in both early-stage atypical hyperplasias and invasive cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, recent studies have suggested that in contrast to previous studies, Cox-2 expression is decreased in invasive breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, although the use of Cox-2 inhibitors in late-stage breast cancer may be limited, epidemiological studies suggest that Cox-2 inhibition may be relevant for breast cancer prevention. Interestingly, our results suggest that induction of Cox-2 expression alone is insufficient to drive tumourigenic alterations of normal epithelial cells such as migration and proliferation, because treatment of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; alone resulted in increased Cox-2 but did not promote these phenotypes. However, in combination with a single oncogenic stimulus, iFGFR1 activation, Cox-2 was able to participate in the acquisition of cell motility. These data suggest that the functions of Cox-2 in breast cancer are likely to be dependent on the stage of cancer and the context of the microenvironment rather than the levels of protein expression.</p><p>Cox-2-selective inhibitors have previously been shown to inhibit mammary tumour formation in mouse mammary tumour models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, due to the stochastic nature of these tumour models, it is difficult to determine the effects of Cox-2 inhibition during the initiating events in tumourigenesis. Because there is substantial interest in the ability of anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer, inducible models of mammary tumourigenesis provide a unique opportunity to study the contributions of inflammation to breast tumourigenesis. Our results from the Cox-2 inhibition <italic>in vivo </italic>studies demonstrate that inhibition of Cox-2 prior to activating the initial oncogenic stimulus may be sufficient to delay the formation of early-stage lesions in the breast. Interestingly, gross comparison of the mammary glands using whole mounts suggested that Cox-2 inhibition did not appear to be as effective as IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition. Therefore, comparisons between different methods of inhibiting IL-1&#x003b2; and Cox-2 in this model may provide insights into which of these inflammatory mediators might represent a more effective anti-inflammatory target. Finally, further studies of this model will provide important insights into the role of inflammation in promoting breast tumour formation, which may be particularly relevant to subsets of patients that have high levels of inflammatory mediators associated with pre-invasive lesions in the breast.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Studies of growth factor signalling pathways in breast cancer have produced a wealth of information regarding the effects of these pathways on tumour formation and progression. However, it is becoming more apparent that tumours are the result of a complex interplay bet ween intracellular signalling pathways and extracellular stimuli. Although several growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2 and FGFR1, have been studied and implicated in breast cancer, we are only beginning to understand how these growth factor pathways interact with other autocrine or paracrine factors to promote tumourigenesis. Although inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in breast cancer, it is clear that these cytokines alone are not sufficient to cause tumour formation. In fact, it is well accepted that cancer does not develop due to a single genetic alteration, but instead requires the contribution of multiple factors, both within the cell and in the microenvironment. Understanding how these various factors cooperate within epithelial and tumour cells to promote breast cancer initiation and formation will lead to the development of more effective combinatorial therapies designed to target multiple pathways within both the tumour cells and the supporting stromal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Cox-2: cyclooxygenase 2; ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; FGFR1: fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; H&#x00026;E: haematoxylin and eosin; iFGFR1: inducible fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Ig: immunoglobulin; IL: interleukin; IL-1R: interleukin-1 receptor; i.p.: intraperitoneally; MMTV: mouse mammary tumour virus; NF: nuclear factor; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; pH3: phospho-histone H3; rm: recombinant murine; RT-PCR: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JRR performed cell culture studies and the <italic>in vivo </italic>celecoxib studies, analysed the data and prepared results and contributed to drafting of the manuscript.
