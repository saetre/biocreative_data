It is typical of microorganisms living at high temperature and might play a role in maintenance of genome stability and repair. We have identified the translesion DNA polymerase SsoPolY/Dpo4 as one partner of reverse gyrase in the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>. We show here that in cell extracts, PolY and reverse gyrase co-immunoprecipitate with each other and with the single strand binding protein, SSB. The interaction is confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> by far-western and Surface Plasmon Resonance. In functional assays, reverse gyrase inhibits PolY, but not the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> B-family DNA polymerase PolB1. Mutational analysis shows that inhibition of PolY activity depends on both ATPase and topoisomerase activities of reverse gyrase, suggesting that the intact positive supercoiling activity is required for PolY inhibition. <italic>In vivo</italic>, reverse gyrase and PolY are degraded after induction of DNA damage. Inhibition by reverse gyrase and degradation might act as a double mechanism to control PolY and prevent its potentially mutagenic activity when undesired. Inhibition of a translesion polymerase by topoisomerase-induced modification of DNA structure may represent a previously unconsidered mechanism of regulation of these two-faced enzymes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reverse gyrase is a very unusual DNA topoisomerase, specific of thermophilic microorganisms, which catalyzes positive supercoiling of DNA molecules [for reviews, see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)]. It contains a C-terminal topoisomerase IA domain fused to a N-terminal helicase-like domain, endowed with ATPase activity. The gene for reverse gyrase is present in all hyperthermophiles, either archaea or bacteria, and in some moderately thermophilic bacteria, but has never been found in mesophiles, suggesting a strong link between this enzyme and life at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A role for reverse gyrase in adaptation to high temperature was confirmed by the thermosensitive phenotype of a reverse gyrase knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Very recently, a reverse gyrase gene found in the genome of <italic>Nautilia profundicola</italic>, a moderately thermophilic bacterium living close to hydrothermal vents, was shown to be transcriptionally induced by 100-fold when the temperature was increased from 45&#x000b0;C to 65&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), thus suggesting that reverse gyrase confers a selective advantage to these bacteria facing rapid temperature fluctuations.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of reverse gyrase belongs to the universal type IA topoisomerase family, shared by <italic>Bacteria, Eucarya</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic>. The N-terminal domain contains conserved sequence motifs typical of SF2 helicases, including the ATP binding site but, unlike other members of this family, does not show strand separation activity or the ability to move along DNA. The two isolated domains of reverse gyrase behave as independent DNA binding and enzyme modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Whereas the C-terminal domain is clearly responsible for strand passage, the function of the N-terminal domain is poorly understood. The enzyme carries out DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, which is essential for positive supercoiling.</p><p>Results obtained in our laboratory suggest that reverse gyrase might participate in the cell response to DNA damage. In the crenarchaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, this protein is recruited to DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), interacts with the single strand binding protein SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and is specifically degraded after treatment with the alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>We report here the identification of the translesion (TLS) DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) as one partner of reverse gyrase in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>. TLS polymerases belong to the recently categorized Y-family that has been identified in <italic>Bacteria, Eucarya</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Y family DNA polymerases are characterized by low fidelity, lack of a proofreading exonuclease activity and ability to bypass normally replication-blocking lesions. They play essential role in response to DNA damage, but also hold high mutagenic potential. The DinB-like polymerases are taxonomically the most widespread of the Y-family polymerase subgroups. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DinB is induced as part of the SOS stress-response system, but might also play some additional physiological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> Dpo4/SsoPolY (hereafter called PolY), the only Y-family DNA polymerase of this organism, is a direct orthologue of <italic>E. coli</italic> DinB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). It is able to bypass a number of different DNA lesions, such as oxidized and deaminated bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>), N(2)-alkylguanine adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and others. It interacts with the sliding clamp PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and is stimulated by PCNA and the replication factor RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>We show here that <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> reverse gyrase specifically interacts with PolY <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell extracts. In primer extension assays, reverse gyrase inhibits the DNA polymerization activity of PolY, and mutational analysis shows that this inhibition is strictly dependent on integrity of reverse gyrase ATPase and topoisomerase activities. <italic>In vivo</italic>, PolY and reverse gyrase are both degraded after treatment of cells with lethal doses of the alkylating agent MMS. The biological meaning of our data and the possible mechanism of the functional interaction are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Recombinant His-tagged TopR1 and mutants were expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-AI strain (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant TopR1 recognized both recombinant proteins and a single band in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts (data not shown).</p><p>In order to identify proteins interacting with reverse gyrase, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> soluble extracts using anti-TopR1 antibodies. Silver staining of gels showed a discrete number of protein bands in immunoprecipitations (data not shown). Western blots carried out with antibodies directed against PolY identified a protein band specifically co-immunoprecipitating with reverse gyrase, but not present in controls with pre-immune sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In a reciprocal experiment, an antibody directed against PolY co-immunoprecipitated reverse gyrase from cell extracts, but not controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). It has been previously shown that the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> single strand binding protein SSB interacts with reverse gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>); we thus tested whether it could also immunoprecipitate with PolY. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, this was the case, thus suggesting that, in cell extracts, reverse gyrase, PolY and SSB are present in binary and/or ternary complexes. As a specificity control, we used an antibody directed against the &#x003b2;-subunit of the chaperone prefoldin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), a protein not involved directly in DNA metabolism, which revealed no bands immunoprecipitating with PolY. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Physical interaction of reverse gyrase and PolY.

The interaction was further characterized by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis. TopR1 or its separate domains were immobilized onto a sensor chip and various concentrations of PolY or other analytes were passed over. PolY interacted with both TopR1 and Cter with a relative binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of about 0.01 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which was even higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value obtained for the interaction between the two domains of reverse gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

The TopR1 ATPase activity at 55&#x000b0;C was about 45% of that observed at the optimal temperature of 80&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), and the efficiency of positive supercoiling at 55&#x000b0;C, as calculated from the mean &#x003c3; values of the most abundant topoisomers produced (see Materials and Methods), was reduced with respect to that observed at 80&#x000b0;C, but still substantial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Addition of PolY did not have any effect on the TopR1 positive supercoiling activity (data not shown); in contrast, TopR1 inhibited the PolY elongation activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Reverse gyrase is able to hydrolyze dATP as efficiently as ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), raising the possibility that inhibition of PolY activity might be due to nucleotide depletion; however, the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C suggests that this is not the case. Indeed, inhibition was seen at similar extent regardless of whether 0.25 or 1 mM of each dNTP was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), and even if 1 mM ATP was added to reactions (data not shown). Under the conditions used, considering a specific activity of TopR1 ATPase activity of 0.35 U/mg at 55&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), the highest amount of TopR1 used (lanes 3 and 6) should hydrolyze about 0.23 nmol/min of dATP. Thus, the final dATP concentration at the end of reactions should be about 0.77 mM (with initial concentration of 1 mM) or 0.02 mM (with initial concentration of 0.25 mM). The dNTP concentration for correct PolY reaction can be as low as 0.01 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We thus conclude that inhibition was not due to nucleotide depletion. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Functional interaction of TopR1 with PolY.

Indeed, although a polymerase stop site 2 nucleotides after the start was seen in the presence of TopR1, most PolB molecules reached the full-length product. In contrast, under the same conditions, PolY was completely arrested, suggesting that the effect of reverse gyrase on PolY activity is specific and might be mediated by the physical interaction between the two proteins.</p><p>On substrates carrying UV- or MMS- induced lesions, PolY showed a reduced elongation activity as compared with untreated substrates, and it was further inhibited by TopR1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp386/DC1">Figure 1S-A</ext-link> and B). In addition, when dATP was omitted from reactions, PolY almost completely stopped at the position corresponding to the first A, with only one mismatched nucleotide incorporated with low efficiency; TopR1 completely inhibited this reaction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp386/DC1">Figure 1S-C</ext-link>).</p><p>Because of the interaction of both PolY and reverse gyrase with SSB seen in cell extracts, we wanted test the effect of SSB addition. SSB did not influence PolY alone, but further repressed its elongation activity when TopR1 was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The fact that SSB does not inhibit PolY <italic>per se</italic> suggests that its binding to ssDNA does not arrest PolY elongation. <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB was shown to stimulate the TLS polymerase UmuDC, belonging to the PolV family; the different effect of SSB may be due to the different basal activity of the polymerases: unlike PolY, PolV is inactive by itself and requires auxiliary factors for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of SSB and reverse gyrase on PolY activity.

Interestingly, neither Nter nor Cter had any effect on PolY activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C); however, repression was rescued in the presence of both domains, although with lower efficiency with respect to the full-length enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><p>We produced two site-directed mutants of TopR1: K116A, carrying a substitution at the putative ATP binding site in the N-terminal domain, and Y965F, carrying a substitution of the putative catalytic tyrosine in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The biochemical activities of the two mutants were characterized. The topoisomerase activity was tested by 2D agarose electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A); whereas the wild-type TopR1 showed ATP-dependent positive supercoiling, the K116A mutant was only able to relax DNA, but not to induce positive supercoiling; the Y965F mutant was completely inactive. As for the ATPase activity, the K116A mutant turned out to be inactive, whereas the Y965F mutant displayed kinetic parameters comparable to those of the wild type enzyme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). We thus conclude that the K116A and Y965F mutations specifically inactivated the ATPase and topoisomerase reactions, respectively; in both mutant enzymes the positive supercoiling activity was impaired. Neither mutant had any effect on the PolY elongation activity, thus suggesting that both ATPase and topoisomerase activities of reverse gyrase are essential for the inhibition to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Characterization of TopR1 inhibition activity of PolY.

We have shown that the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> reverse gyrase TopR1 interacts specifically with PolY <italic>in vitro</italic> and the interaction is mediated mainly by the C-terminal domain of TopR1. In cell extracts, PolY and reverse gyrase co-immunoprecipitate with each other and with SSB. In primer extension assays, TopR1 inhibits PolY, but not the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> DNA polymerase PolB1. Inhibition of PolY activity depends on the intact catalytic activity of TopR1, since deletion mutants containing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal domain, as well as inactive ATPase or topoisomerase point mutants, were unable to repress PolY activity. These data support the involvement of reverse gyrase in the DNA damage response.</p><p>Which activity of TopR1 mediates inhibition? Our data rule out a number of possibilities. First, inhibition is unlikely to depend on competition for DNA; indeed, both Nter and Cter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) as well as the K116A and Y965F mutants (data not shown) all show high DNA-binding ability. Second, repression does not depend on nucleotide depletion following the ATPase activity of TopR1, since the Y965F mutant shows ATPase activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme, yet has no inhibitory effect. In addition, the inhibition by TopR1 occurs when ATP was added to the reaction or when dNTP were used at concentration 10-fold higher than the Vmax of reverse gyrase ATPase activity. Third, inhibition does not depend on cleavage of the substrate by the TopR1 topoisomerase activity. This conclusion is supported by two observations: (i) the full-length (uncut) primer is seen in all reactions, even at high TopR1 concentrations, and (ii) both the Cter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and the K116A (this work) are competent for DNA relaxation, thus for cleavage/religation, yet neither inhibits PolY activity. Our mutational analysis showed that both ATPase and topoisomerase activities of reverse gyrase are essential for repression, suggesting the obvious deduction that it is the positive supercoiling activity that inhibits PolY activity. The observation that addition of SSB, which is known to stimulate reverse gyrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) further represses PolY when reverse gyrase is present, reinforces this conclusion. Addition of increasing TopR1 concentration results in progressive shortening of PolY elongation products. Thus, the effect of TopR1 is to halt the polymerase at certain sites, progressively reducing the elongation rate. Because PolY can be viewed as a machine moving along DNA, we could describe the action of TopR1 as a brake for the polymerase. The fact that SsPolB1 is only weakly affected by reverse gyrase suggests that either the inhibition is mediated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions, or that SsPolB1 is insensitive to repression because of its higher processivity.</p><p>How could reverse gyrase positive supercoiling activity interfere with PolY activity? PolY inhibition by reverse gyrase might be due, at least in part, by reverse gyrase-induced modification of the substrate. Reverse gyrase is able to bind and cleave the substrate used in these experiments with high efficiency (7 and data not shown); of course, the activity of a topoisomerase on a linear substrate cannot result in stable topological modifications. Nevertheless, reverse gyrase &#x02018;gyration&#x02019; activity could induce local variation of the helical twist, which might persist as long as the enzyme stays on DNA and might prevent PolY binding/activity. Through its interaction with reverse gyrase, PolY might be tethered to templates being modified by the enzyme in such a way to be unsuitable to elongation. Further investigation is required to address the role of template structure in the TopR1-PolY functional interaction.</p><p>We have observed that PolY, as previously shown for reverse gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) is actively degraded following treatment of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cells with MMS. Our previous and present experiments show co-regulation of the two proteins and evidence of the involvement of a metal-dependent protease; unfortunately, attempts to identify this activity have been unsuccessful. Interestingly, we observed a tight inverse correlation between the concentration of MMS used and PolY and reverse gyrase protein levels, which suggests direct correlation between the number of MMS-induced lesions and reverse gyrase-PolY degradation. However, at moment we cannot establish whether the proteins are degraded independently, together, or degradation of one protein destabilizes the other.</p><p>Which is the biological implication of our results? We find that PolY is subjected to dual control: inhibition by reverse gyrase and degradation. In principle, the activity of TLS polymerases, which are potentially highly mutagenic, should be tightly regulated. Regulation of TLS polymerases through modification of DNA structure has never been reported before, but might well be a general mechanism. Many proteins affect DNA structure, inducing either covalent (DNA topoisomerases, recombinases) or conformational modification (DNA binding proteins, helicases, translocases). Tethering TLS polymerases to inaccessible sites might be a strategy to control these &#x02018;two-faced Janus&#x02019; enzymes.</p><p>Although degradation of archaeal PolY is a novel finding, proteolysis of other TLS polymerases has been reported. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, DinB protein levels are elevated in the absence of the protease ClpXP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and UmuC/UmuD (PolV) is subjected to elaborate regulation by degradation involving both Lon and ClpXP proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos, the Pol&#x003b7; TLS polymerase POLH-1 is degraded by a specific protease after treatment with MMS, and indirect evidence suggest that POLH-1 is degraded after performing its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Together with our findings, these data suggest that controlled proteolysis might be a general mechanism of regulation of TLS polymerases. In the case of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, degradation of reverse gyrase might liberate PolY, which might in turn be degraded after performing its function. Alternatively, degradation of the complex is simultaneous and is an apoptotic-like process that occurs in the presence of irreparable lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp386/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp386_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp386_nar-00666-d-2009-File003.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="gkp386_nar-00666-d-2009-File004.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (Project MoMa n. 1/014/06/0).
