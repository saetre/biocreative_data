Technically, OCT uses a weakly coherent infrared laser to analyze the reflectance properties of a sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The spectral domain mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g001">Fig. 1 A</xref>) currently outmatches the time domain mode as it combines high resolution with high recording speed. Each resulting data set consists of a large number of topographically ordered depth profiles (A-Scans), which together represent a two-dimensional slice (similar to an ultrasound scan) across the sample. Several consecutive slices together may be used to generate a three-dimensional data set (&#x0201c;volume scan&#x0201d;).</p><fig id="pone-0007507-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007507.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Principle of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and its application in rodents.</title><p>A) Schematic diagram of spectral-domain (SD) OCT.

This has been a severe limitation in animal studies. The OCT, in contrast, provides a high-resolution depth profile based on reflectivity that correlates well with histomorphological sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, the resulting image is different as conventional imaging and histology are based on absorption (light shade - little absorption, dark shade - strong absorption), whereas OCT is based on reflectivity (light shade - weak reflectivity, dark shade - strong reflectivity). In particular, membranous surfaces are extremely well detected in OCT regardless of their physical extension. Consequently, membrane-rich but less optically dense layers like plexiform and nerve-fiber layers are represented in a darker shade of gray than optically more dense layers with less membrane content like the outer nuclear layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). It is thus that the OCT provides not only refined depth resolution but also entirely new information about the sample structure.</p><p>Recent studies with custom-made equipment support the applicability of OCT in rodents, the ability to detect retinal lesions, and the potential to follow disease processes over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Xu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Typically, the outer retina mainly formed by photoreceptor cell bodies and their inner and outer segments degenerates and subsequently vanishes without major alterations of the inner retinal layers. Whereas inherited diseases commonly affect the retina gradually, i.e. the course of a degeneration takes some time and its topographical distribution may not be uniform, focal light exposure (particularly high intensity blue light) produces strictly localized lesions adjacent to practically normal retina within a short period of time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Wenzel1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, allowing a direct comparison between damaged and non-damaged areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>). The huge amount of autofluorescent, lipid-rich debris from photoreceptor outer segments that cannot be processed by the retinal pigment epithelium and glial cells clearly demarcates the area of damage in SLO autofluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The selective loss of the outer retina in the exposed region (marked with an asterisk) is very prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Also, the transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Fig. 3 D,E</xref>) closely matches that in a respective histomorphological section, but preserves the capability to follow the development of such degenerative changes over time, an important added value of <italic>in vivo</italic> diagnostics. A novel finding in rodents was the discovery of a site of edema formation (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Fig. 3 E</xref>), a pathological alteration that does not endure the tissue processing required for <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, and is thus not visible in traditional histology. Edema was present in all (4/4) of the treated cases 3 days following the exposure, and was still present one week later (4/4). In all cases, it formed a ring around the light damage area.

As factors like Rb often have related functions in many different tissues, a complete loss of respective genes commonly leads to embryonic lethality, preventing the generation of knock-out models.

An important feature of OCT is the capability to capture multiple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g006">Fig. 6 C</xref>) sections directly linked to the surface image within a short period of time, allowing to follow topographical changes like the thickness gradient from center to periphery. A set of consecutive serial sections (&#x0201c;volume scan&#x0201d;) even allows this gradient to be mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g006">Fig. 6 D</xref>), which in this case correlates with the topography of <italic>&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> transgene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="pone-0007507-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007507.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Topographic analysis of retinal thickness in an organ-specific model of retinoblastoma protein (<italic>Rb</italic>) deficiency.</title><p>Thickness variations (center vs. periphery) were caused by imperfections of the Cre-lox system (see text), leading to differences in developmental apoptosis.

We found a close correlation of the site of autofluorescence in the 488 nm SLO images (attributed to the lipid-rich remnants of the photoreceptor outer segments) with the outer retinal damage in the OCT sections. For the first time, we were able to demonstrate edema formation in these rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g003">Fig. 3 E</xref>), which appears to be part of the dynamic processes associated with acute light exposure and, because of the tissue processing, is not detectable in conventional morphological analyses.</p><p>An example of perturbed retinal structure is the rosette formation in the <italic>Nrl</italic> knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Whereas the relatively even topographical distribution of the lesions became visible in SLO imaging (similar to a retinal whole-mount, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4 A,B</xref>), details of the structure were accessible <italic>in vivo</italic> with OCT sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4 E,F</xref>). The formation of rosettes in Nrl mutants is not yet fully understood, but it is known that cones are a major component of these dysmorphic structures, with their inner and outer segments pointing towards the center of each rosette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Wenzel2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The respective photoreceptor nuclei around the center of the rosette in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4E</xref> (similar to the ONL ones) correspond in the OCT to an area of low reflectivity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4F</xref> (similar to the ONL band). The center of rosettes was further shown to contain RPE proteins and have connections to the RPE layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Wenzel2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the OCT, we found that this tissue has reflective properties close to plexiform layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Rosette formation occurs postnatally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Wenzel2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Feathers1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, apparently driven by a metabolic need of the retina, leading to an increased surface area between RPE and photoreceptors. To better understand this process, we will examine the time course in individual animals in a separate study.</p><p>In mutants lacking the <italic>Crumbs1</italic> gene, lesions are commonly sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g005">Fig. 5 A</xref>), which makes an histological analysis laborious and demanding. An <italic>in vivo</italic> screening with the SLO has proven to be very effective the overall assessment as well as a preselection for immunostainings, saving time, money, and animals. Now, with the OCT, the nature and extent of the lesions can be assessed in real time. The particular example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g005">Fig 5 C</xref> illustrates the capability to detect intraretinal (black arrows) as well as choroidal vessels (white arrows), which so far required a full histological work-up of such lesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g005">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Having the morphological information available <italic>in vivo</italic> permits to study the dynamics of such sites in more detail (together with the use of dyes) before the animal is sacrificed.</p><p>The results in the <italic>Rb<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> mice illustrate how the developmental apoptosis due to an imbalance of RB and the E2Fs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Chen2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> affects the different layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>However, developmental apoptosis only occurs in areas where <italic>Rb</italic> is missing, which in this conditional knock-out is the area of Cre expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Sauer1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the retina-specific <italic>&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> mice used here do show a central-peripheral expression gradient, so does the apoptosis and, subsequently, retinal thickness. So, besides the <italic>Rb</italic>-specific findings, this model also helped to assess the feasibility of a topographical mapping of retinal thickness based on a set of consecutive serial sections (&#x0201c;volume scan&#x0201d;). The color-coded map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g006">Fig. 6 D</xref>) reveals regular retinal thickness values mainly around the optic disc (image center), which reflects the inverse topography of the <italic>&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> transgene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007507-Baumer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Thickness maps are further useful to follow thickness changes over time.</p><p>The prime advantage of OCT is certainly the ability to non-invasively produce histology-analogue retinal sections. As we have shown, these are both useful for the assessment and numerical quantification of generalized changes and for the detection and analysis of sporadic, localized lesions.</p><p>In many cases, standard histology may be replaced or at least its extent reduced by OCT, diminishing the amount of study animals needed. Even if histological sections are required (e.g. immunostains), OCT may help to preselect and to determine the optimal time point in individual animals in case of progressive changes.</p><p>As most degenerative processes are dynamic in nature, the non-invasive examination has substantial advantages for the understanding of short&#x02013;term alterations like edema formation. A requirement for preclinical and long-term studies is that markers of potential degenerative changes or therapeutic effects may be analyzed numerically. The OCT, for the first time, allows an accurate quantitative description of the retinal layers <italic>in vivo</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007507-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. As the majority of lesions primarily compromise the outer retina but leave the inner retina unchanged, it is a fundamental improvement that these layers are now accessible to separate quantification.</p><p>In summary, our results present the OCT as an important new tool for the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of rodent eyes. It is not only a methodological step forward but will also significantly help to reduce standard histology and thus the amount of animals needed. The ability to monitor developmental as well as inherited and induced degenerative processes and respective therapeutic intervention in the same individual animals opens a wide field of applicability in future long-term and preclinical studies. In conjunction with other non-invasive tests like electroretinography (ERG), OCT allows for a refined morphological and functional follow-up over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures concerning animals adhered to the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research, and were performed with permission of local authorities (Regierungspraesidium Tuebingen).

Over a decade of SLO in vivo imaging in animals, we have tested several conditions for the visualization of the murine fundus.
