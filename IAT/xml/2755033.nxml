Since the AtHKL1 protein is predicted to bind glc, although with a relatively decreased affinity, a reverse genetics approach was used to test whether HKL1 might have a related regulatory function in plant growth. By comparing phenotypes of an HKL1 mutant (<italic>hkl1-1</italic>), an HXK1 mutant (<italic>gin2-1</italic>), and transgenic lines that overexpress HKL1 in either wild-type or <italic>gin2-1</italic> genetic backgrounds, it is shown that HKL1 is a negative effector of plant growth. Interestingly, phenotypes of HKL1 overexpression lines are generally very similar to those of <italic>gin2-1</italic>. These are quantified, in part, as reduced seedling sensitivity to high glc concentrations and reduced seedling sensitivity to auxin-induced lateral root formation. However, commonly recognized targets of glc signalling are not apparently altered in any of the HKL1 mutant or transgenic lines. In fact, most, but not all, of the observed phenotypes associated with HKL1 overexpression occur independently of the presence of HXK1 protein. The data indicate that HKL1 mediates cross-talk between glc and other plant hormone response pathways. It is also considered Whether a possibly decreased glc binding affinity of HKL1 could possibly be a feedback mechanism to limit plant growth in the presence of excessive carbohydrate availability is further considered.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Auxin</kwd><kwd>glucose signalling</kwd><kwd>growth regulation</kwd><kwd>GUS staining</kwd><kwd>hexokinase</kwd><kwd>hexokinase-like</kwd><kwd>hypocotyl elongation</kwd><kwd>plant hormones</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All living organisms have complex regulatory networks that enable them to sense their nutrient status and to adjust their growth and development accordingly. Glucose (glc) is an important metabolic nutrient, which also functions as a signalling molecule that regulates gene expression in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Towle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gancedo, 2008</xref>). In plants, glc affects the expression of more than 1000 genes involved in a diverse array of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Price <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osuna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Many of the glc-regulated genes are involved in phytohormone biosynthesis and response pathways which control plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, genetic studies indicate that many mutants of plant glc signalling are alleles of genes with defined roles in ABA or ethylene biosynthesis, or their signalling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leon and Sheen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rognoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins, hexokinase1 (HXK1) and the regulator of G-protein signalling1 (RGS1), have independent roles in glc sensing and phytohormone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). As a glc sensor, AtHXK1 modulates plant growth at many different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). A null mutant of AtHXK1, <italic>gin2-1</italic>, has reduced shoot and root growth, increased apical dominance, delayed flowering, and altered sensitivities to auxin, cytokinin, and glc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, AtRGS1 has been suggested to function as a glc binding protein that can attenuate cell division in primary root apical meristems through its interaction with GPA1, a heterotrimeric G-protein subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Similar to HXK1, plant heterotrimeric G-proteins also affect a diverse array of developmental and hormone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perfus-Barbeoch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, even though seedlings of null mutants of both AtHXK1 and AtRGS1 fail to undergo normal glc-dependent cell cycle arrest, their hypocotyl elongation responses at low light are opposite to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Plant HXKs are encoded by a modest family of about 5&#x02013;10 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claeyssen and Rivoal, 2007</xref>). HXK proteins are reported to occur in the cytosol, mitochondria, plastids, nuclei, and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, and references therein). AtHXK1 is predominantly associated with the mitochondria, but also reportedly can occur in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). There is evidence that from both locations, AtHXK1 can regulate gene and/or protein expression, but there are questions regarding both scenarios (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasubramanian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In rice, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 have been shown recently to act as glc sensors and similarly to have a predominantly mitochondrial association, but possible nuclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, in contrast to AtHXK1, both OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 do contain a predicted nuclear localization signal.</p><p>A recent analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HXK gene family revealed that three of the six members lack catalytic activity when assayed with varying concentrations of glc or fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These were designated as hexokinase-like (HKL) proteins since they also are about 50% identical to AtHXK1. The basis for the lack of catalytic activity in the HKL proteins was attributed to a number of changes throughout the primary sequences and not to any specific single amino acid change. Known functional domains and key residues are reasonably well conserved in AtHKL1 (At1g50460) and AtHKL2 (At3g20040), and both proteins can probably bind glc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, sequence divergence in AtHKL3 (At4g37840) is so extensive that the protein might not bind either glc or ATP. Interestingly, all three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HKL proteins have a mitochondrial targeting peptide which is very similar to that of AtHXK1. Experimental evidence for their mitochondrial association has been shown by using a proteomics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heazlewood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and by examining the cellular expression of C-terminal GFP fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Non-catalytic HXKs have been reported in fungi and possibly occur commonly among higher plants (A Virnig and Bd Moore, unpublished data). The fungal HKL proteins have divergent roles including one as a meiosis-specific transcription factor in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniel, 2005</xref>) and others as regulators of a carbon starvation response in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Despite the reports of the presence of HKL proteins in evolutionarily diverse species, their lack of catalytic activity has made it challenging to define their functions. In this study, a reverse genetics approach was used to determine whether AtHKL1 might have a role in plant growth, perhaps as an effector of glc signalling. Analyses of phenotypes from gain-of-function <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants and from an identified mutant line with a T-DNA insertion in HKL1, show that HKL1 is a negative regulator of plant growth and that it affects seedling growth responses to glc and auxin. However, HKL1 does not affect glc signalling, as shown in protoplast transient expression assays and by seedling candidate gene expression assays. These data indicate that AtHKL1 has an important role in plant growth and development, perhaps by mediating cross-talk between glc and hormone response pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia (Col-0), ecotype Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>), and a Col line with a T-DNA insertion within the <italic>HKL1</italic> locus (At1g50460; line WISCDSLOX383A5; hereafter designated <italic>hkl1-1</italic>) were obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University).

HKL1 overexpression in L<italic>er</italic> (HKL1-HA) resulted in reduced seedling growth on sucrose plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), reduced hypocotyl elongation under low light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), severely reduced rosette size under LD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), and a decreased sensitivity to auxin-induced lateral root formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In a recent initial report, some rice HXK family members also were considered to be possible negative regulators of seedling growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu and Chiang, 2008</xref>). The status of the glc binding domain in possible regulatory HXKs needs to be evaluated experimentally. It has previously been shown that AtHXK1-G173A has a 90% decrease in glc phosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Since AtHKL1 has the same recognized glc binding domain as does this mutated protein, we speculate that glc binding affinity is reduced in AtHKL1, but not eliminated. Thus, for a negative regulator, decreased glc binding affinity could be a feedback mechanism to limit plant growth in the presence of excessive carbohydrate availability.</p><p>The HKL1 protein might function as a negative regulator of cell expansion, based on reduced hypocotyl growth of HKL1-HA seedlings and on increased hypocotyl growth of the <italic>hkl1-1</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Seedling hypocotyl growth by cell elongation integrates diverse signals including light, temperature, nutrients, and most plant hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Grauwe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In <italic>gin2-1</italic>, reduced hypocotyl growth has been attributed to the possible insensitivity of seedlings to auxin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, ethylene also can repress hypocotyl elongation in seedlings grown under conditions similar to those in our experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smalle <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Thus, it is possible that HKL1 expression promotes ethylene sensitivity instead of attenuating auxin sensitivity. Consistent with this possibility, while lateral root formation does require auxin synthesis, transport, and/or signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casimiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), enhanced ethylene signalling has more recently been shown to repress lateral root formation by modulating auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Negi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Thus, the observed HKL1 repression phenotype for auxin-induced root formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) might instead be associated with an altered ethylene response. Further experiments are needed to clarify the mechanisms involved.</p><p>The mode of action of AtHKL1 is not known, but does merit further consideration. On the one hand, since both HXK1 and HKL1 are targeted to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heazlewood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karve <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), the two proteins have the potential to interact such that HKL1 could act as a dominant negative effector. In this case, the overexpression of HKL1 in the <italic>gin2-1</italic> background might not result in a novel phenotype relative to its overexpression in the presence of HXK1. Assay results for hypocotyl growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), for auxin induction of lateral root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), and for glc tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) are consistent with this possibility. Furthermore, the contrasting phenotypes observed by these assays with the <italic>hkl1-1</italic> mutant also support this interpretation. On the other hand, the overexpression of HKL1 in WT did result in a much more diminutive plant under LD conditions than was observed in <italic>gin2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This implies that HKL1 could have a more complicated mode of action by also independently affecting one or more targets possibly involved in mediating phytohormone responses.</p><p>In summary, the present results indicate that the non-catalytic AtHKL1 protein can negatively influence plant growth, possibly by somehow influencing cross-talk between glc and other plant hormone response pathways. Elucidating the functions of non-catalytic proteins will be an ongoing challenge for contemporary biologists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp252/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp252/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1.</ext-link></bold> The number of T-DNA insertions in <italic>hkl1-1</italic> as determined by real time PCR.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp252/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2.</ext-link></bold> Growth under 16 h (long day) photoperiod conditions of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> expressing HKL1 protein in different genetic backgrounds.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp252/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3.</ext-link></bold> Growth response on agar plates with varying glc concentrations for the transgenic HKL1-Flag line 43.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp252/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4.</ext-link></bold> Transcript abundance by semi-quantitative RT-PCR of HXK1 and HKL1 from L<italic>er</italic> seedlings grown on plates with 0.5% sucrose (&#x02013;) or with 6% glucose (+).</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp252_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="erp252_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>GFP</term><def><p>green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GUS</term><def><p>glucuronidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p>haemagglutinin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HKL</term><def><p>hexokinase-like</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HXK</term><def><p>hexokinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LD</term><def><p>long day</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LUC</term><def><p>luciferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAA</term><def><p>naphthalene acetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPA</term><def><p>1-naphthylphthalamic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPDK</term><def><p>pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBCS</term><def><p>ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p>reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>short day</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UBQ</term><def><p>ubiquitin</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We very much appreciate technical help from Ms Xiaoxia Xia.
