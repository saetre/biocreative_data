Diabetes is likely to be an important risk factor for atherosclerosis, as hyperglycemia induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and may thus contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. This study was performed to investigate whether PGC-1&#x003b1;, a PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator and metabolic master regulator, plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and migration induced by high glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels are decreased in blood vessel media of STZ-treated diabetic rats. In cultured rat VSMCs, high glucose dose-dependently inhibits PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression. Overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; either by infection with adenovirus, or by stimulation with palmitic acid, significantly reduces high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In contrast, suppression of PGC-1&#x003b1; by siRNA mimics the effects of glucose on VSMCs. Finally, mechanistic studies suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1;-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration is regulated through preventing ERK1/2 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; is a key regulator of high glucose-induced proliferation and migration in VSMCs, and suggest that elevation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in VSMC could be a useful strategy in preventing the development of diabetic atherosclerosis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis and microvascular diseases are the major vascular complications of diabetes, and constitute the principal causes of morbidity and mortality among diabetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004182-Krolewski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004182-Stamler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Activation of ERKs subsequently leads to the phosphorylation and the activation of a number of downstream targets, such as Elk-1 and Ets-1, which evoke c-Fos and MMP-9 and contribute to VSMCs growth and migration, respectively. In the present study, high glucose markedly increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels in VSMCs, whereas overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; completely abolished this phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004182-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). However, little effect is observed either on VSMC proliferation and migration or on the activity of ERK1/2 when PGC-1&#x003b1; was overexpressed in the VSMCs without high glucose stimulation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of PGC-1&#x003b1; on VSMC proliferation and migration only exists in the cells which have been exposed and responded to the mitogenic signal, instead of quiescent VSMCs. These data suggest PGC-1&#x003b1; inhibits high glucose-induced ERK activity in VSMCs, and negative regulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in VSMC proliferation and migration is achieved by inhibiting nuclear ERK MAPK signaling. Our results confirmed to the previous report which showed that overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; abolished oleic acid induced ERK1/2 activity. However, it also reported that PGC-1&#x003b1; expression was regulated in skeletal muscle cells through a mechanism involving MAPK-ERK and NF-&#x003ba;B activation (26), suggesting the interaction between PGC-1&#x003b1; expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation are different in various cell types. The differences may attribute to different mechanism involved and may relate to the regulation of specific cell function. In VSMCs, given that PPAR&#x003b3; has been reported to act as an inhibitory factor upstream of the ERK MAPK pathway (9&#x02013;12) and PGC-1&#x003b1; is a co-activator of PPAR&#x003b3;, the inhibitory effect of PGC-1&#x003b1; on ERK activity may be mediated through the coactivation of PPAR&#x003b3;. The precise mechanisms of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation on ERK activity merit further study.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that high glucose increases VSMC proliferation and migration through PGC-1&#x003b1;. Experimental elevation of PGC-1&#x003b1; (by adenoviral overexpression or incubation with palmitic acid) inhibits high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration.
