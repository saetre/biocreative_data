Although <italic>L. casei</italic> induced IP-10 ubiquitination, the inhibition of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation did not prevent the loss of intracellular IP-10.

The incidence and prevalence of the two main idiopathic pathologies of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are rising globally in parallel to the progression of the industrialisation. More that 3.5 million people suffer from IBD in the United States and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Loftus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, but although extensive research was performed in this field, the initial trigger is still unknown and efficient therapies are not available yet. Genetical susceptibility of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Cho1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and the intestinal microbiota both were found to play a pivotal role in the onset and perpetuation of IBD. Enhanced numbers of mucosa associated bacteria and decreased microbiota diversity are associated with these diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Sartor1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to the fact, that IBD is the result of an overreaction of the intestinal immune system towards intestinal microbes, clinical studies showed that oral uptake of specific probiotic bacterial strains like VSL#3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Gionchetti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Gionchetti2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> or <italic>Escherichia coli Nissle</italic> 1917 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Kruis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Rembacken1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> resulted in attenuation of IBD disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Isaacs1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Apart from its protective effect in clinical studies, VSL#3 was shown to reduce experimental colitis in IL-10-deficient (IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice. Treatment of IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in decreased histopathology, normalization of colonic function, barrier integrity and mucosal cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Madsen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, VSL#3 was shown to induce protective heat-shock-proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Petrof1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> or proliferation of IL-10-dependent TGF&#x003b2;-bearing regulatory T-cells in Th1-dependent murine colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Giacinto1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is no study showing protective effects of VSL#3 in the context of CD or experimental ileitis, suggesting disease-and intestinal segment-specific effects of VSL#3. Extensive progress has been made in understanding probiotic effects of VSL#3 in the context of IBD but the molecular mechanisms as well as strain-specificity remain to be elucidated.</p><p>IEC are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Artis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and failure to control inflammatory processes at the epithelial cell level may critically contribute to the disease pathogenesis. The intestinal epithelium must interact with and adapt to the constant changing environment by processing the combined biological information from luminal enteric bacteria and host-derived signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Clavel1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. IEC react on bacterial as well as immune-derived pro-inflammatory signals by secreting cytokines and chemokines like interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon &#x003b3;-induced protein 10 (IP-10) to activate and attract Th1-immune cells and phagocytic cells to the site of infection. Cytokine and chemokine levels were shown to be strongly elevated in inflamed intestinal regions of IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Banks1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Experimental studies confirmed that IP-10 plays an outstanding role in uncontrolled disease development as the blockade of IP-10 by an anti-IP-10 antibody was sufficient to decrease disease severity in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This effect was shown to be due to reduced Th1 cell generation in inductive sites and reduced recruitment of Th1 effector cells to the colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Hyun1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Another experimental study revealed that anti-IP-10 therapy attenuates murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) colitis through the blockade of Th1-cell trafficking and the reduction of IEC apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the importance of IP-10 as a pro-inflammatory mediator in IBD has been clearly demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of IP-10 expression in IEC during disease development are not well understood. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that probiotics are able to regulate chemokine expression in IEC.

As expected, we found that TNF-induced ileitis correlates with enhanced IP-10 protein expression in primary ileal epithelial cells from TNF<sup>&#x00394;ARE</sup> mice. The absence of T-cell contaminations in the purified IEC from inflamed mice confirmed the purity of the epithelial cell isolation (data not shown). Consistent with the tissue pathology, VSL#3 did not reduce IP-10 protein expression in primary ileal IEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The presence of VSL#3 bacteria in the intestine was proven by the use of bacteria-specific PCR on DNA isolated from intestinal contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast to the unresponsiveness of heterozygous TNF<sup>&#x00394;ARE</sup> mice to VSL#3 treatment, we found that cecal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) but not colonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) inflammation in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was significantly reduced by the probiotic mixture, suggesting intestinal segment specific effects of VSL#3.

Although we were not able to separate cecal and colonic epithelial cells during the isolation procedure (for the sake of yield), Western blot analysis showed that VSL#3 clearly reduced the expression of IP-10 even in the pooled cell population. Real-time PCR analysis of IP-10 mRNA levels in these primary IECs showed that the observed reduction of IP-10 protein is not due to reduced levels of IP-10 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), supporting our finding that the reduction of IP-10 protein in IEC is the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism induced by VSL#3.

Since formaldehyde fixed <italic>L. casei</italic> had the same inhibitory effect on IP-10 secretion as live bacteria, active interaction between bacteria and IEC is not necessary for the inhibitory effect, suggesting a bacterial cell surface component as the effective probiotic structure. In contrast to <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG, a probiotic bacteria that was shown to have protective effects on IEC survival and growth via two secreted proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Yan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, we demonstrated that the inhibition of TNF-induced IP-10 secretion was due to a heat-labile surface protein of <italic>L. casei.</italic> The proteinasous nature of the bacterial structure responsible for the inhibition of IP-10 was supported by the finding that the effect was independent of TLR2-dependent signalling mechanisms.

Given the high physiological relevance of elevated IP-10 expression in inflamed intestinal tissue regions of IBD patients and animal models of experimental colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Banks1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, the inhibitory effect on this chemokine may play an important role in the anti-inflammatory effects of the probiotic mixture VSL#3 on inflammatory bowel diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Bibiloni1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We were able to show that IP-10 expression in IEC correlates with inflammation, as IP-10 expression was elevated in primary ileal IEC from heterozygous TNF<sup>&#x00394;ARE</sup> mice as well as in colonic IEC from IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to healthy wildtype mice. In a healthy host, pathogen-induced secretion of IP-10 triggers enhanced recruitment of effector Th1 cells and monocytes into the mucosa, resulting in subsequent deletion of the infectious agent. In the case of IBD, chronically activated IEC steadily produce high amounts of IP-10 in the absence of any pathogenical stimuli resulting in constant Th1 and monocyte recruitment. The presence and activity of these effector cells may lead to the loss of epithelial cell integrity and tissue damage. In consequence, the expression of IP-10 in IEC has to be tightly regulated to prevent infections on the one hand and the development of pathological conditions like chronic intestinal inflammations on the other hand. Consistently, IP-10 expression has been shown to be modulated at various levels. The activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by PPAR&#x003b3; ligands inhibited IP-10 expression by reducing IP-10 promoter activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Marx1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, butyrate inhibited IFN&#x003b3; and TNF-induced IP-10 transcription in colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Inatomi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and interleukin 10 suppressed LPS-induced IP-10 gene transcription in peritoneal macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Tebo1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Many studies have analyzed the transcriptional regulation of cytokines and chemokines like IP-10 but although post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of chemokines is suggested to be very important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Proost1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, exact mechanisms are mostly unknown. The pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 was shown to be upregulated by a TLR5-mediated, p38-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Yu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and furthermore, to be processed at the amino terminal end by a matrix metallo proteinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-VanderSteen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the biosynthesis of IFN&#x003b3; was shown to be suppressed post-transcriptionally by the stimulation with lead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Heo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Concerning IP-10, complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms seem to play an important role. Recent studies revealed regulatory mechanisms like IP-10 mRNA half-life modulation in monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Shanmugam1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> or C-terminal truncation through furin, a pro-protein convertase, resulting in another active form of the chemokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Hensbergen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, IP-10 was found to be processed C-terminally by gelatinase B and neutrophil collagenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-VanderSteen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the activity of IP-10 was shown to be regulated by its oligomerization status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Campanella1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study revealed for the first time that probiotic bacteria are able to induce post-translational regulation of IP-10 protein in IEC. Decreased IP-10 protein stability was identified as a new post-translational regulatory mechanism.</p><p><italic>L. casei</italic>-induced ubiquitination of IP-10 is very likely involved in the observed degradation of the chemokine although it does not target the protein for proteasomal degradation. It has already been shown that stimulation with <italic>L. casei</italic> has multiple effects on the expression of genes involved in proteasome and ubiquitination pathways in IEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Tien1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, but the exact mechanisms are not known yet. In contrast to lysosomal degradation of LPS-induced TNF under hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Lahat1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, lysosomal pathways were not involved in <italic>L. casei</italic>-induced loss of IP-10 protein, suggesting alternative degradation pathways to be involved. The inhibition of protein secretion through brefeldin A was found to induce degradation of IP-10 instead of intracellular accumulation, as it was shown for other secretory proteins like makrophage inflammatory protein-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Isowa1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. This result led to the hypothesis that <italic>L. casei</italic> might selectively impair secretion of IP-10 followed by subsequent degradation as a protective mechanism to prevent protein accumulation. In contrast to interleukin-6, the secretion of IP-10 was found to be dependent on tightly regulated vesicular transport. <italic>L. casei</italic> mimicks the effect of 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of vesicular trafficking and exosome secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Dardalhon1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, which specifically inhibits IP-10 secretion and induces loss of intracellular IP-10 protein. Considering the extensive post-translational processing of IP-10, this inhibitory mechanism might be due to the necessity for chemokine maturation processes in endo-lysosomal compartments prior to exocytosis as it has been shown for several other secretory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Marinari1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Schhs1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that <italic>L. casei</italic> inhibits vesicle trafficking similar to 3-methyladenine, resulting in impaired maturation and secretion of IP-10 followed by subsequent degradation of the chemokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004365-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> feeding studies revealed that VSL#3 has no effect on the development of ileal inflammation in heterozygous TNF<sup>&#x00394;ARE</sup> mice. This result may indicate that the constant overexpression of TNF in these mice and the resulting T-cell driven immunopathology constitute such a strong pro-inflammatory stimulus that probiotic therapy is not sufficient to reduce tissue inflammation. Apart from that, one could raise the hypothesis that probiotic therapy is generally less effective in the ileum than in the colon due to high luminal content passage rates in this intestinal segment. The failure of VSL#3 in the context of ileitis together with the observed reduction of cecal inflammation in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is consistent with clinical data showing effective probiotic treatment mostly in the context of UC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Bibiloni1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and pouchitis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Chapman1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that VSL#3 has protective effects on cecal but not on colonic inflammation clearly reveals intestinal segment specific effects of the probiotic mixture. The differences in response to probiotic treatment between the two intestinal compartments might be due to the lower inflammatory grade in the cecum compared to the colon in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice or due to differences in the bacterial colonisation. The discrepancy to previously published studies, showing anti-inflammatory effects of VSL#3 in the cecum and colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Madsen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, may presumably be due to differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota of the IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in different animal facilities or the time point of intervention. The intestinal microbiota has already been shown to have an enormous impact upon the onset, severity and localisation of experimental colitis, suggesting that even small differences might impact the effectiveness of probiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004365-Kim1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The expression of IP-10 in primary intestinal epithelial cells was found to correlate strongly with disease severity.
