This gene encodes for the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that has been shown to use its RGG box domain to bind to G quartet-forming RNA. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the interactions between the FMRP RGG box domain and one of its proposed RNA targets, human semaphorin 3F (S3F) RNA by using biophysical methods such as fluorescence, UV and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We show that this RNA forms a G quartet-containing structure, which is recognized with high affinity and specificity by the FMRP RGG box. In addition, we analyzed the interactions of human S3F RNA with the RGG box and RG cluster of the two FMRP autosomal paralogs, the FXR1P and FXR2P. We found that this RNA is bound with high affinity and specificity only by the FXR1P RGG box, but not by the FXR2P RG cluster. Both FMRP and FXR1P RGG box are able to unwind the G quartet structure of S3F RNA, however, the peptide concentrations required in this process are very different: a ratio of 1:6 RNA:FMRP RGG box versus 1:2 RNA:FXR1P RGG box.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXMR/FXS), an X-linked disorder, is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). At the molecular level, the progressive expansion of (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats and the hypermethylation of the CpG island, in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene causes its transcriptional inactivation. The resulting suppression of the encoded protein, named the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), has been shown to be the underlying cause of this syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). FMRP is a putative nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), found abundantly expressed in the neurons and several studies suggested that this protein participates in the synaptic plasticity of neurons by acting on post-transcriptional control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). FMRP has been proposed to regulate the transport and translation of specific messenger RNA targets (mRNA) in a manner critical for neuronal development. It has also been shown that this protein has nucleic acid chaperone properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The sequence analysis of FMRP revealed that the 632 amino acid protein contains two types of RNA-binding motifs: two K-homology (KH) domains and one arginine-glycine-glycine rich region (RGG box), suggesting that the protein exerts its function through RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>FMRP has two autosomal paralogs, the FXR1 and FXR2 proteins (FXR1P and FXR2P), with which it forms the fragile X-related protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed that the two proteins have &#x0223c;60% amino acid identity, with regions of 90% sequence identity to FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). FXR1P and FXR2P are also cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, each containing two KH domains. The FXR2P is divergent from FMRP and FXR1P in the C-terminal region, in that it has a RG cluster instead of an RGG box. The fact that the FXR proteins have been found to be associated predominantly with the ribosomal 60S subunit, and that they have similar RNA-binding domains lead to the suggestion that the FXR1P and FXR2P might compensate for the FMRP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, the comparison of the expression levels of each of these proteins in different tissues and cellular distributions suggests that each of the FXR proteins might have an independent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical studies conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that FMRP uses its RGG box to bind with high affinity to target RNA sequences proposed to contain G quartet structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">15&#x02013;19</xref>). A G quartet is formed from four guanine residues arranged in a planar configuration, which is stabilized by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds. Several such planar structures can stack and are stabilized by potassium or sodium cations, but they do not form in the presence of lithium cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). The specific mechanism by which FMRP interacts with its mRNA ligands and regulates their translation still remains poorly understood. Human semaphorin 3F (S3F) mRNA has been identified both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> as a potential mRNA target of the FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and it has been proposed that its interactions with the FMRP RGG box occur in a G quartet-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). S3F mRNA encodes for the SEMA 3F protein which belongs to the class 3 semaphorins, a family of secreted and transmembrane signaling molecules that play crucial roles in the nervous (neuronal migration and axon pathfinding), immune and cardiovascular systems. Every member of this family has the 500 amino acid signature, the semaphorin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). SEMA 3F is a putative secreted protein that has been suggested to have chemoattractant and repulsion functions. The expression of the <italic>SEMA 3F</italic> gene has also been reported to suppress tumor formation in nude mice and to cause the alteration of the cellular response to drugs inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this study is to contribute to our understanding of the principles of recognition between FMRP and its RNA target(s), by analyzing its interactions with S3F RNA. We show here that S3F RNA adopts a parallel intramolecular G quadruplex structure and we use thermodynamic methods to determine if the stability and the secondary structure of this RNA are altered by its interactions with the FMRP RGG box. We also investigate the binding of the RGG box and RG cluster of the FXR1P and FXR2P to S3F RNA, in an effort to determine if the recognition of the structural elements in this RNA is unique to the FMRP RGG box.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>RNA synthesis</title><p>The unlabeled RNA oligonucleotides (S3F-lg, S3F-M2 and Munc-13 site 1) were synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions using T7 RNA polymerase (produced in-house), following the procedure by Milligan and Uhlenbeck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

To determine if this RNA folds into a G quadruplex structure, we used a combination of CD, fluorescence, NMR and UV spectroscopy techniques. It is well known that the G-rich nucleic acid sequences fold in to G quartets in the presence of cations like K<sup>+</sup>, by forming cation&#x02013;dipole interactions with the guanine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). CD spectroscopy has been extensively used to analyze the G quadruplex structure in DNA and RNA. Typically, there are two types of CD spectra observed for G quadruplexes: type I, which exhibits a positive band &#x0223c;265&#x02009;nm and a negative band &#x0223c;240&#x02009;nm and type II, which exhibits a positive band &#x0223c;295&#x02009;nm and a negative band &#x0223c;260&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). At least for &#x02018;<italic>intermolecular</italic>&#x02019; G quadruplexes, there is a strong correlation between the parallel quadruplex and type I CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and between the antiparallel quadruplex and type II CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In the case of intramolecular G quadruplexes, there are also examples of parallel type quadruplexes exhibiting type I of CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38">35&#x02013;38</xref>) and of antiparallel quadruplexes exhibiting type II of CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, this correlation is not as clearly established in the case of <italic>intramolecular</italic> G quadruplexes, since there are not enough high-resolution structures available. Generally, the CD spectroscopy results cannot be exclusively used to assign definitively a particular type of fold to a G quadruplex structure, as there are examples of more complex CD spectra exhibiting the features of both, type I and type II spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>The CD spectrum of S3F-lg RNA folded in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> ions is of type I, with a positive band at 263&#x02009;nm and a negative one at 238&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), confirming the presence of G quartet structural elements in this RNA. This result suggests that the fold of this G quadruplex is of parallel nature, however, as discussed above, this can only be confirmed by the high-resolution structure of this RNA.</p><p>The UV spectroscopy thermal denaturation profile of S3F-lg measured at 305&#x02009;nm, shows a characteristic hypochromic transition between 52 and 72&#x000b0;C, corresponding to G quadruplex dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), supporting the presence of a G quadruplex structure in this RNA.</p><p>G-rich sequences are notorious for forming alternate G quartet structures <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to determine if this is true for S3F-lg RNA as well, we used native gel electrophoresis. Two conformations are observed on a 15% native gel performed in the presence of 75&#x02009;mM KCl at all RNA concentrations investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and data not shown).</p><p>To obtain higher-resolution information about the structure of S3F-lg RNA, we have used one-dimensional (1D) <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Resonances are present in the 10&#x02013;12&#x02009;ppm. proton region corresponding to imino protons involved in G quartets, however, they are very broad, suggesting that this RNA exchanges between different conformations. Surprisingly, we did not observe any imino proton resonances corresponding to Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs in the 12&#x02013;14&#x02009;ppm. region, indicating that the stem structure proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A does not exist in S3F-lg (data not shown). One possible explanation for this finding is that the addition of the extra four nucleotides (GGGA) at the beginning of the S3F-lg sequence might actually promote the folding of this RNA into an alternate G quadruplex structure, since they contribute to the formation of an uninterrupted stretch of 10 purines.</p><p>In an effort to promote the folding of S3F RNA into a single conformer we have removed its first four GGGA nucleotides [that were added only for transcription purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)], and introduced specific point mutations at positions 3 (G to C) and 4 (G to U) and at the complementary positions 31 (U to A) and 32 (U to C), respectively (labeled in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This mutated RNA, named S3F-M2 RNA, no longer contains a stretch of 10 purines at its 5&#x02032; end and of six consecutive guanines in the region proposed to fold into a stem structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We first investigated whether S3F-M2 RNA maintained the ability to form a G quadruplex structure. Upon titration of increasing concentrations of KCl, the CD spectrum of S3F-M2 RNA showed the spectral features of a type I G quadruplex CD spectrum, with a strong positive band at 263&#x02009;nm and a negative band at 238&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), very similar to that of S3F-lg RNA. The native gel electrophoresis of S3F-M2 RNA indicates that at concentrations &#x0003c;10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M this RNA exists in a single conformation (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, and data not shown), whereas at higher concentrations S3F-M2 adopts more conformations.</p><p>The 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of S3F-M2 shows resonances corresponding to imino protons involved in G quartets, as well as resonances corresponding to Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs, indicating the presence of both a stem and a G quadruplex in the structure of this RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). However, the G quartet imino proton resonances are very broad, consistent with an exchange between the different S3F-M2 conformers formed at the high RNA concentration required when using this technique. The exchange between different RNA conformations is also supported by the Watson&#x02013;Crick imino protons, whose resonances become much broader upon addition of increasing KCl concentrations. These findings hindered our efforts to pursue high-resolution NMR spectroscopy studies of the S3F-M2 RNA structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermodynamics of G quartet formation in S3F-M2 RNA</title><p>We have employed UV spectroscopy to obtain the thermodynamic parameters of G quartet formation in S3F-M2 RNA. The UV thermal melting profile of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M S3F-M2 RNA folded in the presence of 150&#x02009;mM KCl shows a hypochromic transition between 38 and 67&#x000b0;C (indicated in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), and a hyperchromic transition starting around 75&#x000b0;C. We assign the 38&#x02013;67&#x000b0;C hypochromic transition, with a melting point &#x0223c;52&#x000b0;C, to the S3F-M2 RNA G quadruplex dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). As expected, this transition is absent when the RNA is folded in the presence of 150&#x02009;mM LiCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), since G quartets do not form in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup> ions. We postulated that the hyperchromic transition starting at 75&#x000b0;C corresponds to the S3F-M2 stem structure melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we have constructed a S3F RNA from which the stem region has been removed (named S3F-sh). S3F-sh maintains the ability to form a G quadruplex structure, as evidenced by its type I (positive band &#x0223c;265&#x02009;nm and negative band &#x0223c;240&#x02009;nm) CD spectrum and by the presence of G quartet imino proton resonances in its 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (data not shown). In addition, its UV thermal denaturation profile measured at 305&#x02009;nm shows a 40&#x02013;65&#x000b0;C hypochromic transition, corresponding to a G quadruplex melting point of &#x0223c;52&#x000b0;C (Supplementary Figure 1). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>UV thermal denaturation profile of S3F-M2 RNA (10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) containing either 150&#x02009;mM KCl <bold>(A)</bold> or LiCl (<bold>B)</bold>.

Thus, it is clear that the origin of the hyperchromic transition observed in the UV melting profile of S3F-M2 RNA, is not the melting of its stem structure. We ruled out the possibility that this hyperchromic transition is due to the RNA degradation at high temperatures, by checking the reversibility of the melting curves of S3F-M2 RNA measured in the range 25&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C and 25&#x02013;99&#x000b0;C, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A and B). One possibility for the presence of the hyperchromic transition in the UV melting curves of S3F-M2, S3F-sh and S3F-lg RNAs could be that all have an uninterrupted stretch of 14 purines (starting at G12 for S3F-M2 RNA- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Upon the melting of the G quadruplex structure, the liberated rG residues can stack with their rA nearest neighbors, and these rG-rA stacks will melt with increasing temperature, giving rise to the hyperchromic transition observed above 65&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>Since we could not determine the transition corresponding to the melting of the S3F-M2 stem structure from its UV melting curve recorded at 305&#x02009;nm, we used 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, since with this technique we can monitor individually the stem structure of S3F-M2 RNA (resonances at 13.3&#x02009;ppm. and 12.0&#x02009;ppm. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). We have determined that both resonances corresponding to Watson&#x02013;Crick imino protons are no longer present at 50&#x000b0;C, indicating that the stem structure in S3F-M2 RNA is completely melted above this temperature (data not shown).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the G quadruplex forming sequence of S3F-sh RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, nucleotides 8&#x02013;27) is wild-type and it is also identical in S3F-lg and S3F-M2 RNAs.

This supports the idea that the addition of four extra nucleotides in S3F-lg RNA, promotes the formation of an alternate G quadruplex structure, different from that formed by the wild-type S3F-sh. Moreover, this finding indicates that the mutations introduced in the stem of S3F-M2 RNA do not affect the ability of the G quadruplex forming sequence to fold into a structure similar to that of the wild-type S3F-sh.</p><p>To determine if S3F-M2 RNA forms an &#x02018;<italic>intramolecular</italic>&#x02019; or an &#x02018;<italic>intermolecular</italic>&#x02019; G quartet structure we have measured its melting temperature at various RNA concentrations in the range 10&#x02013;80&#x02009;&#x000b5;M.

The UV melting curve of the S3F-M2 RNA:FMRP RGG box complex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E has been corrected by subtracting the UV melting curve of the free FMRP RGG box peptide. The 38&#x02013;67&#x000b0;C UV hypochromic transition corresponding to G quartet dissociation in the free RNA is now shifted in the range 42&#x02013;78&#x000b0;C, corresponding to an increase of the G quartet structure <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> from &#x0223c;52&#x000b0;C to &#x0223c;65&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, in a 1:1 ratio, the FMRP RGG box increases the stability of S3F-M2&#x02009;G quartet structure. It is very interesting to note that upon binding the RGG peptide, a second hypochromic transition appears in the range 79&#x02013;91&#x000b0;C, indicating that the peptide promotes the formation of an alternate more stable structure of S3F-M2 RNA.</p><p>The FMRP RGG box binding has also been shown to stabilize the G quartet structure of Sc1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), however to a different extent: the difference in melting temperatures of the G quartet structure in the free RNA and in the RNA in complex with the RGG peptide is &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;C for Sc1 RNA and &#x0223c;13&#x000b0;C for S3F-M2 RNA. Thus, in the case of S3F-M2, only a small fraction of the FMRP RGG box binding free energy is used to stabilize the RNA G quartet structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). In contrast, in the case of Sc1 RNA, a significant fraction of the binding free energy is used to stabilize its G quartet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions of S3F-M2 RNA with the FXR1P and FXR2P</title><p>We inquired next if the recognition of the G quartet structure in S3F-M2 RNA is unique to the FMRP RGG box, or if this RNA is also recognized by the two FMRP autosomal paralogs, the FXR1P and FXR2P. FXR1P has an RGG box different in sequence from that of the FMRP RGG box, whereas the FXR2P has an RG cluster, but not RGG repeats <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Using EMSA we determined that S3F-M2 RNA is bound by the FXR1P RGG box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6), but not by the FXR2P RG cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). To get a quantitative measure of the FXR1P RGG box binding we determined the binding curve by titrating increasing amounts of the peptide into a solution of 150 nM S3F-M2_15AP RNA and monitoring the steady-state fluorescence change of the 2-AP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, green trace).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C, both the FMRP and FXR1P RGG boxes bind specifically to S3F-M2_15AP RNA, since their binding curves are identical in the presence or absence of a large excess of the Munc13 site 1 RNA or of the FXR2 RG cluster (the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values are reported in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> legend).</p><p>This result is in contrast to what has been reported for the G quartet-forming Sc1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), since this RNA is bound specifically only by the FMRP RGG box, but not by the FXR1P RGG box. This difference in specificity of the FXR1P RGG box binding to Sc1 and S3F-M2 RNAs is likely due to structural differences in their G quartet and/or junction regions. Thus, the ability of FXR1P RGG box to bind specifically and with high affinity to the G quartet-forming mRNA targets of FMRP might be modulated by subtle differences in the particular G quartet structure adopted by the RNA. Another level of complexity becomes apparent if one considers the G quartet RNA-binding activity of the full-length FXR1P, as opposed to just of its RGG box domain. Recently, it has been reported that of three different FXR1P isoforms, only one is able to bind specifically to N19 RNA, a G quartet-forming segment of the FMRP mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Since all these three FXR1P isoforms contain the RGG box domain, it has been suggested that the FXR1P RGG box domain is not sufficient <italic>per se</italic> to bind to the G quartet structure and that a 27 amino acid stretch, present only on the FXR1P isoform that binds specifically to N19 RNA, might directly assist the FXR1P RGG box in binding the G quartet, or it might alter the structure of C-terminal portion of FXR1P, thereby allowing binding. We show here that the FXR1P RGG box domain can <italic>per se</italic> bind specifically to G quartet forming RNA, so it is more likely that the differences observed in the binding activity of the full-length FXR1P isoforms originate from differences in the C-terminal structure that might have an impact on the accessibility of the RGG box domain.</p><p>Since the FXR1P RGG box binds with high affinity and specificity to S3F-M2_15AP RNA, we assessed also if this peptide has any effect upon the stability of the RNA G quadruplex structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D shows that the 38&#x02013;67&#x000b0;C UV hypochromic transition corresponding to G quartet dissociation in the free RNA is shifted in the range 50&#x02013;72&#x000b0;C when the RNA is complexed with the FXR1P RGG box, corresponding to a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#x0223c;61&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the FXR1P RGG box binding is also slightly stabilizing the G quadruplex structure of S3F-M2 RNA. Moreover, like the FMRP RGG box, the FXR1 RGG box binding induces the formation of an alternate G quadruplex structure in S3F-M2 RNA, whose dissociation has a hypochromic transition in the range 73&#x02013;93&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The FXR2 RG cluster has no effect upon the stability of the S3F-M2&#x02009;G quadruplex structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and it does not promote the formation of a secondary alternate structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E).</p></sec><sec><title>At high concentrations the FMRP and FXR1P RGG boxes induce the unwinding of the G quadruplex of S3F-M2 RNA</title><p>To investigate the effect of the FMRP and FXR1P RGG boxes on the intramolecular G quartet structure of S3F-M2 RNA, we compared the CD spectra of the free RNA with those of the RNA in complex with the RGG peptides. At a 1:1 ratio of S3F-M2 RNA:RGG peptide, the intensity of the CD band at 263&#x02013;238&#x02009;nm was almost unchanged, for both the FMRP and FXR1P RGG boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). However, at higher ratios of the RNA:RGG box, both peptides induced the unstacking of the G qudruplex structure of S3F-M2, as reflected by a decrease of intensity of the 263&#x02009;nm CD band as well as a shift to 265&#x02009;nm. As a negative control we have also performed the same experiment in the presence of the non-binding FXR2 RG cluster (Supplementary Figure 3) It is interesting to note that the actions of the FMRP and FXR1P RGG peptides are very different: the FXR1P RGG peptide starts to unwind the G quartet RNA structure at only an 1:2 RNA:peptide ratio, whereas this effect occurs for the FMRP RGG box at an 1:6 ratio. At RNA:RGG peptide ratios higher than 1:4 the solutions become turbid, similar to what has been reported for the RGG box of nucleolin protein interactions with MS2 phage RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the RNA is degraded in the presence of the large excess of the RGG peptides, we have treated the solution containing the 1:10 RNA:peptide complexes with proteinase K, which degrades the RGG peptides, and re-acquired its CD spectrum (corrected for the proteinase K contribution). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D, the removal of the RGG peptides, allows the free RNA to refold into a G quadruplex structure, indicating that the spectral changes we observed in the presence of a large excess of the RGG peptides are not due to the RNA degradation, but due to the G quadruplex structure unstacking. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>CD spectra of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M S3F-M2 RNA in the presence of increasing concentrations of the RGG boxes of FMRP <bold>(A</bold>) and FXR1P <bold>(B</bold>). 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M S3F-M2 RNA+ 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M FMRP RGG Box <bold>(C)</bold> and the 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M S3F-M2 RNA+ 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M FXR1P RGG Box <bold>(D)</bold> with proteinase K (1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g) for 1&#x02009;h at 25&#x000b0;C, to check for the degradation of the RNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm581f6"/></fig></p><p>We cannot easily reconcile the findings that in an 1:1 RNA:peptide ratio, both the FMRP and FXR1P RGG boxes stabilize the S3F-M2&#x02009;G quadruplex structure, whereas at higher ratios, they induce the G quadruplex unwinding.</p><p>The unwinding of the S3F-M2 RNA G quartet structure by the FMRP RGG box occurs at high RNA:peptide ratios and it is accompanied by an increase in the solution turbidity; thus it is not clear if this event is biologically significant. However, the finding that the FXR1P RGG box starts to unwind the G quartet structure of S3F-M2 RNA at only an 1:2 RNA:peptide ratio might be relevant considering that the FXR1P has been shown to exist in living cells as a homo-multimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the FMRP and FXR1P might compete for, and act differently on the G quartet RNA structure; however, it remains to be seen if this G quadruplex unwinding effect is observed for other FMRP G quartet forming RNA targets besides S3F-M2 and also for the full-length FMRP and FXR1P.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH grant GM074660-01 to M.-R.M.
