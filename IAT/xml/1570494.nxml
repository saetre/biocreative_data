Following entry into the host cell, the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA and subsequently integrated into the host genome as a chromatin template. The integrated proviral DNA, along with the specific chromatinized environment in which integration takes place allows for the coordinated regulation of viral transcription and replication. While the specific roles of and interplay between viral and host proteins have not been fully elucidated, numerous reports indicate that HIV-1 retains the ability for self-regulation via the pleiotropic effects of its viral proteins. Though viral transcription is fully dependent upon host cellular factors and the state of host activation, recent findings indicate a complex interplay between viral proteins and host transcription regulatory machineries including histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), and histone methyltransferases (HMTs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we describe the effect of Tat activated transcription at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border of the cell cycle and analyze the interaction of modified Tat with the chromatin remodeling complex, SWI/SNF.

The pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease is complex and multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Following infection, reverse transcriptase complexes synthesize a double stranded DNA molecule that is then incorporated into the host genome. A robust cellular and humoral immune response inhibits viral production within weeks. However, a chronic persistent infection in lymphoid tissue persists throughout the life (median period of 10&#x02013;20 years) of the infected individual. Several key HIV-1 and cellular proteins have been determined to be necessary for this course of infection, including the <italic>trans</italic>-activator Tat. Viral clones deficient in Tat do not effectively replicate <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, infected T cells quiescent at the G<sub>0 </sub>phase of the cell cycle (lacking cytokine signals) will not produce high titer virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The replication rate of integrated HIV-1 is largely controlled at the level of transcription. The HIV-1 LTR, present at both ends of the integrated viral genome, contains <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements necessary for transcription initiation from the 5' LTR and for polyadenylation of the viral transcripts in the 3' LTR. The core promoter of HIV-1 includes two NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites, three Sp1 binding sites, the TATA box, and the ligand-binding protein 1 (LBP-1)/YY1 site. There is also a repressor complex sequence (RCS) within the initiation site, which contains three binding motifs for LSF. YY1 and LSF cooperate to allow binding of YY1 to the RCS and subsequent recruitment of HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to cellular transcription factors, the activity of the HIV-1 promoter is strongly dependent on the viral <italic>trans</italic>-activator, Tat. Historically, the mechanism of action by Tat has been assigned to be at the level of initiation and elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The effect of Tat on pre-initiation, initiation, and elongation has been observed through a number of biochemical interactions, including physical binding to Sp1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], stabilization of the TFIID/TFIIA complex on the HIV-1 TATA box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], recruitment of a functional TATA-binding protein (TBP) or TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by a number of kinases, including TFIIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], hSpt5 which functions in transcription elongation as a stabilization factor of RNAPII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and binding of Tat directly to RNAPII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. More recently the role of Tat in transcription initiation has been revisited, where Tat enhanced recruitment of TBP has been observed resulting in activated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Tat activates the HIV LTR by binding to TAR and recruiting and activating cellular factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. One of the co-factors required for Tat activity is a protein kinase called TAK (Tat-associated kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] whose activity is stimulated by Tat. Activation of TAK (cdk9/cyclin T<sub>1</sub>) results in hyper-phosphorylation of the large subunit of the RNAPII CTD and activation of transcription elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Cdk9 is analogous to a component of a positive acting elongation factor (P-TEFb) isolated from Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which acts to stimulate promoter-paused RNAPII to enter into productive elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A histidine-rich stretch of cyclin T<sub>1 </sub>binds to the CTD of RNAPII, which is required for the subsequent expression of full-length transcripts from target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Cdk9 phosphorylation is required for high-affinity binding of Tat/P-TEFb to TAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>HIV-1 proviral DNA is organized into a higher order chromatin structure <italic>in vivo</italic>, which regulates viral expression by restricting access of the transcriptional machinery to the HIV-1 LTR. The primary chromatin structure of integrated HIV-1 has been characterized <italic>in vivo </italic>by the DNase-1 digestion method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Two chronically infected human cell lines, ACH<sub>2 </sub>(T-cell line) and U<sub>1 </sub>(promonocyte cell line), were analyzed by DNase-I digestion and four distinct DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS) were identified in the 5' LTR. It has been largely assumed that DHSs in the native chromatin are free of histones and allow unrestricted access to DNA-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The first site, DHS1, located at the 5' end of the integrated LTR, was detected only as a minor DHS in U<sub>1 </sub>cells. DHS2 and DHS3 are located in the U3 region, encompassing nt 223&#x02013;325 and nt 390&#x02013;449, respectively. The NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 binding sites, as well as the TATA box, are located in DHS2 and DHS3. DHS4 was found immediately downstream of the U5 region (nt 656&#x02013;720), where a cluster of potential transcription factor binding sites for AP-1, AP-3 like, DBF-1, and Sp1 are positioned. The location of the DHSs was also verified <italic>in vitro </italic>using the HIV-1 promoter reconstituted into chromatin by DNase-I footprinting analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, independent of the viral integration site, five nucleosomes (nuc-0 to nuc-4) are precisely positioned within the 5' LTR. In the transcriptionally silent provirus, these nucleosomes define two large nucleosome-free regions spanning nt -255 to -3 and +141 to +265. One nucleosome, nuc-1, is located between these two regions. The first nucleosome-free region in U3 contains many promoter/enhancer elements which are already occupied by transcriptional factors including repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. When cells are activated with TNF-&#x003b1; and TPA treatment or with the HDAC-specific inhibitors, trapoxin, Trichostatin A (TSA), or sodium butyrate, DHS3 and DHS4 are extended and nuc-1 is specifically remodeled. Using a ChIP assay, histone acetylation surrounding nuc-1 and the RCS was observed to be significantly increased following TSA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The disruption of nuc-1 occurred independent of transcription and was &#x003b1;-amanitin insensitive, suggesting that this chromatin remodeling was a pre-requisite for transcription, rather than a consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, the integrated proviral DNA, along with the specific chromatinized environment in which integration takes place allows for the coordinated regulation of viral transcription and replication. While the specific roles of and interplay between viral and host proteins have not been fully elucidated, numerous reports indicate that HIV-1 retains the ability for self-regulation via the pleiotropic effects of its viral proteins. Though viral transcription is fully dependent upon host cellular factors, recent findings indicate a complex interplay between viral proteins and host transcription and signaling machineries (i.e. HDACs, HATs, and other protein-modifying factors).</p><p>In the current manuscript, we describe the effect of Tat activated transcription at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border of the cell cycle and analyze the interaction of Tat with the chromatin remodeling complex, SWI/SNF. HIV-1 LTR DNA reconstituted into nucleosomes can be activated <italic>in vitro </italic>using various Tat expressing extracts. More specifically, optimal activated transcription was observed at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border of the cell cycle both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In an attempt to define protein complexes that are normally involved in HIV-1 transcription, we used an <italic>in vitro </italic>immobilized nucleosomal DNA assembly system in the presence of the G<sub>1</sub>/S extracts and pulled-down complexes followed by their identification using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In addition to known factors such as Sp1, TFIIB, and cdk9/cyclin T<sub>1</sub>, we also specifically detected the presence of acetylated Tat and members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Using a number of <italic>in vitro </italic>binding as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>ChIP assays, we detected the presence of both BRG1 and acetylated Tat in the same complex. Finally, we demonstrate that removal of nuc-1 resulted in accessibility of the HIV-1 LTR DNA to a restriction enzyme and activated transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of Tat activation at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border</title><p>We previously demonstrated, by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription analysis, that Tat-dependent transcription takes place in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We utilized cells that were transfected with either a control plasmid (pCEP4) or a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Tat plasmid (eTat), selected in hygromycin by single-cell dilution, and maintained in hygromycin. Whole-cell extracts were prepared from control and eTat cells for <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription assays using wild-type and mutant HIV-1 naked templates. Cells at late G<sub>1</sub>/early S contained 10-fold higher levels of transcriptional activity on the wild-type LTR template (LTR-TAR<sup>+</sup>) than on the TAR mutant template (LTR-TAR<sup>-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Our previous results were performed with HIV-1 naked LTR DNA; however, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the HIV-1 DNA is assembled into organized nucleosomal DNA and the presence of nucleosomes generally acts as an inhibitor of transcription. Therefore, to closely mimic the <italic>in vivo </italic>scenario, we decided to reconstitute HIV-1 LTR DNA into nucleosomes and use the templates in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reaction. Nucleosomes were assembled on the HIV-1 LTR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Following reconstitution, extracts from various stages of cell cycle were used in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reaction. To obtain a uniform population of cells, we treated both eTat and control cells first with hydroxyurea, released, treated with nocodazole, followed by release at various time points. Extracts were made from the control and eTat cell lines at G<sub>0</sub>, early G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>/S, late S, and G<sub>2 </sub>for <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription. Three types of DNA were used in these assays, including HIV-LTR-TAR wild-type, HIV-LTR-TAR mutant (TM26) (both assembled into chromatin) and Adenovirus-Luc plasmid (AdLuc) as a naked DNA control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Transcription from the WT HIV LTR was first observed with eTat extracts purified from the G<sub>1 </sub>phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, left panel, lane 2). Transcription was maximal at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border and declined during the S and G<sub>2 </sub>phases (lanes 4 and 5). Very little detectable transcription was observed with extracts obtained at the G<sub>0 </sub>(lane 1) or in control extracts. Furthermore, no transcription was observed when a TAR mutant template (TM26) was used (lanes 11&#x02013;15). These results indicate that HIV-1 transcription started in the early G<sub>1 </sub>phase (lane 2); however, a more robust activity was observed at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border (lane 3). In all cases ample transcription was observed using naked AdLuc DNA. All HIV-1 DNAs still contained core histones after transcription, indicating that nucleosomes were still present (bottom panel). These results indicate that robust Tat activated transcription begins at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border of the cell cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HIV chromatin transcription at various stages of the cell cycle</bold>. To obtain synchronized extracts, both eTat and control cells were first treated with hydroxyurea, released and then treated with nocodazole. Extracts were made from 1 h (G<sub>0</sub>), 3 h (early G<sub>1</sub>), 6 h (G<sub>1</sub>/S), 15 h (late S), and 21 h (G<sub>2</sub>) post-nocodazole release and used in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reaction.

We measured these proteins by a multiparametric flow cytometric approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. This technique allowed us to examine the accumulation of multiple proteins in individual cells, as opposed to immunoblotting, which determines the accumulation of proteins in a large, diverse cell population. Furthermore, the flow cytometric approach allows us to correlate this value with respect to the cell's position in the cycle by measuring DNA content and multiple analyses can be carried out in the same cell with different fluorescent markers. OM10.1 cells are a promyelocytic line containing a transcriptionally latent, single copy of wild-type HIV-1 integrated proviral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. For cell cycle analysis, these cells were initially arrested at G<sub>0 </sub>by feeding with serum starvation medium for three days. Cells were subsequently treated with TNF-&#x003b1; (10 ng/ml) for 2 h to induce virus, washed, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with complete medium. Samples (2/3) were collected at various time points and analyzed using flow cytometry. The remaining samples (1/3) were processed for RT-PCR using primers for Env and Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The positive controls, cyclin E (hallmark of G<sub>1</sub>/S transcription) and cyclin A (hallmark of S transcription), were detectable in OM10.1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). More importantly, HIV-1 proteins, namely Nef (from a doubly spliced transcript) and Env (from a singly spliced transcript), were detected starting at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase of the cell cycle. RT-PCR assays show that these samples display robust Env transcription at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, bottom panel). Propidium iodide staining of host DNA from various cell populations used in antibody staining and RT-PCR analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) demonstrated that the samples used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> were at particular phases of the cell cycle. These results are also consistent with our previous work where we showed that HLM-1 cells (HIV-1<sup>+</sup>/Tat<sup>-</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]), which contain a single copy of full-length HIV-1 provirus with a triple termination codon at the first AUG of the Tat gene, had dramatically reduced levels of Gag/p24 antigen production when arrested at G<sub>1</sub>/S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>HIV-1 Nef and Env expression in individual cells at various phases of the cell cycle</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>HIV-1 protein expression was monitored by flow cytometric analysis.

While the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying Tat dissociation from TAR RNA and its <italic>trans</italic>-activation of transcription on the integrated HIV-1 genome remain elusive, increasing evidence suggests that Tat activity requires association with several multiprotein complexes, which include the cyclin T<sub>1</sub>/cdk9 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and the HAT transcriptional coactivators, p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. The site of acetylation of Tat was mapped to a double-lysine motif in a highly conserved region (<sup>49</sup>RKKRRQ<sup>54</sup>) of the basic RNA-binding motif of Tat. Tat acetylation resulted in its dissociation from TAR RNA and promoted the formation of a multiprotein complex comprised of Tat and p/CAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Furthermore, we previously had shown that immobilized biotin Tat or acetylated Tat at positions 41, 50, and 51 could selectively pull-down distinct functional complexes including transcription-associated proteins, acetyltransferase-associated proteins, and kinase proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].</p><p>We confirmed by Western blotting that the unmodified peptide of Tat (aa 42&#x02013;54) bound cyclin T<sub>1 </sub>while the acetylated form of the Tat peptide bound BRG1. These results were confirmed using full length Tat protein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed that acetylated lyines 41, 50, and 51 of Tat are important for BRG1 binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Results presented in panel A used CEM extracts and results in panel B used purified cyclin T<sub>1</sub>/cdk9 and SWI/SNF complexes (containing BRG1). To further validate these findings, we decided to perform an <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assay using <sup>35</sup>S-Tat or <sup>35</sup>S-BRG1. Two independent BRG1 domains were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-Tat <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Nucleosomes were first assembled on biotinylated HIV-1 LTR DNA template and then immobilized using strepavidin agarose beads.

Active complexes were pulled-down, washed, ran on a 4&#x02013;20% SDS/PAGE, stained for the presence of histones and then western blotted for the presence of cyclin T<sub>1 </sub>or BRG1. Results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> indicate that the wild-type Tat acetylated by HAT was able to efficiently bind to BRG1, consistent with results from panel B, where there was no HIV-1 DNA present in the reaction. Finally, to address whether these interactions were functionally significant in a chromatin transcription setting, we utilized the G<sub>1</sub>/S extract from CEM cells in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reaction.

Naked AdLuc DNA served as an internal control for transcription. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, only acetylated Tat allowed for a robust transcription from the wild-type LTR (lane 3) and not the mutant TAR template (lane 7).

We first raised polyclonal antibodies against acetylated Tat using acetylated Tat peptides as antigens. These antibodies recognize Tat acetylation at lysine 41 or 50 and 51. Next, we transfected HLM-1 cells with a wild-type Tat plasmid (eTat). These cells are HIV-1<sup>+</sup>/Tat<sup>-</sup>, thus introduction of wild-type Tat allows for full <italic>trans</italic>-activation and viral progeny formation. When anti-acetyl-Tat antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, we consistently observed an association of acetylated Tat at regions where nuc-1 is located but not nuc-0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These data suggest that Tat is acetylated <italic>in vivo </italic>and is associated with the nuc-1 region of the HIV-1 promoter, which encompasses the transcription start site.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of BRG1 on HIV-1 transcription <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Tat recruitment of SWI/SNF to the HIV-1 LTR presumably plays a role in the ability of Tat to <italic>trans</italic>-activate the promoter and induce replication. To assess this possibility, RNA interference (RNAi) of BRG1 expression in HIV-1 infected cells was used. Here, we synthesized a series of wild-type and mutant siRNA against BRG1. We chose five oligonucleotides that span the 5' end, middle, and 3' end of the BRG1 mRNA. The sequences of the siRNA and the nucleotide position are listed in Materials and Methods and have previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The most optimal sequences had a GC content of between 30%-70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. To assess the importance of BRG1 in viral transcription, we utilized the HIV-1 chronically infected cell ACH<sub>2</sub>. Viral induction in ACH<sub>2 </sub>cells was achieved by treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, left panel). Addition of increasing amounts of wild-type BRG1 siRNA (a mixture of all five oligonucleotides electroporated into cells) resulted in a decrease in p24 expression. However, when mutant BRG1 siRNA was utilized, p24 expression and, hence HIV-1 progeny formation, was unaffected. Similar results were obtained in other chronically infected cells including OM10.1, 8E5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, right panels), and J1-1 as well as U<sub>1 </sub>(data not shown). BRG1 protein expression was also decreased as a result of the siRNA (wild-type) treatment; mutant siRNAs did not affect BRG1 protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, bottom panel). These results indicate that BRG1 expression is critical for HIV-1 replication.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Suppression of BRG1 expression by RNAi inhibits HIV-1 replication</bold>.

We transfected a BRG1 eukaryotic expression construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] into C33A cells that had an HIV-1 reporter construct stably integrated into its genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Cells were either left untreated, stimulated with PMA, treated with the HDAC inhibitor TSA, or exposed to both PMA and TSA. Following harvesting, a ChIP assay was performed with antibodies against BRG1. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR with primers specific for nuc-0 and nuc-1. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> shows that BRG1 does interact with the nuc-0 region <italic>in vivo </italic>and that this interaction is dependent upon presence of both PMA and TSA (panel A top, lanes 7 and 11). The presence of BRG1 on nuc-0 was not Tat dependent (lanes 8&#x02013;10). However, BRG1 was present on nuc-1 in the presence of PMA or TSA (panel A bottom, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). More importantly, BRG1 was present on nuc-1 in unstimulated cells in the presence of Tat (compare lanes 4 and 8). A Tat 50/51 mutant did not recruit BRG1 to the nuc-1 site (data not shown). Finally, since BRG1 is recruited to the nuc-1 region of the HIV-1 promoter in response to Tat expression alone, we investigated whether this recruitment stimulated transcription. C33A cells containing a stably integrated HIV-1 luciferase reporter construct were transiently transfected with the BRG1, Tat, or BRG1 and Tat expression constructs or a control vector (Mock). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> shows that without BRG1 or Tat; PMA, TSA or PMA and TSA stimulated HIV-1 luciferase transcription anywhere from 3- to 14-fold. However, in the presence of both Tat and BRG1 the stimulation increased from 28- to 89-fold above background, implying that to recover robust activated transcription, the integrated HIV-1 promoter requires both Tat and BRG1. This also indicates that a factor required for a high level of HIV-1 reporter expression is limiting in C33A cells. Hence, we concluded that Tat acetylation, followed by BRG1 recruitment, plays an important role in stabilizing the interaction between SWI/SNF and HIV-1 chromatin resulting in remodeling of nuc-1 and activated viral transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>BRG1 and Tat associate with chromatinized HIV-1 promoter in C33A cells at nuc-1</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>The BRG1/hBrm-deficient cervical carcinoma cell line C33A was used for these experiments and maintained under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

The HIV-1 genome was first analyzed for the presence of DNase-I hypersensitive sites using an indirect end-labeling technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Three well characterized, chronically infected cell lines, ACH<sub>2</sub>, 8E5, and U<sub>1</sub>, were used to define nucleosome boundaries. Five major hypersensitive sites were identified, some of which were common among the three cell lines. They included DNase-I hypersensitive sites at the 5' LTR, namely HS2 (nt 223&#x02013;325), HS3 (nt 390&#x02013;449), and HS4 (nt 656&#x02013;720) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Both HS3 and HS4 are at the 5' and 3' boundaries of nucleosome-1 (nuc-1), respectively. Nuc-1 is located at the transcriptional start site and poses a block to activated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. However, when activated transcription occurs, there is a disappearance of the periodic DNA protection pattern following digestion with DNase-I and reveals a profile of digested template essentially identical to naked DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, nuc-1 is disrupted when activated transcription takes place in all three cell lines tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>].</p><p>We then determined whether BRG1 and/or acetylated Tat are responsible for removing nuc-1, and whether we could faithfully mimic the <italic>in vivo </italic>data in an <italic>in vitro </italic>remodeling assay. We used two LTR sequences spanning 800 bp from the 5' U3 region into the Gag region. Sequences from clades B and E were PCR amplified with biotin-labeled primers, assembled into nucleosomes, and mixed with CEM G<sub>1</sub>/S extracts for <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription. To facilitate chromatin remodeling, we also added SWI/SNF, Tat, or acetylated Tat to the reaction. Following transcription, immobilized templates were pulled-down, washed, and used for restriction enzyme digestion (<italic>Afl II</italic>). <italic>Afl II </italic>cleaves at position 520 at the end of the R (TAR) region. The <italic>Afl II </italic>site is normally blocked if nuc-1 is present; however, the site becomes accessible if the nucleosome is remodeled or removed. Therefore, if <italic>Afl II </italic>is able to cleave the DNA, then a 3' fragment consisting of U5 and Gag will be released into the supernatant and the fragment can be detected by Southern analysis using a probe spanning the U5/Gag region. A diagram of the experiment is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> while the results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>. The presence of CEM G<sub>1</sub>/S extracts and SWI/SNF allowed a low level of digestion with <italic>Afl II</italic>, and Tat increased accessibility by 3-fold (panel B, second line). However, in the presence of SWI/SNF and acetylated Tat, <italic>Afl II </italic>digestion was increased 13- to 15-fold for the LTRs of clades B and E (panel B, third line). The increase in digestion was specific to a combination of SWI/SNF and acetylated Tat, since neither complex alone dramatically increased accessibility. Finally, in the presence of a RNAPII inhibitor, &#x003b1;-amanitin, there was no <italic>Afl II </italic>digestion, indicating that active RNAPII transcription was needed for nuc-1 removal and <italic>Afl II </italic>accessibility. No increase in <italic>Afl II </italic>digestion was observed on the TAR mutant template (panel B, right side). Collectively, these results indicate that <italic>in vitro </italic>reconstitution of at least few nucleosomes on the LTR mimics the <italic>in vivo </italic>positioning of HIV-1 nucleosomes as seen in latently infected cells, and that the presence of SWI/SNF and acetylated Tat are sufficient to remodel/remove the blocking nuc-1 nucleosome on the HIV-1 LTR.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of SWI/SNF, Tat, or acetylated Tat on restriction enzyme accessibility</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>A diagram of the transcription experiment.

Various complexes, including HATs, covalently modify nucleosomal histone proteins through acetylation while ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers alter the chromatin structure via ATP hydrolysis. These modifications and alterations of chromatin structure increase DNA accessibility to transcription factors and activators thus promoting transcription initiation and efficient elongation. A more current view is that activators must first recruit chromatin remodelers in order to create a chromatin environment permissive for pre-inititation complex (PIC) assembly. Recently, it has become evident that other factors, such as the chromatin structure of the gene promoter and the phase of the cell cycle, also govern how chromatin remodelers collaborate with each other to control steps before, during, or after PIC assembly.</p><p>Although the precise nucleosome position of the integrated HIV-1 LTR is well characterized, there is little data about how this primary structure is folded into the chromatin fiber or other secondary structures (&#x0003e;30 nm fiber) and how these structures influence HIV-1 latency and transcriptional activation. Few studies have shown that the integration site and its corresponding chromatin environment affect HIV-1 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Sequence analysis and mapping of HIV-1 integration sites in the cellular genome has provided evidence that chromatin structure plays an important role in subsequent HIV-1 transcription. Analysis of the site of integration during productive HIV-1 infection has shown that integration preferentially occurs in areas rich in retrotransposable Alu elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] and transcriptionally active genes (69% of 524 integration sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. These areas are characterized by increased chromatin accessibility and the accumulation of factors important for chromatin remodeling. These data are also consistent with earlier observations that sites which are preferentially accessible to DNase-I are favored for integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. However, a small fraction of cells (less than 1%) exhibited post-integration latency, a state of transcriptional silencing.</p><p>Many reports in the last several years have linked Tat <italic>trans</italic>-activation to chromatin remodeling <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. When transcription is activated by Tat in a LTR integrated cell line, the chromatin associated with sequences immediately downstream of the transcription start site become accessible to nucleases and the nucleosome adjacent to the transcription start site (nuc-1) becomes disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Similarly, transfection of Tat into Jurkat (Tat<sup>-</sup>) clones containing a integrated single HIV-1 mini-genome activated HIV-1 transcription and resulted in the disruption of nuc-1 to the same extent as TSA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of Tat from human cells identified a protein complex with HAT activity, suggesting that HATs are targeted to the HIV-1 promoter by Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription from chromatinized templates indicated that Tat <italic>trans</italic>-activation is synergistic with Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, HIV-1 LTR lacking Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B sites do not undergo chromatin remodeling and are unresponsive to Tat <italic>trans</italic>-activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Several other groups have observed that Tat is able to form a ternary complex with several HAT complexes, including p300/CBP, p/CAF, TAFII250, and Tip60, targeting these HAT proteins to the viral promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>].</p><p>Similar to our findings, two recent reports have shown the involvement of SWI/SNF as a cofactor for Tat activation of the HIV promoter. Tr&#x000e9;and et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>] showed that, via its arginine-rich motif, Tat was able to interact with Brm, the enzymatic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. This interaction was regulated by Tat acetylation at lysine 50. Tat recruited the SWI/SNF complex to the LTR <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to the activation of the integrated HIV-1 promoter. Another recent report from the Verdin lab also showed similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>]. Knockdown of INI-1 and BRG1, two components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, suppressed Tat-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-activation, and cells deficient in INI-1 or BRG1 exhibited defective Tat <italic>trans</italic>-activation. Tat was found to be in complex with several SWI/SNF subunits, and the complex synergized with p300 to activate the HIV-1 promoter. A recent study from the Trono lab revealed that INI1 uses its repeat domains (Rpt 1 and 2) to bind and subsequently enhance the <italic>trans</italic>-activation potential of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. While INI1 is dispensable for viral transduction, their findings suggest that incoming PIC might recruit INI1 to promote chromatin remodeling at the HIV-1 promoter and enhance transcription.</p><p>It is interesting to note that INI-1 (Snf5/BAF47) is also a potent tumor suppressor whose mechanism of action is largely unknown. Tumor suppressor activity of Snf5 depends on its regulation of cell cycle progression; Snf5 inactivation leads to aberrant up-regulation of E2F targets and increased levels of p53 that are accompanied by apoptosis, polyploidy, and growth arrest. Furthermore, conditional mouse models demonstrate that inactivation of p16Ink4a or Rb does not accelerate tumor formation in Snf5 conditional mice, whereas mutation of p53 leads to a dramatic acceleration of tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to further determine if the binding of Tat to the SWI/SNF complex (either through INI-1 or BRG1) could somehow control the expression of cell cycle genes (i.e., G<sub>1</sub>/S genes) and alter their activity. Current experiments are in progress to address this critical issue and whether G<sub>1</sub>/S genes such as various cyclins, including the cyclin E and T promoters, are modulated by the Tat/SWI/SNF complex.</p><p>We and others have shown that Tat can be acetylated at lysines 28, 50, and 51 leading to altered interactions between Tat and TAR, p300/CBP, and p/CAF, as well as activation of viral transcription and replication. They collectively support the notion that Tat first recruits p300/CBP to the HIV-1 promoter during initiation. Tat acetylated at lysine 50 then recruits p/CAF, which subsequently acetylates Tat at lysine 28. Acetylation of Tat at lysines 50 and/or 51 promotes the dissociation of Tat from TAR RNA and contributes to stimulation of transcription elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. The acetylated form of Tat is released from TAR, which can now bind to BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We hypothesize that the interaction of Tat with BRG1 facilitates SWI/SNF to remodel downstream nucleosomes allowing for further transcription of the HIV-1 genome. We propose that the major function of the interactions between Tat and bromodomain proteins is to modify HIV-1 chromatin such that the LTR becomes responsive to Tat and allows ample and rapid activated transcription to occur. This also may set the stage for re-initiation of transcription where pre-made (activated) complexes may be recycled for HIV-1 activated transcription. Future experiments will address these particular issues along with Tat's effect on the remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complex at the proximal promoter and ORF regions of HIV-1 genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>ACH<sub>2 </sub>and 8E5 cells are both HIV-1-infected lymphocytic cells, with a single integrated wild-type copy (ACH<sub>2</sub>) and a single integrated copy containing a defective reverse transcriptase (8E5) in CEM (12D7) cells.
