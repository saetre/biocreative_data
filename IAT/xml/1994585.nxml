Recent studies using lineage-specific deletion of the <italic>Ptpn6</italic> gene demonstrated a B cell-intrinsic function of SHP1 in limiting the size of the B1a B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Pao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

How these intracellular signaling pathways are used by cell surface molecular interactions to regulate the size of B1 B cell lineage is largely unknown. In particular, targeted mutation of genes encoding several potential membrane proteins that can associate with SHP1, including those of CD72 and CD22, did not substantially impact the development of B1 B cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-OKeefe1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Otipoby1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Pan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Sato1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Of particular interest are members of the sialic acid-binding, immunoglobulin-like lectin family, or Siglec, many of which have ITIM Motifs for association with SHP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Crocker1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Siglec G and its human orthologue Siglec 10 appears to have several alternative splicing variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Li1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Munday1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Kitzig1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Whitney1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. All variants, however, shared the same cytoplasmic domain with the ITIM motif capable of interacting with SHP-1, which was known to be a negative regulator for B1B cell lineages. Since the function and expression of Siglec G have not been characterized in detail, we produced Siglec G-deficient mice with a knockin of GFP open-reading frame to report its expression. Our results revealed that Siglec G is expressed at high levels at essentially all stages of B cell development and significant but reduced levels in other cell lineages. Importantly, targeted mutation of the Siglec G gene dramatically expanded the B1a B cell lineages postnatally, by increasing NF&#x003ba;B activation. Our data revealed Siglec G is a molecular checkpoint that limits the postnatal expansion of B1a B cells by repressing NF&#x003ba;B activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>GFP-knock-in mice reveal wide-spread expression of <italic>Siglecg</italic> in multiple lineages</title><p>Previous studies using flow cytometry have suggested that Siglec 10 may be expressed in subsets of human leukocytes including eosinophils, monocytes and a minor population of natural killer-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Munday1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the alternative splicing, it is unclear whether these data reflect specific alternative spliced variants. To investigate the cell lineage in which the <italic>Siglecg</italic> locus is active while studying the function of the <italic>Siglecg</italic> in vivo, we replaced essentially all coding exons of the <italic>Siglecg</italic> sequence with a GFP coding sequence, as diagramed in Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000997.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>. The genomic DNA clones were isolated from C57BL/6j DNA library for homologous recombination in the ES cells of C57BL/6 origin.

Therefore, the expansion of the B1a B cell compartment can theoretically be attributed to either increased fetal production or postnatal production. Our analysis of adult progenitor cells in the bone marrow and fetal livers indicated a substantial increase in the B1a B progenitors in the bone marrow, but not in the fetal or new born liver. Consistent with the increased B1a B progenitor cells, the <italic>Siglecg-</italic>deficient bone marrow are more efficient in constituting the B1a B cells. These data, together with the fact that neither increased proliferation nor decreased apoptosis explains the expansion of B1a B cells in the peritoneal cavity, supports the notion that postnatal expansion of the B1a compartment is responsible for the expansion of B1a cells in the <italic>Siglecg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>mice.

Such requirement, however, seems to be reflected in competition with progenitor cells from the WT host, but not with other cell lineage, as the relative number of B cells are the same when the <italic>Siglecg-</italic>deficient mice were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><italic>Siglecg</italic> is a negative regulator of NF<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activity in peritoneal B cells: similarity with <italic>Shp1</italic></title><p>Our comparison between WT and <italic>Siglecg-</italic>deficient ex vivo peritoneal lavage revealed that activation of a number of signaling pathways, including AKT, STAT, Erk, P38 and JNK was not affected by the mutation (data not shown).

Since the activation correlates with the I&#x003ba;B phosporlation, it is likely that the conical NF&#x003ba;B pathway is being activated. Moreover, since the IKK is responsible for I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation, we used the IKK inhibitor VI to block NF&#x003ba;B activation in order to study the significance of this activation in B1a cell expansion in the peritoneal cavity.

These data clearly indicated that expansion of B1a B cells in the peritoneal cavity uses a mechanism that is not employed to maintain the number of spleen B1a B cells. The selective expansion of B1a B cells from the mutant peritoneal cavity suggests that the expansion requires both unique checkpoint in the specific cell lineage and specific stimuli in the peritoneal cavity.

Thirdly, in bone marrow chimera mice, the mutant bone marrow shows a remarkable advantage in reconstituting the peritoneal B1a B cells, while displaying a disadvantage in constituting spleen B1a B cell compartment. These similarities in functional defects raise the possibility that the gene has a similar function within B cell compartment. Since Siglc10, the Siglec G orthologue in human, has been shown to be associated with Shp1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Kitzig1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Whitney1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the simplest hypothesis is that Shp1 works down-stream of Siglec G in limiting the controlled expansion of B1a subset. This hypothesis has the potential to unify observations made from mice with genetic defects of <italic>Siglecg</italic>, <italic>Ptpn6</italic>, and <italic>NF&#x003ba;B1</italic> and <italic>C-rel</italic>. Since mutation of <italic>Siglecg</italic> increases the titer of anti-DNA antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and since deletion of Shp1 in B cells causes autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Pao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, the balance of the Siglecg signaling will likely be important in the proper tuning of the B1a function in innate immunity against infection vs. autoimmune side effect. Given recent advances in pharmaceutical targeting of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000997-Park1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, our study suggests a new approach in selective tuning of innate immunity and autoimmunity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>Siglecg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice using C57BL/6 ES cells</title><p>The production of the <italic>Siglecg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice is carried out by the Ingenious Research Laboratory, Inc.

Briefly, a &#x0223c;9.8 kb region used to construct the targeting vector was first sub cloned from a positively identified BAC clone using a homologous recombination-based technique. The region was designed such that the short homology arm (SA) extends 1.8 kb 3&#x02032; to exon 11. The long homology arm (LA) ends in exon 2 just before the ATG and is &#x0223c;8.8 kb long. The GFP/Neo cassette (Neo is flanked by both loxP and FRT sites) is inserted before the ATG of Exon 2 and replaces &#x0223c;5 kb of the gene sequence including exons 3&#x02013;11.</p><p>Ten micrograms of the targeting vector was linearized by AscI and then transfected by electroporation of iTL C57/Bl6 embryonic stem cells. After selection in G418, surviving clones were expanded for PCR analysis to identify recombinant ES clones. Primers, A1, 2 and 3 were designed downstream (3&#x02032;) to the short homology arm (SA) outside the region used to generate the targeting construct. PCR reactions using A1, 2 or 3 with the N1 primer at the 5&#x02032; end of the Neo cassette amplify 2.0, 2.0 and 2.1kb fragments respectively. The control PCR reaction was done using AT1 and AT2, which is at the 5&#x02032; end of the SA inside the region used to create the targeting construct. This amplifies a band of 1.7 kb. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000997.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, Individual clone was screened with A1/N1, A2/N1 and A3/N1 primers.
