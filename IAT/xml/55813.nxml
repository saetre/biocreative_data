These include the activation of DNA repair and intracellular checkpoint signalling pathways, which serve to delay cell cycle progression while DNA damage persists. Genetic strategies, principally using the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and the distantly related fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, have identified a large number of radiation sensitive (<italic>rad</italic>) mutants that are defective in one or more of these protective pathways. Such studies have provided an increasingly detailed view of the roles of the corresponding Rad proteins in DNA damage responses. Many of the <italic>rad</italic> gene products are required for DNA repair processes, specifically nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombinational repair, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and post-replication gap-filling. Other Rad proteins have primary roles in checkpoint responses. The DNA damage checkpoint components partially overlap with those of the S-M checkpoint, which delays progression into or through mitosis when chromosomal DNA is not fully replicated. The extent of this overlap is clearest in <italic>S.pombe</italic> where, following either DNA damage or inhibition of replication, a common set of &#x02018;checkpoint Rad&#x02019; proteins transduce checkpoint signals, which are presumed to be generated following the detection of abnormal DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c2">2</xref>). Defects in the checkpoint Rad pathway allow progression into mitosis in the absence of complete DNA replication or in the presence of DNA strand breaks, giving rise to a characteristic &#x02018;cut&#x02019; (<underline>c</underline>ell <underline>u</underline>ntimely <underline>t</underline>orn) phenotype.</p><p> For several gene products the distinction between functions in DNA repair, in checkpoint arrest or in recovery from such arrest is not straightforward. This is the case for the product of the <italic>SGS1</italic> gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, and that of <italic>rqh1</italic> (also known as <italic>hus2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rad12</italic>), its homologue in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. These non-essential genes encode DNA helicases that are of particular interest because their human counterparts BLM and WRN are mutated in Bloom&#x02019;s and Werner&#x02019;s syndromes, disorders characterised in part by increased cancer incidence and premature ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c3">3</xref>). Sgs1 and Rqh1 are required for maintenance of normal levels of resistance to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), to UV light and to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>). The radiation sensitivity of <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutants can be interpreted in terms of a role for the corresponding proteins in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>). In <italic>S.pombe</italic> this repair pathway appears also to involve the checkpoint Rad proteins, together with their effector, the protein kinase Cds1, and the homologous recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>). Sgs1, Rqh1 and BLM are also required to prevent unscheduled mitotic recombination, either in the presence of DNA replication inhibitors or in the absence of any perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c9">9</xref>).</p><p> In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, a second DNA helicase, Srs2, appears to be functionally related to Sgs1. Like <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants, cells lacking Srs2 are sensitive to DNA damaging agents and display elevated levels of mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, simultaneous deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> (also known as <italic>RADH</italic>) and <italic>SGS1</italic> results in a dramatic reduction in cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c11">11</xref>). This has been attributed to a role for these helicases in DNA replication, a function also recently ascribed to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> BLM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c12">12</xref>). An alternative, but related, view is that simultaneous loss of Sgs1 and Srs2 results in lethal levels of aberrant recombination. This view is supported by the observation that inactivation of the homologous recombination pathway by deletion of the <italic>RAD51</italic> gene substantially suppresses the growth defect seen in <italic>sgs1</italic><italic>srs2</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c13">13</xref>).</p><p> Although Srs2 is structurally related to bacterial DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c14">14</xref>), orthologues of <italic>S.cerevisiae SRS2</italic> have not so far been described in other eukaryotes. Here, we describe the identification and characterisation of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> gene most closely related to <italic>SRS2</italic>. Our data lead us to conclude that this fission yeast gene is required for maintenance of normal levels of resistance to DNA damaging agents, and that in some aspects its function resembles <italic>S.cerevisiae SRS2</italic>. Nonetheless, genetic interactions between <italic>S.pombe</italic><italic>srs2</italic> and the recombination pathway differ from those of <italic>SRS2 </italic>in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting significant divergence of activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Database searches</title><p>Searches to identify Srs2-related sequences in <italic>S.pombe</italic> were performed using the Sanger Centre BLAST server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.sanger.ac.uk&#x0002f;Projects&#x0002f;S&#x0005f;pombe&#x0002f;blast&#x0005f;server.shtml">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.sanger.ac.uk&#x0002f;Projects&#x0002f;S&#x0005f;pombe&#x0002f;blast&#x0005f;server.shtml</ext-link>). &#x003a8;-BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;cgi-bin&#x0002f;BLAST&#x0002f;nph-psi&#x0005f;blast">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;cgi-bin&#x0002f;BLAST&#x0002f;nph-psi&#x0005f;blast</ext-link>) searches were used to identify similarities between Srs2 and proteins in the Swiss-Prot database.

Among all the putative ATP-dependent DNA helicases in the Swiss-Prot database, the hypothetical <italic>S.pombe</italic> protein sequence was most closely related to that of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Srs2. We consequently refer to this <italic>SRS2</italic>-like <italic>S.pombe</italic> gene as <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, in deference to the established <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> nomenclature. The C-terminal regions of the two Srs2 sequences lacked significant similarity either to each other or to other known proteins.</p><p> The <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene encodes a predicted protein of 887 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular weight of 101 061. Homologous recombination with a PCR-generated fragment was used to place an HA epitope tag sequence in-frame with the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>srs2</italic> open reading frame. Western blotting demonstrated the expression of the HA-tagged Srs2 protein, and indicated that there was no obvious change in the abundance or electrophoretic mobility of this protein after exposure of <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells to HU or the radiomimetic drug bleomycin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f1">1</xref>B). Consistent with the calculated molecular weight, HA-tagged Srs2 had a migration appropriate to a protein of just over 100 kDa.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> causes hyper-recombination and sensitivity to DNA damage</title><p>As a first step towards determining the function of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, one copy of the gene was replaced with the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker in a <italic>ura4-D18</italic> diploid strain and, after induction of meiosis, tetrads were dissected. Haploid ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progeny segregated 2:2, indicating that the <italic>srs2</italic> gene is not essential for growth. The ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>srs2</italic>-deleted (<italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;) progeny had plating efficiencies and growth rates similar to those of their <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (ura<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) counterparts and to <italic>rqh1</italic>-deleted (<italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394;) cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>A and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>).</p><p> We next compared the sensitivites of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells to agents that inhibit DNA replication or induce DNA damage. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic><italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells were mildly sensitive to HU, although not as sensitive as <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells, as judged by continuous growth on agar containing HU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>A). The <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; strain lost &#x0003e;90&#x00025; cell viability by 8 h exposure to HU in liquid culture, as judged by colony formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>B). In contrast, there was no significant loss of viability in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain after short-term HU treatment. The sensitivity of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells grown on agar containing HU therefore presumably reflects a requirement for Srs2 during continuous exposure to HU.</p><p> There was no significant loss of viability in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain after exposure to 50 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup> UV, a dose sufficient to cause a 90&#x00025; loss of viability of <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>C). At higher doses, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells were significantly UV sensitive (&#x0223c;90&#x00025; loss of viability at 200 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup>) in comparison with a <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> control, but were far less sensitive than <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells. Microscopic examination of cells 14 h after UV treatment (200 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup>) showed that wild-type controls had regained a normal morphology by this time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>D). In comparison, UV-treated <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells displayed a variety of defects, including cell elongation, aberrant nuclear morphology and unequal chromosome segregation. In some cases the highly elongated cells contained a single mass of chromatin bisected by a septum. In the case of <italic>rqh1</italic> mutants, this &#x02018;late cut&#x02019; phenotype reflects failure to resume cell cycle progression faithfully after UV-induced cell cycle arrest, which explains the cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>). Both <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains showed significant sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and to the radiomimetic drug bleomycin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>E). In each case the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain displayed a sensitivity intermediate to those of the wild-type and <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; strains.</p><p> Sensitivity to DNA damage in <italic>rqh1</italic> and <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants is associated with elevated levels of mitotic recombination. In order to address whether or not the same is true for <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells, <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; stable diploid strains were constructed containing the <italic>ade6-M26 </italic>and <italic>ade6-L469</italic> heteroalleles. Reciprocal recombination or gene conversion between these alleles can lead to the generation of ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progeny, and the frequency with which these arise therefore provides a convenient index of mitotic recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>). Using this approach, we found that the spontaneous recombination rate in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; diploid strain was elevated &#x0223c;12-fold with respect to the wild-type control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>F).</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rqh1</italic> causes a dramatic growth defect</title><p>As simultaneous mutation of budding yeast <italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> results in lethality, we were interested to see whether there might be an analogous interaction between the corresponding genes in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. A diploid strain was constructed in which one allele of <italic>srs2</italic> was disrupted by the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker and one allele of <italic>rqh1</italic> was disrupted by the <italic>kanMX6</italic> cassette, conferring resistance to the neomycin analogue G418. Dissection of ascospores from this strain following induction of meiosis showed that, as expected, haploid segregants bearing either the <italic>srs2::ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or the <italic>rqh1::kanMX6</italic> allele were able to grow and form colonies normally. From 90 tetrads dissected, the numbers of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; segregant colonies visible after 3 days growth at 30&#x000b0;C were 78, 76 and 80, respectively. These numbers are close to the 90 that would be expected for independently segregating markers, and indicate that there was only a slight overall loss of spore viability attributable to heterozygosity at the <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rqh1</italic> loci in the diploid. In contrast, only 14 <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; segregant colonies were visible after 7 days growth, and these formed only extremely slowly growing microcolonies. Microscopic examination showed that many of the cells in these slowly growing colonies were highly elongated, suggesting that one or more aspects of cell cycle progression are defective when both Rqh1 and Srs2 are absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f3">3</xref>A). DAPI staining of these cells showed that cell and nuclear morphologies were relatively normal in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; single mutants, although some of the cells in each of these strains were somewhat elongated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f3">3</xref>B). In line with their poor overall viability, the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;<italic> rqh1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants exhibited a variety of aberrant morphologies, including highly elongated cells, &#x02018;cut&#x02019; cells and others with apparently much reduced nuclear DNA content. The overall appearance of these cells was broadly similar to that of UV-treated <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; single mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>D).

Diploid strains heterozygous for deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> and for deletion of <italic>rhp51</italic>, <italic>rad22</italic> or <italic>rhp54</italic> were constructed (see Materials and Methods). Dissection of ascospores following induction of meiosis provided independent confirmation that there is a synthetic interaction between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>A). Of 108 tetrads dissected from the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; heterozygous diploid, only 13 spores gave rise to viable haploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; colonies (in contrast to the 108 that would be expected for a cross involving two unlinked markers), and all of these grew very slowly. The severity of this synthetic effect with <italic>srs2</italic> was if anything even more extreme in the cases of <italic>rad22</italic> and <italic>rhp54</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>B and C), although spore viability was only 64&#x00025; even in <italic>rhp54</italic>&#x00394; single mutants. Of 108 tetrads dissected from the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; heterozygous diploid, and 126 dissected from the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rhp54</italic>&#x00394; heterozygous diploid, one and zero spores, respectively, gave rise to doubly mutant haploid microcolonies. Thus, <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells lacking Srs2 are dependent on the homologous recombination pathway for maintenance of viability.</p><p> Genetic interactions between <italic>rqh1</italic> and homologous recombination genes were also examined in further detail. An earlier study demonstrated that the UV sensitivities of <italic>rqh1</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> or <italic>rhp54</italic> mutants were not additive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>). Similarly, we found that <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rhp54</italic>&#x00394; mutants grew only slightly more slowly than the single <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>D and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>), although their plating efficiencies were somewhat reduced. A much more pronounced synthetic interaction was seen on combining <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; with <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394;, however. Thus, the doubling time of a <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; strain was almost twice that of a <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; single mutant, and the plating efficiency was decreased almost 5-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>D and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>).</p><p> The epistatic relationship between <italic>rqh1</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rhp54</italic> with respect to UV sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>) has been interpreted in terms of an involvement of the products of these genes in a common pathway of DNA damage tolerance. The modest UV sensitivity of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>C) and the synthetic interactions between <italic>srs2</italic> and homologous recombination genes in the absence of exogenous DNA damage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;C) suggested that <italic>srs2 </italic>is unlikely to participate in such a pathway, at least not to the same extent as <italic>rqh1</italic>. In line with this interpretation, the UV sensitivity conferred by <italic>srs2</italic> deletion was additive with that resulting from deletion of <italic>rhp51</italic>, required for recombinational repair, or <italic>rad13</italic>, which is essential for the NER pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f6">6</xref>). By these criteria it would appear that <italic>srs2</italic> is required for a pathway of UV damage repair that is neither the recombination pathway nor NER.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>srs2</italic> cannot compensate for deletion of <italic>rqh1</italic></title><p>If the predicted DNA helicase activity of Srs2 were functionally related to that of Rqh1, overexpression of Srs2 might be sufficient to suppress defects seen in the absence of Rqh1. To address this point, PCR-mediated gene disruption was used to replace the promoter of the <italic>srs2</italic> gene in its normal chromosomal context with the thiamine-repressible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter, at the same time introducing an HA epitope tag sequence fused in-frame to the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>srs2</italic> open reading frame (see Materials and Methods). Removal of thiamine from the medium led to readily detectable levels of HA-Srs2 after 16 h growth at 30&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f7">7</xref>A). In addition to the full-length, HA-tagged protein, a number of smaller species were detected, the most prominent of which migrated at &#x0223c;35 kDa. Since the epitope tag is at the N-terminus, these shorter species most likely represent degradation products. Comparison with levels of Srs2-HA expressed from the <italic>srs2</italic> promoter in its normal chromosomal context indicated that the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter-driven gene was overexpressed &#x0223c;15-fold in comparison with endogenous <italic>srs2</italic>, but haploid HA-Srs2-expressing cells were not UV sensitive, suggesting that the overproduced protein is functional (S.W.Wang and C.Norbury, unpublished results). This level of srs2 overexpression had no effect on the UV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f7">7</xref>B) or HU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f7">7</xref>C) sensitivity of a <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; strain, however, indicating that Srs2 is incapable of performing the function of Rqh1 in response to these agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> fails to suppress the lethality of <italic>top3</italic> deletion</title><p>We showed previously that the lethality resulting from deletion of the <italic>top3</italic> gene encoding <italic>S.pombe</italic> topoisomerase III can be suppressed by deletion of <italic>rqh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c24">24</xref>).

Although structural and functional homologues of <italic>SGS1</italic> have been identified in eukaryotic species as diverse as yeasts and mammals, this report is the first to describe an <italic>SRS2</italic>-like gene function in any eukaryote other than <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The completion of genome sequencing projects will make it possible to establish whether or not Srs2-like proteins exist in non-fungal eukaryotic species, but at this stage it has not been possible to identify clear candidates among the available <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> or human sequences (S.-W.Wang and C.Norbury, unpublished observations). The bacterial helicases most closely related to Srs2 (those of the PcrA family) are essential for DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c26">26</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> an essential role for Srs2 and Sgs1 in chromosomal replication has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c11">11</xref>), but such a role is difficult to reconcile with the observation that the <italic>srs2 sgs1</italic> double mutant phenotype can be suppressed by simultaneous inactivation of the homologous recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>). BLAST searches show that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Srs2 amino acid sequence is significantly more similar to the bacterial members of this family than is <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Srs2. This could indicate that the common ancestral yeast contained two diverging Srs2 isoforms, only one of which is retained in each of the modern species. Other explanations, such as horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to an <italic>S.pombe</italic> ancestor, or more rapid sequence divergence in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, cannot be ruled out however.</p><p> We have shown that Srs2 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> is required to maintain the normal level of resistance to UV irradiation, as is its counterpart in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The precise nature of this protective function is not yet clear. A cell cycle checkpoint role was proposed recently for <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c27">27</xref>), but we currently have no indication that Srs2 has an analogous checkpoint function in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. Unlike the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> protein, <italic>S.pombe</italic> Srs2 was not phosphorylated in a checkpoint-dependent manner, as far as it was possible to judge by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f1">1</xref>B). In addition, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells, like <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells, became substantially elongated after UV irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>D), suggesting that establishment of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> DNA damage checkpoint is not Srs2 dependent. Instead, like Rqh1, Srs2 may be involved in a damage tolerance pathway that involves bypass of DNA damage by replication forks, reversal of cell cycle arrest and&#x0002f;or suppression of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>). The substantially elevated level of spontaneous recombination seen in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>F) would be compatible with such a role. Although elevated recombination was also seen on deletion of <italic>rqh1</italic>, this was not intrinsic, but dependent on inhibition of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c4">4</xref>).</p><p> An alternative interpretation of the data would be that Srs2, like Rad6 and Rad18 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, functions in a post-replication gap-filling repair pathway. Indeed, the <italic>SRS2</italic> locus was first identified through dominant mutations capable of suppressing the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c28">28</xref>). In this case, the hyper-recombination phenotype seen on <italic>srs2</italic> deletion could be attributable to an increased reliance on a recombinational pathway of post-replication repair, while simultaneous inactivation of this alternative pathway would give rise to the observed lethality or slow growth phenotype. A very recent study concluded that the synthetic lethality observed in <italic>S.cerevisiae srs2 rad54</italic> strains was attributable to activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c29">29</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether or not inactivation of this checkpoint pathway can suppress the lethality seen in the equivalent double mutant in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p> Deletion of <italic>rhp51</italic> was reported previously to confer no additional sensitivity to UV on an <italic>rqh1</italic> deletion strain, suggesting that the two genes might act in a common pathway of DNA damage tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c5">5</xref>). In contrast, we showed that the UV sensitivities seen on deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rhp51</italic> are additive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f6">6</xref>A), suggesting that the UV-protective role of <italic>srs2</italic> does not operate through the recombinational repair pathway. Similarly, epistasis suggests that <italic>srs2</italic> acts independently of the NER pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f6">6</xref>B). It is possible that Srs2 acts in the NHEJ pathway of DNA repair in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, as has been reported recently for <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c30">30</xref>), but at this stage it seems at least equally likely that its principal role is in a non-recombinational gap-filling pathway, as discussed above. Examination of the relationship between Rqh1, Srs2 and the homologous recombination machinery also revealed a specific requirement for <italic>rad22</italic>, but not other homologous recombination genes, in cells lacking <italic>rqh1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>D and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>). Rad22&#x0002f;Rad52 homologues bind DNA ends and appear to act at an early stage in the homologous recombination pathway, interacting with Rad51 to promote homologous pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c33">33</xref>). It is conceivable that Rqh1 and its homologues might act in concert with Rad22&#x0002f;Rad52 at this early stage in recombination, potentially explaining the specific genetic interaction observed here between <italic>rqh1</italic> and <italic>rad22</italic>. The precise nature of any such interaction awaits further investigation.</p><p> While deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> on its own resulted in a comparatively minor growth defect, simultaneous deletion of <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rqh1</italic> was barely compatible with cell survival (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>). Thus, the function of Srs2 is conserved between <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> at the level of genetic interaction with the sole RecQ family helicase in each yeast (Sgs1 and Rqh1, respectively). The analogous growth defect seen in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic><italic>srs2 sgs1</italic> mutants has been attributed to unrestrained recombination, as the phenotype can be suppressed by inactivation of the homologous recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke434c7">7</xref>). We have been unable to establish the underlying cause of the growth defect in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; cells, partly because the strain itself grew so poorly, and partly because the growth defect is not suppressed by deletion of the homologous recombination gene <italic>rhp51</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f4">4</xref>). Thus, despite our observation that spontaneous recombination is elevated in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f2">2</xref>F), we cannot implicate unscheduled spontaneous hyper-recombination in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; growth defect. Interpretation of the failure of <italic>rhp51</italic> deletion to suppress this growth defect is complicated by the fact that the <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; single mutant displays a growth defect, whereas no such defect has been described for the corresponding <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mutant. However, we observed a specific genetic interaction between <italic>rhp51</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic>, and a comparative lack of any such interaction between <italic>rhp51</italic> and <italic>rqh1</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f4">4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f5">5</xref>A, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke434tb3">3</xref>). These observations support the notion that the relationship between <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>SRS2</italic> and the recombination pathway differs between <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p> In summary, we have identified the <italic>S.pombe</italic> orthologue of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic><italic>SRS2</italic> gene. Several aspects of this gene function have been conserved during the interval of &#x0223c;400 million years since the ancestors of these two yeasts diverged. In particular, <italic>srs2</italic> mutations in each yeast confer elevated levels of mitotic recombination and sensitivity to DNA damage, and are synthetically lethal with mutations in <italic>rgh1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>rhp54</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>RAD54</italic>. These functional similarities, along with the extensive sequence similarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke434f1">1</xref>A), justify our conclusion that <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is the closest fission yeast counterpart of <italic>SRS2</italic>. In other respects, the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>SRS2</italic> function appears to have diverged. Thus, inactivation of the homologous recombination machinery, which is sufficient to suppress the lethality of <italic>S.cerevisiae srs2 sgs1</italic> mutants, was not capable of similarly suppressing the <italic>srs2 rqh1</italic> phenotype in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke434f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Srs2 is structurally conserved between <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic>.
