How their survival is regulated in the periphery is less clear. Here we show that T<sub>reg </sub>cells express receptors for gamma chain cytokines and are dependent on an exogenous supply of these cytokines to overcome cytokine withdrawal apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>. This result was validated <italic>in vivo </italic>by the accumulation of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in Bim<sup>-/- </sup>and Bcl-2 tg mice which have arrested cytokine deprivation apoptosis. We also found that CD25 and Foxp3 expression were down-regulated in the absence of these cytokines. CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from Scurfy mice do not depend on cytokines for survival demonstrating that Foxp3 increases their dependence on cytokines by suppressing cytokine production in T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Our study reveals that the survival of T<sub>reg </sub>cells is strictly dependent on cytokines and cytokine producing cells because they do not produce cytokines. Our study thus, demonstrates that different gamma chain cytokines regulate T<sub>reg </sub>homeostasis in the periphery by differentially regulating survival and proliferation. These findings may shed light on ways to manipulate T<sub>reg </sub>cells that could be utilized for their therapeutic applications.</p><p>This article was reviewed by: Avinash Bhandoola, Fred Ramsdell (nominated by Juan Carlos Zuniga-Pflucker) and Anne Cooke.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells are a subset of lymphocytes having an anergic phenotype as shown by their absence of proliferation and production of IL-2 upon TCR stimulation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] They have been shown to suppress various inflammatory and autoimmune responses in mice and humans. Absence of this population of T cells causes an acute autoimmune condition called Immune dysregulation Polyendocrinopathy Enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX) in humans and fatal autoimmune manifestations in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. T<sub>reg </sub>cells cause cytokine deprivation death by consuming cytokines from CD4 T cells to cause suppressive apoptosis. This is probably one of the default mechanisms of how T<sub>reg </sub>cells operate in the close vicinity of CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Evidence show that self-peptides are important for homeostatic expansion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite the abundant availability of self-peptides, the frequency of T<sub>reg </sub>cells is always 10&#x02013;15% of CD4<sup>+ </sup>population. Increase or decrease in T<sub>reg </sub>numbers would result in immune imbalance as evidenced by suppressive effects of T<sub>reg </sub>cells on other immune cells. However, parameters controlling T<sub>reg </sub>cells and their survival maintaining the normal T<sub>reg </sub>numbers <italic>in vivo</italic>, remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. FAS and TCR restimulation mediated death constitute two of the major mechanisms regulating T cell survival and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, T<sub>reg </sub>cells are shown to be resistant to these active forms of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. IL-2 is shown to be a major survival factor of T<sub>reg </sub>cells, but the role of other cytokines is unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One study proposes the role of gamma chain cytokines in regulating the suppressive potential of human T<sub>reg </sub>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the direct contribution of these cytokines in the survival of T<sub>reg </sub>cells remains undocumented. Exploiting T<sub>reg </sub>cells for therapeutical applications demands a complete understanding of their survival mechanisms <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we show evidence that common &#x003b3; chain cytokines play a major role in T<sub>reg </sub>survival in the periphery.</p><p>Common chain (&#x003b3;c) cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, bind to multimeric receptors that share the common &#x003b3; chain (&#x003b3;<sub>c</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Common &#x003b3;c is a critical part of the cytokine receptors that confers the ability of as &#x003b3;c cytokines to activate MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling, leading to anti-apoptotic and proliferation signals in lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For example, IL-2 binds to IL-2R complex consisting of IL-2R-&#x003b1;, which possesses a short cytoplasmic domain. IL-2R-&#x003b1; binds IL-2 only with low affinity and does not recruit intra cytoplasmic signaling molecules. &#x003b2; chain (IL-2/15R&#x003b2;), shared by the IL-15 receptor stimulates downstream signaling pathways. However, &#x003b3;c is the most crucial component of the IL-2 receptor complex, raising its binding affinity for IL-2 and thus initiating a potent IL-2 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. &#x003b3;c chain cytokines are pleiotropic soluble factors crucial for lymphocyte generation, survival and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Defects in &#x003b3;c signaling components result in impaired B, T, and natural killer (NK) cell development, leading to severe combined immunodeficiency in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The roles of IL-7 and IL-15 in the homeostasis of na&#x000ef;ve CD4 and memory CD8 cells respectively, are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The importance of IL-2 in lymphocyte homeostasis is shown by a severe autoimmunity in mice deficient in IL-2 signaling components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The autoimmune phenotype observed in these mice has been attributed to the loss of cell death mechanism mediated by FAS and absence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Besides maintaining the homeostasis of na&#x000ef;ve and memory cells, &#x003b3;c-cytokine signaling plays an important role during differentiation of activated T cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. How &#x003b3;c-cytokines impact T<sub>reg </sub>cells <italic>in vivo </italic>is not well studied. The absence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in &#x003b3;c-knockout mice seems to suggest that the common gamma chain signaling is important for the development of T<sub>reg </sub>cells. However, whether these cytokines influence the peripheral survival and expansion of T<sub>reg </sub>cells is not known. Here we show that gamma chain cytokines are crucial for maintaining the T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the periphery without which they undergo apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>BALB/c, C57BL/6, Bim<sup>-/- </sup>mice and Scurfy mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. 129 Foxp3-eGFP transgenic mice were purchased from Taconic farms.

T<sub>resp </sub>cells were CFSE-labeled to distinguish them from T<sub>con </sub>or T<sub>reg </sub>cells in co-culture. Proliferation was also assayed by CFSE dilution. Cell death analyses of CFSE<sup>+ </sup>responders were performed based on forward scatter and propidium iodide staining.

We measured the frequency of surviving cells based on forward scatter and propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry analyses. There was a dramatic T<sub>reg </sub>cell death (75&#x02013;90%) in the absence of IL-2 and increasing doses of IL-2 rescued them in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). T<sub>con </sub>cells survived well without exogenous IL-2 in the cultures, presumably because they produce IL-2 themselves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). To test the effect of other &#x003b3;<sub>c </sub>cytokines, we added IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 or IL-21 at 20 ng/ml concentration during the beginning of stimulation in T<sub>reg </sub>cultures. We observed that the presence of the cytokines rescued T<sub>reg </sub>death, with IL-2 having the strongest pro-survival function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, <bold>right panel</bold>). On the other hand, IL-23 a non-&#x003b3;<sub>c </sub>cytokine did not have an effect on the survival of T<sub>reg </sub>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, <bold>right panel</bold>). Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling of the cells showed that in the absence of cytokines, few T<sub>reg </sub>cells that remained in the culture did not undergo proliferation whereas T<sub>con </sub>cells proliferated vigorously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). IL-2 induced proliferation in T<sub>reg </sub>cells whereas IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21 had minimal effect on proliferation even at the excessive concentration of 20 ng/ml (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, <bold>data not shown</bold>). However, the possibility that the combination of some or all &#x003b3;<sub>c </sub>cytokines such as IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21 could initiate proliferation in Treg cells is not excluded. As a control for CFSE staining, un-stimulated T<sub>reg </sub>cells isolated <italic>ex vivo </italic>is shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Next, we hypothesized that T<sub>con </sub>cells producing IL-2 might also serve as IL-2 source and support the survival and proliferation of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in cultures. Therefore we stimulated the CFSE labeled T<sub>reg </sub>cells with increasing numbers of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells and analyzed their death after 72 hours. As expected, T<sub>reg </sub>cells died less and also proliferated in the presence of conventional CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Even though conventional CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells themselves died in the presence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells at CD4:T<sub>reg </sub>in 1:1 ratio, their viability was only mildly affected at 3:1 and 8:1 ratios. To test if T<sub>con </sub>induced survival was mediated by IL-2, we blocked IL-2 using a blocking antibody and found that the survival frequencies of T<sub>reg </sub>cells fell back to basal levels even in the presence of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). However, the direct effect of blocking IL-2 in T<sub>con </sub>cells cannot be ruled out. The number of proliferating T<sub>reg </sub>cells was directly proportional to the numbers of viable CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). This is in accordance with our previous findings that T<sub>reg </sub>cells consume cytokines from conventional CD4 T cells, and in the process, suppress them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy analyses of T<sub>reg</sub>cells in the absence of cytokines showed condensed nuclei and membrane blebbing, the characteristic features of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>). Thus, it is evident that T<sub>reg </sub>cells undergo apoptosis in the absence of cytokine signaling <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings corroborate the observation that T<sub>reg </sub>cells are absent in &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub>-knockout mice, implying that gamma chain signaling is important not only for the development but also for the survival of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the periphery. Our observation that gamma cytokines besides IL-2 can support the survival of T<sub>reg </sub>cells potentially explains previous observation that shows only a reduced frequency and not a complete absence of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in CD25 deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the absence of IL-2-R signaling, the combination of other &#x003b3;<sub>c </sub>cytokines could also induce both survival and homeostatic proliferation of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the periphery.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gamma chain cytokines rescue T<sub>reg </sub>cells from apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Viability of T<sub>con </sub>or T<sub>reg </sub>cells stimulated for four days with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28.

To this end, we measured the frequency of CD25<sup>+ </sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in Bcl-2 transgenic mice in CD45.1 background. We found that there was an increased percentage of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in these mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The specific role of Bcl-2 interacting member (Bim) protein in mediating cytokine deprivation apoptosis is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, we tested the frequency of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in Bim deficient mice.

In addition to causing cell death in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>resp </sub>cells, both WT T<sub>reg </sub>cells and BIM<sup>-/- </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells were able to induce Foxp3 in conventional CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells in co-cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>). The relevance of Foxp3 induction in T<sub>resp </sub>cells due to the presence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells is unknown presently. However, in the presence of T<sub>reg </sub>cells and IL-7, the frequency of induced Foxp3+ cells seems to be diminished, probably due to an increased proliferation of non Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>CD4<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>resp </sub>cells as compared to induced Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>CD4<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>resp </sub>cells in the presence of IL-7.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>T<sub>reg </sub>cells are susceptible to cytokine deprivation apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

T<sub>reg </sub>cells stimulated without any cytokine showed a substantial down-regulation of the CD25 expression whereas CD25 up-regulation was normal on T<sub>con </sub>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, <bold>two upper panels</bold>). In the presence of cytokines however, CD25 expression was maintained at high levels both on T<sub>con </sub>cells and T<sub>reg </sub>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, <bold>two upper panels</bold>). CD25 down regulation was only partial on BIM<sup>-/- </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the absence of cytokines, but was further up-regulated in the presence of cytokines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, <bold>two lower panels</bold>).

These findings demonstrate that cytokines are crucial not only for the survival but also for maintaining the cardinal features of T<sub>reg </sub>cells i.e the expression of CD25 and Foxp3. We believe that T<sub>reg </sub>cells lose the expression of Foxp3 due to the initiation of death signals in the absence of cytokines because it did not occur in the absence of death in Bim<sup>-/- </sup>T<sub>reg</sub>cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Gamma chain cytokines maintain CD25 and Foxp3 expression in T<sub>reg </sub>cells</bold>.

We tested whether a strong dependence of cytokines was a characteristic feature of all <italic>ex vivo </italic>isolated CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells in general. We found that these Scurfy mice harbored CD4<sup>+ </sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells that are presumably activated CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells owing to the autoimmune condition of the mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). However, the CD25<sup>high </sup>cells that represent the T<sub>reg </sub>population was reduced from 16% to 8% in CD4<sup>+ </sup>population as compared to WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). However, there was a complete absence of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in these mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). To investigate whether Foxp3 is important in T<sub>reg </sub>cells for the extreme cytokine dependence for their survival, we isolated CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from the Scurfy mice and tested their survival in the presence or in the absence of IL-2. We found that isolated Scurfy T<sub>con </sub>cells, when stimulated in cultures had an impaired survival as compared to WT T<sub>con </sub>cells. Surprisingly, however we found that Scurfy CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells survived as well as Scurfy T<sub>con </sub>cells even in the absence of IL-2 whereas WT T<sub>reg </sub>cells died substantially (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Because of the lack of dependence on IL-2, we hypothesized that Scurfy CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells might not suppress other conventional T cells. To test this tenet, we co-cultured the CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from WT mice or Scurfy mice with CFSE labeled CD4 T cells and measured the suppressive death after 3 days. Interestingly, we observed that responding T<sub>resp </sub>cells underwent death in the presence of CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from WT mice and not with CD25<sup>+ </sup>from Scurfy mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). It is likely that CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells from Scurfy mice produce cytokines due to the absence of Foxp3, which is why they do not depend on IL-2 added exogenously. To validate this theory, we stimulated WT T<sub>reg </sub>cells and scurfy CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells with anti-CD3 and anti CD28 and measured IL-2 in the supernatants after 3 days. We found that while WT T<sub>reg </sub>cells did not produce IL-2, Scurfy CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells produced as much cytokine as Scurfy CD4<sup>+ </sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells approaching the level of cytokine produced by WT CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD25<sup>- </sup>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). This data is consistent with the previous observations showing suppressive effects of Foxp3 on IL-2 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and the effect of IL-2 on T<sub>reg </sub>homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Together, we show here that Foxp3 represses cytokine production in T<sub>reg </sub>cells, which is why they are dependent on gamma cytokines from an external source for survival. Thus T<sub>reg </sub>cells have a self-regulatory mechanism through which their inability to produce cytokines instruct them to depend on cytokines and without the cytokines, the T<sub>reg </sub>cells are deleted.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Foxp3 repression of IL-2 determines the IL-2 dependence in T<sub>reg </sub>cells</bold>.

Here, we demonstrate that Treg cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis in the absence of cytokines. This cytokine withdrawal apoptosis in T<sub>reg </sub>cells is substantially abolished by the &#x003b3;c cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data also reveal that Bim<sup>-/- </sup>mice accumulate higher frequencies of T<sub>reg </sub>cells showing the importance of cytokine withdrawal death in regulating peripheral T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Moreover, T<sub>reg </sub>cells from Bim<sup>-/- </sup>mice do not depend on cytokines for survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition to enhancing their survival, the &#x003b3;c cytokines also maintain CD25 and Foxp3 expression in T<sub>reg </sub>cells, thus maintaining their suppressive potential. Most importantly, our data show that Foxp3 appears to confer the inability to produce cytokines in T<sub>reg </sub>cells thus increasing their dependence to extra-cellular sources of cytokines for survival and function. We have described here a cytokine dependent homeostatic regulation mechanism of the T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Along with the self-peptides, the availability of &#x003b3;c cytokines probably keeps the T<sub>reg </sub>numbers in constant check thus maintaining both protective and regulatory arms of the immune system in balance. Thus, our study highlights the important role of &#x003b3;c cytokines in regulating T<sub>reg </sub>survival, opening new ways to manipulate T<sub>reg </sub>cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewers' comments</title><sec><title>Reviewer's report 1</title><p>Dr Avinash Bhandoola, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia</p><p>PA United States</p><p>I thought there was plenty of interesting new data in this work.

The connection between g-c receptor signaling and apoptosis &#x02013; and the distinction between these cytokines and proliferation &#x02013; is a significant finding and generally well supported by the data. To date, the bulk of studies on Treg survival/activity and cytokines has focused on IL-2, and the extension to other gamma-c receptor using cytokines provides a more comprehensive analysis of this biology.</p><p>Whilst the experiments in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> are an interesting attempt to address the function of Foxp3 with respect to cytokine dependence, the conclusions are not fully supported by the data. The abstract states that in scurfy mice, "Foxp3 increases their (CD25+ cells) dependence on cytokines by suppressing cytokine production in Treg cells." Whilst Foxp3 does appear to directly suppress cytokine production, it does so in any T cell and the major effect of lack of Foxp3 in scurfy mice would appear to be the absence of the T<sub>R </sub>lineage more broadly. Thus, this is not an appropriate way to test "whether Foxp3 is important in Treg cells for the extreme cytokine dependence for their survival" as these mice don't have Treg cells. Previous data has demonstrated that scurfy T cells do not express Foxp3, that they are CD25+ and that these cells do not have any Treg activity (Khattri, et. al.). In fact, these cells produce large amounts of IL-2 and many other cytokines. Importantly however, the cells remaining in scurfy mice do not appear to be in any way related to Treg cells. The data in the manuscript is consistent with data from Foxp3 transgenic mice in which Foxp3 levels are increased, but the actual number of Treg cells is decreased, as are their CD25 levels &#x02013; perhaps due to Foxp3 inhibition of g-c derived (IL2 or other) secretion. This figure however does not seem necessary to me for the manuscript to be of interest.</p><sec><title>Author response</title><p><italic>This data indicates that not all CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells consume and depend on cytokine in vitro. In the absence of Foxp3 in Scurfy mice, CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells do not depend on IL-2 and other cytokines and make cytokines themselves. Even though our data do not show that Foxp3 determines cytokine dependence directly, we feel that there is a strong implication that the presence of Foxp3 inversely correlates with cytokine production in Treg cells, based on the fact that Foxp3 expression is restricted to Treg cells in mice. The weakness in this experiment, and a point on which we agree with the reviewer, is that it is not clear that the CD25-expressing cells in the Scurfy mice are related to CD25-expressing Treg cells in WT mice. For example, if Treg cells are truly absent in Scurfy animals, then the CD25-expressing T cells could be from a completely different lineage of CD4+ T cells. In this case, we would be comparing different lineages and the results would not indicate a direct effect of FoxP3. Alternatively, it might be that the FoxP3-negative, CD25-expressing cells in Scurfy mice are cells that would otherwise would have become Tregs, then our data gives a better insight into the role of FoxP3. In either case, a cleaner experiment would be to perform a knockdown of FoxP3 in WT mouse Tregs and assess if they now produce cytokines at a normal level and are no longer susceptible to apoptosis in the absence of exogenous cytokines. We are working on executing this experiment in the future. However, the results in </italic>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>show that Foxp3 expression and function but not expression of cytokine receptors alone determines cytokine consumption. Sakaguchi and colleagues (Hori et al, 2003, Science) have shown that Foxp3 transduction alone converts normal T cell in to a Treg cell validating our finding that the function of Foxp3 is restricted to Treg cell. Therefore, we feel that </italic>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic> is necessary for the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>One further observation is that it appears to be very clear in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a/b</xref> that the amount of Foxp3 protein is substantially less in the Bcl-2 tg and Bim -/- Treg cells than in conventional cells (although this is less evident in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Previous data has suggested that the absolute amount of Foxp3 can be a critical factor in regulating the amount of suppressive activity by Treg cells, and the functional data in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e/f</xref> would support this. But I am unclear why, in the model proposed, there might be less Foxp3 protein in cells from these animals and I would be interested to hear the author's speculation on this.</p></sec><sec><title>Author response</title><p><italic>We speculate that Treg cells in Bcl-2 tg and Bim-/- mice, do not die even when cytokine levels are less abundant resulting in accumulation of T<sub>reg </sub>cells.

This distinction is one of the more salient features of the article. It seems appropriate to reference the work of Malek and colleagues (particularly Bayer, Yu and Malek, JI, 2007) when referring to previous studies on the role of IL-2 and Treg development (eg, in reference to Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).
