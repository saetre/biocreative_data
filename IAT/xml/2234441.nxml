Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which typifies an inflammation-related tumor, is one of the most common malignancies in the world, especially in Asia and Africa. Japan has a high incidence of chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC. The resolution of inflammatory activity at the molecular level may correlate with prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis and cancer promotion.</p><p>The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor classified as an immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface molecule and acts as a counter-receptor for high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), S100/calgranulins, and amyloid-&#x003b2; peptides. These interactions trigger the activation of key cell signaling pathways (e.g., p38 and p44/42 MAP kinase,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> NF-&#x003ba;B, cdc42/rac,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> and the generation of reactive oxygen species, and result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> RAGE-mediated proinflammatory processes are now considered to contribute to the progression of many chronic diseases, such as neuropathy, nephropathy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> macrovascular disease, amyloidoses, inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease) and sepsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> In addition to RAGE-mediated proinflammatory events, recent studies have revealed that the interaction of RAGE and its ligands and the resultant signaling play a causative role in the characteristic modulation of cancer cell functions, i.e., increasing tumor invasion and metastasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> Furthermore, several clinical studies have demonstrated the (strong) association of RAGE expression with the malignant potential of various cancers such as gastric cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> colon cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> common bile duct cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> pancreatic cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> and prostate cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> although one report showed a reverse correlation between RAGE expression and tumor progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> Thus, RAGE expression may be expected play have a significant role in the development of HCC, although no data have been reported for this tumor. In terms of HCC, it is known that the pathophysiological conditions or circumstances surrounding tumorigenesis are quite different from those reported for other cancers. For example, small HCC tumors at an early stage are continuously exposed to low oxygen and high glucose as well as the noncancerous hepatic tissues with cirrhosis in which tissue derangement occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> In addition, RAGE is the receptor for AGEs produced from excessive glucose metabolism,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> extracellular HMGB1 released from necrotic cells which could be induced by hypoxia and inflammation, and serum amyloid A (SAA) produced in response to the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> and these RAGE ligands are possibly generated and/or released from inflamed hepatic tissues. Our central hypothesis is thus that RAGE expression may play a particular role in tumorigenesis of HCC, in addition to the role in the invasive and/or metastatic potential of cancer cells. With this background, the objectives of this study were: (1) to clarify the relationship between RAGE expression and the clinico-pathological features of HCC and (2) to investigate the functional role of RAGE expression in HCC development.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Human samples</title><p>From March 2000 to September 2005, 65 patients with primary HCC were treated surgically in the Department of Surgical Oncology and Digestive Surgery, Kagoshima University School of Medicine.

Samples from the remaining 36 patients (30 men and 6 women with a mean age of 67.1 years) were included in the study. Seven patients (19.4%) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and 21 (58.3%) were positive for the antibody to hepatitis C virus. Eight patients (22.2%) were negative for both of these viruses. Twenty-four patients had chronic hepatitis and four had liver cirrhosis. The mean tumor size was 49.7 mm (range, 16&#x02013;150 mm). The histological grade of each tumor was determined according to the general rules for the clinical and pathological study of primary liver cancer (The Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, 2000).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> Four tumors (11.1%) were well-differentiated HCC, 28 (77.8%) moderately differentiated HCC, and 4 (11.1%) poorly differentiated HCC. Postoperative tumor recurrence was observed for 11 patients (30.6%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For immunohistochemical study, a further 12 HCC samples (six well- and six poorly differentiated HCC), obtained surgically during the same period at JA Kagoshima Kouseiren Hospital, were added and used to verify the correlation of RAGE expression with tumor differentiation. Finally, a total of 48 HCC nodules (10 well-differentiated HCC, 28 moderately differentiated HCC, and 10 poorly differentiated HCC) were studied. As a control study, six normal liver samples were collected from patients with benign or metastatic liver tumors. Written informed consent, recognized by the ethical committees of Kagoshima University School of Medicine and JA Kagoshima Kouseiren Hospital, was obtained from each patient before tissue acquisition. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>TABLE&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Background of patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Gender</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Male</td><td align="left">30 (83%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Female</td><td align="left">6 (17%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mean age</td><td align="left">67.2 years</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Virus type</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;B</td><td align="left">7 (19.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;C</td><td align="left">21 (58.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;None</td><td align="left">8 (22.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Background of livers</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Chronic hepatitis</td><td align="left">24 (60.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Liver cirrhosis</td><td align="left">4 (11.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Normal liver</td><td align="left">8 (22.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Mean tumor size </td><td align="left">49.7mm</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Histological grade</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Well differentiated</td><td align="left">4 (11.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Moderately differentiated</td><td align="left">28 (77.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Poorly differentiated</td><td align="left">4 (11.1%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Postoperative tumor recurrence 11 (30.6%).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Consecutive 4-&#x003bc;m sections were cut from each paraffin-embedding block. Sections were immunostained by anti-RAGE antibody (Santa-Cruz, CA, USA) according to the conventional immunoperoxidase technique. Briefly, after peroxidase blocking with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/methanol for 10 min, specimens were blocked with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Anti-RAGE antibody was used at 1/200. After overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody, specimens were briefly washed in PBS and incubated at room temperature with the secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase. The specimens were then washed in PBS and color-developed by diaminobenzidine solution (DAKO). After washing with water, specimens were counterstained with Meyer&#x02019;s hematoxylin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA). Immunostaining of all cases was performed at one time to ensure the same conditions of antibody reaction and DAB exposure. A total of 48 HCC nodules (10 well-differentiated HCC, 28 moderately differentiated HCC, and 10 poorly differentiated HCC) were studied. To evaluate the immunohistochemical staining, ten fields were selected and expression in 1000 tumor cells (100 cell/fields) was evaluated with high-power (&#x000d7;200) microscopy. The immunohistochemical expression of RAGE was defined as positive if distinct staining of the cell membrane was observed in at least 10% of tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell and cell culture</title><p>Hepatoma cell lines HepG2, HuH7, HT17, and Li7 were kindly provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University and Hep3B was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures.

One milliliter of Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer was added to a 100 mm cell culture plate. The plates were gently rocked for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Adherent cells were scrpaed with a cell scraper, followed by incubation for 30&#x02013;60 min on ice. The cell lysate was microcentrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant fluid was the total cell lysate. The supernatant was transferred to a new microfuge tube and the pellet was discarded. Twelve microgram lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were immunoreacted with anti-RAGE antibody (a gift from TORAY Research Institute, Sagamihara, Japan) or with anti-HMGB1 antibody (BD Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). The immune complex was visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection system (PIERCE, Rockford, IL, USA). The amount of B-actin as an internal control was also examined using a specific antibody (Cytoskelton Inc., Denver, CO, USA and Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Moreover, in the liver, with a dual blood supply from the hepatic artery and portal vein, liver-specific oxygen and glucose supply are available dependent upon the degree of liver disorder. The multiligand receptor RAGE is particularly relevant in this context. The ligands for RAGE may be produced abundantly during HCC development. For example, HMGB1 released from necrotic cells and AGE generated in the process of higher hepatic glucose metabolism are considered to be major candidates (i.e., the presence of HMGB1 and carboxymethyl lysine in HCC; data not shown). Hepatic SAA production in response to IL-6 may also be included.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> In addition, RAGE expression and its downstream signaling are now considered to play a significant role in the progression of various cancers as well as the development of inflammatory lesions.</p><p>Another aspect of the biology of RAGE was suggested by the features of retinoic acid-induced neuroblastoma differentiation, in which RAGE expression played a more important role in cellular survival than in neurite outgrowth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> In this model, inhibition of RAGE function partially blocked the increase in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the process of neuronal differentiation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> indicating that RAGE and its signaling also might contribute to the survival of certain cancer cell types undergoing &#x0201c;differentiation&#x0201d;. Furthermore, although indirectly, our previous study demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B, currently considered as a causative transcriptional factor for various inflammatory events and also known as a major RAGE-mediated signal, played an important role in the survival of neuronal tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> and in experimentally developed HCC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></p><p>The present study demonstrated that increased RAGE expression was highly associated with the status of pathological &#x0201c;differentiation&#x0201d; in HCC, which played a significant role in acquisition of the hypoxia-resistant phenotype of tumor cells. This conclusion is supported by several lines of experimental evidence. First, the level of RAGE expression was higher in well- and moderately differentiated HCC, while it diminished as the tumors dedifferentiated to poorly differentiated HCC. This was consistent with the evidence that a negative correlation was observed between the level of RAGE mRNA expression and either the level of PIVKA II or the incidence of postoperative recurrence. Second, the analysis of five HCC lines revealed that three of these (Li7, Hep3B, and HuH7) that are resistant to hypoxic stress characteristically showed higher levels of RAGE expression compared to the two hypoxia-intolerant cell lines HepG2 and HT17. Third, sublethal hypoxia exposure induced significantly increased RAGE expression in hypoxia-resistant HCC lines. In the analysis of the association between the level of RAGE expression and the &#x0201c;differentiation status&#x0201d; of HCC lines, the level of RAGE expression was higher in &#x0201c;possibly differentiated&#x0201d; lines (i.e., HCC with low Alpha-Fet protein (AFP) production), consistent with the results from clinical samples. Finally, cells overexpressing RAGE exogenously showed prolonged survival under hypoxic conditions compared to control mock-transfected cells, and siRNA experiments demonstrated similar results.</p><p>Our conclusion also provides a new hypothetical concept that hepatic RAGE expression may be relevant to the stage or severity of inflammation and the incidence of carcinogenesis and early tumorigenesis of HCC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In the process of the development of an HCC lesion, increased RAGE expression by inflamed hepatocytes may confer adaptation to an advanced hypoxic environment during remodeling and carcinogenesis with accelerated cell proliferation. In this context, an HCC lesion which is highly associated with inflammation caused by either hepatitis viruses or drugs is developed through a process of multistage carcinogenesis, i.e., from inflammatory lesions (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis and precancerous lesion) to adenomatous hyperplasia, and eventually into HCC. Once cancer is established, HCC dedifferentiates step-by-step to a more malignant histology, from well- and moderately to poorly differentiated HCC. It has also been pointed out that the vascular supply changes significantly between each stage of tumorigenesis. According to the evidence from several clinical studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref> both adenomatous hyperplasia and well-differentiated HCC are hypovascular tumors primarily fed by the portal vein system, while moderately and poorly differentiated HCC are hypervascular tumors primarily fed by arterial blood. In addition, early carcinogenesis and the development of the malignant phenotype generally occur in an avascular environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref> Increased RAGE expression, at least in part, may thus play an important role in the mechanism of early HCC development from precancerous inflammatory lesions. In addition, about the expression of RAGE being lower in poorly differentiated HCC when compared to well and moderately differentiated HCC, gastric and colon cancers have been showed that RAGE and other ligands interacts act on tumor promotion in clinical materials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> However, prostate cancer was demonstrated to show no correlation between RAGE expression and tumor differentiation and depth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> Moreover, non-small-cell lung cancers have been showed a reverse correlation between RAGE expression and tumor stage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref> This result is partially similar to our results. RAGE expression of each clinical samples is various. <fig id="Fig7"><label>FIG.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Scheme of the change of RAGE expression according to the sequential change of liver tissue: normal &#x02192; chronic hepatitis (CH) &#x02192; cirrhosis &#x02192; HCC.

It is important to know whether RAGE can bind HMGB1 secreted from activated macrophages in hepatic inflammation, or if occupancy of RAGE by inhibitors would obviate binding of the stimulatory ligands. The functional role of downstream signaling of the RAGE would also be important to determine the cytoprotective mechanism under hypoxia.</p><p>Our findings have provided the first evidence of the clinical relevance and function of RAGE in HCC, namely differentiation-associated RAGE expression that confers a hypoxia-resistant phenotype. Although other mechanisms may also be important, our data also introduce the concept that RAGE and its functions may be possible candidates for therapeutic targets in the treatment of HCC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.
