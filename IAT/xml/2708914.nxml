Crossover assurance ensures at least one crossover per homolog pair, while interference reduces double crossovers. Here, we have investigated the interplay between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement. We demonstrate that chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites as indicated by correspondence between crossover designation marker Zip3 and domains enriched for axis ensemble Hop1/Red1. This association is first detected at the zygotene stage, persists until double Holliday junction resolution, and is controlled by the conserved AAA&#x0002b; ATPase Pch2. Pch2 further mediates crossover interference, although it is dispensable for crossover formation at normal levels. Thus, interference appears to be superimposed on underlying mechanisms of crossover formation. When recombination-initiating DSBs are reduced, Pch2 is also required for viable spore formation, consistent with further functions in chiasma formation. <italic>pch2&#x00394;</italic> mutant defects in crossover interference and spore viability at reduced DSB levels are oppositely modulated by temperature, suggesting contributions of two separable pathways to crossover control. Roles of Pch2 in controlling both chromosome axis morphogenesis and crossover placement suggest linkage between these processes. Pch2 is proposed to reorganize chromosome axes into a tiling array of long-range crossover control modules, resulting in chiasma formation at minimum levels and with maximum spacing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In the germ line of sexually reproducing organisms, haploid gametes are generated from diploid precursor cells by a specialized cell division called meiosis. Reduction by half of chromosome numbers during the first meiotic division depends on genetic exchange, resulting in the formation of crossovers. Without crossovers, pairs of homologous chromosomes frequently fail to separate, resulting in unbalanced gametes with a surplus or deficit of individual chromosomes. Along a given chromosome, crossovers form in different locations in different cells, but distribution of crossovers within each cell is controlled in two ways: first, at least one crossover is formed along each homolog pair, irrespective of size; second, a crossover in a given interval reduces the frequency of crossovers in adjacent chromosome regions. Here, we identify functions of the evolutionarily conserved protein Pch2 in suppressing additional crossovers in adjacent regions and ensuring homolog segregation under certain conditions. Pch2 further controls the assembly of chromosome axis protein Hop1 at future crossover sites. Our findings reveal that chromosome axes undergo structural changes at the same positions where crossovers occur. Thus, axis remodeling and crossover placement are linked via Pch2.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome separation, with homologous chromosomes (homologs) segregating during meiosis I and sister chromatids during meiosis II. Homolog segregation critically depends on formation of crossovers (COs) between homologs. COs, cytologically detectable as chiasmata, in combination with sister chromatid connections, mediate the correct positioning of homolog pairs in the meiosis I spindle. Without COs, homologs frequently fail to segregate, resulting in formation of aneuploid gametes, i.e. gametes with a chromosome surplus or deficit. Aneuploid gametes are one of the major causes for stillbirths and birth defects in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Hassold1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CO formation occurs via a carefully orchestrated program during prophase of meiosis I entails close homolog juxtaposition, followed by reciprocal exchange of chromosome arms through homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Bishop1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. On the DNA level, meiotic recombination is initiated by formation of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) at multiple genome positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Blitzblau1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Keeney1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. A non-random subset of DSBs undergoes stable interaction with a homologous chromatid, giving rise to COs, while the remainder of DSBs progress to alternative fates, including non-crossovers (NCOs), i.e. recombination events without exchange of flanking chromosome arms, as well as repair events with the sister chromatid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Hunter1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies in fungi including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have provided an understanding of meiotic recombination at the molecular level. Processing of meiotically induced DSBs depends on numerous proteins with related roles in mitotic DSB repair, but there are also prominent differences between these processes: First, during meiosis, homologs rather than sister chromatids serve as partners for homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, CO formation is enhanced over that of NCOs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-McMahill1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Following 5&#x02032; resection, DSBs undergo strand invasion of intact non-sister homologous chromatids. Pathways leading to COs and NCOs appear to bifurcate no later than the stage of strand invasion: Single end invasions (SEIs) emerge as the first CO-specific intermediate, subsequently giving rise to double Holliday junctions which are specifically resolved as COs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Hunter2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Brner1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. NCOs likely arise via an alternative pathway characterized by a more transient strand invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-McMahill1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, only COs provide interhomolog connections as required for homolog segregation.</p><p>Recombination is temporally and spatially coordinated with dramatic changes in global chromosome structure culminating in the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC, a widely conserved proteinaceous structure, stably juxtaposes homologs along their entire lengths during the pachytene stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Zickler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. SC formation is initiated during the leptotene stage when axial elements first form between and along sister chromatids. During the zygotene stage, axial elements of homologous chromosomes become closely juxtaposed via the SC central element which starts polymerizing from discrete sites; achieving full length homolog synapsis during the pachytene stage. Recombination is initiated via induction of DSBs during the leptotene stage, followed by onset of strand invasion at the transition from the leptotene to the zygotene stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Hunter2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. During the pachytene stage, in the context of fully formed SC, double Holliday junctions are formed and resolved into COs, with NCOs emerging somewhat earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Hunter2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Brner1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Morphogenesis of the SC and recombination are highly interdependent, as indicated by (i) requirements for recombination proteins for SC assembly, and (ii) functions of SC components in recombination.

Spo11-dependent DSB formation is also required for SC assembly. Prominent components of yeast axial elements include Hop1 and its binding partner Red1, as well as meiosis-specific cohesin Rec8 and cohesin-associated proteins, e.g. Spo76/Pds5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Smith1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Storlazzi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Zip1 is a prominent component of the SC central element.

Two ZMM proteins, Zip2 and Zip3, are required for formation of most COs and also mediate normal SC assembly.

Later, when chiasmata emerge, they are characterized by extended regions of sister axis separation flanking the position of an established CO (see example in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Kleckner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>CO placement along homolog pairs is non-random at several levels: First, CO assurance guarantees formation of at least one CO per bivalent (e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Shinohara1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>).

Third, CO interference reduces the frequency of COs in regions adjacent to established COs resulting in maximally spaced COs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Muller1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The three levels of CO control indicate communication along chromosomes between sites of ongoing recombination.

CO assurance and CO homeostasis suggest mechanism(s) that sense overall CO and/or DSB levels, affecting the outcome of ongoing recombination events. Timing, mechanism and the functional relationship between CO control and meiotic recombination pathway(s) are poorly understood. CO control is thought to operate on randomly distributed recombination interactions, a non-random subset of which become designated as future COs with the remainder progressing to NCOs. CO designation likely occurs no later than zygotene, as suggested by occurrence of cytological markers of CO-designation at this stage, and by concurrent appearance of CO specific recombination intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Brner1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Linkage between CO assurance and CO interference was inferred from coordinate loss or retention of both features in certain mutant situations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Martini1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Sym2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, CO interference is retained in two <italic>zmm</italic> mutants (<italic>zip4&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>spo16&#x00394;</italic>) despite apparent loss of CO assurance, indicating that separable pathways contribute to CO control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Shinohara1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Structural chromosome components responsible for CO control also remain unknown.

In yeast, Pch2 further mediates assembly of structurally normal SC, controlling installation of axis component Hop1 and SC central element protein Zip1 along meiotic chromosomes in a pattern of alternating hyperabundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Brner2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This pattern likely arises due to uniform loading of Hop1 and Zip1 at base levels along the length of the SC, corresponding to the uniform appearance of the SC detected by electron microscopy, in combination with additional domainal loading of either protein. Absence of Pch2 results in uniform localization patterns of Hop1 and Zip1 along the length of meiotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Brner2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the interplay between meiotic chromosome morphogenesis and CO control in yeast. We demonstrate intimate coordination between controlled CO distribution and axial element morphogenesis, as suggested by frequent association between Zip3-marked CO-designation sites and domains of preferential Hop1/Red1 loading. Association between Zip3 and Hop1/Red1 becomes detectable prior to substantial SC polymerization, consistent with axis differentiation at future CO sites early during meiosis. Furthermore, Hop1-Zip3 association is detected in <italic>ndt80&#x00394;</italic>-arrested cells indicating its establishment independent of and prior to double Holliday junction resolution.

We demonstrate a spatial association between CO-designated sites and structurally differentiated chromosome axes: Early during meiotic prophase, axis proteins Hop1 and Red1 preferentially associate with sites designated to become COs. A key implication of this finding is that local modifications of chromosome axis and recombination site selection are coordinated, and are possibly controlled by the same determinants. Pch2 controls the association of Hop1 with designated CO sites, the number of designated CO sites along the genome and CO interference. Identification of <italic>pch2&#x00394;</italic> as a mutant that affects CO/chiasma formation in response to remote recombination events without playing a major role in overall CO levels suggests that CO control is mechanistically distinct from and likely superimposed on basic recombination events.

Under such conditions, DSBs normally ensured to become COs may now fail to induce steps in chromosome morphogenesis associated with normal chiasma formation.</p><p>Control of CO numbers via one-crossover modules provides an attractive way how recombination frequencies can be controlled in different organisms and even different sexes. Accordingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, each chromosome would be organized as a single module, while in e.g. mouse, there would be one or two OCMs per homolog pair. In many species, CO levels between males and females differ for identical homolog pairs. Setting differently sized OCMs represent an attractive way to control CO levels in a chromosome-wide manner. Levels and distribution of COs are dramatically modulated by temperature and other environmental factors in many eukaryotes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000557-Zetka1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>). Such sensitivity along WT chromosomes may be related to the mutant sensitivities revealed by the current work.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In summary, we have demonstrated here that chromosome axes undergo programmed changes in their global structure that strikingly parallel the non-random positioning of chiasmata during meiosis. Unlike other cases of cytologically detectable chromosome domain organization, including heterochromatin assembly, such domainal organization is determined individually for each cell, in accordance with non-random meiotic crossover distribution. Close functional and temporal coordination between assured crossover formation and chromosome domain organization identify potential functions for chromosome axis status in faithful meiotic homolog segregation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Strains were of the SK1 background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000557.s010">Table S5</xref>).
