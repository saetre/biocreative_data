We show that inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) accumulated in these strains and that poly P is a potent inhibitor of poly(A) polymerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Binding analyses of poly P and yeast Pap1p revealed an interaction with a <italic>k</italic><sub>D</sub> in the low nanomolar range. Poly P also bound mammalian poly(A) polymerase, however, with a 10-fold higher <italic>k</italic><sub>D</sub> compared to yeast Pap1p. Genetic tests with double mutants of <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> and other genes involved in phosphate homeostasis and poly P accumulation suggest that poly P contributed to cordycepin hypersensitivity. Synergistic inhibition of mRNA synthesis through poly P-mediated inhibition of Pap1p and through cordycepin-mediated RNA chain termination may thus account for hypersensitive growth of <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> strains in the presence of the chain terminator. Consistent with this, a mutation in the 3&#x02032;-end formation component <italic>rna14</italic> was synthetic lethal in combination with <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic>. Based on these observations, we suggest that binding of poly P to poly(A) polymerase negatively regulates its activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) comprises chains of 10s to 100s of phosphate residues, connected by energy-rich phospho-anhydride bonds. Despite the fact that poly P is an ubiquitous molecule detected in every living cell, our knowledge concerning its biochemistry and biological function remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Poly P serves important roles as a substitute for ATP for sugar and adenylate kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), as phosphate reservoir with osmotic advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>), as energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), as buffer against alkaline stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and as chelator of divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these general functions, poly P has been implicated in a number of regulatory processes both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, poly P is essential for survival during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It accumulates into large amounts in response to stress situations brought about by nutritional downshift from rich to minimal media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), phosphate limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), amino acid depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) or nitrogen starvation. During the latter condition, poly P promotes ribosomal protein degradation by binding and activating the Lon protease in <italic>E. coli</italic> delivering amino acids needed to respond to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Poly P is also ubiquitous in mammalian cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) where it has been implicated in a host of regulatory processes. For example, the mammalian TOR kinase, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), is activated by poly P under conditions of nutritional starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This observation also led to the proposal of an evolutionary conserved role for poly P in stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, poly P was found to enhance proliferation of human fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), to stimulate calcification of osteoblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), to inhibit the secretion of immunoglobulin and to stimulate apoptosis in human plasma and myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and more recently, poly P has been shown to have anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, there are several reports that link poly P to the regulation of gene expression through effects on RNA polymerase transcription. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, poly P is associated with RNA polymerase during the stationary phase and inhibits specifically the transcriptional activity of the enzymes associated with the E&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter-recognition subunit, which is involved in the transcription of genes during exponential growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Moreover, poly P induces transcription of <italic>rpoS</italic>, the stationary phase &#x003c3; factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Polyphosphate kinase (Ppk1), the enzyme synthesizing poly P, is a component of the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Since poly P is a potent inhibitor of the degradosome, it was suggested that Ppk1 might act to maintain a correct microenvironment for proper mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In addition, poly P has been shown to associate with ribosomes and to suppress misincorporation of amino acids during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, poly P concentrations can reach &#x0223c;120 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and thus poly P contributes up to 20% of the cellular dry weight. Most of the poly P (90&#x02013;99%) is localized to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), but poly P was also detected in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). For rat liver nuclei, micromolar poly P concentrations were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and for yeast nuclei a similar level of poly P is assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Poly P content of a yeast cell is strongly dependent on the growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and the average length of nuclear poly P polymers of approximately 45 phosphate residues was found to be changing dynamically with growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Enzymes involved in eukaryotic poly P synthesis remain mostly elusive to this day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but activities indicative of an active poly P catabolism have been associated with all cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), including the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The observation that a double mutant of <italic>PPN1</italic> [encoding a endopolyphosphatase; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>)] and <italic>PPX1</italic> [encoding an exopolyphosphatase; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)] rapidly looses viability in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), underscores the biological importance of poly P. We recently screened the entire collection of haploid yeast gene deletion mutants for poly P content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and found that poly P metabolism and primary metabolism (e.g. ATP and phosphate homeostasis) were strongly interdependent. This screen also revealed that all cellular compartments are linked to poly P homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we establish a connection between cellular accumulation of poly P and inhibition of poly(A) polymerase activity. Yeast strains mutant in central components of the phosphate response pathway (<italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic>) contained increased amounts of poly P that contributed to cordycepin-hypersensitive growth. We propose a role for poly P in negatively regulating polyadenylation through inhibition of poly(A) polymerase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Wild-type BY4741 (<italic>Mat a</italic>; <italic>his3&#x00394;1</italic>; <italic>leu2&#x00394;0</italic>; <italic>met15&#x00394;0</italic>; <italic>ura3&#x00394;0</italic>) and isogenic mutant strains were obtained from EUROSCARF.

Since temperature-sensitive mutations in the essential 3&#x02032; end formation factors Rna14p and Rna15p render yeast cells sensitive to cordycepin (3&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), we reasoned that a growth phenotype in the presence of this drug may identify mutant strains involved in poly(A) metabolism. Cordycepin is taken up by the yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and converted into the RNA-chain terminating CoTP, which is a substrate for RNA synthesis. The presence of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml cordycepin in the medium has only mild toxic effects on wild-type cells and increased the doubling time in liquid culture by &#x0223c;20% (data not shown). In contrast, a strain lacking the 3&#x02032; end formation factor Ref2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) showed severe growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, strains lacking non-essential genes involved in poly(A) metabolism can be identified through cordycepin-hypersensitive growth. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains display cordycepin-hypersensitive growth.

Pho84p is a high-affinity phosphate transporter, Pho85p and Pho80p form a cyclin-CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) pair and Pho81p is an associated CDK inhibitor; the Pho4p transcription factor (the target of the Pho85p/Pho80p complex) in its hypo-phosphorylated form associates with the homeodomain transcription factor Pho2p to drive the expression of phosphate-regulated genes, like e.g. the Pho5p secreted acid phosphatase.

The entire results of this screening will be presented elsewhere (S.H. and B.D., unpublished data). Here we focus on the further characterization of cordycepin-hypersensitive growth observed with <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Complementation of the mutant strains with plasmids carrying wild-type <italic>PHO85</italic> and <italic>PHO80</italic> genes, respectively, demonstrated a direct requirement for these genes for cordycepin resistance. Empty plasmids, in contrast, did not complement. Pho85p kinase and its cyclin partner Pho80p form a complex and are central regulators of the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). However, Pho85p can associate with nine other cyclins to perform functions in various cellular pathways including the cell cycle, carbon-source utilization and glycogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). We also tested mutant strains of seven other Pho85p cyclins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C; <italic>&#x00394;pcl1</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pcl2</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pcl6</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pcl7</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pcl8</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pcl9</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;clg1</italic>). Since we could not observe sensitivity with these strains, the cordycepin-hypersensitive growth of <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> appeared to be mainly linked to their function in phosphate homeostasis. The absence of Pho85p or Pho80p results in constitutively active transcription of phosphate-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). To evaluate the relation of other <italic>PHO</italic> pathway components and the observed cordycepin sensitivity, we analyzed strains lacking the transcription factors Pho4p and Pho2p, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p, the high-affinity phosphate transporter Pho84p and the target gene <italic>PHO5</italic> (encoding a secreted acid phosphatase). None of these strains reacted to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and data not shown).

Therefore, we isolated total RNA from wild-type and mutant strains and analyzed the length distribution of cellular poly(A). The protocol for poly(A) labeling that we employed included the transfer of radioactively labeled [&#x003b1;<sup>32</sup>P]-CoTP to 3&#x02032;-OH groups present in the RNA preparation with recombinant yeast poly(A) polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). With wild-type RNA, a uniformly distributed length of approximately 10&#x02013;70 adenosines was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Quite unexpectedly, we were unable to label any poly(A) isolated from <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains under standard assay conditions (i.e. 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We considered the possibility that some inhibitory activity may be present in the RNA preparations of the mutant strains interfering with the activity of poly(A) polymerase and performed the labeling assay with decreasing amounts of total RNA. We observed that a 4- to 8-fold dilution of the total RNA from <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains indeed allowed poly(A) labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, reduced amounts of wild-type RNA gave increased labeling efficiency. We conclude that an inhibitory activity was present in the total RNA preparations from <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains interfering with the poly(A) labeling test and that the same inhibitor was also present in wild-type RNA, albeit at lower concentration. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains accumulate poly P, an inhibitor of poly(A) polymerase.

No poly(A) was detected when reaction buffer replaced Ppx1p or when the Ppx1p was heat-denatured prior to use. Interestingly, the labeling efficiency of wild-type RNA following Ppx1p pre-treatment was also enhanced, demonstrating the presence of poly P also in wild-type RNA, consistent with our poly P measurements in wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

Under the conditions employed, yeast Pap1p extended the primer to &#x0223c;300 to 400 adenosines in 60 min.

This effect was stronger with 20 nM poly P<sub>750</sub> and 200 nM resulted in almost complete inhibition. Similar effects were observed when poly P of varying length (average of 28 and 61 phosphate residues) was tested (data not shown).

When 20 nM to 2 &#x003bc;M of poly P<sub>750</sub> were included in the reaction, the length of the products was reduced but inhibition was not complete.

A possible explanation for the inhibitory effect on poly(A) polymerase activity could be the chelation of magnesium ions which are essential for Pap1p function. However, the magnesium in our assays is present in large molar excess over inhibitory poly P concentrations (calculated as the amount of free inorganic phosphate). Therefore, we considered the possibility that poly P may inhibit the enzymes by direct binding. To test this, we performed filter-binding assays with radioactively labeled poly P<sub>750</sub> and yeast or bovine poly(A) polymerase. We determined an apparent dissociation constant of 0.38 nM for the yeast enzyme and of 2.7 nM for the bovine enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It has to be pointed out, however, that one poly P molecule is likely to provide multiple binding sites for Pap1p. Therefore, it seems possible that binding was influenced by avidity effects.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, poly P binding did not result in precipitation of the enzyme. Thus, unspecific aggregation can be excluded as a possible reason for the observed inhibition. To test whether the inhibition of poly P on Pap1p activity was reversible, we pre-incubated Pap1p with 200 nM poly P to allow binding of poly P and Pap1p. As expected, this resulted in strong inhibition of polyadenylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 7&#x02013;11). However, Pap1p activity could be almost completely restored by treatment of the Pap1p&#x02013;poly P complexes with Ppx1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 12&#x02013;16). This demonstrated that the inhibition of Pap1p by poly P was reversible.</p><p>The Pap1p that we used in the poly(A) length analysis and in the polyadenylation assay was purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, which also contains poly P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Thus, purified Pap1p may already be partially bound to poly P causing a partial inhibition of the enzymatic activity. To test this, we performed a polyadenylation assays with Pap1p that was pretreated with Ppx1p. Since the treatment did not noticeably increase the activity of Pap1p preparation (data not shown), we conclude that most of Pap1p that we used in our experiments was not pre-bound by poly P. This indicated that the conditions used for over-expression of Pap1p did not induce significant poly P accumulation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Poly P accumulation contributes to cordycepin sensitivity</title><p>We showed that <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains are cordycepin hypersensitive, that these strains accumulated poly P and that poly P acted as an efficient inhibitor of poly(A) polymerase. These observations suggested a correlation between cellular poly P accumulation and the drug-dependent growth defect. Ogawa and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) reported accumulation of poly P in strains mutant for <italic>PHM5</italic>, <italic>PHM6</italic>, <italic>PHM2</italic> and <italic>CTF19</italic> during the so-called &#x02018;overplus&#x02019; conditions. However, we could not observe cordycepin-hypersensitive growth associated with these mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Moreover, our poly P measurements in these strains did not indicate a significant increase of the polymer under conditions, which revealed a strong increase in <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The differences between the measurements presented here and in Ogawa <italic>et al</italic>. are possibly due to differences in growth conditions at the time of measurement. Furthermore, our recent genome-wide assessment of poly P metabolism failed to identify other mutants that would result in poly P accumulation comparable to levels observed in <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It seems possible, therefore, that cordycepin-hypersensitive growth is a consequence of elevated poly P levels exceeding a certain threshold in <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains and that such levels are not achieved or stably maintained in other mutants defective in poly P metabolism.</p><p>To further test whether cordycepin sensitivity was due to poly P accumulation in <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> mutants, we interfered with the ability of the strains to synthesize poly P and asked whether this alleviated cordycepin sensitivity. When low concentrations of phosphate (0.1 mM) are present in the medium growth of the yeast is only marginally reduced, but no significant poly P accumulation can be measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We tested <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains on plates containing cordycepin but low phosphate and found that <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains showed significant resistance to cordycepin under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). This observation suggested that abundant phosphate was required for the observed cordycepin hypersensitivity. Furthermore, the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway regulates poly P accumulation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D shows that cellular levels of poly P were significantly reduced in <italic>&#x00394;pho2</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pho4</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho84</italic> mutants compared to wild type. We produced double mutants of <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> and other components of the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway and found that <italic>&#x00394;pho80 &#x00394;pho4</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;pho80 &#x00394;pho2</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80 &#x00394;pho84</italic> double mutants did not accumulate poly P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The cellular poly P content of the analyzed double mutants correlated well with a loss of cordycepin hypersensitivity associated with the single <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). These observations are consistent with the proposal that poly P accumulation in <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains contributed to cordycepin hypersensitivity. Increased cellular poly P levels may interfere with poly(A) polymerase activity, and this may cause hypersensitive growth in the presence of cordycepin, another inhibitor of RNA synthesis.</p><p>To further test this idea we asked whether a temperature-sensitive mutation in the 3&#x02032; end formation factor Rna14p (<italic>rna14-1</italic>) can duplicate the effects observed with cordycepin in <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> mutants. It was previously shown that combination of mutations in <italic>rna14</italic> and <italic>pap1</italic> resulted in a synthetic growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and <italic>rna14</italic> mutant strains are cordycepin hypersensitive [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>); our unpublished data]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E shows that combination of the <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> mutation with the <italic>rna14-1</italic> allele indeed resulted in synthetic lethality.

We propose that a synergistic effect of poly P-mediated inhibition of poly(A) polymerase together with inhibition of RNA synthesis by CoTP can cause lethality. Synthetic lethality observed between <italic>PHO80</italic> and an essential factor involved in 3&#x02032; end formation underscores this assumption. Poly P may therefore play a role in the regulation of poly(A) polymerase activity.</p><p>The starting point of this work was an unbiased genome-wide screen for mutants that showed hypersensitive and/or resistant growth in the presence of cordycepin. The rational for this screen was that cordycepin will be converted to CoTP, which will then provoke RNA-chain termination in the nucleus. Although CoTP will terminate RNA synthesis when incorporated during transcription, it seems possible that polyadenylation would be a more sensitive target since up to 70 consecutive adenosines are incorporated during this process. This may be particularly pronounced under the low cordycepin conditions (40 &#x003bc;g/ml) that were employed during our screening; as expected, mutants in 3&#x02032; end formation factors displayed hypersensitive growth in the presence of such cordycepin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and data not shown). Although it remains unclear which other cellular ATP-consuming activities are sensitive to cordycepin or CoTP, cordycepin-hypersensitive growth can be indicative of a functional involvement of a mutation in 3&#x02032; end formation and poly(A) metabolism. A complete account of the results obtained from our cordycepin-dependent growth screening will be presented elsewhere (S.H. and B.D., unpublished data). However, no additional links emerged between cordycepin hypersensitivity and poly P metabolism other than the one presented here for <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains.</p><p>The kinase activity of the Pho85p/Pho80p CDK&#x02013;cyclin complex controls phosphate-dependent gene expression by regulating both the activity and localization of the Pho4p transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Interestingly, poly P was proposed to act as a phosphate buffer that can be mobilized to maintain constant internal phosphate levels under conditions where external phosphate levels fluctuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway was linked to expression of genes that are involved in poly P homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). As a consequence, constitutive activation of the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway (e.g. in <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains) was expected to result in increased poly P levels. However, Ogawa and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) could not observe increased levels of poly P in <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains. In contrast, it was reported that <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> strains have increased poly P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). We re-evaluated the poly P content of <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains and detected an approximately 3-fold increase in both strains compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We attribute these conflicting poly P measurements to fluctuations of poly P levels in the yeast depending on the growth state and recently proposed a standardized procedure for poly P determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>We found that the presence of increased amounts of co-purified poly P in RNA preparations from <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> strains was accompanied by a strong inhibition of poly(A) polymerase activity. Consistent with our observations, previous biochemical work on the effects of poly P on yeast Pap1p revealed an inhibitory activity on tRNA primed poly(A) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). We show in this work by filter-binding assays that poly P directly binds to yeast Pap1p with a <italic>k</italic><sub>D</sub> in the low nanomolar range (0.38 nM). This value is comparable to the <italic>k</italic><sub>D</sub> of 0.48 nM that was determined for the poly P&#x02013;Lon interaction, which stimulates Lon protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Pap1p and Lon are thus the interactors with the highest reported affinities for poly P. Consistent with a physiological relevant role for the interaction of poly P and Pap1p, nuclear poly P levels were reported to reach micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>); furthermore, nuclei predominantly contain poly P of an average chain length of approximately 45 phosphate residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and poly P with similar length (poly P<sub>28</sub> and poly P<sub>61</sub>) acted as efficient inhibitor of Pap1p in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We have not delineated the binding site of poly P on Pap1p, but potential interaction surfaces include regions of RNA primer binding or of ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Notably, binding of poly P to bovine poly(A) polymerase and inhibition of its activity is approximately 10-fold weaker compared to the yeast enzyme. This may have important consequences on a potential <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of poly P and poly(A) polymerases in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>What is the biological role of poly P-mediated inhibition of poly(A) polymerase activity? We predict that such a function must be connected to growth conditions that are accompanied by high poly P concentrations and that the control of poly P levels is at least partially under control of the <italic>PHO</italic> pathway. We recently showed that poly P content reaches a peak when cells experience the diauxic shift following depletion of glucose from the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). This growth phase is characterized by major changes in the gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). It seems possible that the down-regulation of many hundreds of genes during diauxic shift is accompanied by an inhibition of polyadenylation. In this context, it is worth pointing out that cellular poly(A) levels inversely correlate with poly P levels when cells enter diauxic shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Our observation that the inhibitory effects of poly P on Pap1p were completely reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D) may indicate that poly P action can be transient and controlled through a dynamic nuclear poly P metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Furthermore, fluctuations of nuclear poly P levels may interfere with RNA processing in a microenvironment as was suggested for the regulation of the bacterial degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Since no global polyadenylation defect could be observed at steady state in <italic>&#x00394;pho80</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;pho85</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) poly P may act on specific gene loci and not as a general suppressor of Pap1p activity. A deeper understanding of poly P biochemistry and metabolism will be required to address these possibilities in future experiments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We want to thank Georges Martin (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland) for the generous gift of purified yeast and bovine poly(A) polymerases and C.
