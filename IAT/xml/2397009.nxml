Genomic rearrangements do not contribute to a significant proportion of mutations in MSH6, but missense variants are relatively common and their pathogenicity can be uncertain. HNPCC families may be ascertained through an individual presenting with EC, and recognition of these families is important so that appropriate cancer surveillance can be put in place.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endometrial</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>MSH6</kwd><kwd>HNPCC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>HNPCC is an autosomal dominant highly penetrant cancer-susceptibility syndrome caused by germline mutations in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, namely MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

All families who met the Amsterdam I and II criteria were included. In addition, inclusion criteria was extended to families with a clustering of CRC, or other HNPCC related cancer, with at least three affected family members (age not restricted), or at least two family members if the age of onset was below 50 years with pedigrees suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, or an individual with CRC diagnosed less than 35 years &#x02013; similar to the Bethesda criteria. Probands were contacted with information regarding the study, and a consent form with a stamped addressed envelope (SAE) to return if they wished to participate.

One hundred and eighty-eight potential participants were contacted, and one hundred and twenty-five participants were recruited to this cohort. Age ranged from twenty-six to eighty-four, with a mean age of 58.9 years.

A further eight missense mutations were identified, of which the functional significance is not known at this time. A summary of results is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table I</xref>. At the time of study design, only estimates of total prevalence were available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and the cohort sizes actually attained in the study were smaller than planned. This is reflected in lower precision (wider confidence limits) in the estimates than had originally been specified.</p><sec><title>HNPCC Cohort</title><p>A definite pathogenic mutation was identified in 2.6% of the HNPCC cohort. These results are comparable with other studies carried out on Amsterdam, Amsterdam II and &#x02018;HNPCC like&#x02019; families &#x02013; estimates range between 2% and 5% - who have a germline mutation in MSH6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Further work on the missense variants is required to determine their pathogenicity, as the yield of MSH6 mutations in the HNPCC cohort could increase up to 7% if these are found to be significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Endometrial cohort</title><p>A truncating germline mutation was identified in 3.8% of the endometrial cohort. This is higher than that obtained for the HNPCC cohort of whom the majority were &#x02018;HNPCC like&#x02019;, thereby broadening the criteria to fit with the described characteristics of a MSH6 phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This prevalence figure is also likely to increase following further work (including immunohistochemistry), being carried out on the missense variants as some of these may be pathogenic.</p><p>There are few studies looking at MSH6 in EC. Comparison can be difficult to make between studies because of pre-selection of some study groups of EC patients by age restriction or tumour microsatellite instability. Goodfellow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> estimated the minimum prevalence of inherited MSH6 mutations in EC to be 1.6%, from a sub-population of an EC cohort, selected for molecular analysis, the majority of which showed tumour microsatellite instability (MSI). A comparable figure is seen by Berends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> one MSH6 mutation identified in a cohort of 58 EC patients diagnosed less than 50 years whose families fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria. Higher figures of 4.7%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and 8.3%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, have been observed in EC cohorts not restricted by age or the limitations of the Amsterdam II criteria, but where the majority of tumours exhibit MSI, although the significance of the latter study will be limited by its relatively small cohort.</p><p>As well as the heterogeneous populations studied, the variability in frequency of MSH6 mutations in both HNPCC and endometrial cohorts can also be accounted for by the sensitivity of techniques used to identify variants, the use of MSI and IHC to target molecular screening of MMR genes, and the interpretation of missense mutations which occur relatively frequently in MSH6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Founder mutations in certain populations can also contribute to higher than average prevalence rates of MMR genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Further work on functional, population and family studies is required to determine the pathogenicity of the eight missense mutations identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic Rearrangements</title><p>Genomic rearrangements account for between 17%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> to 54.8% of pathogenic mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 in HNPCC families<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The prevalence of genomic rearrangements in MSH6 is less well studied, but it had been estimated that rearrangements may account for 10&#x02013;20% of mutations in MSH6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. No genomic rearrangements were identified in our HNPCC cohort consistent with findings by Charbonnier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and Wagner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Likewise genomic rearrangements were not detected in any of our EC patients in keeping with findings by Ollikaninen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Studies that have identified MSH6 genomic rearrangements have been particularly large HNPCC cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, or EC cohorts pre-selected by MSI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, yielding a genomic rearrangement in MSH6 in less than 1% of the chosen population.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter Region</title><p>Sequencing is highly sensitive for detection of mutations in the coding regions; however the promoter region of MSH6 was not sequenced in this study.</p><p>Previous studies have mainly concentrated on coding regions, and exonic / intronic boundaries. Two deletions of the MSH6 promoter region have been described in HNPCC families<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, but other studies looking at the promoter region of MSH6 in EC cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> or in HNPCC patients negative for a mutation in MLH1 or MSH2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, did not identify any pathogenic mutations. Studies looking specifically at the promoter region of the more prevalent MMR genes, MLH1 and MSH2, identified three possible pathogenic mutations in the promoter area in 141 HNPCC patients and patients with early onset CRC (&#x0003c;45 years)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Given that MSH6 mutations occur at a relatively low rate in both HNPCC and EC patients, we can assume that mutations of the promoter region in either cohort are unlikely to significantly alter the prevalence figures calculated from this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Redundancy of MSH6 mutations</title><p>Although germline mutations in MSH6 are distributed throughout the length of MSH6 displaying little redundancy, the majority of pathogenic mutations identified are in exon 4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, with fifty-seven percent of truncating mutations identified in this study (4/7) occurring in exon 4, the largest of MSH6 exons, indicating that analysis of MSH6 in HNPCC families without a known mutation should commence at exon 4.</p></sec><sec><title>MSH6 phenotype</title><p>None of the truncating mutations identified in this study met the original Amsterdam criteria, the majority having a &#x02018;HNPCC like&#x02019; phenotype, with a later age of cancer onset, and non-penetrance in family members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table IV</xref>). This further supports current evidence that application of the Amsterdam criteria to HNPCC families to select for molecular testing will result in a significant proportion of MSH6 mutations being missed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table IV</label><caption><p>Classification of families with a MSH6 variant identified</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Truncating</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Missense</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amsterdam I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amsterdam II</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02018;HNPCC like&#x02019;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not HNPCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Previously unidentified HNPCC families</title><p>Eighteen out of 125 participants (14.4%) from the endometrial cohort had a significant previously unidentified HNPCC phenotype. Five of these participants had a variant identified, three truncating mutations and two missense mutations. These findings are in keeping with findings from other studies where previously unidentified HNPCC families have been ascertained through an individual with EC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Increased awareness of HNPCC and other hereditary cancer syndromes amongst physicians/surgeons directly involved with the care of cancer patients such as gynaecologists, surgeons, oncologists, and general practitioners is essential for their identification.</p></sec><sec><title>Endometrial Cancer</title><p>HNPCC, traditionally identified as a condition with a genetic predisposition to CRC, has now been recognised as conferring a significant risk of EC to females, particularly those with a mutation in MSH6. In addition to other Mendelian inherited syndromes with a predisposition to EC such as Muir Torr&#x000e9;, Cowden and Turcot syndrome, there are families who show a clustering of EC alone that do not have an identifiable molecular basis. Un-identified genes or predisposing low penetrant polymorphisms may contribute. The importance of environmental factors conferring a risk to the development of EC cannot be underestimated. Obesity is associated with increased levels of endogenous oestrogens, and is a significant risk factor for the development of EC. Mean BMI in the endometrial cohort was 30.65 and ranged from 18.64&#x02013;53.15, with only 28 (22.4%) of participants having a BMI within the normal range (&#x0003c;25). In comparison it is estimated that 44% of UK females over 16 years have a BMI within the normal range. (Figures published by the Department of Health and estimated by the Health Survey for England 2003; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"/>).</p><p>The mean BMI for the four participants from the endometrial cohort with a truncating mutation in MSH6 was 26.2, ranging from 22.36&#x02013;31.05. One of these participants had a BMI in the overweight range, and one had a BMI in the obese range. It is likely that obesity has an additive effect to the underlying risk form a MMR mutation, but larger studies would be required to determine this.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From this study we have identified the minimum prevalence of pathogenic mutations in MSH6 to be higher in an unselected cohort of EC patients, than a cohort of HNPCC patients who have been selected by criteria &#x02018;widened&#x02019; from the traditional Amsterdam II criteria, in keeping with the described phenotype of MSH6. Unlike the other more common MMR genes, genomic rearrangements do not contribute to a large proportion of mutations in MSH6.</p><p>HNPCC families may not be identified if patients present with HNPCC associated cancers, such as gynaecological cancer, rather than the more commonly recognised phenotype of CRC. Clinicians should be vigilant to this possibility when presented with a history of endometrial cancer in young women. Further work on immunohistochemistry of possible missense variants may increase the true frequency of mutations in MSH6.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thank-you to Peter Logan for his help with technical difficulties, to Prof. Glenn McCluggage for help with recruitment of the endometrial cancer patients and to Dr Chris Patterson for help with statistics.
