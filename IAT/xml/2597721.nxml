However, the NIK1&#x02013;NSP interaction does not fit into the elicitor&#x02013;receptor model of resistance, and hence the molecular mechanism that links this antiviral response to receptor activation remains obscure. Here, we identified a ribosomal protein, rpL10A, as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1 that functions as an immediate downstream effector of NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus where it may act to modulate viral infection. While ectopic expression of normal NIK1 or a hyperactive NIK1 mutant promotes the accumulation of phosphorylated rpL10A within the nuclei, an inactive NIK1 mutant fails to redirect the protein to the nuclei of co-transfected cells. Likewise, a mutant rpL10A defective for NIK1 phosphorylation is not redirected to the nucleus. Furthermore, loss of rpL10A function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, resembling the phenotype of <italic>nik1</italic> null alleles. We also provide evidence that geminivirus infection directly interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. However, the NIK1-mediated defense signaling neither activates RNA silencing nor promotes a hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development. Although the virulence function of the particular geminivirus NSP studied here overcomes this layer of defense in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the NIK1-mediated signaling response may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plants are constantly exposed to microorganisms and, like animals, developed innate immune systems to prevent infections. Although these immune systems protect plants against most potential pathogens, the molecular mechanisms underlying nonhost immunity remain obscure. Here, we describe a novel strategy of plant defenses identified as a target of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) that suppresses the activity of the transmembrane receptor NIK (NSP-interacting kinase). In addition, we identified a ribosomal protein, rpL10A, as the immediate downstream component of the pathway. Based on our findings, we propose that this pathway is elicited by activation of the receptor NIK1, which results in phosphorylation and translocation of rpL10A to the nucleus. We also provided genetic and biochemical evidence that this regulated trafficking of rpL10A may effectively mount a defense strategy that negatively impacts geminivirus proliferation or movement. Nevertheless, the virulence function of NSP from the bipartite geminivirus CaLCuV (<italic>Cabbage leaf curl virus</italic>) is capable of overcoming the NIK1-mediated defense and thereby enhances the pathogenicity of CaLCuV in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

We also performed the reverse experiment with a mutant rpL10A (QM104, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s003">Figures S2B and S2C</xref>) in which the replacement of a serine residue, position 104, to alanine blocked NIK1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 4) and hence impaired NIK1-mediated nuclear redirection of the mutant rpL10A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, QM104).</p><p>To further confirm that the translocation of rpL10A to the nuclei was driven by phosphorylation, we directly monitored the presence of rpL10A phosphoproteins in the nuclei of NIK1, T474D or G473V/T474A co-transfected tobacco leaf cells by immunoblotting of nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In YFP-rpL10A-expressing tobacco leaf cells, a small fraction of hypophosphorylated rpL10A accumulated in the nuclei of transfected cells (lane 1). However, ectopic expression of <italic>NIK1</italic> increased the nuclear concentration of YFP-rpL10A proteins as a slower migrating electrophoretic band (lane 2), which was reversed to the normal lower YFP-rpL10A band by alkaline phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts (compare lanes 2 and 6). This result indicates that the observed change in electrophoretic migration of the YFP-fusion was due to phosphorylation. In support of this, co-expression of rpL10A with an inactive NIK1 (G473V/T474A) did not change the normal electrophoretic pattern of the nuclear localized YFP-rpL10A (lane 3) and hyperactive NIK1 (T474D) intensified the accumulation of nuclear phosphorylated rpL10A (lane 4). The increased accumulation of phosphorylated rpL10A-YFP and GFP-rpL10A in the nucleus mediated by NIK1 expression was not an apparent effect on protein stability due to phosphorylation because rpL10A when expressed alone or with NIK, as well as the mutant QM104, which is not phosphorylated by NIK1, accumulated to similar extent in agroinoculated tobacco leaves (data not shown and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that phosphorylation of rpL10A by NIK1 relocates the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</p><p>Because interaction of NIK1 with its substrate rpL10A is difficult to detect <italic>in vivo</italic> by co-immunoprecipitation, probably due to its transient nature along with the pre-requisite of receptor activation, we anticipated that overexpression of the constitutively active T474D mutant receptor and mutant rpL10A (QM104) in our transient co-expression assays would facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> detection of NIK1-rpL10A complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Accordingly, while rpL10A could be only detected in complexes formed with T474D (lane 2), the rpL10A mutant associated detectably <italic>in vivo</italic> with both NIK1 (lane 4) and T474D (lane 5). In contrast, neither intact rpL10A nor mutant rpL10A (QM104) interacted with the inactive G473V/T474A mutant receptor (lanes 3 and 6), which in fact was not expected to assume a proper conformation for substrate binding due to the lack of autophosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This was not the case for NIK1 because we could not detect NIK1-rpL10A complex formation under the conditions of our experiment but we did detect binding between NIK1 and QM104. The complex formed between NIK1 and QM104 is expected to be sufficiently stable to be detected in our assay because QM104 cannot be phosphorylated by NIK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Using NSP as marker, we confirmed that the formation of punctuate YFP-rpL10A bodies was induced by geminivirus infection.

Our results indicate that rpL10A plays an important role in plant defense response as a downstream effector of NIK1 signaling. To examine whether L10 would function as a component of the silencing machinery we used a RNA silencing-inducing approach by co-expressing GFP, an inverted repeat GFP RNA as a strong silencing inducer (dsGFP) and a test or control construct in leaf epidermal cells upon agroinfiltration. Expression of GFP was visualized under UV light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s008">Figure S7A</xref>) and transcript accumulation was detected by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s008">Figure S7B</xref>). As expected, expression of the viral HC-Pro control protein suppressed GFP-directed silencing in the transient system by supporting GFP transcript and protein accumulation in the presence of dsGFP expression. Expression of rpL10A either alone or with NIK1 did not suppress dsGFP-mediated GFP silencing. More importantly, inactivation of the endogenous rpL10A homolog by expression of dsrpL10A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s008">Figure S7B</xref>, NbL10 lanes 9 and 10) did not prevent GFP-directed silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s008">Figure S7A</xref>, panel 10). These results indicate that rpL10A is not likely to function in RNA silencing. We also investigated whether NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A would trigger a hypersensitive response as expected for a gene-for-gene resistance mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Bent1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Co-expression of rpL10A and NIK1 or constitutively hyperactive NIK1 in tobacco infiltrated leaves neither caused necrotic lesions nor induced PR genes expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s009">Figures S8A and S8B</xref>), disfavoring an effector-triggered immune response as the basis for NIK1-mediated defense. More likely the NIK1-mediated response represents a novel layer of the innate host defenses that may act on basic compatibility processes to negatively affect virus infection at the expense of normal growth. Accordingly we found that overexpression of <italic>NIK1</italic> in tomato inhibited plant growth and development, a scenario that is likely to impose constraints to virus proliferation and/or spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g005">Figures 5D and 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite extensive studies investigating how viruses influence their hosts, our knowledge about host factors controlling viral disease is still incipient. Here we describe a novel strategy of plant defense response against virus. We propose that this pathway is elicited by activation of the transmembrane receptor NIK1 which results in phosphorylation and translocation of rpL10A to the nucleus. We also provided genetic and biochemical evidence that shuttling of rpL10A may effectively mount a defense strategy that negatively impacts geminivirus proliferation or movement. Firstly, inactivation of <italic>rpL10A</italic> gene enhances geminivirus susceptibility, a phenotype resembling that of <italic>nik1</italic> knockout lines. Furthermore, geminivirus infection interferes with the nucleocytoplasmic shutting of rpL10A and the ribosomal protein forms dispersed punctate corpuscles over the cytoplasm of infected cells. This induced-change in rpL10A subcellular localization may result from suppressing NIK1 kinase activity by the viral NSP protein. NSP inhibits kinase activity of NIK1 by binding to the activation-loop and preventing autophosphorylation of regulatory threonine residue (data not shown). In our infection/expression transient assay in TGMV-infected tobacco leaves, concomitant overexpression of NIK1 restores the normal subcellular localization of YFP-rpL10A, which favors the argument that the produced TGMV NSP inhibitor is titrated out by a molar excess of exogenously introduced NIK1. These results may provide a direct <italic>in vivo</italic> link between NSP virulence and NIK1 defense functions, strongly suggesting that NSP physically associates with and inhibits NIK1 <italic>in vivo</italic> as well. Consistent with this hypothesis overexpression of NIK1 in tomato attenuates symptoms and delays the onset of ToYSV infection. Nevertheless, constitutive expression of <italic>AtNIK1</italic> under the control of 35S promoter in tomato plants also led to growth inhibition under optimal growth conditions.</p><p>The virulence function of NSP by targeting and inhibiting the NIK1 kinase activity is likely to enhance the pathogenicity of CaLCuV in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Thus, it is not surprising that the enhanced susceptibility phenotype displayed by single mutants of <italic>rpL10A</italic> or <italic>NIK</italic> alleles can only be monitored by challenging <italic>Arabidposis</italic> with an attenuated form of the virus. In fact, <italic>CP</italic> null mutants of CaLCuV DNA-A delays infection and attenuates symptoms in wild type lines but not in <italic>nik1</italic> or <italic>rpl10a</italic> knockouts in which the coat protein-less mutant promotes wild type-like infection. In bipartite geminiviruses, the coat protein has been demonstrated to act as an auxiliary protein for NSP function by increasing the accumulation of viral ssDNA, the substrate for NSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Qin1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the coat protein may indirectly stimulate the NSP shuttling function and thereby may increase the efficiency of intracellular viral DNA trafficking, potentiating viral infection. As an inhibitor of NIK kinase activity, the level of NSP inhibition will depend on the ratio of NSP and NIK concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000247.s007">Figure S6</xref>). Because concentration of viral produced NSP in infected cells will depend on the dosage of accumulated viral DNA, the variation on infection efficiency promoted by wild type or CaLCuV mutants will affect the extent to which NIK-mediated pathway is inhibited. Furthermore, both NIK and rpL10 are encoded by small gene families (three gene copies) whose members may functionally substitute for one another. Functional redundancy of rpL10 family may explain why we did not observe any phenotypic variation between <italic>rpl10a</italic> knockout and wild type lines grown under normal conditions. These observations may also implicate a gene dosage-like effect on NIK-NSP interaction, which may explain at least in part a wild type-like infection promoted by <italic>CP</italic> null mutants in <italic>nik1</italic> and <italic>rpl10a</italic> genetic background. If this is the case, in a triple <italic>rpL10A</italic> mutant, the infection rate by CaLCuV would be enhanced to such extent that would be possible to distinguish it from a relatively lower rate of infection displayed by wild type lines infected by wild type CaLCuV. Nevertheless, the essential character of ribosomal genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Barakat1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> is likely to complicate attempts at further pursuing these experiments.</p><p>Our current findings together with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Fontes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> support a proposed mechanistic model for NIK1-mediated signaling pathway and its interaction with geminiviral protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000247-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In response to unidentified stimuli, the LRR extracellular domain undergoes oligomerization bringing the intracellular kinase domains into close proximity to transphosphorylate and to activate one another. <italic>In vitro</italic> kinetic studies on NIK1 kinase activity and activation provided evidence that oligomerization of NIK1 precedes transphosphorylation and activation of the kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Fontes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The active kinase recruits and phosphorylates the downstream component rpL10A, which results in translocation of the ribosomal protein to the nucleus where it may function to directly mount a defense response that negatively impacts virus replication and/or movement. Alternatively or additionally, as a putative translational control factor, redirecting rpL10A to the nucleus may shut down protein synthesis, thereby impairing virus infection. Counteracting the pathway activation mechanism, binding of NSP to the kinase domain impairs autophosphorylation of regulatory threonine residues within the A-loop and hence prevents activation of NIK1 and the subsequent translocation of rpL10A to the nucleus. Thus, upon geminivirus infection, rpL10A is trapped within the cytoplasm as punctate corpuscles to prevent the establishment of a host environment that disfavors virus proliferation and/or spread.</p><fig id="ppat-1000247-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000247.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model for NIK1-mediated signaling pathway.</title><p>Stress-induced oligomerization of the extracellular domain of NIK1 brings the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and allows them to transphosphorylate and activate one another.

Yeast rpL10A is required for joining of the 40S and 60S subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Eisinger1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and for large subunit nuclear export through direct interaction with Nmd3p, a NES (nuclear export signal)-containing protein that is specifically associated with 60S subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Gadal1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. By analogy with the yeast rpL10A homolog, one may predict that relocation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> rpL10A to the nucleus would interfere in both ribosome subunit assembly and 60S subunit export from the nucleus, which would affect general translation and hence impair virus infection. Alternative mechanisms for rpL10A action would invoke extraribosomal functions like those described for other eukaryotic homologs. The <italic>rpL10A</italic> gene (At1g14320) is closely related to QM originally identified from the Wilms' tumor cell line as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Dowdy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and has been shown to regulate the proto-oncogene <italic>c-Yes</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Oh1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

These putative rpL10A functions, translational control and cell proliferation suppression, may serve as potential host defense strategies against virus. The identification of downstream targets of rpL10A is crucial to decipher this layer of innate defense and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of a defense signaling that has the potential to interfere with normal developmental and cell proliferation events. Because a productive viral infection depends extensively on host biochemical and physiological performance, the NIK-mediated defense responses are likely to target other phytoviruses as well. The NIK1-overexpressing lines will allow us to address the effectiveness of this innate defense strategy on other virus compatible interactions.</p><p>In summary, the present characterization of the NIK1-mediated signaling pathway uncovered a novel strategy of plant defenses and provided new insights into the molecular basis for bipartite begomovirus virulence. In fact, this pathway was identified by the virulence function of NSP from CaLCuV that suppresses the NIK1 receptor kinase activity and hence impairs the innate response stoichiometrically. Likewise, the virulence function of NSP from ToYSV is likely to target and inhibit the tomato NIK counterpart, because overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis NIK1</italic> in tomato delays the onset of geminivirus infection. However, in nonhost-virus interactions, a sustained NIK signaling is likely to prevent other virus from infection in most plants, because NIK is conserved in plant species from the <italic>Leguminosae</italic>, <italic>Solanaceae</italic> and <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Fontes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000247-Mariano1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.
