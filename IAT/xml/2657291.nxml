It is a multi-enzyme cascade whereby ubiquitin moieties are selectively transferred on to target molecules, which, in many cases, tags them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Specificity, in large part, is determined by the HECT (homologous with E6-associated protein C-terminus)- and RING (really interesting new gene)-type ubiquitin ligases that interact with their substrates via specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains. Nedd4 (neural-precursor-cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4) is a ubiquitously expressed HECT-domain-containing E3 ubiquitin&#x02013;protein ligase that has been shown to regulate the stability and/or localization of several membrane proteins through interactions of its WW (Trp-Trp) domain with substrate PY (Pro-Tyr) motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Nedd4 has been shown previously to increase in models of skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and has been shown to target Notch1 in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although the mechanisms by which Nedd4 contributes to the biological process of muscle breakdown are unknown. We sought to identify novel protein substrates of Nedd4 in muscle. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified a PY-motif-containing protein expressed in skeletal muscle, MTMR4 (myotubularin-related protein 4), that belongs to the family of PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatases)/DSPs (dual-specificity phosphatases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Myotubularins are 3&#x02032;-phosphatases specific for PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> and PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>. It has been proposed that myotubularins regulate endosome trafficking by dephosphorylation of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, MTMR4 is the only family member that possesses a PY motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and has a unique distribution to endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the major site of substrate lipid accumulation. In the present study, we found that MTMR4 and Nedd4 co-immunoprecipitate, interact via a WW domain&#x02013;PY motif interaction and co-localize in cells to the PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>-rich late/recycling endosomes. Using a rat model of denervation atrophy, we have confirmed that the increase in Nedd4 expression in atrophying muscle (compared with control muscle) is coincident with a decrease of MTMR4 in atrophying muscle. We demonstrate that Nedd4 ubiquitinates MTMR4 and that mutation of the MTMR4 PY motif inhibits Nedd4 binding and MTMR4 ubiquitination, suggesting that MTMR4 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> Nedd4 target. We propose that MTMR4 may play an important role in the progression of Nedd4-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cells were cultured at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

To determine whether MTMR4 protein levels are affected by denervation-induced atrophy, we performed Western blot analysis of protein lysate from experimental (denervated atrophied muscle) and control (contralateral innervated rat muscle) with anti-MTMR4 antibodies. We found that the antibody recognized several bands of different size (results not shown); many were differentially expressed in experimental compared with control limbs. The HEK-293 cell lysate, transfected with hMTMR4 cDNA, was run alongside the control and experimental insoluble muscle lysates to confirm the identity of MTMR4 in these fractions. A faint band (approx. 160&#x000a0;kDa) was recognized by the anti-MTMR4 antibodies in the control lysate, corresponding to what has been reported in previous studies with hMTMR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

Although this interaction has not been previously identified, it is not unexpected, as previous studies have shown an association of Nedd4 with phosphoinositides and an involvement in endocytosis. The N-terminal C2 lipid-binding domain of Nedd4 has been shown to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipid binding and membrane association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], in addition to mediating its own protein&#x02013;protein interactions that serve to localize it to apical rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The Nedd4 C2 domain displayed no preferences towards lipid composition in an <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay, but was shown to bind phosphoinositides, and this binding was partially augmented in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, the yeast Nedd4 homologue, Rsp5, has a well-defined role in endocytosis; the C2 domain of Rsp5 localizes it to the plasma membrane, where Rsp5 binds membrane phosphoinositides directly and directs ubiquitination of endosomal cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Little is known of the regulation and physiological role of MTMR4, but studies show a unique distribution to endosomal structures, the major site of substrate lipid (PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>) accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present study, we have shown that MTMR4 co-localizes with the late endosomal marker Rab7 in addition to the transferrin receptor, a marker for recycling endosomes. In addition, MTMR4 and Nedd4 both localize to areas of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> staining, all suggesting that MTMR4 and Nedd4 are co-localized to late endosomes. Phosphatase-inactive forms of MTMR4 or overexpression of wild-type MTMR4 were shown to inhibit EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This effect was abrogated if the MTMR4 FYVE domain was mutated, and was recapitulated by the expression of the FYVE domain alone at very high levels, promoting the notion that this family member mediates endosomal trafficking by engaging in specific interactions between its FYVE domain and endosomal phosphoinositides, thus affecting the balance of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> synthesis and degradation.</p><p>Mutations in other MTM family members are associated with muscle dysfunction. This is not unexpected, since muscle is the predominant location of MTM expression. In humans, MTM1 mutations are associated with XLMTM (X-linked myotubular myopathy), which is a congenital myopathy associated with major hypotonia at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The histopathology of skeletal muscle reveals small rounded fibres with central nuclei. <italic>Mtm1</italic>-knockout mice recapitulate the histological signs of XLMTM and show a progressive myopathy starting at a few weeks after birth, whereas muscle histology appears normal at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Adenoviral-mediated replacement of MTM1 reverses the myopathy completely, restoring muscle mass and contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This suggests that the defect in the muscle fibres is due to a defect in structural maintenance rather than an impairment of myogenesis, as was hypothesized previously. Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> MTMR3, the closest relative of MTMR4 and the only other family member to contain a FYVE domain, results in severe impairment of body movement, revealing a critical role for MTMR3 in maintaining muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, the finding that increased levels of Nedd4 in atrophied muscle correlate with a decrease in the levels of MTMR4 supports the notion of MTM family regulation of muscle structure and function.</p><p>The role of the Nedd4&#x02013;MTMR4 interaction in the physiological progression of muscle atrophy can be speculated upon. Phosphoinositides are important membrane lipids that regulate cell growth and survival, cell division and membrane trafficking through recruiting and activating effector proteins and enzymes that contain phosphoinositide-binding domains, to specific membrane microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The MTM substrate PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>, which is highly enriched in early endosomes and internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes late in the endosome pathway, plays a major role in endocytic trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Depletion of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> results in inefficient sorting and delayed trafficking of a number of proteins (such as internalized growth factor receptors) through the endocytic pathways to the late endosome and lysosome. A main function of the other MTM substrate, PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, is to catalyse the budding of vesicles from the late endosome as yeast mutations in Fab1p/PIKfyve kinase [the enzyme that phosphorylates PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> to PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>] results in enlarged poorly acidified vacuoles and late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus decreased levels of MTM expression, or alternatively MTM loss-of-function mutants, probably result in cellular dysfunction because of inadequate dephosphorylation of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> and PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> and dysregulation of the lipid signaling within the endocytic pathway. Experimental models examining the status of endosomal trafficking and receptor recycling in the absence of MTMR4 and/or mutants that are defective in its ubiquitination can address the contribution of Nedd4 to these processes and the participation of endosomal trafficking to the progression of muscle atrophy.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel Nedd4 target in muscle, the inositol phosphatase MTMR4, which implicates further a role for Nedd4 in regulating endosomal signalling and distinguishes a candidate for future studies examining the physiological role of Nedd4 action in atrophying muscle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge Lucy Osborne (University of Toronto), Chris Fladd (Hospital for Sick Children, SIDNET) and Brent Steer (University of Toronto) for their technical expertise and assistance.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">Canadian Institutes for Health Research</funding-source>.
