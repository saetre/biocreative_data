Taking the middle of ChIP-PET overlap region (i.e., a PET cluster) as the proxy for actual binding site locations, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Loh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, we plotted the ratio of the observed distance distribution between binding sites of PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004907-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and what would be expected in case of random binding. We observed a significant co-localization of PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR binding sites within distances of 500 bp or less. A Monte-Carlo assessment further confirmed that the enrichment of paired PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR binding sites is significant at FDR&#x0003c;0.05 when these bona fide individual binding sites are separated by &#x0003c;300 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004907-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We call these PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR site-pairs identified by our ChIP-PET sequencing as ChIP-PET <italic>heterosites</italic>, as they are the likely DNA interaction sites of putative PPAR&#x003b3;&#x02236;RXR heterodimers (Henceforth, we would also use the term monosites to refer to binding sites of PPAR&#x003b3; (or RXR) where no RXR (or PPAR&#x003b3;) present within the specified distance).The interval size is most likely determined by the number of fragments constituting a cluster and the initial shear size of the DNA fragments. As such, we considered a maximum interval of 200 bp in identifying heterosites. Individual NHR binding sites without another binding cluster within 200 bp are called monosites. Validations of these PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR binding at the monosites and heterosites by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004907-g004">Figure 4</xref>) found that heterosites had a significantly greater degree of occupancy than the monosites. Furthermore, this degree of occupancy for any individual site was not observed in undifferentiated cells (fibroblasts), where RXR is abundantly expressed but PPAR&#x003b3; is not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We then took 157 ChIP-PET determined mono- and heterosites and subjected them to ChIP-q-PCR validation for binding of PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004907-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The results of this validation first showed that on average, the moPET counts correlated with the qPCR outcomes: the higher the moPET, the greater the fold enrichment by qPCR. The second observation is that almost all of the monosites as determined by ChIP-PET for PPAR&#x003b3; were also bound by RXR in qPCR validation. The reverse was also true in that almost all ChIP-PET based monosites for RXR also bound PPAR&#x003b3; by qPCR. This is supported by the fold enrichment levels of PPAR&#x003b3; or RXR at any binding site that exceeded the adaptive threshold cutoff. Regardless of whether monosites or heterosites are used, both NHR bound with the same relative degree to each binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s015">Table S4</xref>).What discrepancies were attributable to a small number of low order binding sites of approximately 1.5&#x02013;2 fold enrichment where occupancy of the heterodimer partner could not be detected. Given that each of the ChIP-PET sequencing runs were only 63&#x02013;65&#x00025; saturated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s002">Figure S2</xref>), we believe that the heterosite calls missed by ChIP-PET is a function of sampling error of sites with weaker NHR occupancy. Highly enriched sites are most likely present in both libraries and sites with lower enrichment are more likely to be present in only one of the libraries. Supporting this, we found that the ChIP-PET monosites had a lower level of enrichment for PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR as compared to the ChIP-PET heterosites upon ChIP-qPCR validation (3.5&#x02013;5.4 average fold enrichment for the monosites vs. 14.4&#x02013;16.1 average fold enrichment for the strong heterosites;Wilcoxon's one-tailed test p&#x0003c;1E-4 in all cases) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s015">Table S4</xref>). The combination of our genome-wide ChIP-PET data and the ChIP qPCR validation therefore suggest that PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR interact on the same DNA binding sites throughout the genome though of differing intensities. This is consistent with the biochemical evidence that PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR act together as a heterodimer in PPAR&#x003b3; action. Our work extends this observation on a genome wide scale. Combining both the PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR sites we identified a total of 7821 binding sites throughout the genome (PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR heterosites are counted as one) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004907-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s022">Spreadsheets S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s023">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s024">S5</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004907-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004907.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PPAR&#x003b3;&#x02236; RXR overlap sites show higher validation rate than nonoverlapping sites.</title><p>ChIP Q-PCR was used for validation of binding sites. 4 populations of binding sites were chosen for validation: PPAR&#x003b3; monosites (no RXR sites within 200 bp), RXR monosites (no PPAR&#x003b3; sites within 200 bp), low confidence PPAR&#x003b3;moPET2&#x02236;RXR heterosites (within 200 bp) and high confidence PPAR&#x003b3;&#x02236;RXR heterosites (within 200 bp).

We extracted 278 probes on the Illumina expression array which had PPAR&#x003b3;moPET2&#x0002b;/RXR ChIP-PET heterosite(s) within 5 kb of the TSS, and 424 and 1494 probes had respectively a PPAR&#x003b3; or RXR site within 5 kb of their TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s022">Spreadsheets S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s023">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s024">S5</xref>). Based on our earlier analysis, the ChIP-PET determined monosites would collectively represent sites with a lower level of occupancy by the heterodimer than the ChIP-PET heterosites. Of the 278 probes in proximity to a heterosite, more than 31&#x00025; (88) were regulated by PPAR&#x003b3; activation (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.91E-38). This compares to 14&#x00025; (54) in proximity to PPAR&#x003b3; ChIP-PET monosites (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.57E-07), 13&#x00025; (192) for RXR ChIP-PET monosites (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.61E-16), and 9&#x00025; for all probes on the expression array (i.e., background).

This low sequence conservation at the binding sites is consistent with our experience with the majority of transcription factors.

When all PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR binding sites are taken into consideration, the top functional category that is overrepresented is lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.61E-08) followed by nucleic acid metabolism (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.95E-06) and cell proliferation and differentiation (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.02E-05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s012">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s017">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s018">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s019">S8</xref>). When only the high quality heterosites were considered, lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism again was the top category, followed by apoptosis, and then fatty acid metabolism. Gratifyingly, when compared to the ontology of genes regulated by PPAR&#x003b3; as assessed by expression arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), the top intersects were lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Thus by two different approaches, one based on expression, and the second solely on binding site association, PPAR&#x003b3; primarily regulates a transcriptional cassette that is involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>siRNA knockdown of a set of PPAR&#x003b3; direct targets affects adipocyte differentiation</title><p>To assess the function of selected direct PPAR&#x003b3; targets during adipogenesis, we carried out gene knockdown experiments using siRNA in 3T3-L1 cells. Adipogenic potential of the selected target genes was evaluated by quantifying the reduction of lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes in the absence of the respective gene. Evaluated genes were selected from the high confidence target genes defined by a transcriptional unit with heterosites within 5 kb of their TSS and showing differential expression pattern during adipogenesis. After Oil Red O staining, lipid accumulation in cells was measured using a spectrometer set at 540 nm. Level of lipid accumulation inhibition ascribed to PPAR&#x003b3; KD was used as the positive control (40&#x00025; reduction compared with untreated adipocytes). A knockdown was considered affecting lipid accumulation if it did not produce significantly higher lipid accumulation (one-tailed t-test p&#x0003e;0.02) than that of PPAR&#x003b3; KD. The level of lipid accumulation of untransfected cells undergoing adipogenesis after chemical stimulation was taken arbitrarily to exhibit 100&#x00025; adipogenesis. Whereas non-targeting siRNA had no effect on the adipogenic phenotype, 6 of the 20 (30&#x00025;) tested siRNAs showed a reduction of lipid accumulation similar to that of PPAR&#x003b3; knockdown.

Cells were stained after 4 days of treatment using Oil Red O stain, and quantified for lipid accumulation using a spectrophometer set at an absorbance of 540 nM. Percentage of adipogenesis, as measured by Oil Red O staining, was compared for each siRNA target to that of the non-transfected differentiated cells (set at 100&#x00025; adipogenesis). Non-targeting siRNA served as a control, while siRNA targeting PPAR&#x003b3; served as a threshold for adipogenesis inhibition.

Herein, we sought to detail the transcriptional regulatory configuration of PPAR&#x003b3;-RXR-DNA interaction on a genome-wide scale using an established ChIP-PET sequencing approach. Such genome-wide analysis of bona fide NHR binding sites provides sufficient numbers to achieve statistical power to uncover core characteristics of specific transcription factor-DNA interaction by examining the population characteristics of the DNA binding sites in a genome-wide scale. By comprehensively assessing the binding profiles of each heterodimer partner separately and then mapping their intersects, we were able to assess the functional importance of the heterodimer in PPAR&#x003b3; signaling and function.</p><p>The observation of consistent PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR interaction at almost all high quality RXR binding sites was unexpected since such exclusive interaction would not be expected given the promiscuous nature of RXR as a heterodimerization partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Mangelsdorf1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In seeking an explanation for these findings, we constructed potential mechanistic models based on the composite configuration of the &#x0201c;population&#x0201d; of binding sites. This approach was used to uncover the cooperation between Oct4 and Sox2 in regulating genes involved in stem cell biology. The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Loh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our data, we posit that true monosites are fundamentally very weak binders and account for a small proportion of the binding sequences. This is especially true for PPAR&#x003b3; where there were a significantly greater proportion of weak occupancy sites (as measured by the ratio low/high confidence sites) than with RXR (PPAR&#x003b3;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;62783/2953&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;21.3 vs. RXR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; 33882/5142&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.6).We also observed that experimental heterosites are associated with consistently higher NHR occupancy and more likely associated with genes induced by PPAR&#x003b3;. One plausible model is that our ChIP-PET experiments were performed at day 4 post induction, where PPAR&#x003b3; levels are the highest and in the presence of the potent PPAR&#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone, thus represents a cellular milieu that favors the full utilization of the PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR heterodimers in adipocyte differentiation. We surmise that, under these conditions, the excess PPAR&#x003b3; could titer out the limited pool of RXR molecules from its other heterodimeric partners during the course of adipogenesis. Consistent with this observation is that despite similar levels of RXR in undifferentiated 3T3L1 cells, the binding of RXR to high confidence sites was uniformly lower than that seen after adipogenic induction when PPAR&#x003b3; expression is dramatically induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This suggests that the efficiency of RXR binding at PPAR&#x003b3; sites is augmented in the presence of its heterodimerization partner. Though this mechanism has been suggested in studies involving individual binding sites, our genome-wide analysis suggests that the PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR heterodimer is a general requirement for optimal DNA binding throughout the genome.</p><p>In addition, our data suggest asymmetric requirements for PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR in this heterodimerization process. RXR appeared to have an almost 4 fold higher ratio of high quality to lower confidence occupancy sites than PPAR&#x003b3;. Moreover, de novo motif analysis showed RXR binding sites gave a robust direct repeat that resembled the canonical PPRE whereas the PPAR&#x003b3; motif appeared more degenerate.</p><p>Our global results have revealed other general characteristics of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR binding as it relates to downstream function. First, that proximity of a binding site to the TSS along with the level of occupancy of the heterodimer predicts for association with regulated genes, and in particular upregulated genes. We have observed this with other transcription factors such as ER&#x003b1;, Myc, and p53 in that proximity to the TSS (up to 50 kb) is statistically associated with upregulated genes. Downregulated genes do not have this position association with binding sites of their cognate transcription factors. When coupled with the observation that the evolutionary conservation of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR binding sites is greater when adjacent to upregulated genes than downregulated genes suggest that the primordial function of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR is the induction of genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism.</p><p>Extending the functional importance of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR transcriptional regulation to adipogenesis, our assessment of the ontologic classification of the genes in proximity to PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR heterosites shows significant enrichment for three major classes. The most enriched are genes involved in lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, and then genes involved in apoptosis. In a broader analysis of all PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR binding sites, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism cluster remains the most enriched, with other metabolic processes following. This suggests a transcriptional network with PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR at its core mediating an appropriate transcriptional response to changing ligand (i.e. fatty acids) concentration by fine tuning the levels of enzymes involved in metabolic processes associated with fatty acid and lipid metabolism. A comparison of the functional classification of downstream targets of different transcription regulators is also informative. The function of downstream targets of transcription factors such as ER&#x003b1;, Oct4-Nanog, p53 and RELA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Wei1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Lin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Loh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Lim1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> include a significant number of other transcription factors suggesting a &#x0201c;cascade&#x0201d; effect on transcription as a result of the induction of a series of other transcriptional regulators. By contrast, however, transcription factors are not overrepresented among direct PPAR&#x003b3; targets. While this is not ruling out any crucial function for TFs in the process of adipogenesis downstream of PPAR&#x003b3; as was shown for C/EBPa and Stat5a, the enrichment of enzymes involved in metabolic processes is very significant.</p><p>Only a limited number of genes are known to date to be direct targets of PPAR&#x003b3;, with the majority being involved in lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Walczak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we extended this number to about 250 putative target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s022">Spreadsheets S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004907.s025">S6</xref>). On the assumption that these direct target genes may have a central role in the adipogenic action of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR activation, we examined the biological significance of a number of direct target genes identified in our study in the adipocyte differentiation process. We hypothesized that by suppressing these direct targets of PPAR&#x003b3; using siRNAs targeted against them, we would be able to inhibit adipogenesis, hence justifying the importance of these direct targets in the PPAR&#x003b3; adipogenic cascade. Indeed, of the 20 putative direct targets genes assessed using siRNA approaches, we found that 6 or 30&#x00025; showed inhibition of adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells when expression was attenuated using gene specific siRNAs. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that selective inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3; direct targets do in fact play a crucial role in the PPAR&#x003b3; adipogenic cascade, even in the presence of endogenous PPAR&#x003b3;. These putative targets include genes previously associated with obesity, while others have not been well characterized. <italic>Pim3</italic>, which we demonstrate here as being a direct target of PPAR&#x003b3; is a serine threonine kinase that is evolutionarily highly conserved.

Additionally we have identified novel PPAR&#x003b3; direct targets that have previously been demonstrated to promote lipid accumulation, regulate lipolysis and promote triglyceride accumulation. These include FSP27/Cidec, which has previously been reported to be regulated by C/EBP and other C/EBP-like proteins and functions in regulating adipocyte metabolism and enhancing triglyceride storage. FSP27 is expressed at high levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), and its expression is enhanced during adipogenesis in primary rodent and human preadipocytes. In addition, insulin exposure enhanced FSP27 transcript levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Danesch1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Puri1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent evidence suggests transmembrane proteins play a vital role in the development of adipose tissue and obesity.

Adipogenin may function in a similar manner by regulating levels of lipid stores during adipogenesis. We have shown that the downregulation of angiotensinogen (Agt) inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. AGT is secreted by WAT, is induced during adipogenic conversion, and may contribute to the elevation of blood pressure and several cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Ailhaud1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Janke1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation is severely impaired when angiotensinogen levels are reduced. Though the role of angiotensinogen in the differentiation of adipoblasts has not been elucidated, angiotensinogen signaling has been linked to leptin/leptin receptor signaling, insulin receptor signaling and the metabolism of complex and glycerolipids, via serpine1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Sharma1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. GPRK7 (Mnk2), which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and which we show here as being a direct target, also inhibits adipogeneis. The role of G-protein coupled receptors in adipocyte biology is unclear. Of the numerous GPR expressed, GPR120 and 43 has been linked with a possible physiological role in adipose tissue development and adipocyte differentiation. The levels of both receptors are highly expressed in adipose tissues of mice fed on a high fat diet, and siRNA targeting these receptors inhibited adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Hong1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Gotoh1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the gene targets that were transcriptional upregulated by the PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR heterodimer, we also investigated whether KD of target genes that were transcriptionally downregulated by the heterodimer could enhance adipogenesis. For this, we targeted PDZRN3, which contained a heterosite within its promoter and was downregulated by PPAR&#x003b3; during the course of adipogenesis. PDZRN3 is a PDZ domain containing RING finger 3 (PDZRN3) that potentially has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Previous studies have shown that PDZRN3 is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle and liver. Up-regulation of PDZRN3 during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, and injury induced muscle regeneration has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-Ko1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although PDZRN3 has a role in myoblasts differentiation, we observe a paradoxical finding during adipocyte differentiation. We postulated that KD of PDZRN3 could enhance adipogenesis. Our siRNA screen for PDZRN3 resulted in a decrease in adipogenesis. This observation suggests a complex role for PDZRN3 in adipocyte differentiation which will require further study. The remaining direct targets of PPAR&#x003b3;/RXR that were tested showed no changes in lipid accumulation when targeted by their respective siRNAs. These targets may not contribute directly to the accumulation of lipids during the adipogenic process, but may play a role in other metabolic processes or may play a redundant role during adipocyte lipid accumulation and differentiation. Of the interesting targets that showed no phenotypic changes include, Mgst1 (MAPEG, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism family member) that may be involved in inflammation and cellular defense and ECH1 (enoyl Coenzyme A hydratase 1) which is involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004907-FitzPatrick1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The rest of the targets that were screened have not previously been reported to play a role in metabolic processes related to obesity.

For the first task, we compiled the distances of all sites to all TSS (based on UCSC knownGene database) within 100 kbp away and grouped them into 5 kbp bins. As a control, the same amount of sites was randomly distributed in the genome and their distances to all TSS were similarly compiled and binned.

The binding site predictions are based on a position weight matrix algorithm and to compute the statistical significance, we generated a background sequence set of 10,000 randomly selected 500 bp sequences, roughly matching the 9002 binding sites identified in the PPAR&#x003b3; and RXR ChIP-PET experiments. The analyzed ChIP-PET cluster sequences were 500 bp long, and defined using the center of the PET cluster as the middle of the cluster and then expanding 250 bp on each side.
