Here we used gene expression and transcription network connectivity data, genetic knockouts, and network component analysis (NCA) to map the initial isobutanol response network of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> under aerobic conditions. NCA revealed profound perturbations to respiration. Further investigation showed ArcA as an important mediator of this response. Quinone/quinol malfunction was postulated to activate ArcA, Fur, and PhoB in this study. In support of this hypothesis, quinone-linked ArcA and Fur target expressions were significantly less perturbed by isobutanol under fermentative growth whereas quinol-linked PhoB target expressions remained activated, and isobutanol impeded growth on glycerol, which requires quinones, more than on glucose. In addition, ethanol, <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and isobutanol response networks were compared. <italic>n</italic>-Butanol and isobutanol responses were qualitatively similar, whereas ethanol had notable induction differences of <italic>pspABCDE</italic> and <italic>ndh</italic>, whose gene products manage proton motive force. The network described here could aid design and comprehension of alcohol tolerance, whereas the approach provides a general framework to characterize complex phenomena at the systems level.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biofuel</kwd><kwd>network component analysis</kwd><kwd>quinone</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent metabolic engineering of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for higher branched-chain alcohol production has enabled isobutanol to emerge as a potential biofuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Atsumi <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).

As this compound was previously considered a minor microbial fermentation product, isobutanol cytotoxicity remains largely uncharacterized. Thus, to facilitate improved isobutanol production, an understanding of how microorganisms respond to isobutanol stress is desirable.</p><p>A considerable amount of work has focused on the effects of similar alcohols on microorganisms; namely, ethanol on <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>n</italic>-butanol on <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ingram, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dombek and Ingram, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sikkema <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Yomano <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tomas <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alsaker <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Borden and Papoutsakis, 2007</xref>). In general, the cytotoxicity of these alcohols has been attributed to membrane disruption, which is thought to occur by direct insertion of lipophilic side chain into the cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ingram, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Borden and Papoutsakis, 2007</xref>).

To understand solvent stress, a number of genomic techniques, including gene-expression profiling and genomic libraries, have been used. Using DNA microarray to identify transcriptional differences between an ethanol-tolerant <italic>E.coli</italic> mutant and its parent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic> (2003)</xref> identified three metabolites (glycine, betaine, and serine) and one non-functional transcription factor (FNR) as important for ethanol tolerance in anaerobic <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures. In <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>, multiple studies involving a genomic library and/or DNA microarray were used to investigate gene overexpressions that conferred increased <italic>n</italic>-butanol tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tomas <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alsaker <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Borden and Papoutsakis, 2007</xref>). These studies provide useful foundations to analyze solvent toxicity, and highlight the complexity and breadth of the solvent-stress phenotype. Owing to this inherent complexity, we used a systems-biology approach to investigate isobutanol stress.</p><p>Here we mapped the initial response network of <italic>E. coli</italic> to isobutanol using gene expression and transcription factor (TF)&#x02013;gene interaction data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), genetic knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and network component analysis (NCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liao <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Galbraith <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). ArcA was identified as the most significantly perturbed TF by NCA, and verified by knockout to be a major regulator of respiratory changes induced by isobutanol. We postulated that ArcA activation resulted from quinone malfunction, and linked the activations of Fur and PhoB, two other verified regulators of the isobutanol response in this study, to these important electron carriers. To support this hypothesis, quinone-linked ArcA and Fur target gene expressions were shown to be comparatively unperturbed by isobutanol under fermentative growth, whereas quinol-linked PhoB target gene expressions remained activated. In addition, growth on glycerol was shown to be more significantly retarded by isobutanol than growth on glucose (glycerol requires quinones to enter glycolysis but glucose does not). Although quinones are found in the membrane and their malfunction conforms to a solvent-stress model centered on membrane disruption, they have not been previously implicated in the solvent-stress regulatory cascade. Repercussions of quinone malfunction include disproportionate growth defects for different carbon sources (glycerol versus glucose growth), and alterations in metabolism (TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt), protein&#x02013;protein interaction (ArcA&#x02013;ArcB and PhoB&#x02013;PhoR), and transcriptional regulation (ArcA, Fur, PhoB). The results presented here connect changes in respiratory, phosphate, and iron control to the malfunction of a single class of membrane components upon exposure to isobutanol stress, and therefore highlight the utility of a systems-biology approach for the study of isobutanol toxicity. Lastly, we identified the common and distinct toxicity features of the three alcohol-based biofuels, <italic>n</italic>-butanol, ethanol, and isobutanol, by comparing their initial response networks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Physiological response to isobutanol</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, isobutanol caused <italic>E. coli</italic> growth arrest at concentrations &#x02a7e;1&#x00025; vol/vol in minimal MOPS medium with 0.2&#x00025; glucose. Accumulation of pyruvate was observed at 1&#x00025; vol/vol isobutanol in that medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>), and was more pronounced at 2 and 3&#x00025; vol/vol isobutanol. As pyruvate is a core metabolite, its accumulation suggests a significant degree of metabolic distress. In order to characterize the initial transcriptional changes induced by isobutanol, aerobic <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures were split; one half received a 1&#x00025; isobutanol treatment whereas the other remained untreated, and transcriptome measurements were taken from both cultures at 10 min. Using the LOWESS normalization and rank-invariant selection method of lcDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), which is an open-source Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure that can identify statistically significant expression perturbations that do not meet the <italic>ad hoc</italic> two-fold change threshold (Materials and methods), 1452 genes were identified as significantly perturbed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). To identify whether these genes were enriched for any biological function, Gene Ontology (GO) classifications were obtained from EcoCyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Karp <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and analyzed using the BinGO plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Maere <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) for Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Shannon <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).

This criterion clearly links NCA results to the biological system and makes interpretation straightforward. A detailed derivation of NCA can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liao <italic>et al</italic> (2003)</xref>.</p><p>In this study, NCA was used to deduce TFA perturbations resulting from isobutanol stress. Gene-expression data were analyzed by NCA using transcription network connectivity obtained from Regulon DB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gama-Castro <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) to quantify TFAs and CSs. For NCA, training data are not required and were not used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liao <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The transcription network is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table III</xref>. As the number of experiments (<italic>M</italic>) was less than the number of TFs (<italic>L</italic>), a modified NCA criterion for use with limited microarray data was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Galbraith <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This criterion allows for the identification of a unique solution up to a scaling factor when <italic>M</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>L</italic>, by requiring each gene to be regulated by not more than <italic>M</italic> TFs. The statistical significance of TFA perturbations was evaluated by comparing each TFA with a null distribution generated from randomization of the data using a <italic>z</italic>-test (Materials and methods).</p><p>Owing to the imposition of NCA uniqueness criteria on the transcription network connectivity, we were able to quantify TFAs and CSs for 67 TFs from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Among the 67 TFs analyzed, 16 TFs had significantly perturbed activities in response to isobutanol (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.01). These TFs are listed along with their significance level (low <italic>P</italic>-value=high likelihood TFA perturbed by isobutanol), biological function, and regulon members that were significantly perturbed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>. A complete list of TFs analyzed along with their significance level can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table IV</xref>. It is evident from the three most significantly perturbed TFs (ArcA, PdhR, and FNR) that isobutanol affects respiration. Under the assumption that isobutanol toxicity is mediated through membrane disruption, it is not surprising that respiration is affected. The purpose of respiration is to generate a PMF across the membrane, many critical respiratory processes occur at the membrane, and many respiratory components are membrane constituents. To explore this result, we looked at the known activation mechanisms for ArcA, PdhR, and FNR, and the identities of their regulon members that were perturbed by isobutanol.</p><p>The activities of AcrA, PdhR, and FNR are mediated by phosphorylation, pyruvate, and oxygen, respectively. All three are cytoplasmic proteins. However, ArcA forms a two-component system with ArcB, a membrane protein. Phosphorylation of ArcA occurs when quinone inhibition of ArcB is released. Quinones are metabolites embedded in the membrane that function as electron carriers for respiratory processes. PdhR shares 10 of its 12 perturbed regulon members with ArcA, whereas FNR shares 50 of its 96 perturbed regulon members with ArcA. It should be noted here that NCA might have difficulty in separating TFAs for TFs with highly overlapping regulons. Considering this information, it is likely that the ArcA&#x02013;ArcB system is the major regulator of respiratory genes in response to isobutanol. PdhR is a minor transcriptional regulator not known to associate with the membrane, the majority of whose perturbed regulon members are also regulated by ArcA. FNR, which is inactive under aerobic growth due to Fe&#x02013;S oxygen binding, is unlikely to be active under the growth conditions used for transcriptome measurements in this work (mid-log aerobic). In addition, more than half of the perturbed FNR regulon members are also regulated by ArcA, and 74 of its 96 perturbed regulon members are controlled by one or more of the other 14 TFs identified as significantly perturbed. Therefore, it is more likely that these genes were perturbed through the action of other regulators rather than by FNR.</p><p>To verify that ArcA modulates gene expression in response to isobutanol, transcriptome measurements were obtained from a &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> strain treated with and without 1&#x00025; isobutanol (Materials and methods). We reasoned that if ArcA regulates <italic>gene</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> in response to isobutanol, then the response of <italic>gene</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> to isobutanol in &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> would be different from the response of <italic>gene</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> to isobutanol in wild type. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the log<sub>10</sub> expression ratios of ArcA-regulon members from wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> experiments, along with an indication of whether the difference was significant at a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05 (for exact <italic>P</italic>-values, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table V</xref>). The majority of ArcA-regulon members perturbed by isobutanol in wild type (47 out of 86) had significantly different expression ratios in &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05). This provided additional evidence that ArcA participates in the <italic>E. coli</italic> response to isobutanol. The remaining 39 regulon members showed indistinguishable activation/repression (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003e;0.05) in response to isobutanol in &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> compared with wild type. This could have resulted from the inherent noise of DNA microarrays, compensatory action by other regulators, or expression of that gene being under the control of a different TF under isobutanol stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isobutanol stress causes a loss of quinone function and ArcA activation</title><p>With ArcA verified by knockout to be involved in the isobutanol response, we sought to identify the upstream isobutanol target responsible for ArcA activation. ArcA is activated through phosphorylation by ArcB, a membrane protein. This phosphorylation occurs after quinone (primarily ubiquinone) inhibition of ArcB autophosphorylation is released. Therefore, given this two-component mechanism, the likely target for isobutanol is quinone function. Quinones are electron carriers with an isoprenoid side chain that anchors them to the membrane. They function as the primary electron carriers for respiration, and are thought to regulate the ArcA&#x02013;ArcB two-component system in response to cellular redox state (reduced Qs/QH<sub>2</sub>s cannot inhibit ArcB autophosphorylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Georgellis <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Malpica <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2006</xref>). A mechanism for the isobutanol activation of ArcA through quinone malfunction conforms to a mode of toxicity through membrane disruption. We hypothesize that isobutanol disrupts the membrane, leading to quinone malfunction (dissociation from or disruption of interaction with the membrane), which results in a release of quinone inhibition on ArcB, and subsequent autophosphorylation of ArcB and activation of ArcA.</p><p>To support this hypothesis, we tested the effect of isobutanol on metabolic processes that require quinones. One such example is glycerol degradation, which requires quinones in the second step (glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref> shows the glycolytic entry pathways for glucose and glycerol under normal aerobic growth conditions. Quinones are the only components of the respiratory chain found along the glycolytic separation of glycerol and glucose. As glycerol directly requires functional quinones to enter glycolysis and glucose does not, growth on glycerol should suffer from more significant retardation than growth on glucose if the presence of isobutanol causes quinone malfunction. Thus, growth rates were measured for <italic>E. coli</italic> in glycerol and glucose minimal media in the presence of a spectrum of isobutanol concentrations (Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the relative time to four doublings for <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in glycerol and glucose medium over a spectrum of isobutanol concentrations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for growth curves). These results show that isobutanol hinders growth on glycerol more significantly than growth on glucose, and that this effect becomes more pronounced at higher concentrations of isobutanol. This result supports the hypothesis that isobutanol causes the loss of quinone function either by membrane damage or by quinone depletion, and shows possible repercussions of these findings for isobutanol production in terms of carbon-source selection, which will be discussed further in the Conclusion section.</p><p>To support the hypothesis that ArcA activation is caused by the loss of quinone function, we measured ArcA-regulated genes under fermentative conditions using quantitative real-time PCR. As ubiquinone is a component of the respiratory chain, it is not needed in fermentative conditions. Thus, if the hypothesis is true, ArcA activity will not change in response to isobutanol under fermentative conditions. Fermentative expression ratios are presented alongside their aerobic equivalents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. The genes <italic>sdhC</italic> and <italic>oppA</italic> were selected as ArcA target genes because they were the lead genes in the most significantly repressed and induced operons, respectively, shown to be regulated by ArcA in &#x00394;<italic>arcA</italic> experiments. The expression changes of <italic>sdhC</italic> and <italic>oppA</italic> in response to isobutanol under fermentative conditions (red bars) are negligible compared with their expression changes in an aerobic environment (blue bars). The observed fermentative <italic>oppA</italic> repression (average approximately two-fold) under fermentative conditions is in contrast to the strong aerobic activation of <italic>oppA</italic> (average approximately 14-fold) and may have resulted from the action of other known regulators of <italic>oppABCDF</italic> expression, GcvB, Lrp, or ModE. These results support a mechanism of ArcA activation through malfunction of the respiratory chain, as in the absence of respiration (fermentation) isobutanol fails to perturb the expression of ArcA-regulon members to the same degree or direction observed under aerobic conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isobutanol activations of PhoB and Fur are likely mediated by quinone function</title><p>Owing to the profound effect isobutanol had on the respiratory system through quinone malfunction, we sought to identify additional TFs whose activity perturbations can be linked to quinone malfunction. We started by identifying additional two-component systems known to be regulated by quinones. Three other two-component systems are known to have quinone-related activation mechanisms. These include EvgAS of <italic>E. coli</italic> (ubiquinone mediated), BvgAS of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (ubiquinone mediated), and PhoPR of <italic>Bacillus subtillis</italic> (menaquinol mediated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bock and Gross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schau <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Eldakak and Hulett, 2007</xref>). EvgAS is homologous to BvgAS in structure, and the PhoBR system of <italic>E. coli</italic> is homologous to the PhoPR system of <italic>B. subtillis</italic> in structure and function (BLAST results presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VI</xref>). Of these systems, PhoBR was identified as significantly perturbed by NCA. Although the EvgAS system is known to be regulated by quinones, EvgA was not identified as a significantly perturbed regulator by NCA (<italic>P</italic>-value=0.47), and therefore was not investigated further in this study. To verify that PhoB was involved in the isobutanol response, transcriptome measurements were obtained from &#x00394;<italic>phoB</italic> treated with and without 1&#x00025; isobutanol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> lists the log<sub>10</sub> expression ratios of PhoB-regulon members from wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>phoB</italic> experiments, along with an indication of whether the difference was significant at a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05 (for exact <italic>P</italic>-values, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VII</xref>). The majority of PhoB-regulon members perturbed by isobutanol in wild type (nine out of 16) had significantly different expression ratios in &#x00394;<italic>phoB</italic> (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05). This provided additional evidence that PhoB is activated by isobutanol. Taken together with the knowledge that the PhoPR system of <italic>B. subtillis</italic> is homologous to the PhoBR system of <italic>E. coli</italic> and they regulate similar operons in response to the same stimulus (phosphate starvation), we postulate that isobutanol disrupts the membrane and releases quinol inhibition of PhoR, which allows PhoR to autophosphorylate and activate PhoB. To support this hypothesis, expression levels for PhoB target genes were measured under fermentative growth conditions using quantitative real-time PCR (Materials and methods). As reduced Qs/QH<sub>2</sub>s are the primary form of quinone under fermentative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Shestopalov <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Georgellis <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bekker <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), our hypothesis would predict that unlike ArcA, isobutanol treatment should activate PhoB under fermentative conditions to a similar, if not stronger, extent than it does in an aerobic environment. Fermentative expression ratios are presented alongside their aerobic equivalents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. The genes <italic>phoB</italic> and <italic>pstS</italic> were selected as PhoB target genes because they were the lead genes in the most significantly induced operons shown to be regulated by PhoB in &#x00394;<italic>phoB</italic> experiments. These results clearly show isobutanol activation of PhoB under fermentative and aerobic conditions is similar, and support a mechanism of PhoR inhibition by quinols and isobutanol-mediated PhoB activation through quinol malfunction.</p><p>In addition to their regulatory role, quinones serve as important electron carriers for many respiratory processes. We reasoned that if isobutanol caused general Q/QH<sub>2</sub> malfunction the activity of all membrane-bound enzymes that rely on Q/QH<sub>2</sub> for their electron-carrier capabilities, including all cytochromes and both NADH dehydrogenases, would be disrupted. With this in mind, there may be TFs whose isobutanol response can be linked to quinone electron-transport malfunction. To identify these TFs, we identified all aerobic respiratory machineries known to utilize quinones when glucose is the sole carbon source. These include succinate dehydrogenase (<italic>sdhCDAB</italic>), NADH dehydrogenase I (<italic>nuo</italic> operon), NADH dehydrogenase II (<italic>ndh</italic>), and cytochrome <italic>bo</italic><sub>3</sub> (<italic>cyoABCD</italic>). Malfunction of all of these complexes in <italic>E. coli</italic> would diminish the ability to convert NADH to NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and generate PMF. It is also well documented that aerobic respiration generates superoxide ions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), with NDH-II as the main generator of endogenous superoxide and NDH-I and SDH as smaller contributors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gennis and Stewart, 1996</xref>). Therefore, malfunction of these enzymes would also decrease the O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> level. Combined with an inability to convert NADH to NAD&#x0002b;, a decrease in endogenous O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> would cause reductive stress. Interestingly, it has been suggested that a reducing environment may activate Fur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), which is the most significantly perturbed regulator not associated with respiration in this study.</p><p>Fur requires binding of Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to become active and repress genes of its regulon. It has been shown previously that O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> deactivates Fur after its conversion to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by superoxide dismutases, through the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Blanchard <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>):</p><p><disp-formula id="illus3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb200934-i3.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>Therefore, a decrease in endogenous O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> generation would increase the availability of Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, through a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, and in effect activate Fur relative to the control. Indeed, on isobutanol stress, NCA deduced an increase in Fur activity. To verify that Fur was involved in the isobutanol response, transcriptome measurements were obtained from &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> treated with and without 1&#x00025; isobutanol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> lists the log<sub>10</sub> expression ratios of Fur-regulon members from wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> experiments, along with an indication of whether the difference was significant at a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05 (for exact <italic>P</italic>-values, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VII</xref>). The majority of Fur-regulon members perturbed by isobutanol in wild type (24 out of 40) had significantly different expression ratios in &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.05). This provided additional evidence that Fur is activated by isobutanol. We postulate that membrane disruption interferes with the ability of quinones to act as electron carriers, and thereby inhibits the enzymatic activity of NDH-I, NDH-II, and SDH. Inhibition of these complexes results in reductive stress through a decrease in endogenous O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production and an increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. This results in Fur activation through a diminished Fenton reaction and stabilization of Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Once active, Fur represses the expression of genes related to iron homeostasis. To support the involvement of quinones in this hypothesis, expression levels for Fur target genes were measured under fermentative growth conditions using quantitative real-time PCR (Materials and methods). Fermentative expression ratios are presented alongside their aerobic equivalents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. The genes <italic>fhuF</italic> and <italic>fecI</italic> were selected as Fur target genes because <italic>fhuF</italic> was the most strongly repressed gene singly regulated by Fur, <italic>fecI</italic> is an iron-associated sigma factor, and they were both shown to be regulated by Fur in &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> experiments. The average expression changes of <italic>fhuF</italic>, an <italic>fecI</italic>, in response to isobutanol under fermentative conditions (red bars) are negligible compared with their expression changes in an aerobic environment (blue bars). The observed <italic>fhuF</italic> activation under fermentative conditions (average &#x0223c;2.5-fold) is in contrast to the strong aerobic repression of <italic>fhuF</italic> (average &#x0223c;17-fold). These results show that in the absence of respiration isobutanol fails to perturb the expression of Fur target genes to the same degree or direction observed under aerobic conditions, and supports a mechanism of isobutanol-mediated Fur activation through quinones malfunction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isobutanol disrupts general quinone function</title><p>Disruption of quinone function could result from a shift in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio or disruption of quinone&#x02013;membrane interactions. Considering the activations of ArcA, Fur, and PhoB, it is unlikely that isobutanol produces a shift in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio. It has been shown that shifts in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio can activate ArcA-ArcB in <italic>E. coli</italic> and PhoPR in <italic>B. subtillis</italic>. Under normal growth, ArcA becomes active when the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio decreases, which corresponds to NADH-dehydrogenase activity exceeding cytochrome activity. This decrease along with ArcA activation is present during a shift from aerobiosis to anaerobiosis when oxygen becomes limiting for the cytochromes, and for chemicals, such as KCN or NO, which target the cytochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, PhoPR activation is inhibited by menaquinols and activated by an increase in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Eldakak and Hulett, 2007</xref>). Consistent with this phenomenon is the observation that members of the PhoBR regulon are unperturbed by NO-mediated cytochrome-<italic>bo</italic> malfunction shown to activate the ArcA&#x02013;ArcB regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). This would suggest that the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio were not responsible for isobutanol activation of ArcA and PhoB. However, the major quinone inhibitors of the ArcA&#x02013;ArcB and PhoPR systems are different (ubiquinone for ArcB and menaquinol for PhoR), and it is possible that isobutanol affects the UQ/UQH<sub>2</sub> and MQ/MQH<sub>2</sub> ratios differently. To investigate whether this was the case, we obtained a &#x00394;<italic>ubiE</italic> strain from the Keio collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and took transcriptome measurements under isobutanol stress conditions. UbiE is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of MQ synthesis and an intermediary step of UQ synthesis. In &#x00394;<italic>ubiE</italic>, both UQ and MQ are absent and the only functional quinone is demethylmenaquinone (DMQ). As DMQ is the only acting quinone, both ArcB and PhoR inhibition would be mediated by DMQ/DMQH<sub>2</sub> ratio. Therefore, if a change in UQ/UQH<sub>2</sub> were responsible for ArcA activation, in &#x00394;<italic>ubiE</italic>, ArcA should be activated and PhoB should be non-responsive. In contrast, if a change in MQ/MQH<sub>2</sub> were responsible for PhoB activation, in &#x00394;<italic>ubiE</italic>, PhoB should be activated and ArcA should be non-responsive. However, in &#x00394;<italic>ubiE</italic>, both ArcA and PhoB were activated similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>), which suggests that a shift in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> is not responsible for ArcA and PhoB activation. It is unclear how a shift in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> would affect Fur activity, as a breakdown of cytochrome function under aerobic conditions does not necessarily mean a decrease in NDH-II or SDH activity. However, expression data from cultures with NO-perturbed cytochromes clearly show an unperturbed Fur regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). All together, this information suggests that a shift in the Q/QH<sub>2</sub> ratio is unlikely to cause ArcA, Fur, and PhoB activations.</p><p>The remaining hypothesis focuses on disruption of quinone&#x02013;membrane interaction. For example, quinones, which under normal physiological conditions diffuse freely in the membrane, might aggregate at membrane lesions created by isobutanol, or changes in membrane fluidity might alter quinone anchoring and result in sub-optimal distances between quinone headgroups and membrane-bound proteins, or membrane disruption could result in leakage of quinones into the cytoplasm. It is unclear at this point what type of malfunction would cause ArcA, Fur, and PhoB activation. As our aim was to identify the isobutanol response network, identification of the exact abnormality that leads to quinone malfunction is beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isobutanol response network</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the postulated isobutanol response network associated with quinone malfunction. Quinone has an important role in respiration, and its isobutanol-associated malfunction alters the respiratory machinery (TCA cycle, glyoxolate shunt, cytochromes, and NADH dehydrogenases), as well as iron and phosphate homeostasis. On isobutanol treatment, ArcB senses a decrease in respiratory performance and activates its two-component-system partner ArcA, which adjusts the cellular metabolism for growth with decreased respiratory efficiency (e.g. low oxygen). This decrease in respiratory performance results in reductive stress due to an increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and a decrease in endogenous O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Fur senses this reductive stress and represses genes associated with iron uptake in preparation for conditions in which Fe&#x02013;S clusters are safe from damage by reactive oxygen species. PhoR senses a disruption in quinol inhibition by isobutanol and activates its two-component-system partner PhoB, which signals a shift to an environment with higher phosphate demand.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparison of ethanol, <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and isobutanol response networks</title><p>Transcriptome measurements were taken from wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> exposed to 1&#x00025; <italic>n</italic>-butanol and 3&#x00025; ethanol to identify similarities and differences with the isobutanol response.

Consistent with the GO-term enrichment analysis, regulators of amino-acid metabolism (LeuO and TyrR) had significantly different TFAs under butanol stress compared with isobutanol stress.

These results are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>.

It is thought that the <italic>psp</italic> gene products act to restore PMF lost due to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Darwin, 2005</xref>).

NCA was used to quantify TFAs for 67 TFs in response to isobutanol, of which 16 were significantly perturbed. Regulators beyond these 67 could not be analyzed due to insufficient regulatory information (ill-defined regulon) or non-compliance with NCA uniqueness criteria. On the basis of the annotated TF function, the 16 significantly perturbed TFs fall into three categories: those associated with stress mitigation (GadE, LexA, OmpR, and RpoH), those that regulate metabolism (ArcA, Crp, FNR, Fur, Nac, NtrC, PdhR, PhoB and PuR), and nucleoproteins that regulate diverse function (Fis, HNS and IHF). Evidence presented suggests that isobutanol interrupts the function of membrane-bound Q/QH<sub>2</sub>, which leads to respiratory distress and the activations of ArcA (the most significantly perturbed TF), Fur, and PhoB. This malfunction most likely results from disruption of quinone&#x02013;membrane interaction, such as decreased diffusivity, sub-optimal anchoring, or leakage into the cytoplasm. The implications of this finding include decreased activity for enzymes that utilize quinones for their electron-carrier capability. To demonstrate the significance of this finding, <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in a spectrum of isobutanol concentrations in MOPS media with glycerol or glucose as the sole carbon source. As the degradation of glycerol requires quinones before entry into glycolysis but glucose does not, we predicted that growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> on glycerol would be more severely affected by isobutanol than growth on glucose. As measured by the time it took the culture to double four times, growth on glycerol was more severely retarded by isobutanol than growth on glucose. This result suggests that the quinone dependence of a carbon source should be considered before selection of a feedstock or strain for production. This would be especially important for aerobic production. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> shows aerobic isobutanol production.) Perhaps, metabolic engineering efforts could be used to change the quinone dependence of a carbon source and enhance its conversion to isobutanol. In addition to repercussions from quinone malfunction, the activations of ArcA, Fur, and PhoB could be utilized to create synthetic switches that turn off or on particular enzymes when the concentration of isobutanol reaches a desired level. For instance, we have shown that branched-chain amino-acid synthesis is downregulated in response to isobutanol. As these pathways supply the precursors of isobutanol, it may be desirable to use the endogenous signaling provided by ArcA or PhoB to overexpress branched-chain amino-acid synthesis enzymes as the concentration of isobutanol reaches inhibitory levels.</p><p>In addition, the response networks of ethanol, <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and isobutanol were compared. The response networks of <italic>n</italic>-butanol and isobutanol were qualitatively the same, with the most significant difference being the stronger repression of amino-acid synthesis by <italic>n</italic>-butanol. The response network of ethanol varied more significantly, with a major difference in regulation of genes responsible for PMF management. Data presented here and in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Weiner <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) suggest that this difference may be dependent on IHF. This result is of particular interest because it implies that one of the most important membrane-associated processes, generation and regulation of PMF, is handled differently by <italic>E. coli</italic> under ethanol stress compared with <italic>n</italic>-butanol and isobutanol, which are treatments commonly thought to disrupt the membrane in a similar manner.</p><p>The isobutanol response network presented here is consistent with previous work on ethanol and <italic>n</italic>-butanol that attributed the toxic effect of these alcohols to membrane disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ingram, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Borden and Papoutsakis, 2007</xref>). The central role of ArcA in response to isobutanol under aerobic conditions mirrors the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic> (2003)</xref> of a non-functional <italic>fnr</italic> gene contributing to ethanol tolerance under fermentative conditions. This suggests that broad rewiring of metabolism is a mechanism employed by <italic>E. coli</italic> to mitigate alcohol stress. In addition, earlier studies on <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> have observed that <italic>n</italic>-butanol stress elicits a response similar to heat shock and that overexpression of heat-shock proteins confers increased tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tomas <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Consistent with this finding was the fact that NCA deduced a strong activation of RpoH, the heat-shock sigma factor, in response to isobutanol. This suggests that, similar to <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic> could benefit from priming for stress before accumulation of isobutanol to toxic levels.

A confidence level of 95&#x00025; was used to identify significant expression perturbations using lcDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). NCA was used to decompose the significant expression perturbations into TFA and CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liao <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Galbraith <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The method used to determine whether a TF was significantly perturbed in a given experiment was that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hyduke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) with the following modifications: (1) resultant TFAs were averaged over a dataset (8&#x02013;10 microarrays), whereas previously the gene expression ratios were averaged over a dataset before NCA; and (2) 50 randomizations of the data were used. In brief, NCA was used to deduce TFA<sub>true</sub> from the expression data, a null distribution was built by randomizing/shuffling gene expression, NCA was used to deduce TFA<sub>random</sub>(<italic>i</italic>) from each randomization <italic>i</italic>, and a <italic>z</italic>-test was then used to identify the probability that TFA<sub>true</sub> could have been drawn from the null distribution, TFA<sub>random</sub>. The reported <italic>P</italic>-value is the probability that TFA<sub>true</sub> could have been drawn from the null distribution, and thus a low <italic>P</italic>-value for TFA<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> equates to a high likelihood that the activity of TF<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> was perturbed by the specified treatment. Randomization of data amounted to the shuffling of gene expression data. For example, if in the true network <italic>gene</italic><sub>1</sub> was controlled by TF<sub>1</sub>, in the random data <italic>gene</italic><sub>1</sub>-expression data would be replaced by expression data for a gene chosen at random from the genome. In this way, the network used to construct the null distributions is identical to the network used for NCA of the real data. The only difference is in the gene-expression data being decomposed. This way, each TF controls the same number of genes in the network and co-regulates with the same TFs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Knockout strains</title><p>All knockouts were obtained from the Keio collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and cultured identically to wild type, except for the presence of kanamycin in the medium (Keio collection has kan<sup>R</sup> cassette in place of the knocked-out gene).

Hungate anaerobic culture tubes (Belco Glass &#x00023;; 2047-16125) were filled with 15 ml of sterile media, needles were placed in the septum to allow venting, and tubes were heated for 90 min in a boiling water bath. Rezuserin was used as an oxygen indicator for this preparation step, but not added to culture media used in experiments. Once removed from the water bath, needles were removed immediately. Culture tubes were then transferred to an anaerobic chamber equipped with palladium catalyst boxes to react with O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of H<sub>2</sub> (atmosphere maintained at 98/2 N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>). The medium was transferred in the anaerobic chamber to 250-ml baffled flasks and shaken at 200 r.p.m. for a minimum of 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Cultures were inoculated with an anaerobic overnight culture of BW25113 to obtain an initial OD600 of 0.01&#x02013;0.02, and then shaken at 200 r.p.m. in 250-ml baffled flasks filled to 1/10th the volume of the flask at 37&#x000b0;C. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.15&#x02013;0.3, they were split into half, with one half receiving a 1&#x00025; isobutanol treatment. Growth was allowed to continue in both cultures for 10 min, and then they were harvested with RNAprotect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was purified with RNeasy mini columns, with a DNase digestion carried out before RNA cleanup according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Any residual genomic DNA was then digested using Turbo DNA-Free according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). Reverse transcription PCR was carried out using a Superscript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and 50&#x02013;100 ng of total RNA as template according to the manufacturer's protocol. An RNase-H treatment was carried out after the RT reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was carried out using the Roche Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green Master kit on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absolute quantification was measured using the 2<sup>nd</sup>-derivative maximum of the Lightcycler software. RNA was checked for genomic-DNA contamination by running reverse transcription in the absence of Superscript III, followed by real-time PCR. Transcript abundance was normalized to <italic>ypfI</italic> and <italic>hybE</italic>, which were both not perturbed in any of the expression data.
