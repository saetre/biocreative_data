A similar phenomenon was observed in aged mice with a complete, skin-specific ablation of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene, where cells that escaped Cre-mediated recombination repopulated the mutant skin in a very short time period.

They bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and counter receptors such as VCAM, and play fundamental roles for tissue development and homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Brakebusch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The mammalian genome contains 18 &#x003b1; and 8 &#x003b2; integrin genes whose proteins can give rise to 24 different integrin heterodimers. Integrins are expressed on almost all cells including keratinocytes of the skin.</p><p>The epidermis is a multilayered epithelium that protects from environmental assault and damage. The hallmark of the epidermis is its ability to self-renew throughout the entire life span of the organism. This is achieved with epidermal progenitor cells (EPCs) in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, which undergo an unlimited number of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, giving rise to daughter cells that either proliferate or exit the cell cycle and move to the suprabasal layer of the epidermis. There they undergo terminal differentiation and are eventually shed from the skin surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Clayton1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Basal keratinocytes of the murine skin normally express high levels of &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrins and &#x003b1;&#x003bd;&#x003b2;5 that is weakly expressed. Expression of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;&#x003bd;&#x003b2;6 and &#x003b1;9&#x003b2;1 integrins is induced upon wounding or in pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Watt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Tissue specific or constitutive deletion of these integrin chains revealed their crucial roles in skin development and homeostasis with the most striking phenotypes observed upon deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrins and the hemidesmosomal &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-vanderNeut1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Raghavan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mutant mice lacking &#x003b2;1 integrin in skin had multiple blisters due to impaired attachment of basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane (BM), a disorganized and hyperthickened interfollicular epidermis (IFE), impaired proliferation of interfollicular and hair matrix keratinocytes, delayed terminal differentiation in IFE, defects in the hair follicle morphology, progressive hair loss and dermal fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Brakebusch2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, &#x003b2;1-deficient mice showed severely delayed wound healing, which has been associated with impaired migration of &#x003b2;1 integrin-deficient keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Grose1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the severe skin defects and complete hair loss, some of the &#x003b2;1 skin specific conditional knockout mice survived up to 12 months suggesting that loss of &#x003b2;1 integrin is not associated with a stem cell or progenitor cell depletion phenotype. This finding was unexpected, as previous data pointed to an important role for &#x003b2;1 integrins for maintaining skin stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Jones1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Jensen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that keratinocytes with high &#x003b2;1 integrin levels display typical stem cell properties including high colony forming efficiency in vitro. Similar results were also obtained with cells from adult human palm, sole and breast skin that strongly expressed &#x003b2;1 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Wan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it was shown that keratinocytes expressing high levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin are slow cycling cells in vivo and cluster in the basal layer of the epidermis. Interestingly, integrin mediated adhesion to the ECM was shown to negatively regulate terminal differentiation of cultured keratinocytes in vitro, while ectopic expression of &#x003b2;1 integrins in suprabasal cells leads to epidermal hyper-proliferation and perturbed keratinocyte differentiation in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Carroll1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Romero1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to clarify the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results on the role of &#x003b2;1 integrin in the maintenance of epidermal stem cells we generated a mouse strain with reduced &#x003b2;1 integrin expression in keratinocytes of the skin. This approach allows to study the function of &#x003b2;1 integrin in skin homeostasis avoiding the gross abnormalities seen in mice with skin specific ablation of &#x003b2;1 integrin. Using this new model we could show that keratinocytes that express normal levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin due to inefficient downregulation of &#x003b2;1 integrin expression are able to quickly expand in the interfollicular epidermis and almost completely replace the mutant cells over time. This rapid expansion of cells ensures nearly normal epidermal homeostasis and strongly indicates that &#x003b2;1 integrins play a very critical role for the proliferation and maintenance of EPC in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of a &#x003b2;1 integrin hypomorphic allele</title><p>To test how reduced expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin affects skin development and maintenance we engineered a &#x003b2;1 hypomorphic mouse strain by diminishing the stability of the &#x003b2;1 integrin mRNA and thus the amount of &#x003b2;1 integrin subunits. The hypomorphic gene mutation was obtained by introducing a 141-bp long wild-type (wt) cDNA fragment of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene coding for the entire &#x003b2;1 integrin cytoplasmic tail, including the stop codon from exon 16 (called Cyto-cDNA), in frame into exon 15 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005488.s001">Figure S1A</xref> in Supporting Information).

To test this possibility we generated full-thickness excision wounds in <italic>hpm</italic> mice and wild-type littermates at the age of 8&#x02013;12 weeks.

At day 13 after wounding, wounds in mice of both genotypes were fully reepithelialized. The only difference that we observed was an enlarged width of the healed wound and accordingly, an increased area of wound epidermis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005488.s003">Figure S3B</xref> in Supporting Information). This phenotype most likely results from reduced contraction of the wound due to fibrosis in the dermis. However, the rate of reepithelialization was not affected. When sections from 13-day wounds were stained for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity, large areas of the wound epidermis above the healing wound were found to be lacZ-negative (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005488.s003">Figure S3C</xref> in Supporting Information), demonstrating that these cells escaped Cre-mediated recombination.

Although the function of &#x003b2;1 integrins for morphogenesis is undisputed, their role in stem and progenitor cell maintenance and expansion is less clear.

While deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene had no apparent impact on resting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene in keratinocytes reduced the proliferation rate of skin progenitor cells and in the mammary gland epithelium severely affected both, the proliferation and asymmetric division of the stem and progenitor cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Taddei1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present paper we generated a mouse strain expressing reduced &#x003b2;1 integrin levels to directly investigate the role of &#x003b2;1 integrin on skin formation and homeostasis, avoiding gross damages as seen in complete knockout animals. Since the &#x003b2; integrin subunits are usually expressed in excess, the expression of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; integrin heterodimers on the cell surface is controlled by the available amount of &#x003b1; integrin subunits. This is the reason why mice heterozygous for the deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene have normal or only slightly reduced levels of &#x003b1;x&#x003b2;1 integrins on their cells and are thus phenotypically normal. To significantly reduce the expression level of &#x003b2;1 integrins we decided to impair the stability of the &#x003b2;1 integrin mRNA. To this end we fused the coding sequence of the last exon to the second-last exon of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene. We thereby introduced a premature translation termination codon into the second-last exon, which in turn induced the NMD pathway and reduced &#x003b2;1 integrin levels on keratinocytes to &#x0223c;15&#x00025;. Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic &#x003b2;1 integrin allele die between E6.0&#x02013;E6.5, indicating that the remaining integrins allow development to proceed slightly further than the complete &#x003b2;1 gene ablation, as such mice die at the late blastocyst stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Fssler1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We are currently trying to identify the specific defect(s) underlying the lethality of mice homozygous for the <italic>hpm</italic>KI<sup>lox</sup> allele.</p><p>Skin development and maintenance depend on the presence of epithelial progenitor or stem cells, which retain their proliferative capacity throughout the entire life span of an animal. They have to replenish the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicles and are therefore crucial to maintain the skin and the hairs. Genetic studies in mice have shown that the ablation of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene (K5-&#x003b2;1 mice) or the expression of inactive &#x003b2;1 integrins on keratinocytes leads to severe skin and hair coat phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Brakebusch2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Raghavan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Czuchra1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The defects include progressive hair loss, malformation of the hair follicles, hyperthickened and detached epidermis, defective LM-332 deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction, reduced keratinocyte proliferation and dermal fibrosis. The <italic>hpm</italic> mice with 15&#x00025; of normal &#x003b2;1 integrin levels develop similar phenotypes, albeit much less severe and delayed. Their IFE epidermis is less thick, blisters are very small and scarce and almost all HF are malformed. Primary keratinocytes isolated from young <italic>hpm</italic> mice adhered well to ECM substrates but failed to spread, to proliferate and to survive in vitro, suggesting that the reduced &#x003b2;1 integrin levels are sufficient to promote adhesion but insufficient to appropriately activate signalling pathway(s) required for F-actin reorganisation, cell spreading and proliferation.</p><p>Despite the skin abnormalities <italic>hpm</italic> mice had an apparently normal life span. Old <italic>hpm</italic> mice continued to lose their hair, but microblisters and irregular LM-332 deposition were significantly ameliorated with age. Moreover, primary keratinocytes from old <italic>hpm</italic> were able to spread and organize actin into stress fibers, to form robust and normal numbers of focal adhesions and to proliferate. The reason for the &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; of the mutant phenotype in vivo and in vitro was the very rapid expansion of &#x003b2;1 integrin expressing keratinocytes in <italic>hpm</italic> skin. Around 11&#x00025; of the &#x003b2;1 integrin expressing cells escaped Cre-mediated deletion. Similar findings were obtained in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Brakebusch2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, &#x0223c;76&#x00025; of &#x003b2;1 integrin expressing keratinocytes escaped or compensated for NMD-mediated degradation of &#x003b2;1 integrin mRNA. These results indicate that keratinocytes with high &#x003b2;1 integrin levels have an enormous advantage over cells expressing low &#x003b2;1 integrin levels, leading to their rapid expansion in the mutant skin and partial reversion of the epidermal phenotype. Interestingly, this advantage becomes even more pronounced in situations where the requirement for keratinocyte proliferation and migration is particularly high such as during wound healing.</p><p>Concomitant with the restoration of the &#x003b2;1 integrin expression in the mutant animals there was also an increase in cell surface expression of its dimerization partner &#x003b1;2 integrin that was strongly reduced in young animals. On contrary the expression of the hemidesmosomal integrins &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;4 remained relatively stable throughout the entire life span of the <italic>hpm</italic> mice slightly exceeding that of aged-matched control littermates. These data suggest that the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrins do not play a major role in the regulation of the proliferative potential of the keratinocytes, which only increases once cells expressing normal levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin repopulate the skin.</p><p>The K5-&#x003b2;1 mice carry disrupted &#x003b2;1 integrin genes in keratinocytes, resulting in loss of &#x003b2;1 integrin expression shortly after birth in around 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; of basal keratinocytes. Most K5-&#x003b2;1 mice die within the first three weeks after birth. A few mice survive beyond the age of 5 weeks, despite their severe skin abnormalities. Interestingly, the epidermal phenotype of the 5 weeks old K5-&#x003b2;1 mutant also improved indicated by a reduced number of blisters at the epidermal-dermal junction and normal deposition of LM-332. This phenotype improvement is also due to expansion of &#x003b2;1 integrin expressing cells; already 5 days after birth the number of &#x003b2;1 integrin exprerssing cells increased to &#x0223c;50&#x00025;, and at the age of 5 weeks to &#x0223c;86&#x00025;. The majority of these cells were still lacZ-positive indicating that in the majority of &#x003b2;1 integrin-positive cells only one &#x003b2;1 integrin floxed allele was excised by the K5-Cre transgene. These data indicate that the proliferative potential of &#x003b2;1 integrin expressing keratinocytes is so superior that they overgrow &#x003b2;1 integrin-null keratinocytes in a few weeks leading to a partial rescue of the interfollicular phenotype.</p><p>In contrast to the partial rescue of the interfollicular phenotype, the hair follicle phenotype was progressive in the mutant animals, leading to a complete hair loss in 1 year old <italic>hpm</italic> and 5-week-old K5-&#x003b2;1 mice. This finding suggests that once a hair follicle is malformed and has lost the connection to the dermal papilla, it is no longer able to fully regenerate independently of the presence of &#x003b2;1 integrin re-expressing EPCs in the skin.</p><p>Our findings fully support previous in vitro data showing that high expression of &#x003b2;1 integrins on keratinocytes is important for stem or progenitor cell-like properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Jones1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Wan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, ablation of the floxed &#x003b2;1 integrin allele differs in other cell systems such as the hematopoietic organ. Deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrins has no severe impact on hemtaopoietic stem cell/progenitor cell proliferation, lineage commitment and lineage expansion. It will require further studies to explain why keratinocytes so critically depend on the function of this integrin subfamily while blood cells apparently do not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern (Germany) or the veterinary authorities of Zurich (Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generation of mutant mice</title><p>Mouse genomic clones used to generate the targeting construct were described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005488-Fssler1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b2;4 integrin in young and old hpm mutant mice is increased compared to controls (middle and lower panel, respectively). Mean fluorescence intensities were corrected for background fluorescence. Error bars indicate s.d. At least 2 control and 3 hpm mutant mice per developmental stage were analysed.</p><p>(0.90 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005488.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005488.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Wound healing in hpm mice.
