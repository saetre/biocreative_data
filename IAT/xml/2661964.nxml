In the absence of cargo, kinesin motors are kept inactive to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models state that the Kinesin-3 motor KIF1A is monomeric in the inactive state and that activation results from concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. To test this model, we have examined the activity and dimerization state of KIF1A. Unexpectedly, we found that both native and expressed proteins are dimeric in the inactive state. Thus, KIF1A motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Rather, we show that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms, suggesting a simple model for activation of dimeric KIF1A motors by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in monomeric and dimeric motors that can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. However, only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. Thus, KIF1A may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Molecular motors transport a wide variety of cellular cargoes that are important for diverse cellular phenomena such as mitosis, polarity, motility, and secretion.

Thus, understanding how kinesin motors are regulated to enable transport of the correct cargo to the proper cellular destination at the relevant time is an important biological problem.</p><p>In the absence of cargo, kinesin motors are kept inactive to prevent futile ATP (adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis and motility. Two models have been proposed for how activity is suppressed in the absence of cargo. The first model posits that dimeric motors are regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism. Autoinhibition typically involves a folded state that enables the motor's own tail domain to interact with and inhibit its motor domain. This model is based on a large body of work on the Kinesin-1 motor (formerly conventional kinesin or KIF5) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Interestingly, autoinhibition may be a general model for motor regulation, as two well-studied members of the myosin family, nonmuscle myosin II and myosin V, exist in a folded inactive state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Evidence for this model comes from studies on KIF1A/Unc104 motors where the full-length motors exist in a monomeric, inactive state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Whether mammalian KIF1A motors are regulated by cargo-induced dimerization has never been tested. In addition, although a region of the KIF1A stalk domain has been shown to inhibit microtubule binding of the motor domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, it is unclear how this potential autoinhibitory segment fits in the context of the two models for motor regulation. Furthermore, the sequences that facilitate dimerization remain to be identified.</p><p>Here, we test the models for regulation of mammalian KIF1A motors and relate activity to the monomer/dimer state. We show that expressed and endogenous mammalian KIF1A motors exist in a dimeric, inactive state. Thus, cargo-induced dimerization is not a valid model for mammalian KIF1A motors. Rather, we provide support for an autoinhibition mechanism by identifying the sequences and mechanisms required for dimerization and inhibition. Finally, we show that only dimeric motors undergo processive, ATP-driven motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expressed KIF1A Motors Are Inactive in Mammalian Cells</title><p>To study the regulation and motile properties of mammalian KIF1A under native conditions, rat KIF1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000072-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) was tagged with monomeric citrine (mCit), a variant of yellow fluorescent protein (FP), and expressed in COS cells.

COS cells expressing mCit-KIF1A were transiently permeabilized with the bacterial toxin streptolysin O (SLO).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we first investigated whether expressed KIF1A motors exist as monomers or dimers using coimmunoprecipitation. COS cell lysates coexpressing mCit- and Myc-tagged KIF1A proteins were immunoprecipitated with control antibodies (immunoglobulin G &#x0005b;IgG&#x0005d;) or antibodies to the Myc tag. Coprecipitation of mCit-KIF1A with Myc-KIF1A was observed only with the Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), suggesting that KIF1A exists in a dimeric state. As an alternative method, we used chemical crosslinking. Myc- or mCit-tagged versions of KIF1A were expressed in COS cells, and lysates were untreated or treated with dimethylpimilimidate (DMP). In the presence of DMP, both Myc-KIF1A and mCit-KIF1A motors migrated at approximately twice the molecular weight (MW) of the corresponding noncrosslinked proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;6). A known dimeric motor, the kinesin heavy chain (KHC) subunit of Kinesin-1, undergoes a similar DMP-induced mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, mCit showed no shift in mobility upon DMP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 9 and 10). These results indicate that the expressed KIF1A protein exists in a dimeric state.</p><p>We next probed the monomer/dimer state of KIF1A using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) stoichiometry, a method that calculates an average FRET efficiency (<italic>E</italic><sub>AVE</sub>) and minimizes effects of variable donor and acceptor FP expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

For donor and acceptor FPs placed on the N-terminus of KIF1A (&#x0201c;motor-to-motor&#x0201d; FRET), a low but measurable FRET efficiency was obtained (<italic>E</italic><sub>AVE</sub> &#x0003d; 3.0 &#x000b1; 1.2&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 45 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">1</xref>F). This value is not compatible with a monomeric state of the motor. Rather, this value indicates that KIF1A motors exist in a dimeric state in live cells. The motor-to-motor FRET efficiency of KIF1A is comparable to that of the Kinesin-1 holoenzyme (<italic>E</italic><sub>AVE</sub> &#x0003d; 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 30 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">1</xref>F) whose motor domains are &#x0201c;pushed apart&#x0201d; in the inactive state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. By analogy, it is thus possible that the two motor domains of inactive, dimeric KIF1A motors may be pushed apart as part of the regulatory mechanism. FRET stoichiometry was also used to probe the overall conformation of KIF1A. For donor and acceptor FPs localized at the N- and C-termini of a single KIF1A polypeptide (mCit-KIF1A-mCFP), the low but measurable &#x0201c;motor-to-tail&#x0201d; FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>AVE</sub> &#x0003d; 4.8 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 39 cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000072-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) confirms that KIF1A is not a fully extended molecule. We conclude that KIF1A exists in a compact dimeric state but is not active for microtubule binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Endogenous KIF1A Motors Exist in a Dimeric State</title><p>That KIF1A motors expressed under native conditions exist in a dimeric state was surprising as recombinant and endogenous KIF1A/Unc104 motors have been defined as monomeric kinesins based on hydrodynamic analysis. Thus, we tested whether endogenous KIF1A motors also exist in a dimeric state. We first used crosslinking of cytosolic extracts from rat brain and detergent extracts of murine cortical neurons. In the presence of DMP, the endogenous KIF1A proteins showed a reduced mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), suggestive of a dimeric state. Crosslinking analysis is dependent on the ability of the antibody to recognize the crosslinked species. Unfortunately, the KIF1A antibody was less able to recognize its antigenic sequence after crosslinking than were antibodies to the epitope tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Thus, we sought an alternative method to analyze the monomer/dimer state of endogenous KIF1A motors. Previous reports used hydrodynamic analysis of KIF1A as compared to MW standards &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. As the shape of kinesin motors may influence their hydrodynamic properties, we sought to compare the sedimentation of endogenous KIF1A motors in sucrose gradients to motors with known oligomeric states. Cytosolic extracts of rat brain or detergent extracts of COS cells expressing dimeric Myc-KIF1A or mCit-KIF1A motors were separated by sucrose gradient sedimentation. The majority of the expressed Myc-KIF1A was found in fractions 5&#x02013;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>H), whereas the majority of the expressed mCit-KIF1A was found in fractions 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>H) with the shift likely due to the mCit tag. The endogenous Kinesin-1 protein in rat brain cytosol was also found in fractions 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). Strikingly, the endogenous KIF1A protein in rat brain cytosol was found in fractions 5&#x02013;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g001">Figure 1</xref>H), a mobility identical to that of the expressed dimeric Myc-KIF1A and mCit-KIF1A proteins. It is interesting to note that Kinesin-1 (&#x0223c;360 kDa) and KIF1A motors (&#x0223c;380&#x02013;440 kDa) sediment slower than the marker protein catalase (240 kDa) despite their larger size. Thus, sedimentation as compared to MW standards is not a reliable indication of motor mass. Taken together, these results indicate that endogenous KIF1A exists as a dimeric protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Two Autoinhibitory Mechanisms Regulate KIF1A</title><p>That KIF1A exists in a dimeric and inactive state suggests that dimerization is not sufficient for activation.

We first tested the ability of these constructs to bind to microtubules. KIF1A(1&#x02013;726)-mCit remained cytosolic and did not localize to microtubules upon addition of AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>E), indicating that this protein retains the autoinhibited state of the full-length (FL) molecule. In contrast, deletion of the FHA and CC2 segments resulted in a motor, KIF1A(1&#x02013;491)-mCit, that became trapped in a microtubule-bound state upon addition of AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>E). Thus, the FHA and CC2 domains contribute to autoinhibition by blocking productive interactions with microtubules.

Interestingly, deletion of the CC1 domain resulted in a construct, KIF1A(1&#x02013;393)-mCit, that accumulated on peripheral microtubules at steady state, suggesting that this may be a processive motor. Addition of AMPPNP resulted in an increase in microtubule localization, most notably in the central regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These results suggest that CC1 negatively regulates motility of KIF1A.</p><p>To directly analyze the processive motility of FL and truncated KIF1A motors, we used two assays. First, motility in vivo was indirectly assessed by the ability of KIF1A motors to accumulate at the tips of neurites in neuron-like CAD cells. Second, processive motility in vitro was directly measured using single-molecule motility assays and a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. For the latter, KIF1A constructs were tagged with three tandem copies of mCit for improved signal and decreased photobleaching and photoblinking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>When expressed in differentiated CAD cells, KIF1A-mCit and (1&#x02013;726)-mCit were diffusely localized in the cell body and did not concentrate at the ends of neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). In addition, very few motility events were observed in vitro for KIF1A-3xmCit or (1&#x02013;726)-3xmCit motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>H, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000072-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that truncation of the C-terminal half of KIF1A is not sufficient to relieve autoinhibition of microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>E) or processive motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>F&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>H). Truncation of the FHA&#x0002b;CC2 region also resulted in little to no processive motility for KIF1A(1&#x02013;491) in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) or in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>H, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000072-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Thus, the FHA&#x0002b;CC2 region contributes to autoinhibition by blocking microtubule binding, but an additional mechanism(s) controls the ability of the motor to undergo processive motility. This second control mechanism may reside, at least in part, in the CC1 domain as KIF1A(1&#x02013;393) showed a significantincrease in motility as these motors concentrated at the tips of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) and displayed a large number of processive motility events in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g002">2</xref>H, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000072-t001">Table 1</xref>).

By this analysis, drastic differences between monomeric and dimeric mechanisms of motility became apparent. The motility events of dimeric (1&#x02013;393)-3xmCit motors could be segregated into two classes: first, motile events lasting for short periods of time (&#x0003c;1 s) at a wide variety of speeds and distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, top left panels, red circles) and second, motile events lasting for longer time periods (&#x0003e;1 s) at constant speeds of &#x0223c;1.2 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, top left panel, blue circle) and with run lengths directly dependent on the amount of time spent in motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>E, top left panel, blue circle). We hypothesized that the first class of motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, red circles) is 1D diffusion, whereas the second class of motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, blue circles) is processive motility. Indeed, monomeric KIF1A(1&#x02013;369)-3xmCit motors only moved for short periods of time (&#x0003c;1 s) at a wide variety of speeds and distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, middle left panels, red circles), indicative of 1D diffusion. In contrast, the processive motility of dimeric KHC(1&#x02013;891)-3xmCit motors was evident as these motors spent longer periods of time in motion (&#x0003e;1 s) at a constant speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, bottom left panel, blue circle) and for distances directly dependent on the time spent in motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>E, bottom left panel, blue circle). Thus, dimeric KIF1A(1&#x02013;393) motors display motility properties of both 1D diffusion and processive motility.</p><p>Our second approach was to distinguish these motility classes by their ATP dependence. Diffusion of monomeric KIF1A motors occurs in the weakly bound or ADP (adenosine diphosphate) state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas processive hand-over-hand stepping of kinesin motors requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis. When single-molecule motility assays of monomeric (1&#x02013;369)-3xmCit motors were carried out in the presence of ADP, no change in motility was observed. Monomeric motors continued to move only for short periods of time (&#x0003c;1 s) at various speeds and run lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, middle right panels, red circles), confirming that monomeric KIF1A(1&#x02013;369)-3xmCit motors moved by 1D diffusion. In contrast, the processive motility of dimeric KHC(1&#x02013;891)-3xmCit motors was abolished in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, bottom right panels). The motile properties of dimeric (1&#x02013;393)-3xmCit motors were also highly dependent on nucleotide. Dimeric (1&#x02013;393)-3xmCit motors continued to display short motility events (&#x0003c;1 s) of various velocities and run lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, top right panels, red circles) in the presence of ADP, similar to the monomeric motors. However, dimeric motors were unable to undergo processive motility in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000072-g006">6</xref>E, top right panels). This analysis demonstrates that for motility events that last only short time periods, it is not possible to distinguish 1D diffusion from processive, hand-over-hand motor stepping (overlap of red and blue circles). However, for events that last longer than 0.5&#x02013;1 s, comparisons of velocity and run length to time spent in directional motility enable the separation of motility mechanisms. We conclude that KIF1A motors exist as dimeric molecules that can move by 1D diffusion but show processive motility only in the presence of ATP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The motile properties of kinesin motors must be tightly coupled to the binding and transport of cargo. Two models have been proposed to account for the inactive state of kinesin motors in the absence of cargo. We show that the current model for Kinesin-3 motors, that inactive monomeric motors are activated by cargo-induced dimerization, is not valid for KIF1A as expressed and endogenous motors exist in a dimeric and inactive state. We show instead that regulation is due to autoinhibition by nonmotor regions. Thus, autoinhibition of dimeric motors appears to be a general mechanism for regulating molecular motors.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Dimerization of KIF1A</title><p>We provide four lines of experimental evidence (chemical crosslinking, coimmunoprecipitation, FRET, and photobleaching) to demonstrate that FL KIF1A expressed in mammalian cells exists as a dimeric protein. A concentration-dependent push to the dimeric state seems unlikely since crosslinking, coimmunoprecipitation, and photobleaching assays are carried out under dilute conditions. We also show that endogenous KIF1A behaves as a dimeric motor by crosslinking and sucrose gradient sedimentation. The sedimentation behavior of endogenous KIF1A was previously interpreted, based on comparisons to size standards, as indicating a protein of approximately 200 kDa and thus a monomeric molecule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we show that the sedimentation behavior of endogenous KIF1A is consistent with a dimeric state when compared to Kinesin-1 and KIF1A motors whose oligomeric state has been confirmed in alternative assays.</p><p>The sedimentation behavior of KIF1A is not surprising considering the behavior of other kinesin motors in these assays.

Thus, the oligomeric state of kinesin motors cannot be conclusively determined in sucrose gradients, and perhaps not in other biochemical analyses, by using MW standards and without considering other variables such as protein conformation.

These results do not support a model for cargo-mediated dimerization of Kinesin-3 motors but rather suggest a simple model in which cargo binding relieves autoinhibition of dimeric motors. Using truncation mutants, we identified two regions that contribute to different mechanisms of autoinhibition. First, the FHA and CC2 domains inhibit the interaction of KIF1A with microtubules as KIF1A(1&#x02013;491) motors can bind to microtubules but cannot undergo processive motility, consistent with previous work &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, the CC1 domain regulates processive motility as KIF1A(1&#x02013;393) motors can both bind to microtubules and undergo processive motility. We show that CC1 blocks processive motility by interference with the formation of dimeric motors, perhaps due to an intramolecular interaction with the NC as seen in truncated CeUnc104 motors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. This interaction may contribute to the altered mobility of (1&#x02013;491) motors upon crosslinking. Further studies are required to test whether CC1-mediated inhibition occurs in the FL motor. In this respect, the interaction of CC1 and NC could serve to keep the two motor domains separated and/or uncoordinated, similar to the role of kinesin light chain (KLC) in the autoinhibition of Kinesin-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, the evolutionary development of new kinesin families by the attachment of novel cargo-binding domains onto the catalytic kinesin core may have simultaneously ensured that each family adopt a unique mechanism for autoinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Mechanisms of KIF1A motility</title><p>Our finding that endogenous KIF1A motors exist in a dimeric state indicates that the physiological form that drives processive motion of cargoes in cells is likely to be the dimeric motor.

Whether dimeric KIF1A motors utilize a hand-over-hand mechanism like Kinesin-1 is a question for future experiments.

Yet, it is interesting that 1D diffusion along microtubules has been reported for all three motor classes. The homotetrameric Kinesin-5 motor Eg5 undergoes ATP-independent 1D diffusion in the absence of cargo and switches to ATP-dependent processive motility in the presence of cargo, resulting in the sliding antiparallel microtubules during formation of the mitotic spindle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000072-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.
