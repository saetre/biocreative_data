Despite considerable improvements in surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma remains dismal with median survival of about 15 months. A major reason for this unfavorable outcome is extensive, diffuse invasion of glial tumor cells into surrounding brain tissue, which precludes complete surgical resection and leads to rapid recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. From the biological point of view, glioma invasion is based on interactions of tumor cells with other neoplastic or non-neoplastic cells and with the cerebral extracellular matrix (ECM).</p><p>It has been known for decades that glioblastoma cells <italic>in situ </italic>are able to produce and deposit large amounts of interstitial ECMs such as collagens, fibronectins and laminins, a process that may eventually result in gliosarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, once taken into cell culture glioblastoma cells usually produce increased amounts of ECM components, a process which has been designated mesenchymal drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recent whole genome gene expression analyses have identified a subset of glioblastomas that overexpress transcripts of ECM components, corresponding to a mesenchymal gene expression profile and being associated with worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Matrix gla protein (MGP) is one of the mesenchymal genes overexpressed in glioblastoma samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] as well as in recurrent gliomas undergoing malignant progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, MGP expression in astrocytic tumors appears to be related to grade of malignancy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"/>, Geo database accession numbers GDS1813 and GDS1962). In addition, <italic>in silico </italic>analyses using the REMBRANDT database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov"/>, accessed 10<sup>th </sup>march 2009) revealed more than two-fold upregulation of MGP in glioblastomas as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue, and a correlation (p = 0.0011) between MGP overexpression and worse survival in glioblastomas, suggesting that MGP overexpression is prognostically relevant.</p><p>MGP was originally isolated from bone tissue and is also expressed in kidney, lung, heart, cartilage and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is upregulated in a variety of tumors, including ovarian, breast, urogenital and skin cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. MGP is a 79-amino acid ECM protein containing post-translationally modified &#x003b3;-carboxyglutamic acid residues resulting from vitamin K dependent carboxylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MGP is traditionally considered to be involved in the inhibition of calcification of arteries and cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and germline mutations in MGP cause Keutel syndrome, leading to ectopic abnormal calcification and midfacial hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms linking upregulation of MGP and prognosis in gliomas and, more generally, about the function of MGP in tumors, we hypothesized that MGP promotes glioma migration and performed expression and migration analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>U373fast and U373slow glioma cell line subpopulations, originating from U373MG cells and selected for fast versus slow migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], as well as H4, U343MG, 86HG39 and U373MG glioma cell lines were cultured using standard cell culture conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor and brain samples</title><p>Samples from brain tumor tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen following resection.

We used 16 different glioblastoma samples (n = 10 for mRNA and n = 10 for immunohistochemical analysis, four samples were used for both analysis), including samples from 9 females and 7 males. The mean age (&#x000b1; SEM) of the patients at the time of surgery was 52 (&#x000b1; 0.7), with a range of 35&#x02013;73 years. Two out of these 16 different samples were diagnosed as secondary glioblastoma and 14 were diagnosed as primary glioblastoma. Non-neoplastic, histologically normal cerebral cortices from three adult subjects without neurological symptoms were obtained by autopsy.

After cDNA synthesis 1 &#x003bc;l from the reaction volume was utilized for qRT-PCR measurements. Measurements were done using TaqMan GeneExpressions Assay MGP (Hs00179899_m1, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative MGP mRNA levels were calculated and compared between tumor and normal tissue or between siRNA and control transfected cells, respectively. Data were normalized relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using primers GAPDH-for-ACC CAC TCC TCC ACC TTT GAC (bp-position 928&#x02013;948), GAPDH-rev-CAT ACC AGG AAA TGA GCT TGA CAA (bp-position 1003-980) and the fluorescent labelled probe GAPDH-probe-CTG GCA TTG CCC TCA ACG ACC A (bp-position 956&#x02013;977) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Transfections were performed using the HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against MGP (Hs_MGP_4 HP siRNA (SI00645428); target sequence: TAG CAG CAT TAC TGA AAT ACA), Hs_MGP_8 siRNA (SI04357913); target sequence: CTC CCT ACT GCT GCT ACA CAA) and a non silencing negative control (negative control siRNA (1022076); target sequence: AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT) (all siRNAs purchased from Qiagen).

After being washed three times with PBS scratches including the flanking front lines of cells, were photographed (40-fold magnification). Cells were incubated under standard conditions and migration into the scratched area was photographed 24 h and 48 h after wounding (corresponding to 48 h and 72 h post-transfection). The edges of the wound were marked after scratching (time point 0 h), cells migrating over the edges were counted and the number of cells was determined related to the total area of the scratch. Wound closing was compared between MGP knockdown cells and control transfected cells and evaluated using the analysis FIVE software (Soft Imaging System, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany). Differences between two data points were determined by Student's t test where p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.

Compared to classical Boyden chambers, these filters have hydrophobic masks surrounding each of the 96 filter sites. The masks eliminate the need for a top chamber, because they create surface tension, keeping the cell suspension positioned on the hydrophilic filter site located directly above the bottom wells. Each filter site is 5.7 mm in diameter and pores are 8 &#x003bc;m in diameter. Wells ("lower chambers") were filled with 30 &#x003bc;l of DMEM alone. Polycarbonate filters were positioned on microplates and secured in place with corner pins. 24 h after siRNA mediated knockdown 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>U373fast, U343MG or H4 glioma cells in 60 &#x003bc;l DMEM were placed directly onto the filter sites ("upper chambers") and incubated for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Non-migrating cells on the top of the filters were removed by gently wiping the filters with cotton swabs. Migrating cells on the bottom side were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33258 for 3 min. Stained cells were then captured using a BX50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and cells were quantified using morphometry software (analysis FIVE, Soft Imaging System). Differences between two data points were determined by Student's t-test where p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. Two independent experiments were performed, each of them using 8 fold replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Proliferation assay</title><p>Cellular growth was assessed by (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl))-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.

For each time point, an exponential dilution series of cells was used with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells as starting dilution. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with 200 &#x003bc;l MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml) and incubated for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. MTT solution was discarded and 200 &#x003bc;l of isopropanol was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Measurement was done at 570 nm using an ELISA reader upon 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (corresponding to 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h after transfection). Experiments were independently performed three times, and 6 &#x02013; 10 wells were evaluated for each experimental condition.

No difference was detected between MGP knockdown cells and control transfected cells (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have demonstrated that MGP expression at mRNA and protein levels is upregulated in glioblastoma tissues and cell lines, confirming previous expression profiling studies using DNA microchip analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Based on the immunocytochemical demonstration of intracytoplasmic MGP protein in glioblastoma biopsy specimens and glioma cell lines we conclude that production by glial tumor cells rather than mesenchymal elements (e.g. abnormal blood vessels) is responsible for overexpression of this mesenchymal component in gliomas. Furthermore, human glioma cells, selected for high migration capacity (U373fast) showed elevated MGP expression compared to their less migrating counterparts (U373slow). Knockdown of MGP using siRNA in three different glioma cell lines led to decreased cell migration as demonstrated using two different migration assays, whereas proliferation remained unchanged. Collectively, these findings suggest that MGP is involved in glioblastoma cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>While neural MGP expression has previously been found in rat retinal ganglion cells after induction with glia conditioned factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], most previous studies have focused on the role of MGP in cartilage, bone and blood vessels, because vascular smooth muscle cells and chondrocytes are the major sites of MGP expression. MGP serves as an inhibitor of cardiovascular calcification as observed in MGP null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and arterial and valvular calcification after warfarin intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, MGP enhances VEGF expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells by increasing the activity of TGF-&#x003b2;1 signalling through activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) and the SMAD1/5/8 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The functional role of MGP in neoplasia remains unclear, but in line with our findings in gliomas, increased levels of MGP were found in ovarian, breast, urogenital and skin cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although decreased levels of MGP have been found in colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and loss of MGP expression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and prostatic carcinoma compared with primary tumors has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms linking MGP knockdown and reduced migration of glioblastoma cells remain to be determined, but based on available evidence it is conceivable that interactions with members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family and the ECM component vitronectin are involved. BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. MGP regulates BMP4 in vascular endothelial cells, and MGP is able to bind BMP2 and promote an association between BMP2 and matrix components; interaction between MGP and BMP2 interferes with binding of BMP2 to its receptor and activation of Smad1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, BMPs inhibit the tumorigenic potential of human brain tumor-initiating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], so that MGP-induced repression of BMP signalling may retain tumor cells in an undifferentiated state with enhanced migration potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, MGP effects on glioblastoma cell migration might be mediated by binding of MGP to vitronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Vitronectin is a multifunctional plasma and ECM protein, which serves roles in cell adhesion, complement activation, coagulation and fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. MGP might regulate cell migration via vitronectin receptors of the integrin family, which are known to play important roles in glioblastoma migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Like MGP, vitronectin expression in gliomas is known to increase with tumor grade <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Of note, the binding of MGP to vitronectin does not interfere with possible interactions of MGP and BMP2, because the binding regions are different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, the migratory promoting effect of MGP on glioblastoma cell lines might be mediated by both BMPs and vitronectin.</p><p>Glioma cells in vitro and <italic>in situ </italic>express various ECM components that modulate their microenvironment and promote migration, including collagens, laminins, brevican, tenascin-C and SPARC. These components interact with tumor cells via ECM receptors of the integrin type. Another pair of ECM component/receptor is hyaluronan and CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Several of the components identified in glioma ECMs are permissive substrates enhancing cell migration, but like the interaction of MGP and vitronectin, effects can be modulated by additional ligands or modifications. For example, brevican exposed its promigratory attributes after cleavage by members of the ADAMTS protease family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and glioma migration on laminin is stimulated by binding of glycosaminoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These findings suggest that it is stimulation of invasion by MGP and other ECM components, which underlies the unfavorable prognosis of glioblastomas with mesenchymal gene expression profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MGP is overexpressed in glioma cells, while siRNA mediated knockdown leads to decreased glioma cell migration. Taking into account previous data on negative prognostic effects of MGP overexpression in glioblastomas, our data suggest that upregulation of MGP in concert with other ECM-related components may result in unfavorable prognosis via increased invasion.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Sonja Mertsch carried out the molecular studies, participated in functional assays and drafted the manuscript.
