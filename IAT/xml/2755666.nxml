PrP<sup>C</sup> is bound to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, although a secreted, soluble form has also been identified. Previously we reported that PrP<sup>C</sup> is subject to ectodomain shedding from the membrane by zinc metalloproteinases with a similar inhibition profile to those involved in shedding the amyloid precursor protein. Here we have used gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss-of-function (small interfering RNA knockdown) experiments in cells to identify the ADAMs (<underline>a</underline><underline>d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloproteinases) involved in the ectodomain shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>. These experiments revealed that ADAM9 and ADAM10, but not ADAM17, are involved in the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> and that ADAM9 exerts its effect on PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding via ADAM10. Using dominant negative, catalytically inactive mutants, we show that the catalytic activity of ADAM9 is required for its effect on ADAM10. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ADAM10, but not ADAM9, cleaved PrP between Gly<sup>228</sup> and Arg<sup>229</sup>, three residues away from the site of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The shedding of another membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein &#x003b2;-secretase BACE1, by ADAM9 is also mediated via ADAM10. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding or activation of both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> shedding by ADAM10 overexpression in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma N2a cells does not alter the formation of proteinase K-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Collectively, these data indicate that although PrP<sup>C</sup> can be shed through the action of ADAM family members, modulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> or PrP<sup>Sc</sup> ectodomain shedding does not regulate prion conversion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The prion protein (PrP)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> is the causative agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In these diseases the cellular form of PrP (PrP<sup>C</sup>) undergoes a conformational conversion to the infectious form PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that is characterized biochemically by its resistance to digestion with proteinase K (PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Mature PrP<sup>C</sup> is anchored to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and, like most GPI-anchored proteins, is clustered into cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membrane rafts (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although the precise subcellular site of conversion remains undefined, conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is believed to occur either at the cell surface or within the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies indicate that modulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels at the cell surface may represent a possible future disease intervention strategy. For example, the retention of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the cell surface and concomitant prevention of its endocytosis through the use of PrP antibodies inhibited PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Furthermore, the sterol-binding polyene antibiotic filipin reduced endocytosis, and induced cellular release, of PrP<sup>C</sup> with a concomitant reduction in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that modulation of cell surface PrP<sup>C</sup> levels by the novel sorting nexin SNX33 can interfere with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Nonetheless, the natural processes regulating PrP<sup>C</sup> levels at the cell surface remain poorly defined. One such mechanism of regulation is via shedding of the bulk of the ectodomain of PrP<sup>C</sup> either through cleavage of the polypeptide close to the GPI anchor or within the GPI anchor itself. Indeed, it has long been established that PrP<sup>C</sup> can be shed into the medium of cultured cells and is present as a soluble form <italic>in vivo</italic> in human cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Numerous cell surface proteins can be proteolytically shed by the action of a group of zinc metalloproteinases known collectively as secretases or sheddases (reviewed in Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Whereas most proteolytically shed proteins are derived from transmembrane polypeptide-anchored substrates, several GPI-anchored proteins, including the folate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ART2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and a GPI-anchored construct of angiotensin-converting enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) are shed by the action of metalloproteinases. We have previously shown that PrP<sup>C</sup> can also be proteolytically shed from the cell surface through the action of one or more zinc metalloproteinases with similar properties to those of the &#x003b1;-secretases responsible for the shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This &#x003b1;-secretase-mediated ectodomain shedding of APP from the cell surface is carried out by at least three members of the <underline>a</underline><underline>d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloproteinase (ADAM) family, namely ADAM9, -10, and -17 (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition to cleavage by ADAMs, APP is also cleaved by the &#x003b2;-secretase, BACE1 (&#x003b2;-site APP-cleaving enzyme) and the &#x003b3;-secretase complex to release the neurotoxic amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). BACE1 itself is also subject to ectodomain shedding by as yet unidentified members of the ADAM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>The similarities between the ectodomain shedding of APP and PrP<sup>C</sup>, in particular the similar profile of inhibition by a range of hydroxamate-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), led us to investigate whether the same members of the ADAM family were also involved in the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>. It should be noted that this ectodomain shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> by cleavage of the polypeptide chain near to the site (Ser<sup>231</sup>) of GPI anchor addition in the C terminus of the protein is distinct from the so-called &#x003b1;-cleavage between residues 111 and 112 in the middle of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This latter &#x0201c;endoproteolytic&#x0201d; cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> is reported to be carried out by members of the ADAM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of ADAMs in the ectodomain shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>, we used loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments in cultured cells in which candidate PrP sheddases were either knocked down by siRNA or overexpressed. We have also further characterized the shedding of BACE1 by comparison to the shedding of APP and PrP<sup>C</sup>. In addition, we have explored whether proteolytic shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> is of importance in regulating its conversion into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibody 3F4 (Cambridge Bioscience Ltd., Cambridge, UK) recognizes the 3F4 epitope tag (corresponding to amino acid residues 109&#x02013;112 of human PrP) at residues 108&#x02013;111 of murine PrP.

Proteolysis as a mechanism of PrP<sup>C</sup> ectodomain shedding was first hypothesized with the observation that the mobility of secreted PrP<sup>C</sup> was not altered after treatment with aqueous hydrofluoric acid as would be expected had the protein been shed by the action of a phospholipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Confirming that PrP<sup>C</sup> can be proteolytically shed, we have previously shown that a range of hydroxamate-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitors have an identical inhibitory profile in relation to PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding and the shedding of APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), strongly suggesting that the two proteins are shed by the same protease(s). Here we have extended that study and directly assessed the roles of ADAM9, -10, and -17 in PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding by direct comparison to APP shedding. We show that overexpression of either ADAM9 or ADAM10, but not of ADAM17, enhances the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Using siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous ADAM9 and -10, we were able to confirm that these two proteases were responsible for the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> at least in cell culture models.</p><p>Koike <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) showed that co-expression of ADAM9 with APP in COS cells enhanced production of soluble APP and made the logical conclusion that the catalytic activity of ADAM9 was directly responsible for APP shedding. However, it has since been demonstrated that ADAM9 enhances APP shedding in an indirect fashion via stimulation of ADAM10 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Using the novel approach of overexpression of ADAM9 in the presence of siRNA knockdown of ADAM10, we were able to confirm that ADAM9 exerts its effect on APP shedding by modulation of ADAM10. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that this phenomenon is not restricted to the ADAM9-mediated shedding of APP, as the shedding of both PrP<sup>C</sup> and BACE1 by ADAM9 was also dependent on ADAM10. In addition, we have shown that the proteolytic activity of ADAM9 is critical for its ability to modulate ADAM10, as a catalytically inactive mutant of ADAM9 did not enhance the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>, and that ADAM9 on its own was unable to cleave recombinant PrP. These results raise the question as to whether ADAM9 directly cleaves and sheds other membrane proteins or always acts via ADAM10. In the light of this, the role of ADAM9 in the shedding of other &#x0201c;substrates,&#x0201d; <italic>e.g.</italic> Kit ligand, p75 neurotrophin receptor, Delta-like ligand-1, and pro-epidermal growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), may need to be revisited.</p><p>Recently, both ADAM9 and ADAM15 have been shown to proteolytically cleave ADAM10 releasing the ectodomain into the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The resulting membrane-bound stub was then subject to cleavage by &#x003b3;-secretase, and the intracellular domain translocated to the nucleus, providing evidence that ADAM10 itself undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). It is unclear whether the soluble ectodomain of ADAM10 is capable of cleaving membrane-bound substrates, and although it was catalytically active against synthetic peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), it was incapable of shedding APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>Shedding of the ectodomain of PrP<sup>C</sup> by ADAM10 would require cleavage of the polypeptide chain close to the site of the GPI anchor attachment. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that this is indeed the case, with recombinant ADAM10 cleaving PrP three residues upstream of the Ser residue to which the GPI anchor is attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Cleavage at this site is consistent with known ADAM10 cleavage sites in other substrates, in particular that basic residues are preferred at the P<sub>1</sub>&#x02032; and P<sub>2</sub>&#x02032; sites and Ser is strongly preferred at P<sub>3</sub>&#x02032;. Interestingly, the analysis of C-terminal peptides derived from endoproteinase Lys-C digests of hamster PrP<sup>Sc</sup> revealed that although the majority of the molecules were GPI anchored, &#x0223c;15% had a C-terminal peptide that ended with Gly<sup>228</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), consistent with cleavage at this site by ADAM10. Recently, an anchorless fragment of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which lacks a few amino acids at the very end of the C terminus together with the GPI anchor, was detected in the brains of patients with both sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In light of the data presented in this study it is possible that these C-terminally truncated forms of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> identified <italic>in vivo</italic> are a result of the action of ADAM10 in shedding PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Cleavage at the Gly<sup>228</sup>&#x02013;Arg<sup>229</sup> bond is also consistent with our previous data that sPrP was recognized by the R1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) whose epitope is within residues 220&#x02013;231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Recently, a novel 9-kDa C-terminal fragment of PrP<sup>C</sup>, termed C3, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). This C3 fragment does not appear to correspond to the C-terminal fragment following ectodomain shedding by ADAM10, as its generation was inhibited by E64, and it was recognized by the antibody R1, suggesting that C3 is cleaved upstream of residue 220 by a cysteine protease.</p><p>In addition to the proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup> within its juxtamembrane region, we also examined the role of ADAMs in the endoproteolytic &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> between amino acid residues His<sup>111</sup> and Met<sup>112</sup>. We show that both overexpression of ADAM9, -10, and -17 and depletion of ADAM9 and -10 did not alter levels of the PrP<sup>C</sup> proteolytic fragment C1 in HEK cell lysates. These results appear to contradict previous reports that demonstrated an increase in N1 secretion from HEK cells overexpressing the same ADAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, these previous studies examined only the secretion of a minor pool of N1 into conditioned medium and did not examine the effect of the ADAMs on the cell-associated production of proteolytic PrP<sup>C</sup> fragments. Recently, we have reported that the endoproteolytic &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> occurs predominantly in a late compartment of the secretory pathway, prior to full-length PrP<sup>C</sup> reaching the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In this study we have examined cell-associated levels of C1, as opposed to secreted N1, and we show that ADAM9, -10, and -17 overexpression, and ADAM9 and -10 depletion, did not affect the production of the former fragment. These data indicate that alternative unidentified proteinases are responsible for the bulk cell-associated endoproteolytic &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p><p>For the first time, we have examined the effect of modulating proteolytic ectodomain shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> on the production of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in scrapie-infected N2a cells. As PrP<sup>C</sup> transport to the cell surface and/or its subsequent endocytosis appears to be required for <italic>de novo</italic> PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), it might be expected that the inhibition of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding and the subsequent accumulation of the protein at the cell surface would promote PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. Conversely, one might expect that enhanced shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> would reduce the amount of PrP<sup>C</sup> substrate at the cell surface available for prion conversion. However, although) PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding was clearly inhibited by GW0264 treatment and PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> shedding were increased by ADAM10 overexpression, we observed no concomitant alteration in the accumulation of proteinase K-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the ScN2a cells. These data imply that alterations to the basal shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> do not influence PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation, at least in this cell system. One possible explanation for this lack of effect of altering the proteolytic shedding of either PrP<sup>C</sup> or PrP<sup>Sc</sup> on the conversion process is because the shedding by ADAM10 affects only a minority of the membrane-bound protein, whereas cleavage by phospholipase C or exposure to a PrP<sup>C</sup>-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) affects a larger proportion of the membrane-bound protein, thus impacting on the conversion process.</p><p>From the observation that SNX33 overexpression increased the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> and reduced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion, it was concluded that modulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, this explanation may be oversimplified as these authors also demonstrated that SNX33 overexpression impaired the endocytic trafficking of PrP<sup>C</sup>. As the endocytic pathway is a suggested site of prion conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), it may be through blocking this that SNX33 affects the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. By modulation of one of the proteinases, ADAM10, directly responsible for PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> shedding, our data argue that subtle modulation of PrP shedding is unlikely to offer a new avenue for therapeutic strategies for the treatment of prion diseases. Nevertheless, the precise dissection of the cell biology of PrP<sup>C</sup> by studies such as these provides a realistic avenue toward the development of new treatments for prion diseases by increasing our understanding of the cellular processes governing prion conversion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Medical Research Council of Great Britain Grant G9824728, Wellcome Trust Grant 080229/Z/06/Z, and the University of Leeds.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN4"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">PrP</term><def><p>prion protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">ADAM</term><def><p>a disintegrin and metalloprotease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">APP</term><def><p>amyloid precursor protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">BACE1</term><def><p>&#x003b2;-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">GPI</term><def><p>glycosylphosphatidylinositol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">HEK</term><def><p>human embryonic kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">MS</term><def><p>mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">PK</term><def><p>proteinase K</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">PrP<sup>C</sup></term><def><p>cellular form of PrP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">PrP<sup>Sc</sup></term><def><p>proteinase-resistant form of PrP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">rprP</term><def><p>recombinant PrP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">sAPP&#x003b1;</term><def><p>soluble form of APP derived from &#x003b1;-secretase cleavage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">sBACE1</term><def><p>shed form of BACE1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">SNX</term><def><p>sorting nexin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">sPrP</term><def><p>shed form of PrP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">RT</term><def><p>reverse transcription</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G18">dn</term><def><p>dominant negative.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aguzzi</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2006</year>) <source>J.
