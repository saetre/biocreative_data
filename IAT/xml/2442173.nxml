In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, low voltage&#x02013;activated inward current consists of I<sub>CaT</sub> and a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive I<sub>Ca</sub> component (I<sub>Ca(TTX)</sub>). In this study, we reexamined the nature of low-threshold I<sub>Ca</sub> in dog atrium, as well as whether it is affected by Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel toxins. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. In the absence of external Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, a transient inward current activated near &#x02212;50 mV, peaked at &#x02212;30 mV, and reversed around &#x0002b;40 mV (HP &#x0003d; &#x02212;90 mV). It was unaffected by 30 &#x003bc;M TTX or micromolar concentrations of external Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, but was inhibited by 50 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (by &#x0223c;90%) or 5 &#x003bc;M mibefradil (by &#x0223c;50%), consistent with the reported properties of I<sub>CaT</sub>. Addition of 30 &#x003bc;M TTX in the presence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> increased the current approximately fourfold (41% of control), and shifted the dose&#x02013;response curve of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block to the right (IC<sub>50</sub> from 7.6 to 30 &#x003bc;M). Saxitoxin (STX) at 1 &#x003bc;M abolished the current left in 50 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In the absence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, STX potently blocked I<sub>CaT</sub> (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 185 nM) and modestly reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 1.6 &#x003bc;M). While TTX produced no direct effect on I<sub>CaT</sub> elicited by expression of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.1 and hCa<sub>V</sub>3.2 in HEK-293 cells, it significantly attenuated the block of this current by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub> increased to 550 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and 15 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2); in contrast, 30 &#x003bc;M TTX directly inhibited hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3-induced I<sub>CaT</sub> and the addition of 750 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to the TTX-containing medium led to greater block of the current that was not significantly different than that produced by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone. 1 &#x003bc;M STX directly inhibited Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1-, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2-, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-mediated I<sub>CaT</sub> but did not enhance the ability of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to block these currents. These findings provide important new implications for our understanding of structure&#x02013;function relationships of I<sub>CaT</sub> in heart, and further extend the hypothesis of a parallel evolution of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels from an ancestor with common structural motifs.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>H.

The pore-forming or &#x003b1;-subunit of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels share in common the basic structure of a single linear sequence of amino acids characterized by four repeat sequences containing each six transmembrane domains (S1&#x02013;S6), with the fourth transmembrane segment of each repeat bearing positively charged residues conferring voltage-sensitive properties to the channel. For both classes of channels, the amino acid segment between S5 and S6 of each repeat dips back into the membrane from the extracellular space and forms the basic structure of the pore or P-loop of the channel. Each P-loop repeat shares one critical residue that forms a ring of four amino acid residues conferring ion selectivity and permeation across the pore. For Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, the signature sequence of repeats I&#x02013;IV is DEKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall, 2000</xref>), whereas for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, it is EEXX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>), where X is either E or D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; SF, selectivity filter). Mutation of the Lys of repeat III or Ala of repeat IV to Glu conferred Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> selectivity to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, again supporting commonality in their evolutionary heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinemann et al., 1992</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Amino acid sequence alignments of the pore region of several vertebrate voltage-gated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels.

Similar to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels and contrary to high threshold voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels (e.g., L-type), T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels activate in the negative range of membrane potentials and exhibit relatively fast activation and inactivation kinetics and have a small unitary conductance (&#x0223c;7 pS with 100 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as charge carrier). There is also recent evidence for similarities in the pore region between Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels and T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McNulty et al. (2006)</xref> recently showed that mutating Asn406 to Ala or Cys in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 conferred &#x0201c;T-type&#x02013;like&#x0201d; blocking action of mibefradil, a putative blocker of T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, on Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels and yielded slower inactivation. An alignment of the P-loop region of the four repeats of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.3 thought to generate T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vassort et al., 2006</xref>) shows significant homology with that of various mammalian Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) are two structurally related heterocyclic guanidinium marine toxins that potently inhibit voltage-gated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels by an interaction with several residues in the P-loop as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (labeled in red). In view of the structural similarities within or near the pore region of the two classes of channels and the possibility that they may have evolved from a common ancestor, we wondered whether these toxins also interact with T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. We examined the effects of TTX and STX from several commercial sources on I<sub>CaT</sub> recorded from canine atrial myocytes or from HEK 293 cells transfected with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. TTX exerted no significant effect on the magnitude of native I<sub>CaT</sub> and I<sub>CaT</sub> generated by either Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, the two isoforms predominantly expressed in heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vassort et al., 2006</xref>), while it inhibited Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-induced I<sub>CaT</sub>. Interestingly, for both native I<sub>CaT</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1- or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2-induced I<sub>CaT</sub>, TTX partially relieved the blockade of this current by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Finally, STX directly inhibited I<sub>CaT</sub> in dog atrial cells and that elicited by expression of all three Ca<sub>V</sub>3 subclasses. Our studies further extend the notion that voltage-gated Na<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels share signature properties and may have arisen from a common ancestor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the NIH and the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and was approved by the Montreal Heart Institute Animal Care Committee.</p><sec><title>Cell Dispersion Technique</title><p>Adult mongrel dogs (20&#x02013;30 kg) were anesthetized with morphine (2 mg/kg s.c.) and &#x003b1;-chloralose (120 mg/kg i.v.) and mechanically ventilated.

With tips &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;m in diameter, patch pipette resistance ranged between 2 and 4 M&#x003a9; when the micropipette was filled with the internal solution containing (in mM) CsCl 120, TEA 20, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgATP 5, HEPES 10, GTP.Na 0.1, and EGTA 10, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Voltage clamp protocols were computer driven using Digidata 1200 series acquisition system with PClamp software (v. 8.0 or 9.2) and an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices). Pipette and stray capacitance, as well as series resistance were compensated for in all experiments. Membrane currents were low-pass filtered at 1 or 2 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter) before being acquired at a sampling rate of 2 or 5 kHz. After gaining whole-cell access, myocytes were held at the standard holding potential &#x02212;90 mV, and cell dialysis was allowed to proceed for at least 5 min before any voltage clamp protocol was initiated. To minimize the undesirable effects of I<sub>CaL</sub> rundown on the measurement of low threshold I<sub>Ca</sub>, we used a voltage clamp protocol consisting of two test pulses (TP1 and TP2) to different voltages separated by a 500-ms interval at &#x02212;50 mV. The current elicited by TP1 comprised both low and high threshold Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents, and that evoked by TP2 mainly consisted of I<sub>CaL</sub>. Digital subtraction of I<sub>CaL</sub> from total Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> current recorded during TP1 yielded the low threshold T-type I<sub>Ca</sub> (I<sub>CaT</sub>).

Another set of experiments also shows that LVA elicited at negative potentials is unaffected by 50 &#x003bc;M Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the external medium (P &#x0003e; 0.05), a concentration previously shown to partially inhibit I<sub>Ca(TTX)</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>), while higher concentrations of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> led to the appearance of a faster TTX-sensitive inward current consistent with cardiac I<sub>Na</sub> (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709883/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200709883/DC1</ext-link>). These results are consistent with the existence of two types of inward Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> current in this cardiac preparation with distinct kinetics and voltage dependence resembling those previously reported in other systems: low threshold T-type (I<sub>CaT</sub>) and high threshold L-type (I<sub>CaL</sub>) Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bean, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitra and Morad, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDonald et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fareh et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relief of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced Blockade of Native I<sub>CaT</sub> by TTX</title><p>While examining the pharmacological profile of the LVA in our preparation, we found that TTX does in fact interact with I<sub>CaT</sub> but in a very peculiar manner. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> shows a sample experiment demonstrating this effect. In control conditions, a 200-ms step to &#x02212;30 mV from HP &#x0003d; &#x02212;90 mV evoked a typical I<sub>CaT</sub>, which was inhibited &#x0003e;80% by 50 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In the continued presence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, application of 30 &#x003bc;M TTX partially relieved the block exerted by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (P &#x0003c; 0.001). This sustained effect was consistently observed in all 16 myocytes studied and took place regardless of the order of application of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or TTX. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> illustrates that the effect of TTX on Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced block of I<sub>CaT</sub> was not shared by the structurally unrelated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel antagonist lidocaine. Moreover, the inhibition of I<sub>CaT</sub> by an 8&#x02013;10-min exposure to 5 &#x003bc;M mibefradil could not be reversed by 30 &#x003bc;M TTX; the amplitude of I<sub>CaT</sub> elicited at &#x02212;30 mV from HP &#x0003d; &#x02212;90 mV was &#x02212;67 &#x000b1; 14 pA in the presence of 5 &#x003bc;M mibrefradil, and &#x02212;61 &#x000b1; 13 pA after exposure to mibefradil and TTX (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3; P &#x0003e; 0.05). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> shows mean <italic>I</italic>-<italic>V</italic> relationships for peak inward current recorded from HP &#x0003d; &#x02212;90 mV in control conditions, after the addition of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and in the combined presence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and 30 &#x003bc;M TTX. Nickel abolished I<sub>CaT</sub> and partially suppressed I<sub>CaL</sub>; for example, the inward current recorded at &#x0002b;20 mV, which mainly consists of I<sub>CaL</sub> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), was inhibited 46% by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, a result consistent with previous studies in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDonald et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hobai et al., 2000</xref>). Most importantly, this plot shows that the partial relief of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block by TTX was mainly apparent between &#x02212;40 and &#x0223c;&#x0002b;10 mV, which supports the idea that TTX interacts with I<sub>CaT</sub> but not I<sub>CaL</sub>. Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant difference (P &#x0003c; 0.05) of I<sub>CaT</sub> densities obtained in control, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-treated, and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> plus TTX-treated conditions over the voltage range from &#x02212;40 to &#x02212;10 mV. It also suggests that the relief of the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block of I<sub>CaT</sub> by TTX is voltage dependent, being attenuated by membrane depolarization. This observation would be consistent with an electrostatic repulsion of the TTX molecule as it carries a net positive charge at physiological pH.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>TTX, but not lidocaine relieves the blockade of I<sub>CaT</sub> by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in dog atrium.

A similar trend was observed for this Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel isoform, including lack of effect of TTX, attenuation of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> blockade by TTX, direct inhibition by STX, and maximal block by the combined addition of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and STX, which was not significantly different from the level of block achieved by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). In contrast to the lack of effect of TTX on Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, the toxin at a concentration of 30 &#x003bc;M inhibited I<sub>CaT</sub> mediated by Ca<sub>v</sub>3.3 by &#x0003e;60% (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, middle set of traces). The addition of 750 &#x003bc;M Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the presence of TTX led to further block of I<sub>CaT</sub>, which was similar to that produced by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, leftward set of traces). The higher concentration of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was chosen to produce similar block of I<sub>CaT</sub> and is consistent, as for I<sub>CaT</sub> arising from the expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, with the low affinity of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-mediated I<sub>CaT</sub> for Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x02248; 216 &#x003bc;M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). Finally, 1 &#x003bc;M STX produced similar inhibitory effects on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-elicited I<sub>CaT</sub> to those observed on currents arising from expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), with a similar response to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the presence of the toxin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, rightward set of traces). <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref> summarizes the data pooled from six to eight cells.

Our data indicate that while TTX produced no effect on cardiac I<sub>CaT</sub>, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, the toxin significantly attenuated the block produced by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In contrast, STX exerted relatively high affinity block of cardiac I<sub>CaT</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1&#x02013;3.3, and did not affect Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced inhibition of I<sub>CaT</sub>; TTX produced similar effects on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. These results point to common toxin-binding sites on I<sub>CaT</sub> and I<sub>Na</sub> channels and support the hypothesis that voltage-dependent T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels may have evolved from a common ancestor.</p><sec><title>Low Threshold Inward Current in Dog Atrial Myocytes is a T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Current</title><p>In the absence of external sodium ions, low voltage&#x02013;activated inward calcium current (LVA) was consistently recorded in all canine atrial myocytes studied.

LVA was likely not the product of a TTX-sensitive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry mechanism since the latter pathway has been shown to be inhibited by TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemaire et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>) or low concentrations (10&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M) of external Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>), but is unaffected by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations up to 250 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemaire et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heubach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore conclude that LVA in canine atrial cells is generated by a T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel that is most likely primarily encoded by Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 since the IC<sub>50</sub> for the block of I<sub>CaT</sub> by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (7.6 &#x003bc;M) in our study is similar to the range of values measured for expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 but more than 20-fold lower than Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2006</xref>), the other major subunit known to be expressed in heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vassort et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Channel Toxins Interact with T-Type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Channels</title><p>The most salient observation of the present study was the demonstration that TTX and STX interact with I<sub>CaT</sub>. The nature of the TTX interaction is very peculiar in that the toxin does not apparently influence the voltage dependence and kinetics of cardiac I<sub>CaT</sub> but reduces the efficacy of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced block of this current. With the exception of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, which was blocked by TTX, the toxin produced similar effects on I<sub>CaT</sub> arising from Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 expressed in HEK-293 cells. It appears unlikely that the effects of both toxins would be due to the presence of undesired contaminants as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones and Marks (1989)</xref>, who reported that STX produced a variable inhibition of a low threshold Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> current in bullfrog sympathetic neurons whose potency varied with different batches of the toxin. We tested TTX and STX from respectively two and three different commercial sources and obtained results that were quantitatively similar. The responses of I<sub>CaT</sub> to both toxins were also unaffected by buffering heavy metals with EDTA, arguing against the possibility that such metals significantly contaminate the commercial toxin preparations.</p><p>Although it has been suggested that part of the inhibitory activity of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> takes place in the pore region between S5 and S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1999</xref>), a more recent study from the same group postulated that His191 of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, as opposed to Gln172 in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 located in the extracellular loop between S3 and S4 of domain I, is responsible for the &#x0223c;60-fold higher sensitivity of this channel to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> than Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2006</xref>). In view of the location of this site in close proximity to the voltage sensor in S4 and its remote location from the P-loop, combined with the fact that the block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was use independent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al. (2006)</xref> proposed that the divalent cation exerts its inhibitory activity by an effect on gating resulting in pore closure. Whether TTX is able to bind to this site is unknown. However, our data clearly showed that TTX competitively antagonized without mimicking the effect of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on native I<sub>CaT</sub>, an effect that was also observed with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2. Such an interaction could potentially explain why the toxin did not exert any effect on native or these cloned I<sub>CaT</sub> in the absence of the blocker. In this scheme, STX would not only bind to the same site with higher affinity, presumably facilitated by its additional positive charge, but would also imitate Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> by mediating block of the pore. However, histidine at that same position is also replaced by a glutamine (Gln172) in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 and yet STX blocked Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 with nearly equal efficacies, and TTX also blocked this current.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that TTX binds to, as it does on Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, a region within the outer vestibule near the pore of I<sub>CaT</sub> channels. TTX binding would not obstruct Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding and flux through the pore but would partially occlude the binding of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> through a competitive interaction, or alternatively by a remote alteration of the structure of the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site between S3 and S4 of domain I (His191) when the toxin occupies the pore. On the other hand, STX would bind these channels with higher affinity than TTX, perhaps due to the presence of an additional positively charged guanidinium group, resulting in reduced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry through the pore. The alignment of the pore region of the four domains of several Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel subtypes and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 is displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The figure highlights in red the critical residues reported to be involved in TTX and STX binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Terlau et al., 1991</xref>). Based on the results of single point mutations, the amino acids of the four repeat domains forming the SF of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (0&#x02032;) and those downstream from the N terminus by four positions (3&#x02032;) are postulated to form two rings of charges that are critical for toxin interaction with the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Terlau et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hille, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipkind and Fozzard (1994)</xref> performed molecular modeling of the interaction of TTX with the rat brain II and skeletal muscle (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4) Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, which are sensitive to TTX in the nanomolar range, and suggested that the positive charge of the guanidinium group of TTX interacts electrostatically with three carboxyl groups of Domains I (D384, E387) and II (E942), while the hydroxyl groups of C10 and C11 of TTX would form hydrogen bonds with Glu 945 of Domain II. It has been demonstrated that the aromatic residue Tyr or Phe of TTX-sensitive channels located immediately adjacent to Asp 384 of Domain I is responsible for conferring high sensitivity of these Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels to the toxin. This residue is substituted by a cysteine in the cardiac-specific TTX-resistant isoform Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backx et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Satin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) or by a Ser in the TTX-insensitive Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels found in the nervous system (Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The cysteine at that position is also responsible for the higher sensitivity of the cardiac-type Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel to group IIb metals such as Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Satin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backx et al., 1992</xref>). The model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipkind and Fozzard (1994)</xref> was also able to predict the important role played by the aromatic residue that stabilized toxin binding most likely by an interaction with its ring structure. It was predicted that due to the presence of a second guanidinium group, the additional positive charge would also interact with Asp 1717 of Domains IV. In a subsequent study examining differences in interactions of the two toxins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Penzotti et al. (1998)</xref> showed that while mutations of the selectivity residues (DEKA) produced equivalent effects on both toxins, the aromatic residue (C, Y, or F) adjacent to the Asp (D400 of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) of Domain I involved in selectivity is more important for TTX binding, while the outer residues of Domains II (E758 of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4) and IV (D1540 of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4) play a more critical function in STX binding. Using various analogues of STX, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choudhary et al. (2002)</xref> confirmed the critical role of the outer vestibular Asp1539 of Domain IV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) for the interaction of C11 of STX with Na<sub>V</sub>1.4. A more recent study revisited the possibility of an interaction of TTX with the same residue of Domain IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choudhary et al., 2003</xref>). The study showed that the hydroxyl group at C11 of TTX probably interacts through hydrogen bonding with the outer vestibular Asp residue of Domain IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choudhary et al., 2003</xref>). According to this model, the guanidinium group of TTX would interact with the selectivity filter, and the toxin would be docked tilted across the outer vestibule stabilized by hydrogen bonds between C10 and Glu403 of Domain I, and C11 with Asp1539 of Domain IV. When comparing the pore residues of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1&#x02013;Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 with mammalian TTX-sensitive (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4) and TTX-insensitive (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9) Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), although many identical amino acids as well as equivalent substitutions can be identified, in particular the residues involved in channel selectivity (SF in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and toxin binding, all outer ring residues critical for TTX and STX binding to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> are replaced by either neutral, hydrophobic, or positively charged amino acids in T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. This could form the basis for the reduced apparent affinity of STX for native and cloned T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. However, this scheme would be difficult to reconcile with the lack of effect of TTX on native and two of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3 channels since binding of TTX to the selectivity filter residues Glu and Asp would be expected to alter ion permeation, which was not observed, as both native and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2-mediated T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels were unaffected by TTX in the absence of Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The fact that TTX blocks Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 but not Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 is difficult to explain on the basis of the primary amino acid sequence forming the pores as they are nearly identical with the exception perhaps of a neutral Gln (identified in black in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) replacing the positively charged Arg at &#x02212;5&#x02032; position from the selectivity filter of Domain IV. Interestingly, this Gln residue is also present in the TTX-insensitive mammalian Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9). Clearly a thorough mutational analysis will be necessary to determine the possible contribution of His191 between S3 and S4 of Domain I and that of P-loop residues of all domains in the binding of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel toxins to T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary Properties of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Channels</title><p>Voltage-dependent Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels have been hypothesized to have evolved from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hille, 2001</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by comparing the sequences of cloned Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels and their respective functional properties. Our data further extend this hypothesis by providing evidence that Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel toxins also interact with native cardiac and cloned T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. A link between the structure of the pore and the gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 has recently been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Talavera et al., 2003</xref>). Divalent cations compete with TTX and STX for common binding sites along the inner pore of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 1993</xref>), which is similar to the rightward shift by TTX of the dose&#x02013;response relationship of the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-induced block of native I<sub>CaT</sub> and the attenuated block by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 expressed in HEK-293 cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geffeney et al.

For these particular Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, all of the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; residues in Domains I, II, and III involved in the TTX sensitivity of mammalian Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels were identical to those of highly TTX-sensitive Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (e.g., Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and were thus excluded to explain their TTX insensitivity. Analysis of four different populations of snake identified two major residues in the P-loop of Domain IV, Asn for Asp at position &#x0002b;3&#x02032;, and Val for Iso at position &#x02212;4&#x02032;, from the selectivity filter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geffeney et al.

Curiously, these two identical substitutions are also found in the three T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments of these two sites and adjacent sites (e.g., Gln at &#x02212;5&#x02032; position of the selectivity filter in Domain IV of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3) combined with structural modeling of the pore should enable us to determine if they reflect pure coincidences or whether they bear any evolutionary foundation pointing toward an ancestral TTX-insensitive voltage-gated cation channel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200709883_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200709883_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. A.
