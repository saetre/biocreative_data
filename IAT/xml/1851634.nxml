The positive-sense RNA genomes of flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile virus) for example show strict conservation of the adenosine. We set out to produce GpppA- and <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA-capped RNA oligonucleotides for non-radioactive mRNA cap methyltransferase assays and, in perspective, for studies of enzyme specificity in relation to substrate length as well as for co-crystallization studies. This study reports the use of a bacteriophage T7 DNA primase fragment to synthesize GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9) in a one-step enzymatic reaction, followed by direct on-line cleaning HPLC purification. Optimization studies show that yields could be modulated by DNA template, enzyme and substrate concentration adjustments and longer reaction times.

The capped RNA oligonucleotides were efficient substrates of Dengue virus (nucleoside-2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-)-methyltransferase, and human (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase. Methyltransfer reactions were monitored by a non-radioactive, quantitative HPLC assay. Additionally, the produced capped RNAs may serve in biochemical, inhibition and structural studies involving a variety of eukaryotic and viral methyltransferases and guanylyltransferases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The cap is a unique structure at the 5&#x02032;-end of viral and cellular eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is critical for both mRNA stability and binding to the ribosome during translation. Cap 0 (<sup>7Me</sup>G<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-ppp<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-N) formation is a co-transcriptional modification resulting from three enzymatic activities: RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (AdoMet) dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7MTase). Further methylation at the 2&#x02032;O position of the ribose of the first nucleotide by an AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-2&#x02032;-O-)-methyltransferase (2&#x02032;OMTase) leads to a cap 1 structure (<sup>7Me</sup>G<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-ppp<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-N<sub>2&#x02032;OMe</sub>). Capped RNA molecules are required as substrates for the biochemical characterization of mRNA cap MTases, as well as structural studies on guanylyltransferases and MTases complexed with products or substrates, and they are not commercially available.</p><p>The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of flaviviruses is decorated with a cap 1 structure. The genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> contains at least 70 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), among them emerging human pathogens such as Dengue, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), all of which bear a <sup>7Me</sup>G<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-ppp<sup>5&#x02032;</sup>-A<sub>2&#x02032;OMe</sub> cap structure with a strictly conserved adenosine as first nucleotide. We set out to produce <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppA-capped (i.e. GpppA- or <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA-) RNA molecules to aid our studies on the capping machinery of flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>In order to get GpppA-capped RNAs, several approaches can be taken that differ widely in their efficiency. They can be synthesized chemically starting from mono- or diphosphate RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA cap can also be added to di- or triphosphate RNA using vaccinia virus capping enzyme that contains RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and N7MTase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, diphosphate and triphosphate RNAs are not commercially available. <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppA can be incorporated upon <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription by bacteriophage T7, T3 or SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DdRp) (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)) using their respective promoters and an adenosine in position +1 or +2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The efficiency of these reactions is rather low because these promoters require a guanine as starting nucleotide. Very recently, an alternative, the bacteriophage T7 class II &#x003d5;2.5 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) which requires an adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide, was successfully applied to generate GpppA-capped transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppA was reported to be incorporated upon <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription by <italic>E. coli</italic> DdRp using the bacteriophage &#x003bb; PL promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), a method that has not been exploited since. Finally, very short capped oligonucleotides <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppACC were produced efficiently using bacteriophage T7 DNA primase-helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the adaptation of the latter approach to prepare large amounts of capped RNA oligonucleotides <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> with a range of chain lengths (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7). Instead of the full-length bacteriophage T7 DNA primase-helicase, we used a recombinant N-terminal fragment of 30&#x02009;kD bearing the primase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The use of the fragment offers several advantages regarding enzyme production and purification compared to the full-length protein namely a 10 to 20 times higher relative expression yield, higher solubility and the fact that it does not co-purify with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The DNA primase fragment was reported to show similar activity to the full-length protein when using high DNA template concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Nevertheless, production of short-capped RNA oligonucleotides <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>2</sub> that has been shown for full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), has never been demonstrated for the DNA primase fragment. In this work, we synthesized <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>2</sub> and GpppAC<sub>2</sub> as well as longer products using the DNA primase fragment. After undertaking optimization studies, we designed a robust and effective method to produce high amounts of pure <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7). Given the lack of commercial availability of capped RNA oligonucleotides we expect this method to be useful for many researchers working in the still emerging field of characterization of viral and mammalian RNA capping machineries. In addition, we demonstrate that the produced GpppA-capped RNAs are substrates of Dengue virus 2&#x02032;OMTase and human mRNA cap N7MTase. Both methyltransferase reactions were monitored by a non-radioactive, quantitative assay based on HPLC and the reaction products were characterized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec><title>T7 DNA primase fragment</title><p>The T7 DNA primase expression vector pET19b/PrD was kindly provided by Charles C.

Product formation was analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography on a HPLC system. An &#x02018;on-line cleaning&#x02019; process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) was used to remove unwanted proteic material from the sample. This technique allowed direct analysis of crude enzymatic reaction mixtures, with no significant loss of material. The sample was loaded onto the pre-column, thus eliminating proteic material while retaining the oligonucleotide mixture. After 5&#x02009;min, the flow path was inverted and the substrates and produced capped RNAs were delivered onto the separating column by starting an acetonitrile gradient. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the profiles after 6&#x02009;h of primase reaction. Single peak material was purified and the molecular masses determined by mass spectrometry (see Material and Methods).

The long DNA template size which was chosen albeit the primase fragment works equally on short templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), allowed its easy separation from the reaction products because of its longer retention time (38.3&#x02009;min). </p><p>Subsequently, we followed product formation over time in order to reach optimal substrate conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows the overall yield when GpppA or <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA were used as cap analogs.

GpppAC<sub>2</sub> was equally only present during the early phase of the reaction but to very low extent. After 1&#x02009;h, GpppAC<sub>3</sub> was the main product and remained so throughout the reaction. GpppAC<sub>4</sub> appeared almost immediately and its yield grew linearly, whereas GpppAC<sub>5</sub> appeared after 15&#x02009;h. Thus leaving the reaction longer opens the possibility to produce higher amounts of longer substrates (see below). The product profiles were similar when <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA was used as cap analog (not shown). </p><p>Higher accumulation of AC than of AC<sub>2</sub> products has been observed repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Recently, it was proposed that the accumulation of the abortive AC product results from a change in conformation, namely in the relative position of the Zn-binding and RNA polymerase domains, occurring after the synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond so that the AC product is released more readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Once the elongation-mode conformation is in place, longer products are formed. As it has been described before for non-capped RNA oligonucleotide synthesis by T7 DNA primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the primase added extra non-templated cytidines and thus produced <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<sub>4</sub> and <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<sub>5</sub>. This phenomenon might be due to either the ability of the primase to mis-incorporate CMP opposite cytidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), the addition of a non-templated overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) or pseudo-templated transcription where the primase reiteratively transcribes a small homopolymeric template stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Variation of DNA template, CTP, cap analog and enzyme concentration</title><p>The initially used conditions for the production of capped RNA oligonucleotides were 5&#x02009;mM CTP, 1&#x02009;mM cap analog, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M DNA template CCCC<underline>GGGT</underline>CT<sub>25</sub> (named dAC3) and 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M T7 DNA primase. Routinely, we obtained overall conversions of 81&#x02013;96% after 21&#x02009;h. In view of the possibility to obtain a higher percentage of longer products maintaining overall yields approaching 100%, the influence of DNA template, CTP, cap analog and enzyme concentration was studied.</p><p>The DNA template concentration was varied between 5 and 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. CTP and cap analog concentrations were not varied in total independence because a higher proportion of CTP than cap analog will always be incorporated into the products. The ratio GpppA to cytidine in product GpppAC<sub>5</sub> for instance is 5 to 1. We kept this ratio as a minimum and increased CTP and GpppA concentration together from the starting values 5 and 1&#x02009;mM to 20 and 4&#x02009;mM, respectively. Furthermore, we kept the cap analog concentration at 1&#x02009;mM raising only the CTP concentration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the results of optimization using cap analog GpppA, which were similar for <sup>7Me</sup>GpppA reactions (not shown). Note that there is a difference in substrate conversion (81.2% versus 90.4%) between two identical reactions (0.01&#x02009;mM DNA template and 5&#x02009;mM CTP/1&#x02009;mM GpppA, respectively), which reflect the variations we obtained between independent reaction series. Nevertheless product distribution was always very similar. </p><p>The increase in DNA template concentration up to 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M led to an increase in overall yield and product length. Thus 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M DNA template seems to be the concentration of choice. On the other hand, it has to be considered that template usage is much more efficient when lower concentrations are used. At 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M DNA template concentration, <italic>ca</italic>. 20&#x02009;pmol RNA oligonucleotide are produced from one pmol DNA template, i.e. the template is recycled 20 times supposing that all T7 DNA primase molecules are active. This can be calculated from the amount of total product generated (249.1 pmol per pmol primase) and the amount of DNA of template used in the reaction (12.5&#x02009;pmol per pmol primase). When 5 and 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M DNA template is used, initiation happens 126 and 80 times, respectively, at each template molecule.</p><p>Increasing CTP and cap analog concentration at the same time maintaining a ratio of 5 to 1 resulted in a decrease in total yield and product length, thus both the initiation and elongation part of the primase reaction seem to be affected drastically. When we increased the CTP concentration alone, inhibition was stronger regarding product formation in absolute terms (pmol product per pmol enzyme) whereas product distribution essentially stayed the same. Inhibition by CTP may be explained by the formation of a dead-end complex by non-productive binding between the enzyme and CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) that prevents productive binding of the cap analog. Activity seems to be partially rescued by higher concentrations of cap analog. However, higher cap analog concentrations result in lower overall substrate conversion.

Nevertheless, the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction decreases from 867.5&#x02009;pmol per pmol enzyme at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M to 125.0&#x02009;pmol per pmol enzyme at 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;M enzyme concentration (lower panel).

In accordance with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, almost identical results were obtained with GpppA as cap analog (not shown). Highest yields (100 and 96.1%, respectively) were obtained when DNA templates dAC2 and dAC3 were used. The main products after 21&#x02009;h corresponded to <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>2</sub> (75.2%) and <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>3</sub> (72.1%), respectively. As observed before, considerable amount of (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;1) products (21.2 and 23.6%, respectively) and small amounts of (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;2) products (3.6% and 4.2%, respectively) were formed. With DNA templates dAC4 and dAC5, the overall yield of the reactions were lower (78.1 and 55.7%, respectively). Yields could be increased to a certain limit (93.4 and 70.6%, respectively) by extending the reaction time to 48&#x02009;h. When dAC4 was used, the main product after 21&#x02009;h was <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>4</sub> (44.7%) but the (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;1) product <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>5</sub> after 48&#x02009;h (50.5%).

Allowing the reaction using dAC5 to proceed further to 71&#x02009;h led to a negligible increase in overall product yield and chain length. In conclusion, an adequate DNA template and reaction time of up to 48&#x02009;h can be chosen to produce a desired spectrum of <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9).

Additionally, CTP was added to replenish free CTP thus trying to allow synthesis of longer products but to avoid inhibition by high CTP concentrations (see above). The addition of enzyme alone increased the overall yield of the reaction and product chain length only to a limited extend (76.3% substrate conversion versus 73.7% without addition of enzyme). When enzyme and CTP were added at the same time (the resulting CTP concentration was adjusted to 2&#x02009;mM supposing that CTP had been consumed completely), the overall yield decreased to 68.0% substrate conversion but the product chain length was shifted to longer products. After 71&#x02009;h, <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>8</sub> represented 18% of total product instead of 8.2% without addition of enzyme and CTP. When the amount of added CTP was further increased (adjusted to 5&#x02009;mM concentration), the reaction yield decreased further without increasing the product length in comparison to 2&#x02009;mM. Therefore if longer products are desired, the addition of enzyme and CTP up to 2&#x02009;mM is beneficial.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> on a preparative scale</title><p>Large-scale reactions (200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l reaction volume) were set up using the optimized conditions described above, but trying to use reasonable concentrations of enzyme and HPLC grade DNA template (4 and 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, respectively). Globally, no significant differences in activity and product distribution were observed between small (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) and large (200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) scale reactions (not shown).

The reaction times were chosen to ensure the best conversion rate of the starting material while avoiding excessive distribution of the products, especially for the shorter capped RNAs.

Slightly lower yields were obtained for the dAC2 reactions. As expected the global dispersion of the products for the dAC4 series was the widest with the advantage that this reaction afforded reasonable amounts of <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC and <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<sub>4</sub> to <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<sub>7</sub> to be produced.

The HPLC analysis of the reaction products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lower chromatogram) in comparison to a control reaction using <sup>7Me</sup>GpppAC<sub>3</sub> (upper chromatogram) shows that GpppAC<sub>3</sub> is indeed efficiently methylated at the guanine-N7 position. Note that in this case, a positive charge is generated upon methylation leading to a shorter elution time of the product (29.3&#x02009;min) in comparison to the non-methylated substrate (30.7&#x02009;min). Thus both methyltransfer reactions were readily detectable by our HPLC separation method. They can be easily analyzed in a quantitative way in terms of picomoles methyl group transferred by one picomole enzyme. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We were able to produce and purify a series of GpppA-capped RNA oligonucleotides of different length, <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9), in a simple one-step enzymatic reaction using a recombinant bacteriophage T7 DNA primase fragment. Our yields (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) correspond well to the yield of 75% substrate conversion obtained upon production of <sup>7Me</sup>GpppACC using the full-length T7 DNA primase-helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In our study, we went further in optimizing the production of longer molecules using just the T7 DNA primase fragment. The isolated yields of products <sup>(7Me)</sup>GpppAC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7) obtained after large-scale synthesis and purification, in average 99% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), are superior or comparable to other methods, the additional advantage of the method presented here being the simplicity at least for biochemical laboratories with protein expression facilities. Moreover, this method allows the production of highly purified and easily quantified capped RNAs of different lengths for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) non-radioactive activity assays, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) studies of methyltransferase specificity in relation to substrate length and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) co-crystallization studies of a variety of eukaryotic and viral methyltransferases and guanylyltransferases.</p><p>We showed that our purified capped RNA oligonucleotides serve as substrate of a mRNA cap N7MTase and a 2&#x02032;OMTases of human origin and Dengue virus, respectively. Both methyltransfer reactions were monitored by a non-radioactive, quantitative HPLC assay.</p><p>In addition, our optimized method allows also the production of di- or triphosphate RNA oligonucleotides (using ATP or ADP instead of GpppA), which are valuable tools for the biochemical and structural studies of RNA triphosphatases and guanylyltransferases. Besides, preliminary tests have shown that the production of GpppACUC<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and possibly other RNA oligonucleotides varying at positions 3 and further are attainable (not shown).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank Charles C.
