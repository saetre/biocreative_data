TDM mediates these potent inflammatory responses via interactions with macrophages both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent manner via phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), implying involvement of toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, specific TLRs or binding receptors for TDM have yet to be identified. Herein, we demonstrate that the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), a class A scavenger receptor, is utilized preferentially to &#x0201c;tether&#x0201d; TDM to the macrophage and to activate the TLR2 signaling pathway. TDM-induced signaling, as measured by a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B)-luciferase reporter assay, required MARCO in addition to TLR2 and CD14. MARCO was used preferentially over the highly homologous scavenger receptor class A (SRA), which required TLR2 and TLR4, as well as their respective accessory molecules, in order for a slight increase in NF-&#x003ba;B signaling to occur. Consistent with these observations, macrophages from MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>SRA<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are defective in activation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to TDM. These results show that MARCO-expressing macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to TDM by cooperation between MARCO and TLR2/CD14, whereas other macrophage subtypes (e.g. bone marrow&#x02013;derived) may rely somewhat less effectively on SRA, TLR2/CD14, and TLR4/MD2. Macrophages from MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also produce markedly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection with virulent Mtb. These observations identify the scavenger receptors as essential binding receptors for TDM, explain the differential response to TDM of various macrophage populations, which differ in their expression of the scavenger receptors, and identify MARCO as a novel component required for TLR signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The causative agent of tuberculosis, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, has a lipid-rich cell wall that contains a high percentage of mycolic acids. These mycolic acids contribute to both the impermeable nature of the cell wall and to the immunostimulatory properties of the bacterium. Indeed, it has been known for over 50 years that trehalose 6,6&#x02032;-dimycolate (TDM/cord factor) is the major immunogenic lipid of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which induces potent pro-inflammatory responses from macrophages, although the receptor has not been identified. We have demonstrated that the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to TDM; however, the TLRs alone, or in conjunction with known co-receptors, are not sufficient to induce a response. We demonstrate that the macrophage receptor MARCO, a scavenger receptor, is utilized preferentially to &#x0201c;tether&#x0201d; TDM to the macrophage and activate the TLR2 signaling pathway, and is used preferentially over the related SRA. Macrophages from MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are defective in activation of TDM-induced signaling and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to both TDM-coated beads and virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. By identifying the macrophage receptors involved in initial recognition we can now explain variable responses to TDM between different macrophage populations (which differ in scavenger receptor expression), and have identified a novel co-receptor that may be involved in lipid presentation to TLRs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), a causative agent of human tuberculosis, is responsible for 8 million new infections and 2 million deaths yearly.

This is mainly due to the robust granulomatous response that is initiated by the bacterium, which effectively contains the infection and allows the host to exist in equilibrium with a subclinical infection. The granulomatous response has been shown to be triggered by multiple components of the mycobacterial cell wall, such as phosphatidylinositol dimannoside, phosphatidylinositol hexamannoside, and trehalose 6,6&#x02032;-dimycolate (TDM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Bekierkunst1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Yamagami1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The chemical structure of TDM (also known as cord factor) was solved in 1956 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Noll1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and was identified as the predominant immunogenic mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Bekierkunst2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

These observations, as well as the finding that the stimulatory activity of TDM requires presentation over a larger surface area, such as emulsions, monolayers, or large diameter particles, suggests that the TDM-receptor interaction is of low avidity and requires the aid of co-receptors or other accessory molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Geisel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Retzinger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One class of receptors implicated in TDM recognition is the TLRs.

Although SRA and MARCO have many common ligands, our results show that MARCO binds more TDM-coated beads than either isoform of SRA. MARCO is required for TDM-induced signaling via TLR2 and CD14 in a transfection system, whereas SRAI and SRAII require co-transfection of TLRs 2 and 4, and their accessory molecules, to permit even a minor response to TDM stimulation. Consistent with these data, both resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM&#x003c6;) and BMM&#x003c6; from TLR2/4 double-deficient mice (but not the individual mutants) have a markedly reduced response to TDM. This suggests that TDM engages TLR2 and TLR4 in a redundant fashion and that these predominantly MyD88-dependent pathways are required for the stimulatory effects of TDM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000474-Geisel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

These macrophages also produce fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, indicating that SR-mediated detection of TDM may be an important component of the response to infection.

In order to test whether MARCO might be signaling directly, we created mutants that lacked the cytoplasmic domain, and thus any putative signaling motifs, of MARCO. The cytoplasmic region of MARCO has not been experimentally demonstrated to have any residues that are essential for cell signaling and indeed, apart from the putative myristoylation site at residues 41&#x02013;46, does not contain any potential signaling motifs identifiable by scanning various protein motif databases (D.M.E.Bowdish, unpublished results). After confirming that these constructs were expressed on the surface of transfected CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells, we determined that they could indeed bind to TDM-coated beads and were in fact able to reconstitute TDM-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000474-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Our receptor-ligand interaction assay results, however, show that MARCO alone is not sufficient for TDM binding, and that other receptors present on the surface of RPM&#x003c6; must cooperate with MARCO for effective binding to occur (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000474.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000474.s002">Text S1</xref>).

These observations may explain why some macrophage populations respond more strongly than others to TDM and thus will provide novel insight into the role of the scavenger receptors in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6, SRA<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, MARCO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> SRA<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (DKO), CD14<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ and 129sv/ev mice were bred and housed at the University of Oxford, Cornell University, or University of Georgia.
