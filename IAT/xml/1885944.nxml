Mutations in mice and humans that affect neuronal migration result in abnormal lamination of brain structures with associated behavioral deficits. Here, we report the identification of a hyperactive N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mouse mutant with abnormalities in the laminar architecture of the hippocampus and cortex, accompanied by impaired neuronal migration. We show that the causative mutation lies in the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding pocket of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin (<italic>Tuba1</italic>) and affects tubulin heterodimer formation. Phenotypic similarity with existing mouse models of lissencephaly led us to screen a cohort of patients with developmental brain anomalies. We identified two patients with de novo mutations in <italic>TUBA3</italic>, the human homolog of <italic>Tuba1</italic>. This study demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in the mouse as a means to discover the basis of human neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of the mammalian brain depends on extensive neuronal migration resulting in the formation of a number of highly laminar structures, most notably the cortex and hippocampus. This process involves a large number of neurons that originate in the proliferative ventricular zones and migrate radially to their final locations past previously formed neurons (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Genetic studies in mice and humans have identified some of the molecular determinants of neuronal migration: mutations in doublecortin (<italic>DCX</italic>) (<xref rid="bib11 bib16" ref-type="bibr">des Portes et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Gleeson et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>LIS1</italic> (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reiner et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>) have been shown to impair migration and cause type 1 lissencephaly in humans, a disease characterized by a four-layered cortex with an absence or diminution of gyri and sulci (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dobyns and Truwit, 1995</xref>). In females, mutations in <italic>DCX</italic> can also cause subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH), in which an additional layer of misplaced heterotopic neurons is found in the white matter. Perturbations of the laminar architecture of the cortex also result from mutations in the very low density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>VLDLR)</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boycott et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) and the extracellular matrix protein <italic>Reelin</italic> (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hong et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Together, mutations in&#x000a0;<italic>DCX</italic>, <italic>LIS1</italic>, <italic>VLDLR</italic>, and <italic>reelin</italic> are responsible for &#x0223c;70% of the cases of type 1 lissencephaly. The pathogenic mutations responsible for the remaining cases are unknown (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Leventer, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Impaired neuronal migration affects behavior as well as brain structure. Humans with lissencephaly are mentally retarded and frequently suffer from epilepsy (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Francis et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>reeler</italic> mouse mutant and mice with loss of function mutations in <italic>Dcx</italic> and <italic>Lis1</italic> exhibit varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction (<xref rid="bib8 bib29 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Corbo et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Paylor et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Qiu et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Mice with mutations that cause behavioral abnormalities are currently being identified as part of a large-scale mutagenesis screen in the UK (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nolan et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). In this dominant screen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is injected into the peritoneum of BALB/cAnN male mice and causes random mutations in spermatogonia. Mutagenized males are mated with C3H/HeH females and their offspring assessed for variation in locomotor activity. Here we describe a hyperactive ENU-induced mouse mutant with cortical and hippocampal abnormalities due to impaired neuronal migration. We show that mutations in the human homolog of this gene cause cortical brain malformations, including lissencephaly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Identification and Mapping of a Novel Behavioral Mutant</title><p>We screened 9216 mice from the Harwell ENU mutagenesis program. The total distance each mouse travelled in 35 min was assessed. Mice with levels of activity more than three standard deviations outside the mean were retested 7 days later (n &#x0003d; 87) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). We excluded mice with abnormal vestibular, skeletal, or neuromuscular phenotypes that might also influence locomotor behavior. Ten outliers were subject to heritability testing by backcrossing to C3H/HeH. A single line that we named Jenna (Jna) was identified with a semidominant hyperactive phenotype.</p><p>We mapped variation in locomotor activity to the distal end of chromosome 15 by treating the phenotype quantitatively and applying standard methods for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Zeng, 1994</xref>). To generate sufficient animals to map the mutation, we employed in vitro fertilization, raising a total of 89 animals on a C3H/HeH background. We attempted to intercross hyperactive animals but failed to generate any pregnancies.</p><p>We identified a QTL on chromosome 15 with a logP (negative logarithm of the P value, base 10) of 12.6. This was the only locus that exceeded the genome-wide 5% significance threshold of logP 4.1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Churchill and Doerge, 1994</xref>). No other loci were detected with a logP greater than 2.0. The presence of a relatively large QTL segregating on chromosome 15 suggested that we had mapped the causative mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B), but we could not exclude the possibility that the genetic effect arose from a naturally occurring polymorphism between BALB/cAnN and C3H/HeH.</p><p>We reasoned that the presence of pleiotropy would distinguish the effect of the ENU-induced mutation from a naturally occurring polymorphism. Unlike the latter, engineered and induced mutations with an effect on behavior frequently display additional phenotypic abnormalities. We found that mice from the mapping population could be divided into two groups by variation in weight and activity, the smaller mice exhibiting higher levels of activity&#x000a0;(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). We then fine-mapped the mutation to&#x000a0;a 1.3&#x000a0;Mb region between <italic>D15Mit43</italic> and a single nucleotide polymorphism <italic>rs32344030</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). This region contains 41 annotated genes (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>).</p><p>The coding and exon-flanking sequences of all 41 genes was sequenced in affected animals (n &#x0003d; 4), a wild-type control, and the two mapping strains, C3H/HeH and BALB/cAnN. All the variants identified were present in the two mapping strains, except for a T to C transition in exon 4 of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin (<italic>Tuba1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). We sequenced exon 4 of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin from the inbred strains AKR/J, A/J, C57BL6/J, RIII, DBA/2J, IS, FVB, and 129 and did not observe this polymorphism.We extracted whole brain mRNA from <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> animals, sequenced the cDNA, and confirmed the presence of the mutation in the brain <italic>Tuba1</italic> transcript. The mutation causes an amino acid change from serine to glycine at residue 140 (S140G). This amino acid is located in the T4 loop of Tuba1, forming part of the N-site, a highly conserved glycine-rich motif that binds GTP (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) (Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). GTP bound at the N site does not undergo hydrolysis and is thought to act as a structural cofactor stabilizing the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Spiegelman et&#x000a0;al., 1977</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>The S140G Mutation Reduces GTP Binding and&#x000a0;Native Heterodimer Formation</title><p>We hypothesized that the S140G mutation might affect the ability of Tuba1 to bind GTP at the N site. We therefore conducted in vitro folding assays containing &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P-GTP. Equal amounts of urea-unfolded wild-type or mutant Tuba1 probes, quantitated by Coomassie blue staining, were introduced by sudden dilution into a buffer containing ATP, radio-labeled GTP, and cytosolic chaperonin (CCT). CCT is the first chaperone required in a cascade of interacting proteins that act in concert to facilitate the formation of native tubulin heterodimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). CCT undergoes multiple rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with unfolded &#x003b1;-tubulin polypeptides, forming chaperonin bound quasi-native tubulin folding intermediates that contain a GTP binding pocket (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tian et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>We found that the S140G mutation decreased the ability of CCT bound quasi-native &#x003b1;-tubulin folding intermediates to incorporate GTP by approximately 5-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). We then assessed what effect this would have on native tubulin heterodimer formation. To do this, we repeated the assay, including the additional components required for de novo heterodimer formation. We found that the yield of labeled heterodimers was significantly less in reactions carried out with the mutant protein compared to the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C).</p><p>To show that the reduced incorporation of GTP in mutant heterodimers is reflected in a reduced yield of native dimerized protein, we repeated our in vitro folding experiments using mutant and wild-type unfolded <sup>35</sup>S-methionine labeled Tuba1 probes. Consistent with the data obtained in our GTP labeling experiments, we found that the S140G mutation reduced the efficiency of de novo heterodimer formation under conditions where equal amounts of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled protein were analyzed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). These data are not artifacts of in vitro reconstitution, because we observed the same reduced yield of tubulin heterodimers in parallel experiments in which the identical cloned sequences used for the generation of probes for in&#x000a0;vitro folding experiments were translated in a cell free system from rabbit reticulocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and 2F). We then investigated whether the heterodimers produced in these in vitro experiments were able to polymerize. The products of the reactions shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D were mixed with depolymerized brain microtubules and taken through two successive cycles of polymerization/depolymerization. At the end of each cycle, an aliquot of the depolymerized material was removed and analyzed. While heterodimer formation was reduced in all our assays carried out with the S140G mutant, the ability of mutant heterodimers to cocycle with native tubulin in vitro was not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>G).</p><p>Consistent with these data we found that a FLAG-tagged mutant Tuba1 incorporated into the normal interphase microtubule network upon overexperession in cultured cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>H) and that these microtubules behaved in the same manner as their wild-type counterparts in a regrowth assay following depolymerization with nocodazole (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). These experiments demonstrate the ability of the S140G tubulin, once folded, to assemble into heterodimers that can copolymerize into dynamic microtubules in vivo. We conclude that the S140G mutation results in a diminished efficiency of polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimer formation as a result of a compromised GTP binding pocket. Our data indicate that the S140G substitution is a partial loss-of-function mutation, suggesting that the phenotype in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice is due to haploinsufficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Genetic Rescue of the Hyperactive Phenotype in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> Mice</title><p>We tested whether delivery of additional copies of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin by BAC transgenesis would rescue the phenotype in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice. We selected a BAC clone (RP23-3124H4) that contained the <italic>Tuba1</italic> gene for this experiment. Purified BAC DNA was injected into the pronucleus of C3H/HeH embryos, and these embryos transferred into recipient females. Four transgenic lines were identified that carried the BAC (H2, H8, H17, and H41). We established germline transmission in two of these (H8 and H41). Quantitative PCR analysis of the transgene indicated that four copies of the clone had been incorporated into the H41 line and a single copy into the H8 line (data not shown). Behavioral analysis of the H41 line revealed no significant differences in measures of activity with control animals (F[1,16] &#x0003c; 1; P &#x0003e; 0.5), demonstrating that delivery of additional copies of <italic>Tuba1</italic>, by itself, has no effect on locomotor behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A). The H41 line was selected for rescue and was crossed with <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice. There was&#x000a0;a significant reduction in the locomotor behavior of transgenic animals with the S140G mutation (<italic>Jna</italic>/&#x0002b;/BAC) in comparison to nontransgenic mutants (F[1,14] &#x0003d; 18.7; P&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.005) and no significant difference from controls (F[1,16] &#x0003d; 1.2; P &#x0003e; 0.1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>The S140G Mutation Results in Abnormal Hippocampal and Cortical Morphology in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> Mice</title><p>We undertook a complete histological examination of <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice (n &#x0003d; 4). Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed no gross anatomical defects in somatic organs or tissues (data not shown). We focused on the neuroanatomical features of the <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice. Brains from <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice were smaller than wild-type (&#x0223c;85%), but this is probably because mutant animals weigh &#x0223c;30% less than littermate controls. Examination of coronal sections of <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice (n &#x0003d; 6), littermate controls (n &#x0003d; 6), and rescued brains (n&#x000a0;&#x0003d; 6) from animals aged 8 weeks revealed abnormal lamination of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of mutant animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A&#x02013;3I). Staining with cresyl violet and with the neuronal marker NeuN showed hippocampal disorganization with an additional layer of pyramidal cells in the stratum oriens that extended throughout the pyramidal cell subfields into the subiculum, which was most marked in the CA3 region where the neurons were loosely packed. The abnormality was also apparent in mutant animals aged 8 months (n &#x0003d; 3) (data not shown). Staining with calbindin revealed fewer calbindin-positive pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region and a disorganized mossy fiber tract extending from the dentate gyrus to CA3. No gross morphological abnormalities were apparent in the dentate gyrus of <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice, the hilus appearing intact. There were no detectable abnormalities in the hippocampal morphology of <italic>Jna</italic>/&#x0002b;/BAC mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C, 3F, and 3I).</p><p>We looked for laminar abnormalities in the cortex, staining with antisera for NeuN, Cux-1 (a layer II/III/IV marker), calbindin (a layer II/III and V marker), Er81 (a layer V marker), FOXP2 (a layer VI marker) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> J-X), Brn-1 (expressed predominantly in late cortical plate neurons, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>), and cresyl violet (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). These experiments showed that the laminar cytoarchitecture of the cortex was intact in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice, but closer examination of NeuN, Cux-1, and Nissl stains revealed wave-like perturbations in layer IV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>, Y-ZA and ZB-ZD; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). While layer IV still consisted of the characteristic granular cells that were of similar size and shape to those observed in littermate controls, they were organized into three to four cellular fronts, each containing a single row of cells. This perturbation was evident in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices but was not observed in the motor or retrosplenial cortices (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). It was observed primarily in layer IV but extended into layers II/III in the posterior and dorsal medial regions of the cortex as revealed by Cux-1 staining. <italic>Jna</italic>/&#x0002b;/BAC mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice for all stains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>, L, O, R, U, and X). Analysis of Golgi- stained sections revealed no significant differences in the percentage of misorientated (&#x003b8; &#x0003e; 8&#x000b0;) or inverted (&#x003b8; &#x0003e; 90&#x000b0;) apical dendrites in the visual, somatosensory, or motor cortices between littermate controls (n &#x0003d; 3) and <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice (n &#x0003d; 3) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Demyanenko et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>).

We injected pregnant females with BrdU at three time points (E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5) and counted labeled cells at the day of birth (P0), dividing the cortex into ten equal bins extending from the intermediate zone to the cortical surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A&#x02013;4C). We tested for an interaction between genotype and the mean percentage of cells in each bin.

At these time points, a higher percentage of BrdU-positive cells are observed in bins 1, 2, and 3 in wild-type littermates. These results are consistent with our anatomical observations that showed perturbations in layers II/III and IV of the cortex, as the majority of cells that populate these layers are born between E14.5 and E16.5 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Examination of hippocampal sections following injection of BrdU at E14.5, a time at which most pyramidal neurons are born (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Angevine, 1965</xref>), revealed disorganization in Ammon's horn affecting both CA1 and CA3 regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and 4E).

The causative mutation, a C to T substitution, mutates a highly conserved arginine residue to a histidine (R402H) at the beginning of the H11-H12 loop near the interface of <italic>TUBA3</italic> with &#x003b2;-tubulin (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, 6I, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C).

The mutation, a G to A substitution, mutates an arginine to cysteine (R264C) located at the surface of &#x003b1;-tubulin in a loop between H8 and S7, again in a highly conserved region of the protein (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, 6J, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D).

We found no coding sequence variants in the parents or controls, demonstrating their de novo occurrence and their absence in the normal population. The frequency of mutations is significantly different between cases and controls (P &#x0003d; 0.01). Screening of TUBA3 in a second cohort of patients with cortical anomalies identified a further six individuals with de novo mutations in TUBA3. Mutated residues again include R402 and R264 (unpublished data). Our results indicate that mutations in TUBA3 cause human cortical migration disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the cloning of an ENU-induced mutation that underlies abnormal hippocampal-dependent behavior in&#x000a0;the mouse. The mutation, an S140G substitution in Tuba1, impairs the ability of the protein to bind GTP and to form native heterodimers with &#x003b2;-tubulin. Heterodimers that do form are able to polymerize and are incorporated into the microtubule network of cultured cells. The mutation results in abnormal neuronal migration in vivo; perturbations in layers II/III and IV of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices; and a fractured pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Tuba1, Microtubules, and Neuronal Migration</title><p>We believe that the S140G mutation asserts its effect by interfering with microtubule function, thereby impairing neuronal migration. First, we have shown that the S140G mutation affects GTP binding and impairs tubulin heterodimer formation. Studies in yeast have shown that mutations in tubulin that influence heterodimer formation can result in microtubules with aberrant properties (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vega et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). Second, correct microtubule function is important for key processes involved in neuronal migration, including neurite extension and nucleokinesis (<xref rid="bib22 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kappeler et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Phillips et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Third, the expression of <italic>Tuba1</italic> coincides with the time of neuronal birth at E9.5 and is maintained along defined migratory pathways in the neocortex (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gloster et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Finally, we have employed BrdU in birthdating studies to demonstrate an in vivo neuronal migration deficit in <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice.</p><p>Our data are consistent with a model in which the abnormal phenotype observed in the <italic>Jna/&#x0002b;</italic> mice arises from a reduction in the total amount of functional heterodimers. A consequence of reduced heterodimers might be a reduction of incorporated S140G tubulin into microtubules, which may in turn affect polymerization dynamics. We have not observed a reduction in the incorporation of S140G tubulin in our cellular assay, although this may be the consequence of overexpression by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in an epithelial cell line. An alternative hypothesis is that an imbalance in the relative levels of expression of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin could be a contributing factor (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vega et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). A third possibility is that the S140G mutation alters the stability of microtubules. Microtubule destabilization is believed to be the mechanism whereby mutations in the <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> homolog of &#x003b1;-tubulin suppress nuclear migration mutations (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Willins et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>TUBA3 Mutations Cause Lissencephaly in Humans</title><p>Mutations in <italic>TUBA3</italic>, the human homolog of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin, are present in two patients with type 1 lissencephaly and pachygyria. Structural studies reveal that neither of these mutations (R402H and R264C) lie in the GTP binding domain of TUBA3, suggesting they do not influence GTP binding. While it is possible that these mutations affect the folding of tubulin heterodimers, they may also influence interactions with proteins that bind microtubules, particularly the R402H mutation. The R402H mutation is located in a loop of &#x003b1;-1 tubulin, that forms an interface with doublecortin (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Moores et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>C), and the kinesin KIF1A (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>D).

Newly synthesized &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin polypeptides undergo one or more rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin (CCT). Quasi-native intermediates formed as a result of this interaction are then captured and stabilized by a series of tubulin-specific chaperones termed TBCA&#x02013;TBCE. &#x003b1;-tubulin intermediates interact with TBCB and TBCE, while &#x003b2;-tubulin intermediates interact with TBCA and TBCD. TBCE&#x003b1; (E&#x003b1;) and TBCD&#x003b2; (D&#x003b2;) together form a supercomplex. Entry of TBCC into this supercomplex triggers GTP hydrolysis by &#x003b2;-tubulin; this acts as a switch for the discharge of the newly assembled &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer.
