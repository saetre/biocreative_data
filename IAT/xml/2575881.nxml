We aimed to isolate cDNA markers that would be useful for diagnosing not only vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases. For this purpose, we used stepwise subtractive hybridization and cDNA microarray analyses to comprehensively isolate the genes whose expressions are augmented in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) pooled from vasculitis patients. Subsequently, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#x02013;PCR) to examine the mRNA levels of each candidate gene in individual patients. These analyses indicated that seven genes exhibit remarkably augmented expression in many vasculitis patients. Of these genes, we analyzed G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) further because G0S2 expression is also enhanced in the PBMCs of patients with systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE). We generated G0S2 transgenic mice that ubiquitously overexpress human G0S2. Although we did not observe any obvious vasculitis-related histopathologic findings in these mice, these mice are unhealthy as they produce only few offspring and showed elevated serum levels of two autoimmunity-related antibodies, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-double strand DNA antibody. Thus, our large-scale gene profiling study may help finding sensitive and specific DNA markers for diagnosing autoimmune diseases including vasculitis and SLE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>vasculitis</kwd><kwd>angiitis</kwd><kwd>G0S2</kwd><kwd>EGR1</kwd><kwd>amphiregulin</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin delta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>There are &#x0223c;10 different disorders that are classified as vasculitis (also known as angiitis). Vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the chronic inflammation of systemic blood vessels, veins, and arteries of all types and sizes. This often causes symptoms that can rapidly induce death, such as the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), restriction of oxygenated blood supply (ischemia), and irreversible injury to affected organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C1">1</xref></sup> Although immune system disturbances appear to be the main cause of the disease, the pathogenesis of vasculitis is not fully understood. The diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis was recently greatly aided by the observation that three vasculitis disorders, namely Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg&#x02013;Strauss syndrome (CSS), are characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C3">3</xref></sup> Two different types of ANCA have been identified. C-ANCA targets proteinase-3 and is most frequently found in WG, whereas P-ANCA, which targets myeloperoxidase, is most frequently detected in MPA and CSS. Consequently, enzyme immunosorbent assays (EIA) that examine the ability of patient serum to bind to these enzymes can be used to diagnose WG, MPA, and CSS. However, diagnoses made on the basis of positive EIAs will still need to be confirmed by biopsies. Moreover, many other vasculitis disorders are not characterized by the presence of ANCAs. Thus, the diagnosis of vasculitis disorders requires the identification of more convenient and generally applicable diagnostic markers. The identification of these markers may also provide insights into the pathogenesis behind this disorder and improve the therapy of vasculitis.</p><p>We have isolated putative gene markers that are characteristic to the autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C4">4</xref></sup> and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C5">5</xref></sup>, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we sought to identify new gene markers that can distinguish the autoimmune disease, in particular vasculitis, from other diseases with high specificity when PBMCs serve as the sample. For this purpose, we used the stepwise subtraction technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C6">6</xref></sup> and high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to isolate those genes that show dramatically upregulated expression commonly in the pooled PBMC mRNAs of varieties of vasculitis patients regardless of the patient's symptom, active, or inactive phase when compared with normal volunteer PBMC mRNAs. To identify the genes that are upregulated in many vasculitis patients, we selected and mixed the PBMC mRNAs from patients with one of the following seven vasculitis disorders: WG, MPA, Takayasu's arteritis (TA), allergic granulomatous angiitis (AGA), malignant RA (MRA = rheumatoid vasculitis), giant cell arteritis (GCA), and polyarteritis nodosa (PN). We found that the following seven genes are commonly unpregulated in the PBMCs of many of these vasculitis patients regardless of their symptoms: early growth response 1 (<italic>EGR1</italic>), G0/G1 switch gene 2 (<italic>G0S2</italic>), hemoglobin delta (<italic>HBD</italic>), amphiregulin (also known as <italic>AREG</italic>), interleukin-1 receptor type II (<italic>IL1R2</italic>), <italic>calgranulin C</italic>, and a novel gene named <italic>TVAS10</italic>. Of these genes, we selected <italic>G0S2</italic> for further analysis because its physiological functions are poorly understood. We prepared anti-G0S2 antibodies and then generated G0S2 transgenic mice and examined their phenotype. We propose that the vasculitis gene markers we identified here may be useful for the future diagnosis of vasculitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Human subjects and ethical considerations</title><p>All systemic vasculitis patients used in this study were diagnosed according to a previously documented proposal (the ACR criteria and the CHCC criteria).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C1">1</xref></sup> This study was reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University.

To explore the physiological significance of G0S2, we prepared transgenic mice that overexpress the human gene for G0S2. For this purpose, we constructed plasmid DNA in which human G0S2 cDNA lies directly downstream of the beta-actin promoter, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C7">7</xref></sup> This construct was used to generate transgenic mouse lines that express human G0S2 protein in all tissues. The successful generation of these transgenic mice was confirmed by PCR and/or western blot analysis using DNA or cell extracts obtained from the tail. Expression of G0S2 protein was confirmed by the monoclonal antibody (#3-1) we prepared here (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn014/DC1">Supplementary Result and Fig. S2</ext-link>). Although the transgenic mice did not exhibit an obvious phenotype, they seemed to be unhealthy as they did not produce large numbers of offspring. This made it very difficult to establish this transgenic mouse line. For example, in the first attempt to generate this line, 61 mice were tested by PCR for expression of human G0S2. Of these, three female and three male mice were found to bear the transgene (GTG1a-f, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F2">2</xref>). However, the GTG1f female mouse died soon after birth and the GTG1e female and GTG1c male mice died 3 and 1 months after birth, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn014/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4A</ext-link>). Moreover, while the surviving female transgenic mouse (GTG1d) produced one female transgenic mouse, which safely grew to adulthood, the mother died during her next pregnancy. Her daughter also died during her first pregnancy. In addition, the surviving male mouse GTG1b only produced male transgenic mice when mated with wild-type B6 female mice because the human G0S2 gene was introduced into the Y chromosome. Thus, this mouse could not be used further. Furthermore, the remaining surviving male mouse, GTG1a, did not produce transgenic mouse when mated with wild-type B6 female mice. Thus, we failed to establish a human G0S2-expressing transgenic strain in this trial. The second trial did not generate any transgenic mice. However, in the third trial, of the 22 mice examined by PCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F6">6</xref>A) and western blot analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F6">6</xref>B), we found three transgenic mice, of which one (GTG3a) produced offspring (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn014/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4B</ext-link>). These mice appear to be healthier than the other transgenic mice and consequently we have been able to maintain this line probably due to lower G0S2 levels than other transgenic mice. Thus, the exogenous and ubiquitous overexpression of human G0S2 seems to make the transgenic mice unhealthy and inhibits their production of offspring.</p><fig id="DSN014F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Establishment of <italic>G0S2</italic> transgenic mice.

Of the eight TG mice examined, such lesions were detected in three. We also measured the serum levels of two autoimmunity-related antibodies, namely, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-dsDNA antibody.

receptor (PPAR) alpha, which belongs to a group of transcription factors that are involved in numerous processes, including lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Moreover, it was shown that <italic>G0S2</italic> is upregulated after PPAR&#x003b4; activation and that it may be involved in the PPAR&#x003b4;-mediated mitigation of cardiac fibroblast proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN014C23">23</xref></sup></p><p>We here generated G0S2-TG mice that ubiquitously overexpress G0S2 proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F6">6</xref>). We showed that these mice are unhealthy as they do not produce many offspring (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F2">2</xref>) and frequently display formations of microabscess-like panniculitis lesions in the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F7">7</xref>A). The development of these microabscess-like panniculitis lesions may reflect the dysregulation of the murine immune system in these mice. Supporting this is that some of the G0S2-TG mice had augmented levels of immunodeficiency-related anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies in their sera (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN014F7">7</xref>B), although these phenotypes are related not to vasculitis but to SLE. It should be noted, however, that these serum differences did not achieve statistical significance, largely because of the shortage of G0S2-TG mice. It will be necessary to study larger numbers of G0S2-TG mice to confirm this association between <italic>G0S2</italic> overexpression and the development of autoimmune features. Should this association be confirmed, the high-quality polyclonal and monoclonal anti-G0S2 antibodies that we produced may be useful as tools (perhaps in enzyme-linked EIA) for diagnosing not just vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>We performed this study on a highly heterogeneous cohort of patients, including those with systemic vasculitis. All of these diseases share the inflammatory involvement of blood vessels. However, their target organs, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical findings, and outcomes are quite different. Moreover, although the disease activity status in these patients was heterogeneous and some were receiving corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy, these factors were ignored in our patient recruitment protocol. Nonetheless, despite these marked heterogeneous features of our patient population, we could isolate putative common genes that are upregulated, which was our original goal. We are currently performing in parallel the expression profiling of the genes that are up- or downregulated in each individual disease and analyzing these profiles in terms of the symptoms, disease activity status, and clinical treatment of the patients. However, the results obtained from such studies are highly complex, which has hampered the identification of candidate gene markers that can be used for diagnosis.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the putative gene markers we identified here, in particular <italic>EGR1</italic> and <italic>G0S2</italic>, may be useful for diagnosing not only vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases, perhaps by qRT&#x02013;PCR and antibody-based methods. Other, as yet uncharacterized, genes that we detected as being upregulated in vasculitis may also be useful candidate gene markers and thus are worth further detailed analysis. In particular, the identification of the functions of these genes may reveal the hitherto unknown mechanism(s) that underlie the pathogenesis of vasculitis. This in turn may shed light on therapeutic avenues for treating vasculitis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn014/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was primarily supported by a grant-in-aid from the Health Science Research grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan.
