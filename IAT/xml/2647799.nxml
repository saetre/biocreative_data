In an attempt to discover cancer relevant lysosomal motor proteins, we compared the lysosomal proteomes from parental MCF-7 breast cancer cells with those from highly invasive MCF-7 cells that express an active form of the ErbB2 (&#x00394;N-ErbB2).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Mass spectrometry analysis identified kinesin heavy chain protein KIF5B as the only microtubule motor associated with the lysosomes in MCF-7 cells, and ectopic &#x00394;N-ErbB2 enhanced its lysosomal association. KIF5B associated with lysosomes also in HeLa cervix carcinoma cells as analyzed by subcellular fractionation. The depletion of KIF5B triggered peripheral aggregations of lysosomes followed by lysosomal destabilization, and cell death in HeLa cells. Lysosomal exocytosis in response to plasma membrane damage as well as fluid phase endocytosis functioned, however, normally in these cells. Both HeLa and MCF-7 cells appeared to express similar levels of the KIF5B isoform but the death phenotype was weaker in KIF5B-depleted MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, KIF5B depletion inhibited the rapamycin-induced accumulation of autophagosomes in MCF-7 cells. In KIF5B-depleted cells the autophagosomes formed and accumulated in the close proximity to the Golgi apparatus, whereas in the control cells they appeared uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data identify KIF5B as a cancer relevant lysosomal motor protein with additional functions in autophagosome formation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomes are membrane-bound dynamic organelles that represent the final destination for endocytic, secretory and autophagic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Eskelinen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The physiological importance of lysosomes is highlighted by a number of diseases resulting from defects in the lysosomal biogenesis and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Gieselmann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. On the contrary, the enhanced synthesis, trafficking and extracellular release of lysosomal proteases (cathepsins), are important hallmarks of malignancy and associate with the invasive and metastatic capacity of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Gocheva1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Jedeszko1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the lysosomal changes associated with immortalization and transformation of cancer cells also sensitize cancer cells to programmed cell death pathways involving lysosomal membrane permeabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Fehrenbacher1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Fehrenbacher2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Once triggered, lysosomal membrane permeabilization results in the release of cathepsins and other lysosomal hydrolases to the cytosol, where they can trigger the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization followed by caspase-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Roberg1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Boya1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or mediate caspase-independent programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Foghsgaard1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the inhibition of lysosomal trafficking/exocytosis appears as a promising target for cancer therapy. It would not only inhibit the cathepsin-mediated invasion but also obstruct the general trafficking and possibly result in the accumulation of lysosomes destined for secretion and therefore further sensitize cancer cells to lysosomal cell death pathways. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that vincristine, a microtubule-destabilizing anti-cancer drug, not only inhibits lysosome trafficking but also induces a rapid increase in the volume of the lysosomal compartment followed by lysosomal leakage and cathepsin-dependent cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-GrothPedersen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because drugs that disturb the microtubule network show high general toxicity, we speculated that a more specific interference with lysosome trafficking could result in anti-cancer strategies with fewer side effects. Accordingly, we wanted to identify and characterize motor proteins important for lysosome transport in cancer cells. Motor proteins utilizing the cytoskeleton as substrate for movement are divided into myosin motors that move along actin microfilaments and kinesin/dynein motors that use microtubules through the interaction with tubulin for their movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Mallik1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Motor proteins are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP and convert chemical energy into mechanical work enabling them to move cargo (vesicles, proteins and lipids) over long distances. Microtubule specific motors consist of two basic types of microtubule motors: plus-end motors and minus-end motors, depending on the direction in which they move along the filaments within the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The truncated form of the ErbB2 receptor is frequently found over-expressed in breast cancer and its expression and activity correlates with increased invasiveness, motility and poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Ross1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, the ectopic expression of &#x00394;N-ErbB2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells renders them highly mobile and invasive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Egeblad1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> (Our unpublished observation). Prompted by the finding that the &#x00394;N-ErbB2-induced invasive phenotype was associated with altered lysosomal trafficking and a several fold increase in the expression and activity of lysosomal proteases, we chose this model system to search for cancer relevant lysosomal motor proteins. We applied a quantitative proteomic analysis on purified lysosomes from &#x00394;N-ErbB2 MCF-7 and control cells showing that some motor protein levels were significantly up-regulated following &#x00394;N-ErbB2 induction. Interestingly, we found that &#x00394;N-ErbB2 increased the expression of kinesin 5B (KIF5B), a motor protein implicated in lysosomal and mitochondrial transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Nakata1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with this, KIF5B mRNA has been reported to be up-regulated in several types of cancer tissues including bladder cancer (GDS1479 record), advanced gastric cancer (GDS1210 record), squamous cell carcinoma (GDS2200 record), sporadic basal-like breast cancer and BRCA1-associated breast cancer (GDS2250 record) (Data obtained from NCBI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez</ext-link>; Gene Expression Omnibus). KIF5B is a N-kinesin (Plus-end motor) belonging to the super family of kinesin-1 molecular motor proteins that together with cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for microtubule-dependent transport of cargo in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

To examine if KIF5B is essential for lysosomal exocytosis, we applied three different methods (mechanical scratching, electroporation and ionomycin) to induce plasma membrane lesions that trigger Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx and induction of the resealing response that involves exocytosis of lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Reddy1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. A scalpel was used to scratch on a semi-confluent layer of HeLa cells to mechanically induce plasma membrane damage, and lysosomal exocytosis was immediately assayed using an antibody detecting a luminal epitope of lysosomal LAMP-1 on the cell surface. The surface fluorescence of LAMP-1 was significantly increased at the damage site indicative of lysosomal membrane resealing, and an additional co-localization and accumulation of KIF5B at the damage site was observed suggesting that KIF5B is involved in this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004424-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Since this method is not suitable for quantitative studies, we used electroporation to induce small hydrophilic pores in the plasma membrane to investigate if KIF5B was essential in the transport process of lysosomes to the damage sites.

In contrast, when cells were electroporated at 125 and 250 &#x003bc;F, LAMP-1 was detected on the surface in 11,4 and 21&#x00025; of the cells respectively.

Similarly, the ionomycin-induced lysosomal exocytosis of luminal proteases was unaffected by KIF5B depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004424-g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These data demonstrate that KIF5B is not crucial for the lysosomal exocytosis and plasma membrane resealing.

The three KIF5 subfamily members (KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C) display high similarity in the amino acid sequence and probably share functional redundancy and similar properties. However, at present it is unknown how the individual KIF5 members might contribute or co-operate in various transport mechanisms and why they differ in their expression patterns in neurons and non-neuronal cells. Density fractionation methodology from HeLa cells revealed, that KIF5B is mainly represented in light-membrane fractions containing lysosomes and to some extent in mitochondria.</p><p>MCF-7 and MCF-7-&#x00394;N-ErbB2 cells depleted for KIF5B were inhibited in their growth but displayed a less pronounced death phenotype as observed in HeLa cells. Moreover, we were unable to detect any changes in lysosomal or mitochondrial distribution in MCF-7 cells, whereas HeLa cells displayed a distinct change in lysosomal distribution followed by significant death. This discrepancy between the two cell lines may be ascribed to differences in motor protein expression levels and HeLa cells are probably more dependent on KIF5B for plus-end directed motor protein activity. The aggregation of lysosomes in the pericellular area preceding death in HeLa cells suggested that KIF5B might play a role in trafficking lysosomes proximal to the plasma membrane. However, we were unable to detect any reduction in exocytosis activity triggered either by ionomycin, or electroporation induced membrane damage, following KIF5B depletion. Nevertheless, a significant KIF5B translocation was observed, when HeLa cells were exposed to mechanical induced plasma membrane lesions to induce the resealing response and facilitate lysosomal exocytosis. Here, we observed a considerable recruitment of LAMP-1 positive lysosomes to reseal the damage site and significant colocalization with KIF5B. These data signify that KIF5B could play a role in transporting lysosomes to the plasma membrane destined for exocytosis, but functional redundancy probably exists that implicates other motor proteins as well. The aggregation of lysosomes following KIF5B depletion can also be explained by an alternative possibility: that KIF5B besides its role as a transporter plays a role in positioning lysosomes at distinct sites in the cytoplasm (predominantly perinuclear). Accordingly, depletion of KIF5B would liberate lysosomes allowing their transport by other motor proteins including N-kinesins towards the cortical areas of the cell resulting in lysosomal aggregations. This implies that recruitment of lysosomes by KIF5B to microtubules may localize or queue them and not necessarily facilitate long distance travel.</p><p>The death pathway induced after KIF5B depletion in HeLa cells triggered the aggregation of lysosomes followed by lysosomal destabilization and subsequent release of lysosomal cathepsins to the cytosol. We observed only limited caspase-3 like activation suggesting that the classical caspase mediated death pathway plays a minor role in the death mode observed. Lysosomal cathepsins function as effective mediators of programmed cell death but the pathways leading to LMP are, however, poorly understood. We have recently shown that vincristine, a compound that destabilizes microtubules and is frequently used in cancer therapy, induce dramatic aggregations of lysosomes and induces LMP and death in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-GrothPedersen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The two treatments might have similar consequences for lysosomal distribution resulting in lysosomes that are brought together in an uncontrolled manner inducing aggregations and subsequent destabilization of lysosomes resulting in death.</p><p>The more pronounced death phenotype observed in HeLa cells when compared to MCF-7/MCF-7-&#x00394;N-ErbB2 cells could be explained by a higher dependency on proper KIF5B motor protein activity basically to deal with a high metabolic activity and growth rate. Alternatively, MCF-7 cells might encompass more functional redundancy through expression of various motor proteins than in HeLa cells. Most of the knowledge about KIF5 mediated transport is based on studies in neurons where KIF5 family members can transport various cargoes and its activity seems to be dominant over other motor activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004424-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, however the data in non-neuronal cells are still limited.</p><p>Depletion of KIF5B by RNA interference in MCF-7 cells had a surprising impact on autophagosome formation/localization as determined by the translocation of LC3-eGFP to autophagosomes. We estimated autophagic activity by scoring LC3-eGFP positive autophagosomes after stimulation with rapamycin and observed a significant reduction upon KIF5B depletion. This finding prompted us to follow autophagosome formation in real time by time lapse microscopy using higher concentrations of either rapamycin or concanamycin A enabling us to follow the process in a shorter time frame. The remarkable accumulations of autophagosomes around the nucleus in cells depleted for KIF5B suggested that KIF5B could be involved directly in the transport of autophagosomes along microtubule tracks to the cytoplasm. However, our recent quantitative mass-spectometry analysis on membrane associated proteins purified from autophagosomes (from MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin or concanamycin A) revealed that KIF5B is not directly associated with autophagosomes (MHH, JA, JO, unpublished data). Alternatively, KIF5B might be involved in the transport of critical factor(s) important for initiation of the autophagic process and proper distribution of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, removal of KIF5B might prevent the transport of initiation factor(s) and result in formation of autophagosomes accumulating close to the microtubule organizing center and nucleus. Since the autophagosomes appeared mainly at one site of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004424-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004424.s004">Video S3</xref>) and close to the <italic>trans</italic>-golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004424-g004">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004424.s006">Video S5</xref>) suggests, that the putative initiation factor(s) transported by KIF5B could be golgi derived and affect the distribution of autophagosomes after KIF5B depletion. In addition, KIF5B depletion did not have any influence on the activity of mTOR (as determined by the phosphorylation status of p70 S6 kinase) indicating that the motor protein is acting down-stream of mTOR.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that KIF5B is highly expressed in cancer cells and plays a significant role in growth and survival of HeLa cells. Additionally, we show that KIF5B is very abundant at the site of plasma membrane damage co localizing with lysosomes destined for exocytosis although it's not essential suggesting that functional redundancy probable exist. Moreover, we provide data indicating that KIF5B is involved in the initial formation/localization of autophagosomes and might transport component(s) important for the autophagic process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s001"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Motor proteins associated with lysosomes in MCF-7-deltaN-ErbB2 compared to control MCF-7 cells as quantified by SILAC mass spectrometry.</p><p>(1.32 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s002"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>Control of HeLa-LIMP1-eGFP cells</p><p>(1.58 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s002.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s003"><label>Video S2</label><caption><p>HeLa-LIMP1-eGFP cells depleted for KIF5B (after 72h) and imaged by time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>(8.62 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s003.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s004"><label>Video S3</label><caption><p>MCF-7-LC3-eGFP cells depleted for KIF5B were stimulated with 6 nM Concanamycin A and followed by time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>(8.90 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s004.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s005"><label>Video S4</label><caption><p>MCF-7-LC3-eGFP cells treated with control siRNA (MM, 72h) were stimulated with 6 nM Concanamycin A and followed by time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>(9.23 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s005.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004424.s006"><label>Video S5</label><caption><p>MCF-7-LC3-eGFP cells co-expressing dsRED-Golgi (trans Golgi stack) and depleted for KIF5B were stimulated with 6 nM Concanamycin A and imaged by time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>(8.48 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004424.s006.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jane Hinriksen for expert technical assistance.
