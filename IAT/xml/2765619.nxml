The major checkpoint proteins in mitosis consist of mitotic arrest-deficient (Mad)1&#x02013;3, budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (Bub)1, Bub3, and monopolar spindle 1(Mps1). During meiosis, for the formation of a haploid gamete, two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation occur with only one round of DNA replication. To pull homologous chromosomes to opposite spindle poles during meiosis I, both sister kinetochores of a homologue must face toward the same pole which is very different from mitosis and meiosis II. As a core member of checkpoint proteins, the individual role of Bub3 in mammalian oocyte meiosis is unclear. In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of Bub3 in mouse oocyte meiosis. Our data showed that overexpressed Bub3 inhibited meiotic metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing homologous chromosome and sister chromatid segregations in meiosis I and II, respectively. Misaligned chromosomes, abnormal polar body and double polar bodies were observed in Bub3 knock-down oocytes, causing aneuploidy. Furthermore, through cold treatment combined with Bub3 overexpression, we found that overexpressed Bub3 affected the attachments of microtubules and kinetochores during metaphase-anaphase transition. We propose that as a member of SAC, Bub3 is required for regulation of both meiosis I and II, and is potentially involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment in mammalian oocytes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To assure accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis, eukaryotic cells employ the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) mechanism to prevent premature progression to anaphase until all chromosomes are successfully attached to the bipolar spindle with the proper tension.

The results indicate that overexpressed Bub3 inhibits metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids segregations during meiosis I and II, respectively, and that loss of Bub3 function causes misaligned chromosomes and aneuploidy. Furthermore, Bub3 may be important for the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores. We propose that, as a checkpoint protein, Bub3 is required for mammalian oocytes to monitor the meiotic cell cycle and to ensure high fidelity of chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression and subcellular localization of Bub3 during meiosis</title><p>To investigate the role of Bub3 during meiosis, we first examined the expression level and subcellular localization of this protein. Samples of mouse oocytes at different stages of meiosis were collected after oocytes had been cultured for 0, 2, 5, 8, 9.5, and 12 h, corresponding to germinal vesicle (GV), germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), prometaphase I (Pro-MI), Metaphase I (MI), anaphase/telophase I (ATI), and metaphase II (MII) stages, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, Bub3 was expressed throughout meiosis. The expression level was moderate at GV and GVBD stages, and reached the highest level at Pro-MI. At MI, Bub3 was reduced to a similar level as during the GVBD stage and was then further reduced during ATI and MII stages. For the subcellular localization of Bub3, oocytes were processed for immunofluorescent staining at different stages of meiosis. In GV stages, Bub3 was mainly localized in the germinal vesicle (nucleus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Ba</xref>); weak signal was detected around the chromosomes at GVBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bb</xref>); when oocytes progressed to Pro-MI, clear staining was observed at the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bc</xref>). After Pro-MI, we defined a short stage shortly before MI as latePro-MI to study details of Bub3 localization because the Pro-MI-MI transition is a crucial time point for tracing the behavior of checkpoint proteins. At latePro-MI, the signal of Bub3 was still obvious at the kinetochores even though most of the chromosomes had moved to the equatorial plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bd</xref>), suggesting that even one or two unattached chromosome(s) could keep Bub3's localization at kinetochores. Once all chromosomes were aligned at the equatorial plane without any mistake, i.e. the cells had progressed to MI, Bub3 could no longer be detected at the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Be</xref>). By this time the oocytes were ready to enter the AI stage. At the AI/TI stage, the signal for Bub3 was undetectable at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bf</xref>). At the MII stage, Bub3 returned to the kinetochores of chromosomes in both oocytes and the polar bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bg</xref>). Moreover, co-localization of Bub3 and CREST was performed to further confirm the kinetochore localization of Bub3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1B&#x02032;a</xref>). Notably, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1B&#x02032;b</xref>, Bub3 stayed at all 40 kinetochores even though most but not all homologues were attached with tension before the MI stage.

As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Bb</xref>-g, Myc<sub>6</sub>-Bub3 mRNA was successfully overexpressed within the oocytes: in GV and GVBD stages, diffused signal of overexpressed Bub3 was detected in the GV and around the GVBD area, respectively. In Pro-MI and latePro-MI stages, overexpressed Bub3 was clearly localized at the kinetochores of chromosomes, which was the same as the endogenous Bub3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Bc, d</xref>. During MI, however, overexpressed Bub3 was still present at the kinetochores and inhibited the transition from MI to AI by preventing the homologous chromosome segregation even though all chromosomes had been aligned at the equatorial plane and were ready for the AI transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Bf</xref>); and the oocytes could not overcome the inhibition even when cultured for 10 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Bg</xref>), which was significantly different from that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1Be</xref>. On the other hand, co-localization of overexpressed Bub3 and CREST was performed to further confirm their localization at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02032;</xref>). In the overexpressed group, most oocytes were not able to overcome the inhibition even if they were cultured for 10 hours, indicating that overexpressed Bub3 successfully inhibited the MI-AI transition during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To confirm the oocyte arrested by overexpressed Bub3 at the MI stage, we also tested the level of cyclin B. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02032;</xref>, cyclin B's level in overexpressed oocytes was nearly the same as that in MI stage oocytes (Cont2) while it was much higher than that in AI stage oocytes (Contl). To examine the details of homologous chromosomes during the delayed MI-AI transition, we employed chromosome spreading. In meiosis, the number of bivalents in control oocytes cultured for 5&#x02013;6 hours (Pro-MI) was 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Da</xref>). When oocytes entered AI, all bivalents separated and became univalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Db</xref>). Notably, in the overexpression group, all oocytes (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12), whose MI-AI transition was successfully inhibited, displayed 20 bivalents, without any univalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g002">Fig. 2Dc</xref>). These results imply that overexpressed Bub3 inhibits the MI-AI transition and prevents homologous chromosomes from segregation in an &#x0201c;all or none&#x0201d; manner.</p><p>Among the overexpression oocytes cultured for 10 hours, a few (about 10&#x00025; of the total oocytes) were able to enter AI even though the signal of overexpressed Bub3 was detected.

However, using a Bub1 mutant, previous work by Tsurumi et al. demonstrated that CSF-arrested oocytes were not regulated by spindle checkpoint protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Tsurumi1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we showed that Bub3 was involved in meiosis II because overexpressed Bub3 inhibited the MII-AII transition by preventing sister chromatid segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that Bub3 may be required for CSF in mouse oocytes. Indeed, the Bub1 mutant used in the study by Tsurumi et al. was reported to act as a dominant negative by competing with the kinetochore localization of the endogenous protein but did not deplete the endogenous protein and therefore it is possible that this Bub1 mutant did not interfere with a kinetochore-independent function required for CSF establishment or maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Tsurumi1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the fact that Mad2 and Bub1 are localized at kinetochores in MII arrested oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Brunet1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Kallio2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> supports a potential function of SAC proteins in CSF. It appears that different monitoring systems exist in meiosis I and II. Bub3 is a component of the MCC which functions as the inhibitory factor of APC/C to inhibit the MI-AI transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Sudakin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Musacchio1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. While in meiosis II, Bub3 or SAC is involved in establishment of the CSF activity. In our RNAi experiment, however, depletion of Bub3 did not enable oocytes to progress into AII, indicating that down-regulation of single SAC protein is not sufficient to make an essential change to CSF activity. Indeed, various factors are required for CSF activity including Mos/MEK/MAPK/p90Rsk, Cdk2/cyclinE, RINGO, Emi1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Tsurumi1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Tunquist2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent work by other lab has also shown that like BubR1 and Bub1, Bub3 is required for proper chromosome-spindle attachment in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Logarinho1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. During the MI-AI transition or AI stage, sister kinetochores face the same pole and are captured by MTs to form K-MTs so that homologous chromosomes move towards the opposite poles. Through overexpression of Bub3 during the MI-AI transition and cold treatment, we have provided evidence that Bub3 is involved in the kinetochore and microtubule interaction in meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g004">Fig. 4 Ab</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g004">Fig. 4 Ac</xref> indicate the misaligned chromosomes during the transition, which leads to the abnormal segregation. We believe that AI oocytes tend to be sensitive to the overexpressed Bub3 because endogenous Bub3 drops to the lowest level from this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and no signal can be detected at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and Bub3 or SAC proteins are considered to be inactive at this time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Musacchio1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Vogt1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Cleveland1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>; compulsively localized Bub3 at kinetochores by overexpression would disturb the attachment signal. It appears that shortly before the completion of Myc<sub>6</sub>-Bub3 mRNA expression, homologous chromosomes are aligned properly and ready to enter the AI stage. When Myc<sub>6</sub>-Bub3 mRNA translation is completed, the overexpressed Bub3 subsequently interferes with kinetochore-microtubule attachments so that these homologues move out of order during the segregation. A recent study has revealed a crucial complex in kinetochores called KMN which can bind microtubules and checkpoint proteins (especially binding Bub3 directly) in corresponding checkpoint &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Burke1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating a competitive relationship between microtubules and Bub3.</p><p>By down-regulating Bub3 using RNAi, we showed that depletion of Bub3 abrogates the metaphase arrest induced by nocodazole, further indicating that Bub3 functions as a checkpoint protein, which is consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Logarinho1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Kalitsis1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Zhang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, we found that Bub3-RNAi caused misalignment of chromosomes, improper segregations, or abnormal polar bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g006">Fig. 6A and B</xref>), which was similar to that in Mad2-depleted oocytes exhibiting large or multiple polar bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Homer2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the advance of the MI-AI transition and PBE did not occur in the RNAi group, indicating that Bub3 may not be as effective as the other members such as Mad2, Bub1, or BubR1 in SAC. Among these proteins, Mad2 and Mad3 (BubR1 in humans) have been shown to bind Cdc20 directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Hwang1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>; BubR1 depletion leads to extensive misalignment defects that are more severe than those induced by Bub3 and Bub1 depletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Logarinho1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>; loss of Bub1 in oocytes of Zp3-Cre transgenic mice greatly accelerates resolution of chiasmata and PBE, and the peak of APC/C activity in these oocytes is advanced by 5 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-McGuinness1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, SAC proteins have been reported to exert their function interdependently, and down-regulation of a single SAC protein therefore appears to be insufficient to advance the MI-AI transition and PBE. A dynamics study on checkpoint proteins revealed that Bub3 cycled through kinetochores much faster while Mad1 and Bub1 resided stably at kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Howell1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating a Bub3 pool in the cytoplasm, which could buffer the down-regulation. On the other hand, due to the lager volume, the sensitivity of oocyte is not as the same as that of somatic cells. Using chromosome spreading, we found that most of the RNAi-oocytes exhibited incorrect numbers of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007701-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), which provides direct evidence for aneuploidy. An early study showed that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Bub3 was required for checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest as its loss either by mutation or by RNAi causes precocious sister chromatid segregation, abnormal anaphase organization, and significant aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Lopes1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion of Bub3 in the mouse is lethal early in embryogenesis with cells accumulating mitotic errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Kalitsis1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Babu1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, meiosis in humans is particularly error-prone and the majority of the errors in oocytes originate during meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Hunt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007701-Hassold1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. All the clues therefore reveal that Bub3 depletion is one critical cause leading to aneuploidy and up-regulation of some checkpoint proteins in oocytes with SAC deficiency may be a feasible strategy to overcome aneuploidy. In summary, although the characteristics of cell cycle in meiosis are different from those in mitosis, as a core member of SAC, Bub3 is required for monitoring the chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All chemicals and media were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO) except for those specifically mentioned.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Oocyte collection and culture</title><p>ICR mice care and handling were conducted in accordance with policies promulgated by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
