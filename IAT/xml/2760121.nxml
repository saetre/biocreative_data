MicroRNAs function in post-transcriptional gene silencing by targeting the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs, resulting in translational repression. We have developed a system to study the role of miRNAs in cell differentiation. We have found that one of the miRNAs tested in our system (miR-378, also called miR-378&#x0002a;) plays a role in modulating nephronectin-mediated differentiation in the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. Nephronectin is an extracellular matrix protein, and we have demonstrated that its over-expression enhanced osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation. Furthermore, we found that the nephronectin 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) contains a binding site for <italic>miR-378</italic>. Stable transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells with miR-378 inhibited cell differentiation. MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nephronectin exhibited higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation as compared with cells transfected with nephronectin containing the 3&#x02032;UTR in the early stages of development, suggesting that endogenous <italic>miR-378</italic> is present and active. However, in the later stages of MC3T3-E1 development, the differentiation rates were opposite, with higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation in the cells over-expressing the 3&#x02032;UTR of nephronectin. This appeared to be the consequence of competition between nephronectin and UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GalNAc-T7 or GalNT7) for <italic>miR-378</italic> binding, resulting in increased GalNT7 activity, which in turn lead to increased nephronectin glycosylation and product secretion, thereby resulting in a higher rate of osteoblast differentiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past few years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a prominent class of gene regulatory factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Rubartelli1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of gene expression, our understanding of the specific roles of miRNAs has been limited due to the difficulty in tracking the functions of a particular miRNA. Furthermore, since chemically synthetic miRNAs are easily degraded, it is impossible to obtain stable cell lines expressing miRNAs for long-term functional analysis in vitro and in vivo. Although expression of a large DNA fragment has made stable expression possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Dickins1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, in many cases miRNAs are expressed as a cluster, making it difficult to distinguish the function of a particular miRNA from others. To allow long-term studies of miRNA functions in vitro and in vivo, we have developed an expression vector expressing two copies of pre-miRNAs, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tracking unit, and an antibiotic selection marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Lee1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Wang2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. This allows stable expression of double amounts of the miRNA of interest in cells for functional studies.</p><p>Nephronectin was discovered in the developing mouse kidney as a novel ligand for the integrin &#x003b1;8&#x003b2;1. It is a 70&#x02013;90 kDa secreted extracellular matrix protein that contains a putative signal peptide at the N-terminus, five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 57&#x02013;250), an RGD sequence (amino acids 382&#x02013;384), and a C-terminal MAM domain (amino acids 417&#x02013;561). As nephronectin is expressed in a variety of tissues in the developing mouse embryo, we studied the role of nephronectin in bone development. We also examined the regulation of nephronectin expression by <italic>miR-378</italic> and demonstrated that <italic>miR-378</italic> up-regulated nephronectin expression, and enhanced nephronectin glycosylation and secretion via binding to the 3&#x02032;UTR of nephronectin mRNA. Interaction of <italic>miR-378</italic> with nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR arrested this miRNA and freed another <italic>miR-378</italic> target GalNT7, an enzyme essential for nephronectin glycosylation. As a consequence, nephronectin glycosylation was enhanced and osteoblast differentiation was promoted.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nephronectin promotes osteoblast differentiation</title><p>To study the role of nephronectin during osteoblast development, we generated a nephronectin construct (Npnt).

These cells undergo an orderly, time-dependent developmental sequence over three stages that are analogous to the respective stages of <italic>in vivo</italic> bone development. Nephronectin is an extracellular matrix protein known to be highly expressed in the long bone. This study was initiated by examination of the role of nephronectin in osteoblast differentiation and we discovered that ectopic expression of nephronectin promoted osteoblast differentiation. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> model system for bone development, ALP activity was used as a marker for osteoblast differentiation. Only the differentiated osteoblasts would stain pink/red for ALP expression. There was a significant difference in ALP expression between MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with the empty vector and those expressing full-length nephronectin. The function of endogenous nephronectin was confirmed by knocking down nephronectin expression with the siRNA approach.</p><p>We then investigated the mechanisms that could be involved in the regulation of nephronectin-mediated action. MiRNAs are known to bind to the 3&#x02032;UTRs of genes to regulate their expression post-transcriptionally. Since nephronectin bears a long 3&#x02032;UTR, we hypothesized that nephronectin expression is regulated by miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a fragment of the nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR into the nephronectin expression construct. As expected, MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nephronectin bearing the 3&#x02032;UTR fragment (Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;) differentiated in lower levels as compared with those transfected with nephronectin alone in the early stages of differentiation. These results suggested that some endogenous miRNAs might have interacted with the 3&#x02032;UTR fragment and repressed nephronectin expression resulting in a lower level of osteoblast differentiation. Nevertheless, Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells still differentiated at higher levels than the mock-transfected cells suggesting incomplete repression of ectopically transfected nephronectin. Unexpectedly, on examining the Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells over the three stages of bone development, we observed that the initial delay in osteoblast differentiation was followed by an equal rate of differentiation, that finally resulted in the Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells exhibiting significantly higher levels of osteoblast differentiation. This pattern was evident in bone nodule formation as well: after an initial delay in bone nodule formation, the Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells produced significantly higher densities of bone nodules than the nephronectin-transfected cells.</p><p>We hypothesized that over-expression of the 3&#x02032;UTR might have attracted certain miRNAs binding to this fragment and, thereby making them unavailable for targeting some glycosylation-associated enzymes, which are essential for glycosylation of nephronectin. This in turn would increase the activity of glycosylation-associated enzymes, leading to produce more glycosylated nephronectin. Consequently, more nephronectin is secreted to promote osteoblast differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the differences in glycosylation of the nephronectin core protein in the presence and absence of the nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR using the two stable cell lines transfected with nephronectin or Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;. Western blot analysis showed that the Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells had a much higher level of glycosylated nephronectin compared with the nephronectin-transfected cells. These results therefore support our hypothesis.</p><p>The post-transcriptional regulation of nephronectin by miRNA was then examined. The use of bioinformatics algorithms showed that the 3&#x02032;UTR of nephronectin was a potential target of miRNA <italic>miR-378</italic>. To examine the effect of <italic>miR-378</italic>, we generated a construct expressing dual fragments of pre-miR-378. Stable over-expression of the miR-378 construct strongly inhibited MC3T3-E1 differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that miR-378 enhances cell survival and tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Lee1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The report presented here that miR-378 inhibits cell differentiation is in consistent with our previous finding.</p><p>To examine the probability that translation of nephronectin was repressed by <italic>miR-378</italic>, we performed a number of co-transfection experiments including transient transfection and stable transfection of Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032; with the miR-378 construct in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and Hek293 cells. Unexpectedly, co-transfection of Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032; with miR-378 not only promoted nephronectin glycosylation, but also enhanced production of nephronectin, perhaps through enhanced translation, while miR-378 showed little effect on nephronectin (no 3&#x02032;UTR) expression, as expected. We could explain this phenomenon by the fact that nephronectin might not be a true target of miR-378 although the sequence in its 3&#x02032;UTR matches well with the sequence of miR-378. The ability to reliably identify the targets of a given miRNA has been known to be a major problem in the miRNA field. Most of the computational predictions of miRNA targets focus on base pairing between the miRNA &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; region and its target mRNA. Despite the presence of the same target sites, it remains unclear why miR-378 was able to repress luciferase activity while the nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR when placed in the luciferase construct was not able to repress nephronectin expression. Zhao and co-workers have presented evidence for target selectivity which depends on the free energy surrounding the target site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Zhao1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. They proposed that a stable environment with lower free energy may not be accessible to the miRNA silencing complex as compared with the one with higher free energy (or unstable environment). We have also found that the secondary structure of the common miRNA binding site and its flanking regions is normally located in an unstable region with a multi-branching loop-like RNA structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Hua1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. How the average free energy flanking regions in a miRNA binding site affect targeting by a particular miRNA as well as the efficiencies of miRNA repression of gene expression await further investigation.</p><p>Bearing this in mind, we propose that binding of miR-378 to the 3&#x02032;UTR of nephronectin not only did not exert direct repression of nephronectin synthesis, but it also created a secondary structure which is less accessible to other miRNAs which normally target nephronectin and regulate its expression. This space hindrance resulted in increased synthesis of nephronectin. Furthermore, the binding interaction of miR-378 with nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR would reduce free miR-378 for targeting nephronectin glycosylation-associated enzyme(s). As a consequence, the enzyme(s) expression would be enhanced resulting in increased nephronectin glycosylation and product secretion. We have previously demonstrated that glycosylation is an essential step for product secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Yang1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007535-Chen3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Concurrent with increased nephronectin protein synthesis, glycosylation, and secretion was the inhibition of proliferation and promotion of differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells that were co-transfected with miR-378 and the Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032; construct.</p><p>To test whether some glycosylation-associated enzymes were affected, total proteins in MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nephronectin or Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032; were subjected to proteomic and computational analyses. Indeed, GalNT7, an enzyme known to glycosylate proteins, was up-regulated in Npnt&#x0002b;3&#x02032;-transfected cells and was downregulated by miR-378 expression. These results explained why expression of nephronectin 3&#x02032;UTR was able to promote MC3T3-E1 differentiation and bone nodule formation in the late stages. However, it is not clear why these phenomena were not seen in the early stages. It is possible that the over-expressed nephronectin, although not secreted due to lack of glycosylation, interfered with some signalling molecules inside the cells, playing a role in cell differentiation. This awaits further investigation.</p><p>Taken together, we have reported a mechanism by which a miRNA can function in promoting protein expression in two ways. It can be achieved by binding to the 3&#x02032;UTR and resulting in space hindrance preventing easy access of other miRNAs, thereby protecting the mRNA from being regulated post-transcriptionally. Secondly, a miRNA can promote protein expression by binding to the 3&#x02032;UTR and freeing the true target of the miRNA, thereby increasing the levels of the target, which in turn enhances protein modification and secretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), alpha modified Eagle's medium (AMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin/EDTA, Lipofectamine 2000, geneticin (G418), hygromycin were purchased from Wisent Inc.
