We have now directly compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIKfyve in HeLa cells with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of enzyme activity. Both approaches induce changes in the distribution of CI-M6PR and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-46 proteins, which cycles between endosomes and TGN, leading to their accumulation in dispersed punctae, whilst the TGN marker golgin-245 retains a perinuclear disposition. Trafficking of CD8-CI-M6PR (retromer-dependent) and CD8-Furin (retromer-independent) chimeras from the cell surface to the TGN is delayed following drug administration, as is the transport of the Shiga toxin B-subunit. siRNA knockdown of PIKfyve produced no defect in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation, unless combined with knockdown of its activator molecule Vac14, suggesting that a low threshold of PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is necessary and sufficient for this pathway. Accordingly pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve results in a profound block to the lysosomal degradation of activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Met receptors. Immunofluorescence revealed EGF receptors to be trapped in the interior of a swollen endosomal compartment. In cells starved of amino acids, PIKfyve inhibition leads to the accumulation of the lipidated form of GFP-LC3, a marker of autophagosomal structures, which can be visualized as fluorescent punctae. We suggest that PIKfyve inhibition may render the late endosome/lysosome compartment refractory to fusion with both autophagosomes and with EGFR-containing multivesicular bodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>EGF receptor</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>PIKfyve</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>3-phosphoinositides control the identity and dynamics of endocytic compartments, through the recruitment of multiple effector proteins containing specific recognition domains.

We now provide further characterization of the cellular effects of a PIKfyve inhibitor (MF4) pharmacologically similar to YM201636, which we have directly compared with knockdown of PIKfyve alone or in combination with Vac14.

We could obtain highly efficient knockdown of the PIKfyve activator protein Vac14 but this only produced the vacuole phenotype at very low penetrance (&#x0223c;3%) and did not augment the effect of PIKfyve knockdown on vacuole formation (not shown). MF4 is chemically similar to the recently described specific PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 by Jefferies et al., with the only difference being that MF4 lacks an amino group on the pyridine ring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1E</xref>). MF4 inhibited PIKfyve with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 23 n<sc>m</sc>, whereas an inactive analogue MF2 showed no activity even at 5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>.

Application of MF4 gives a vacuolar phenotype in all cells within 4 h. Electron microscopic analysis indicates that the large phase lucent vacuoles are inaccessible to internalized horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but they do become surrounded by a second class of smaller (but still swollen) HRP-containing vacuoles, positive for early (EEA1) or late endosomal markers [lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-2)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which we will henceforth refer to as 'swollen endosomes&#x02019;.

Certain aspects of these studies may be complicated by the fact that TGN-46 itself undergoes a cycling itinerary, which partially overlaps with ciM6PR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">(25)</xref>. We have now analyzed the steady-state distribution of TGN-46, CI-M6PR and golgin-245 following individual knockdown of PIKfyve, hVac14, a combination of the two and the PIKfyve inhibitor.

We have followed trafficking of a chimeric CD8-CI-M6PR along this route following application of an anti-CD8 antibody and of fluorescently labelled Shiga toxin B-subunit.

In cells which show highly dispersed TGN-46 punctae, these do not co-localize with CD8-CI-M6PR at the final time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>). Shiga toxin can reach the perinuclear TGN as judged by co-localization with golgin-245, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A and B</xref>) following PIKfyve inhibition, but its accumulation there, is impeded and co-localization with dispersed TGN-46 positive punctae can also be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>PIKfyve inhibition causes a perturbation in the uptake of the Shiga toxin B-subunit</title><p>Uptake of the Shiga toxin B-subunit was examined in HeLa cells using a Cy3-labelled StxB construct, following treatment with 800 n<sc>m</sc> MF4 PIKfyve inhibitor.

Our data concur with these previous studies, but we noticed that when combined with Vac14 knockdown a modest defect in EGFR downregulation is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A and B</xref>). A far more effective block to EGFR and also c-Met downregulation was seen following application of PIKfyve inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5C, D and E</xref>). Fluorescence examination of EGFR distribution shows that residual receptor following PIKfyve inhibition is concentrated in punctate structures which frequently co-localize with the early endosomal marker EEA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">(29)</xref>. In many cases EGFR can be visualized in the interior of endosomes decorated with EEA1 on their limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus acute pharmacological inhibition has revealed an important function of PIKfyve in mammalian cells that provides some reconciliation with data obtained with <italic>Drosophilia</italic> knock-outs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">(21)</xref>, which indicated defects in receptor downregulation. If activated receptor was retained at the limiting membrane of endosomes, one may expect more prolonged signalling following acute activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30)</xref>. We do not see this when we examine activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or AKT/protein kinase B (PKB). Rather we see a dampening of AKT signalling at later time-points, e.g. 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5F</xref>). Although IC50 values of MF4 (23 n<sc>m</sc>) and YM210636 (33 n<sc>m</sc>) are similar towards PIKfyve, we obtain less selectivity over PtdIns 3-kinase p110<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> than that reported for YM210636 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>.

Both inhibitors caused a significant reduction in phosphorylation of AKT/PKB but had no effect on EGFR degradation (data not shown). These results in combination with the observation that MF4 does not cause a reduction in initial EGF-dependent phosphorylation of AKT/PKB, suggest that the effects on EGFR degradation are not due to a non-specific inhibition of class 1 PtdIns 3-kinases.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Acute inhibition of PIKfyve affects downregulation of tyrosine kinase receptors</title><p>HeLa cells were treated with siRNA oligos against the indicated proteins (A and B), or with 3 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> PIKfyve inhibitor (C and D) or the indicated doses of inhibitor (E).

These have the following drawbacks; (i) PIKfyve has proven hard to completely deplete, so that residual enzymatic activity could provide enough PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> particularly if the enzyme is controlled by a positive feedback loop, (ii) it is not clear if phenotypes observed are because of loss of enzyme activity or of some other function of the protein and (iii) depletion is very gradual, so that any phenotype may constitute a very indirect consequence of protein loss over a prolonged time period. Nevertheless, these studies and our current study, have shown that the distribution of proteins which traffic between the sorting endosome and the TGN is perturbed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref>. This result is recapitulated by acute pharmacological inhibition. One of these proteins is TGN-46, which, because it is also cycling along this pathway cannot be reliably used as a TGN marker under these conditions. Golgin-245, another TGN marker, shows significantly less perturbation following PIKfyve inhibition. Dispersed TGN-46 punctae produced by PIKfyve inhibition do not co-localize with golgin-245, suggesting that TGN-46 may accumulate in another compartment that forms part of its itinerary. Whilst Jeffries et al.suggest that the steady-state distribution of CI-M6PR is not drastically altered following treatment with YM201636, their experiments were performed in a different cell line (NIH3T3) and other assays for retrieval on this pathway were not examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. In accordance with our data, a recent study of Vac14 &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice showed a similar defect in CI-M6PR distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>.</p><p>As well as the steady-state distribution, the kinetics of transport from the cell surface via the endosome to the TGN is delayed for several proteins (CD8-CI-M6PR, CD8-Furin, Shiga Toxin), which may utilize retromer-dependent (CD8-CI-M6PR, Shiga toxin) and retromer-independent (CD8-Furin) sorting mechanisms from the endosome. Interestingly, retrieval to the TGN is delayed and not completely blocked following loss of PIKfyve activity, suggesting that either cargo may traffic on alternate, less efficient pathways or that enzymatic activity is rate-limiting for this process but not essential.</p><p>Knockdown of PIKfyve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref> or of Vac14 (this study) does not significantly affect EGFR degradation rates, consistent with previous studies. This observation has been difficult to reconcile with knockout phenotypes in model organisms which have suggested a critical role for PIKfyve in receptor degradation and formation of terminal lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21)</xref>. We reasoned that in the circumstance of incomplete depletion, combining Vac14 and PIKfyve knockdown should suppress PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> to a greater extent than PIKfyve alone. This condition revealed a modest inhibition of EGFR degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting a role for PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> synthesis, but with a relatively low threshold value. Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve, at concentrations which do not produce any major perturbation in the levels of other 3-phosphoinositides, revealed a strong block to both EGFR and c-Met downregulation, as judged by western blotting and by immunofluorescence. The appearance of EGFR in the interior of swollen endosomes positive for EEA1 suggests that the major impediment is not a defect in sorting to luminal vesicles, but may reflect a failure of multivesicular bodies to fuse with the degradative late endosome/lysosomal compartment.</p><p>A role for PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> in the formation of autophagosomes is well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">(32)</xref>, but the part played by PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is less clear. We observe that PIKfyve inhibition leads to an accumulation of lipidated GFP-LC3 on punctate structures, characteristic of autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. This could reflect an increased rate of production of autophagosomal structures or a decreased rate of their consumption by fusion with lysosomes. Taking this data together with the observation of Jefferies et al., that autophagic breakdown of proteins is reduced by PIKfyve inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>, we favour the second interpretation. Thus, both effects on the autophagy pathway and of EGFR downregulation could be explained by a common mechanism, through which PIKfyve inhibition either renders an acceptor late endosome/lysosome compartment refractory to fusion or leads to a defect in the acidification necessary for lysosomal degradation. Although not quantitative, Acridine Orange accumulation in endocytic punctae, indicative of acidification, is similar in both MF4-treated and control cells, although it does not accumulate in the highly swollen vacuoles which appear disconnected from the endocytic pathway (data not shown). Two general models can explain how PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> effects are mediated; (i) by recruitment of effector molecules with specific lipid binding domains and (ii) allosteric regulation of resident endocytic proteins, e.g. enzyme or channel activity. Although Svp1 in yeast is an authentic PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> sensor it is less clear for its mammalian orthologues WIPI-1 and WIPI-2. WIPI-1, like Svp1 can bind both PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> and PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref> whilst the lipid binding-properties of WIPI-2 are unknown. Other candidate effector proteins remain to be identified.</p><p>In summary, juxtaposition of siRNA knockdown of PIKfyve with pharmacological inhibition links the observed siRNA phenotype of disrupted endosome to TGN trafficking, with enzymatic activity. However, pharmacological inhibition reveals further defects on the receptor degradation and autophagy pathway, suggesting that relatively low levels of PtdIns(3,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> are permissive for these pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and other reagents</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal human Vac14 antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with the N-terminal amino acids of Vac14 (HLEVRHQRSGRGDHLDRR), conjugated via a cysteine to <italic>Limulus polyphemus</italic> haemocyanin (Covance) and affinity purified on peptide columns.
