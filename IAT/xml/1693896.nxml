At the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, the activator Gal4p first recruits SAGA to the upstream activating sequence (UAS), and then the UAS-bound SAGA facilitates recruitment of TATA-box binding protein (TBP) to the core promoter, thereby stimulating formation of preinitiation complex (PIC) and hence transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Sgf73p has been biochemically identified as a new component of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Sgf73p is a yeast homologue of the human Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (<italic>SCA7</italic>) gene product, ataxin-7 or Sca7p. It is one of the eight known autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders which are caused by CAG (that encodes glutamine, Q) nucleotide repeat expansions from &#x0003c;35 (non-pathogenic) to an extreme of 300 (pathogenic) copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, it is not known how CAG nucleotide repeat expansion within ataxin-7 causes neurodegenerative diseases. Recent biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) have demonstrated that, like Sgf73p, wild-type ataxin-7 is a component of mammalian SPT3-TAF<sub>II</sub>31-GCN5<sub>L</sub> acetylase (STAGA) transcription coactivator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), a human homologue of yeast SAGA complex, and it regulates HAT activity of STAGA and its interaction with activators. The poly(Q)-expanded ataxin-7 gets incorporated into STAGA as well as SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), but inhibits Gcn5p-HAT activities of both STAGA and SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and thus alters gene expression, providing significant information on the molecular basis of poly(Q) disorders.</p><p>Although previous biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) have defined the functional roles of Sgf73p and ataxin-7 in maintaining the overall structural integrities of SAGA and STAGA, respectively, and their HAT activities, the molecular role of Sgf73p or ataxin-7 in transcriptional regulation remains mostly unknown <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, using a formaldehyde-based <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we have analyzed the role of Sgf73p in recruitment of SAGA and formation of the PIC assembly (and hence transcription) at the SAGA-dependent promoter in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Further, we have determined the role of histone H3 acetylation or the HAT activity of SAGA in regulation of the PIC formation at the SAGA-dependent promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results reveal that Sgf73p is required for SAGA recruitment and stimulates formation of the PIC assembly at the SAGA-dependent promoters. Consistently, transcription of the SAGA-regulated genes is significantly impaired in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>.

Recently, Sgf73p has been biochemically implicated as a new component of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). To confirm whether Sgf73p is a new component of SAGA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed recruitment of Sgf73p to the UAS of a well-characterized SAGA-dependent gene, <italic>GAL1</italic>, using a ChIP assay. We used either a c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody and yeast strains expressing a C-terminal myc epitope-tagged Sgf73p or polyclonal antibody to SAGA TAF (e.g. TAF12p). Two sets of promoter-specific primer-pairs were used that, as shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, could distinguish binding to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS or core promoter. If Sgf73p is an integral component of the SAGA complex, it would be recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS, but not core promoter, since previous ChIP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) have demonstrated recruitment of SAGA to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that under condition in which Gal4p activation domain was active (galactose-containing growth medium), the TAF12p subunit of SAGA as well as Sgf73p were present at the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS. Similarly, Gal4p was recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Significantly, these same proteins were not associated with the <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter as well as an irrelevant DNA sequence (<italic>GAL4</italic> ORF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations supported the possibility that Sgf73p is a component of SAGA <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, because these experiments were performed with the intact <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, it remained possible that other transcription components, such as general transcription factors (GTFs) played a role in recruitment of Sgf73p to the UAS. To address this issue, we asked whether Sgf73p could be recruited by Gal4p to a plasmid bearing only Gal4p-binding sites, but not other promoter elements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that Sgf73p was recruited to a plasmid bearing Gal4p-binding sites in galactose-containing growth medium in which Gal4p activation domain was active. Significantly, Sgf73p was not associated with the Gal4p-binding sites when Gal4p activation domain was inactive (raffinose-containing growth medium) even though the level of Gal4p recruitment was almost equal to that in galactose-containing growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further, our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) have demonstrated that, like Sgf73p, other SAGA components, such as Spt3p and Spt20p, were also recruited to the minimal Gal4p-binding sites in the plasmid in galactose-containing growth medium. Significantly, the GTFs, such as TBP, TFIIB, Mediator and RNA polymerase II, were not recruited to the minimal Gal4p binding sites in the plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Taken together, our data provide evidence that Sgf73p is a new component of the SAGA complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sgf73p regulates the integrity of SAGA <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To understand the role of the newly identified Sgf73p component of SAGA in transcriptional activation in greater detail, it is necessary to determine its contribution in maintaining the integrity of SAGA. Recently, McMahon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) have demonstrated biochemically that Sgf73p is required to maintain SAGA integrity. Similarly, if Sgf73p maintains SAGA integrity <italic>in vivo</italic>, Spt20p and other SAGA components will not be recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS in the &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> strain. To test this idea, we analyzed recruitment of SAGA to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS in the <italic>SGF73</italic> deletion mutant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the deletion of <italic>SGF73</italic> significantly lowered recruitment of the Spt20p and TAF10p components of SAGA to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS. Similarly, our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) have also demonstrated that recruitment of SAGA was lost in the <italic>SPT20</italic> [that integrates SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)] deletion mutant strain.

Since Spt20p maintains the integrity of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and its recruitment was significantly reduced in the absence of Sgf73p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), thus Sgf73p, like Spt20p, seems to regulate the structural integrity of the SAGA complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, our ChIP data also raised the possibility that Sgf73p might be required for recruitment of Spt20p (and hence SAGA) to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS by its interaction with the activator, Gal4p. In fact, our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) have demonstrated that SAGA is recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS by interaction of its Tra1 subunit with Gal4p <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Histone H3 acetylation or the HAT activity of SAGA has been previously implicated in regulation of transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). However, how histone H3 acetylation or HAT regulates PIC formation and hence transcriptional initiation is not clearly known <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, we asked whether formation of Sgf73p-mediated PIC assembly at the core promoters of the aforementioned SAGA-dependent genes is dependent on histone H3 acetylation or HAT. To address this question, we analyzed recruitment of TBP and RNA polymerase II to the core promoters of the <italic>GAL1, PHO84</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> genes in the <italic>GCN5</italic> deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type equivalent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the <italic>GAL1, PHO84</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> core promoters were acetylated at histone H3. Histone H3 acetylation at these core promoters were significantly reduced in &#x00394;<italic>gcn5</italic>. Interestingly, such a reduction in the level of histone H3 acetylation did not alter recruitment of RNA polymerase II and TBP to the <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> core promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, at these two promoters, Sgf73p facilitates formation of the PIC assembly in a HAT-independent-manner. In contrast, recruitment of RNA polymerase II and TBP to the <italic>PHO84</italic> core promoter was dependent on histone H3 acetylation or Gcn5p-HAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), demonstrating the requirement of histone H3 acetylation or HAT for formation of the PIC assembly. Thus, our data demonstrate that histone H3 acetylation or the HAT activity of SAGA is differentially required for formation of the PIC assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>, revealing a complex regulation of the PIC formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Sgf73p in regulation of histone H3 acetylation or histone H3 eviction at the SAGA-dependent promoters</title><p>We next asked whether Gcn5p-HAT activity of SAGA is regulated by Sgf73p <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) have demonstrated that Gcn5p-HAT activity on nucleosomal histone H3 is dependent on the Ada2p and Ada3p components of SAGA. Similarly, deletion of <italic>SGF73</italic> has been shown to biochemically impair the HAT activity of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, it is not known whether Sgf73p regulates histone H3 acetylation at the promoters of the SAGA-dependent genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this question, we analyzed the levels of histone H3 acetylation at the <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter in the <italic>SGF73</italic> wild-type and deletion mutant strains. Since Sgf73p is required for recruitment of Gcn5p as well as SAGA, histone H3 acetylation at the <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter is expected to be significantly impaired in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. Interestingly, our ChIP data demonstrate the elevated level of histone H3 acetylation at the <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> when compared with wild-type equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Likewise, the elevated levels of histone H3 acetylation were also observed at the <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> core promoters in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, histone H3 acetylation level at the core promoter of a SAGA-independent <italic>RPS5</italic> gene was not altered in the absence of Sgf73p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since H3-K9/14 acetylation antibody also recognizes unacetylated histone H3 (Upstate biotechnology, Inc.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the increase in the levels of histone H3 acetylation at the core promoters of <italic>GAL1, ADH1</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> may be caused by the elevated levels of histone H3 at the core promoters of these genes, possibly because of reduction of histone H3 eviction in the absence of the PIC formation or active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). To test this possibility, we analyzed the levels of histone H3 at the <italic>GAL1, ADH1</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> core promoters in the S<italic>GF73</italic> deletion mutant strain and its isogenic wild-type equivalent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that the levels of histone H3 at the core promoters of <italic>GAL1, ADH1</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>, but not <italic>RPS5</italic>, were elevated in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. Interestingly, the increase in the level of histone H3 acetylation is remarkably similar to that of histone H3 at each of the SAGA-dependent promoters in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. Thus, Sgf73p does not seem to elevate the relative level of histone H3 acetylation or the HAT activity of Gcn5p <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nonetheless, our data reveal that the loss of Sgf73p lowers histone H3 eviction from the SAGA-dependent promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although Sgf73p has been shown to be a new component of SAGA on the basis of the biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), it is not known whether Sgf73p is a SAGA component <italic>in vivo</italic>. If so, it would be recruited along with other SAGA components to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS but not to its core promoter, since SAGA is specifically recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS by the activator Gal4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Here, we show that, like SAGA, Sgf73p is recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> UAS, but not core promoter, or even to the minimal Gal4p-binding sites in a plasmid, implicating Sgf73p as a SAGA component <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we show that the deletion of <italic>SGF73</italic> significantly impairs recruitment of the SAGA complex, consistent with biochemical requirement of Sgf73p for SAGA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Thus, our results support the fact <italic>in vivo</italic> that Sgf73p is a SAGA component and is required for the structural integrity of SAGA, consistent with recent biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Since Sgf73p is essential for recruitment of SAGA, the PIC would thus not be formed at the SAGA-dependent promoters in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. Indeed, our study demonstrates that recruitment of the PIC components such as TBP and RNA polymerase II is significantly impaired at the core promoters of the three representative SAGA-dependent genes, <italic>GAL1, ADH1</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic>, in the absence of Sgf73p. Consistently, transcription of these genes is altered in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. However, whether Sgf73p plays a dual role in assembling PIC by interacting with the component(s) of PIC as well as maintaining structural integrity of SAGA to regulate gene expression remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) have demonstrated the functional role of histone H3 acetylation at the promoters in regulation of transcriptional initiation. Here, we demonstrate that all three SAGA-dependent promoters are acetylated at histone H3. Acetylation of histone H3 at these promoters is significantly lost in &#x00394;<italic>gcn5</italic>. However, formation of the PIC assembly at the <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> promoters is not altered in &#x00394;<italic>gcn5</italic>. Thus, our study reveals that histone H3 acetylation status does not regulate PIC formation at <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic>. In contrast, PIC formation is significantly reduced at the <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter in &#x00394;<italic>gcn5</italic>, demonstrating the role of histone H3 acetylation in regulation of the PIC formation, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Thus, our study reveals that histone H3 acetylation differentially regulates formation of the PIC assembly. However, the molecular basis for such differential roles of histone H3 acetylation in regulation of the PIC formation remains unknown. According to the &#x02018;histone-code&#x02019; hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), it is likely that histone H3 acetylation in combination with other histone modifications at the <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> promoters may contribute to the role of chromatin structure in PIC formation and hence transcriptional activation.</p><p>Histones are evicted during active transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Since Sgf73p is required for formation of the PIC assembly (and hence transcriptional activation), histone eviction from the SAGA-dependent promoters would thus be significantly reduced in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic>. Indeed, our study demonstrates the elevated levels of histone H3 at the SAGA-dependent promoters in the absence of Sgf73p. Thus, impairment of PIC formation in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> decreases histone H3 eviction and hence alters chromatin structure at the SAGA-dependent promoters.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that Sgf73 is a component of the SAGA complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Sgf73p regulates SAGA recruitment, and is required for the assembly of PIC at the core promoters of the SAGA-dependent genes. However, formation of the PIC assembly at the core promoters is differentially regulated by histone H3 acetylation or Gcn5p-HAT activity of SAGA. Further, impairment of PIC formation in &#x00394;<italic>sgf73</italic> lowers histone H3 eviction from the SAGA-dependent promoters, and thus alters chromatin structure. These results provide valuable information on the functional role of yeast Sgf73p (and possibly human ataxin-7 or Sca7p) in regulation of gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Michael R.
