In fish, molecular mechanisms that control oocyte developmental competence remain poorly understood. In the past few years, transcriptomic investigations have been initiated to tentatively link oocyte transcriptome and oocyte developmental potential in order to identify key genes involved in the control of oocyte developmental competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While these types of approaches have been successful, information on the specific molecular mechanisms that make a good oocyte are still limited. One alternative way to fully understand the molecular mechanisms controlling oocyte quality is to study genes that are specifically or predominantly expressed in the oocyte. In mammals it has been shown that the so called "oocyte-specific" genes can affect folliculogenesis, fertilization and early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These genes have been extensively studied in mammals. Yet, very little information is available about those genes in fish despite the recent identification of ovarian-predominant genes in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The purpose of the present study was therefore to identify and characterize genes exhibiting a predominant oocyte expression in fish. Taking advantage of the numerous murine tissue-specific libraries available in public databases, we used an <italic>in silico </italic>approach to identify genes exhibiting an oocyte-predominant expression in rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>). Our study led to the identification and characterization of five previously uncharacterized rainbow trout cDNAs exhibiting an oocyte-specific, oocyte-predominant, or gonad-specific expression: zygote arrest 1 (<italic>zar1</italic>), v-mos Moloney murine sarcoma viral oncogene-like protein (<italic>mos</italic>), B-cell translocation gene (<italic>btg3</italic>), growth differentiation factor 9 (<italic>gdf9</italic>), and mutS homolog 4 (<italic>msh4</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Zygote Arrest 1 (zar1)</title><p>The nucleotide sequence of rainbow trout <italic>zar1 </italic>cDNA was 1195 bp in length (EU124662) and presumably encoded for a 333-aa protein.

In this species, zar1<sup>-/- </sup>mice are infertile as most of their embryos stop developing at one-cell stage. Since its discovery, Zar1 was characterized and its expression studied in several vertebrates species including mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Xenopus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. By contrast, available data in fish are scarce. Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and pufferfish (<italic>Fugu rubipres</italic>) <italic>zar1 </italic>sequences have been reported but no information is available on tissue or cellular expression of <italic>zar1 </italic>in any fish species. Similarly to what has been reported in all studied vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the rainbow trout zar1 sequence exhibits an atypical PHD motif (C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>13</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>1</sub>-C-X<sub>17</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The phylogenic analysis confirmed that the rainbow trout zar1 sequence was orthologous to the previously characterized vertebrate ZAR1 sequences including mouse Zar1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We also show, for the first time in any fish species, that rainbow trout <italic>zar1 </italic>is strongly expressed in the ovary whereas a limited expression is observed in metaphase II oocytes (unfertilized eggs). Within the ovary, the expression was limited to the ooplasm as demonstrated by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. A very low signal was also observed in testis whereas no detectable expression was seen in any other tissue. In agreement with the results reported here, <italic>Zar1 </italic>was shown to be expressed exclusively in the oocyte in chicken and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, expression in other tissues such as testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was also observed in various vertebrates species. In bovine, pig and human, the mRNA expression observed in the testis results from an alternative splicing of the <italic>ZAR1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Together, rainbow trout <italic>zar1 </italic>sequence and tissue expression are consistent with a role in oocyte/embryo development in fish that would be similar to what has been shown in the mouse. Further studies are needed to thoroughly explore any relationship between zar1 expression in the oocyte and the acquisition of oocyte developmental competence.</p></sec><sec><title>v-mos Moloney murine sarcoma viral oncogene-like protein (mos)</title><p>In the mouse oocyte, <italic>Mos </italic>encodes for a serine-threonine kinase involved in the maintenance of the meiotic arrest at metaphase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A disruption of <italic>Mos </italic>results in spontaneous parthenogenetic activation of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In Xenopus, mos has also long been implicated in the maintenance of the meiotic arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast, data on mos function and expression are extremely limited in fish. In the goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>), mos is also involved in the metaphase II arrest but does not participates in oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that rainbow trout <italic>mos </italic>mRNA is specifically expressed in the oocyte and not detected in any other tissue. Interestingly, <italic>mos </italic>mRNA is present in the unfertilized egg and is therefore maternally inherited. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available on the tissue distribution of the <italic>mos </italic>mRNA in fish. In several mammalian species, <italic>Mos </italic>mRNA was only found in embryos, ovary and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

While it is unknown if rainbow trout <italic>mos </italic>is expressed in the testis at other stages, its expression in the oocyte is consistent with existing data in higher vertebrates.

In this family, 6 different proteins have been characterized in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The phylogenetic analysis carried out in the present study clearly shows that we have identified the rainbow trout <italic>btg3 </italic>cDNA. The <italic>Btg3 </italic>gene was originally cloned in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and reported to be expressed in several cell lines and in a wide variety of murine and human adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Similarly, porcine <italic>Btg3 </italic>mRNA was detected in most tissues assayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>btg3 </italic>mRNA could be detected in many tissues at very low levels. However, a strong and predominant expression was monitored in the oocyte. Together, our observations are consistent with existing data in mammals. However the oocyte-predominant expression of <italic>BTG3 </italic>was never reported in any vertebrate species and a thorough expression analysis will be necessary in other vertebrate species. Interestingly, several studies have shown that BTG4, another BTG family member, was preferentially expressed in the chicken oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in bovine reproductive tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In fish, a recent transcriptomic study also revealed that <italic>btg4 </italic>was predominantly expressed in zebrafish ovarian tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the mouse, the 30 kDa protein encoded by the <italic>Btg3 </italic>gene was cell cycle-dependent and peaked at the end of the G1 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Overexpression of the human cognate protein resulted in an impaired serum-induced cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase in NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. More recently, in an attempt to study DNA damaged-induced genes, BTG3 was identified as a p53 target exhibiting an antiproliferative activity. Together, the predominant oocyte-expression of rainbow trout btg3 and the antiproliferative activity of the cognate protein in mammals suggest that btg3 could play an important role in oocyte development in fish. In addition, the presence of <italic>btg3 </italic>mRNA in the trout female gamete suggests a role for btg3 during early embryonic development, possibly in response to UV-induced DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth differentiation factor 9 (gdf9)</title><p><italic>Gdf9 </italic>is an oocyte-specific gene of the TGF beta superfamily involved in folliculogenesis. It participates in the successful transition from primary to secondary follicles and it was previously shown that <italic>Gdf9</italic>-null mice are sterile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In fish, gdf9 was very recently characterized in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and sea bass (<italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present study, the phylogenic analysis clearly showed that rainbow trout gdf9 was orthologous to those previously characterized gdf9 proteins in teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] despite the difficulty to construct a reliable phylogenetic tree among vertebrate species. Northern blot analysis showed an ovarian-specific expression of gdf9 in sea bass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similarly, semi quantitative PCR showed a gdf9 expression in zebrafish oocyte and testis, and possibly a weak signal in follicular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the present study, we clearly showed using real-time PCR and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization that rainbow trout <italic>gdf9 </italic>is exclusively expressed in the oocyte. Interestingly, significant levels of <italic>gdf9 </italic>mRNA were detected in the unfertilized egg, thus demonstrating that <italic>gdf9 </italic>is maternally inherited in rainbow trout. This observation is supported by semi-quantitative PCR data in zebrafish showing strong mRNA levels at early blastula stage and sharp decrease during gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While data on <italic>gdf9 </italic>in fish are scarce, the observed expression patterns are consistent with existing data in mammals. However, the functions of gdf9 in fish, including a possible role during early development, remain currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>mutS homolog 4 (msh4)</title><p>mutS homolog 4 (MSH4) is a meiosis-specific gene belonging to the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. In yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) MSH4 is required for reciprocal recombination and proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In humans, MSH4 protein is only found in testis and ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In mice, Msh4 plays an essential role in the control of meiotic recombination and a disruption of this gene leads to male and female sterility due to meiotic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In fish, very little is known about msh4. To date, msh4 cDNA and protein sequences were never characterized from any fish species and only sequences automatically predicted from zebrafish and tetraodon genomes are available. In rainbow trout, in agreement with existing data in mammals, the tissue distribution study shows a gonad-specific expression pattern and a strong testicular expression. In addition, high expression levels were found in the late vitellogenic ovary, immediately prior to meiosis resumption. Based on existing data in yeast and mammals, it can be speculated that msh4 plays an important role in meiosis in fish. However, the msh4 mRNA is also detected in metaphase II oocytes at low levels. This indicates that <italic>msh4 </italic>mRNA is maternally inherited and could thus participate in early development, possibly through DNA mismatch repair functions. Further investigations are needed to study the expression of msh4 in fish and characterize its participation in oocyte and embryo development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using an in silico analysis, we have successfully identified 5 previously uncharacterized rainbow trout cDNAs exhibiting an oocyte-specific, gonad-specific, or oocyte-predominant expression. Among those 5 genes, 3 had never been characterized in any fish species. In addition, we report the oocyte-predominant expression of btg3 for the first time in any vertebrate species. Finally, expression patterns of those 5 genes in fish and the functions of their orthologs in higher vertebrates strongly suggest that they might play an important role in fish oocyte development, meiotic arrest and early embryonic development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>In silico identification of candidate genes specifically expressed in the oocyte</title><p>A differential digital display (DDD) analysis was previously performed with mouse ESTs providing a list of murine oocyte-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Cognate rainbow trout expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were subsequently identified using a reciprocal blast search strategy. A tblastX search was performed against all rainbow trout expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in dbEST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] using oocyte-specific mouse sequences identified <italic>in silico</italic>. The corresponding clones were obtained from INRA-Agenae program resource center (Jouy-en-Josas, France) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and fully sequenced in both directions using the dye-termination method (ABI PRISM 310, PE Biosystems). The deduced amino acid sequence was used for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Alternatively, the amino acid sequence was deduced from rainbow trout ESTs belonging to the same UniGene cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the phylogenomic analysis pipeline available in the FIGENIX platform <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/evol/figenix/"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. FIGENIX retrieved sequences, provided multiple sequence alignments, performed phylogenetic reconstruction, and deduced orthology and paralogy relationships (for a detailed description of pipelines and models used, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). For each studied gene, the protein sequence was entered in the phylogenomic inference task, which was run with the default parameters and with Ensembl database (release 49) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We chose the NJ (neighbor joining) topology for the graphical representation. The trees (npl) are the fusion of three phylogenetic trees built based on neighbor joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The Dayhoff PAM matrix provided the distance matrix for the NJ method. The evolutionary distance separating sequences is defined as the number of mutational events per site underlying the evolutionary history separating sequences. Thus, evolutionary relations among sequences are represented by the tree structure, where branch length represents the evolutionary distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, evolutionary relations among sequences are represented by the tree structure, where branch length represents the evolutionary distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In phylogenetic tree, bootstrap values are reported on each node for each npl method. Bootstrapping was carried out with 1000 replications.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue collection and RNA extraction</title><p>Investigations were conducted according to the guiding principles for the use and care of laboratory animals and in compliance with French and European regulations on animal welfare. Rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) in their first reproductive season were obtained from an experimental fish farm (PEIMA, Sizun, France). Fish were deeply anaesthetized in 2-phenoxyethanol (10 mg/ml of water), killed by a blow on the head and bled by gill arch section. Tissues were sampled from 3 ovulated females. Testis samples were obtained from 3 different males at stage II of spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For RNA extraction, tissues were homogenized in Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) at a ratio of 100 mg per ml of reagent and total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's instruction. For in situ hybridization, ovarian tissue was sampled from an ovulated female, fixed in Dietrick's fixative (10% Formaldehyde, 28. 5% ethanol, 2% glacial acetic acid) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, rinsed in tap water for 1 hour and held in 50% ethanol until further processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Real-time PCR was performed using an I-Cycler IQ (Biorad, Hercules, CA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Reverse transcription products were diluted to 1/50 and 5 &#x003bc;l were used for each real-time PCR reaction. Triplicates were run for each RT product. Real-time PCR was performed using a real-time PCR kit provided with a SYBR Green fluorophore (Eurogentec, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 600 nM of each primer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). After a 2 min incubation step at 50&#x000b0;C and a 10 min incubation step at 95&#x000b0;C, the amplification was performed using the following cycle: 95&#x000b0;C, 20 sec; 62&#x000b0;C, 1 min, 40 times. The relative abundance of target cDNA within sample set was calculated from a serially diluted ovarian cDNA pool using the I-Cycler IQ software. Subsequently, real-time PCR data were normalized using 18S transcript abundance. After amplification, a fusion curve was obtained in order to ensure that a single PCR product had been generated using the following protocol: 10 sec holding followed by a 0.5&#x000b0;C increase, repeated 80 times and starting at 55&#x000b0;C.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Real-time PCR primers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Name</td><td align="center">Acc #</td><td align="center">Forward primer</td><td align="center">Reverse primer</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><italic>zar1</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU124662">EU124662</ext-link></td><td align="center">GAACGAGCAAGGTCTACTTCAAG</td><td align="center">GCAAGTCTGGCAGGTGATGTC</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>mos</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU276588">EU276588</ext-link></td><td align="center">GGCGACAGGCAATATGTTTT</td><td align="center">CACTTGGACACAATGGATCG</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>gdf9</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU723245">EU723245</ext-link></td><td align="center">ACGAGCGACTGTGCTTTGTAC</td><td align="center">AATGATCCAATGGCTCAGTT</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>btg3</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU723246">EU723246</ext-link></td><td align="center">AGAGGAGGTGTGCTGCAGAT</td><td align="center">CGTCTGAGGAGGAACAGGAG</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>msh4</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU723247">EU723247</ext-link></td><td align="center">TCTGTCTGCGAATTCCTCCT</td><td align="center">ACCTCCATGTGCTGGTTTTC</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>18S</italic></td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF308735"/></td><td align="center">CGGAGGTTCGAAGACGATCA</td><td align="center">TCGCTAGTTGGCATCGTTTAT</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>For all studied genes the GenBank accession number of the rainbow trout cDNA and the sequence of the primers used for the real-time PCR study are shown</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Dehydration (increasing ethanol: 15 min in 50% ethanol, twice 15 min in 70% ethanol, 15 min in 80% ethanol, 30 min in 96% ethanol, and 30 min in 96% ethanol/butanol vol/vol), clearing (butanol once for 30 min, and twice for 3 h each), and paraffin infiltration (once for 1 h and twice for 2 h, at 60&#x000b0;C) were performed in a Citadel 1000 tissue processor (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA).
