It is the most severe form of systemic TB because of its high mortality rate and possible serious neurological complications. In the CNS, where the function of neurons is protected by the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], infection with Mtb leads to catastrophic, inflammatory tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are currently unknown. Unlike pulmonary TB, which has been intensively investigated in numerous clinical trials, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of CNS-TB have received little attention. A better understanding of CNS-TB pathogenesis is urgently required to improve existing therapies, which still leave over half of those affected dead or paralyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The CNS-resident macrophages, microglia, are productively infected with Mtb and may be the principal cellular target in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Activated microglia release a number of cytokines/chemokines that contribute to both defense against and the neuropathogenesis of CNS infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Upon activation, microglia produce and secrete potentially neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, interleukin (IL)-1 &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Both TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; have been found at increased concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with CNS-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Upon mycobacterial infection, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in promoting anti-mycobacterial activity and the production of immune effector molecules, including TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also function as second messengers to regulate several downstream signaling molecules, including MAPKs or the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>ROS are produced in mammalian cells in response to the activation of various cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In brain-resident immune cells, the generation of free radicals plays important roles in anti-microbial defense as well as in pro-inflammatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway initiates an intracellular ROS signaling pathway that amplifies the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Intracellular ROS mediate &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide-induced microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, microglia-mediated neurotoxicity is influenced by the release of microglial NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Previous studies indicate that p47phox, an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, is required for superoxide anion release from microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To date, the roles of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS and the intracellular regulatory mechanisms by which these pro-inflammatory responses are induced in microglial cells during mycobacterial infection are poorly understood.</p><p>Activated microglia express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], CD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and mannose receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. TLRs play an important role in the activation of immune cells by pathogens such as Mtb. Receptors other than TLRs, including C-type lectins, are also involved in mediating host responses to Mtb. Recently, Yadav <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] reported that the &#x003b2;-glucan receptor dectin-1 works with TLR2 to mediate <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-induced pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages. To date, no attempt has been made to identify the specific mycobacterial antigens that interact with specific TLRs or other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) in microglia. To better understand the Mtb-induced molecular signaling pathways in microglia, we selected BV-2 cell lines that retain the characteristics of activated microglial cells, and we confirmed our results in murine primary mixed glial cells. We investigated the role of ROS and MAPK signaling in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in response to sonicated Mtb (s-Mtb). We found that s-Mtb activates inflammatory mediators in microglial cells and primary mixed glial cells through NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS generation. In addition, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling is essential for the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, and IL-12p40 in s-Mtb-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, we investigated the potential roles of PRRs, such as TLR2 and dectin-1, in microglial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Murine mixed glial cells, and cell lines</title><p>Mice with a targeted deletion in the <italic>TLR2 </italic>gene (homozygous mice and their homozygous litter mates) were kindly provided by Dr. S.

We examined whether s-Mtb stimulation caused ROS generation in murine microglial BV-2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and primary mixed glial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) using the oxidative fluorescent dyes H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA and DHE to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and superoxide production, respectively. LPS treatment activated ROS generation in microglia. The chemiluminescent signal intensities attributable to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and superoxide production increased markedly in BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with s-Mtb within 30 min (data not shown). The antioxidant NAC and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI significantly attenuated s-Mtb-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and superoxide production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated whether ERK1/2 or p38 is activated in response to s-Mtb in BV-2 microglial or primary mixed glial cells. LPS induced p38 phosphorylation within 60 min of treatment. However, LPS did not stimulate ERK1/2 activation in BV-2 cells, indicating that ERK1/2 activation is not involved in LPS action in this cell type, which is consistent with previous finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. S-Mtb stimulation activated both ERK1/2 and p38 in BV-2 cells. S-Mtb induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 within 5 min, and peak activity was observed after 15 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Similarly, s-Mtb induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in primary cultures of mixed glial cells.

We also demonstrated that LPS stimulates the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-12p40 in murine BV-2 cells and in primary cultures of mixed glial cells, which is consistent with previous studies using primary cultures of human, murine, and rat microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In contrast, very little research has been conducted regarding the mechanisms of recognition and intracellular signaling that induce the initial immune response to Mtb in microglia. In this study, we prepared non-infective Mtb lysates, as described previously by Netea <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and used them throughout the study. We found that s-Mtb strongly activated the inflammatory response and ROS generation in BV-2 microglial cell lines, as in those infected with live Mtb (data not shown). In addition, the astrocyte-enriched cultures did not play a major role in the s-Mtb-induced cytokine production and ROS generation by primary mixed glial cells. These findings are supported by previous findings that the tubercle bacillus preferentially infects human microglia, rather than astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Because IL-1&#x003b2; affected the ROS generation from astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and because it might be released by activated microglia, we examined whether IL-1&#x003b2; affects the s-Mtb-induced ROS production by primary mixed glial cells.

However, growing evidence suggests that inflammatory responses in the brain lead to tissue destruction in the distinct immunological setting of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Roles for Mtb-induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in CNS-TB have been suggested because dexamethasone treatment suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in Mtb-infected human microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It may explain the beneficial effects of this adjunctive therapy with steroids on the outcome of TB meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies by Harris <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] showed that treating human astrocytes with conditioned medium from Mtb-infected monocytes significantly up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9, which suggests that Mtb may increase the activity of tissue-destructive matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, pro-inflammatory mediators or tissue-destructive enzymes could contribute to the neurological damage observed in CNS-TB.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that the activation of p47phox and MAPK is mutually dependent on inflammatory signaling in s-Mtb-stimulated microglia. The results indicate that ROS formation occurs immediately after s-Mtb stimulation and that ROS act as signaling molecules in MAPK activation and subsequent processes. Possible redox-dependent signaling leading to MAPK activation includes the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inactivation of phosphatase and the deletion of the tensin homologue on chromosome 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition, ROS mediate calcium release, as all three MAPKs are downstream of calcium-dependent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These studies and our data suggest that the NADPH oxidase-derived ROS operate upstream of MAPKs. In addition, the data demonstrate that MAPK activation is required for the phosphorylation of p47phox and ROS production in microglial cells. The phosphorylation of p47phox at several serine residues within the polybasic region of the protein is an essential step in the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

Taken together, the crosstalk between p47phox and MAPK activation may play a pivotal role in the induction of ROS-dependent inflammatory responses by microglial cells.</p><p>Although they play different roles, both IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1; are critical factors in the defense against mycobacteria. IL-12 is crucial for the differentiation of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Because mycobacteria are strong inducers of IL-12, mycobacterial infection can skew the response to a secondary antigen toward the Th1 phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that Mtb-induced IL-12 (p40 and p35) expression is negatively regulated by ERK1/2 signaling, whereas TNF-&#x003b1; is induced by ERK1/2 at both the transcriptional and translational levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, we found that IL-12p40 was negatively regulated by p38, but not by ERK1/2. This is inconsistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] showing that ERK1/2 suppresses the production of IL-12, whereas p38 promotes IL-12 production. This discrepancy may be the result of the differences between microglia and MDMs. Our results strongly suggest that macrophages and microglia have distinct regulatory machinery for the modulation of IL-12 proteins. Additional studies are required to clarify the precise regulatory mechanism of IL-12 production and its role in microglia.</p><p>It is important to identify the PRR that triggers microglial activation after Mtb stimulation.

In addition, it has been suggested that the soluble, heat-stable mycobacterial fraction signals mainly through TLR2, whereas the heat-labile components signal through TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. However, we showed that live, sonicated, or heated Mtb elicited robust amounts of cytokines in TLR2 knockout mixed glial cells, indicating that TLR2 is not essential for activation of the pro-inflammatory response. Our data also demonstrate that s-Mtb-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in microglia was not dependent on dectin-1. These results are partly consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showing that TNF-&#x003b1; production in response to virulent <italic>M. avium </italic>724 and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv was not dependent on dectin-1 in macrophages, although dectin-1 was required for TNF-&#x003b1; secretion in macrophages infected with <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>and other avirulent mycobacterial strains. Therefore, s-Mtb may be recognized through other PRRs or an as yet uncharacterized signaling pathway. To understand the neuropathogenesis of CNS-TB infection, additional studies are required to identify the PRRs that detect pathogen-derived molecules and lead to the development of both innate and adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results provide important insight into microglial biology. First, s-Mtb is a potent inducer of ROS generation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and MAPK signaling. Second, intracellular ROS play an essential role in the regulation of s-Mtb-activated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in murine microglia, which is mediated via MAPK activation. Our data also emphasize the key roles of crosstalk between p47phox and MAPK activation in the pro-inflammatory response to s-Mtb in microglia.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BLP: Bacterial lipopeptide</p><p>CNS: Central nervous system</p><p>DHE: Dihydroethidium</p><p>DPI: Diphenyleneiodium</p><p>ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p><p>ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA: 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate</p><p>IL: Interleukin</p><p>LPS: Lipopolysaccharide</p><p>MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases</p><p>Mtb: <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>NAC:<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-cysteine</p><p>NF&#x003ba;B: Nuclear factor kappa B</p><p>PCR: Polymerase chain reaction</p><p>PGN: Peptidoglycan</p><p>ROS: Reactive oxygen species</p><p>PRR: Pattern-recognition receptor</p><p>RT: Reverse transcription</p><p>TB: Tuberculosis</p><p>TLR: Toll-like receptor</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CSY and HML performed the experiments on mouse primary mixed glial cells (cell cultures, ELISA, Western analysis) was involved in experimental design and interpretation of data, and reviewed the manuscript.
