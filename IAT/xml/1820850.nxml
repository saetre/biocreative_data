This block is dependent on the Mad2 checkpoint protein. Double mutant and inhibitor analyses revealed that Dis3 is required for correct kinetochore formation and function, and that this activity is monitored by the Mad2 checkpoint. Dis3 is a member of the highly conserved RNase II family and is known to be an essential subunit of the exosome complex. The <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutation was found to alter the RNaseII domain of Dis3, which caused a reduction in ribonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Moreover, Dis3 was suggested to contribute to kinetochore formation through an involvement in heterochromatic silencing at both outer centromeric repeats and within the central core region. This activity is likely monitored by the mitotic checkpoint, and distinct from that of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation directly targeting outer centromeric repeats.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis is an essential event for proper cell multiplication. A large number of the genes required for different aspects of chromosome segregation have been identified. This includes genes encoding proteins implicated in centromere/kinetochore structure and function, sister chromatid cohesion, and chromosome condensation, together with proteins required for the spindle assembly checkpoint, activation of APC (anaphase promoting complex)/C (cyclosome) for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, and for anaphase promoting proteolysis that leads to the destruction of securin and the activation of separase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Yanagida1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, various protein kinases such as Cdc2, polo and aurora and related protein phosphatases are implicated in mitotic control. These essential genes for chromosome segregation are conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms.</p><p>A series of fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cold sensitive mutants have been previously isolated that showed severe defects in sister chromatid separation at 20&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Ohkura1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. These mutants, termed <italic>dis1, dis2</italic>, and <italic>dis3 (<underline>d</underline>efective <underline>i</underline>n <underline>s</underline>ister chromatid disjoining)</italic>, also contain hyper-condensed chromosomes at the restrictive temperature. Dis1 is a microtubule binding protein that is required for the proper attachment of kinetochore microtubules to the kinetochores, and is localized at the kinetochore specifically during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Nabeshima1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Nakaseko1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Dis1 is also the founding member of the Dis1-XMAP215-chTOG family of microtubule-associating proteins that are universally present in eukaryotes. Dis2 is one of the two catalytic subunits (Dis2, Sds21) of Type 1 protein phosphatase PP1. The <italic>dis2-11</italic> mutation is semi-dominant and blocks sister chromatid separation at the restrictive temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Ohkura2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Both Dis1 and Dis2 proteins are phosphorylated and their activities are regulated by Cdc2 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Yamano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Aoki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Cdc2 down regulates the phosphatase activity of Dis2 and up regulates the kinetochore localization of Dis1 by direct phosphorylation during mitosis.</p><p>Unlike Dis1 and Dis2, the role of Dis3 in proper kinetochore function or mitotic progression is not clear. Dis3 is a relatively large protein (110 kD) that includes the characteristic RNase II (RNB) domain, which is highly conserved in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase II contains a highly processive 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease activity, and eukaryotic Dis3 homologs (Rrp44 in budding yeast) were identified as a component of the exosome that is required for RNA maturation and turnover in both the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Houseley1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Rrp44/Dis3 is one of more than ten protein components in the exosome, which can act upon different RNA substrates including mRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, rRNA and tRNA. The structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase II was recently determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Frazao1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Zuo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and revealed that the active site in the RNB domain is composed of four Asp residues and one Arg residue in two respective motifs referred to as Motif I and Motif IV. Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion is chelated by the first and fourth asp residues in Motif I.</p><p>The human homologue of Dis3 was identified as an oncogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Lim1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with a potential role in chromosome segregation and/or mitotic progression. Human Dis3 is tightly bound to Ran a small G protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Shiomi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Fission yeast Ned1, a homologue of human disease gene product lipin, directly interacts with Dis3, Pim1/Rcc1 (GEF for Ran) and nuclear pore proteins, and is implicated in complex cellular functions including chromosome organization and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Tange1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The Dis3 protein is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm throughout the cell division cycle, and deletion of the <italic>dis3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> gene in fission yeast showed that it is essential for cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Kinoshita1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The mitotically arrested phenotype is thus specific to the <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant allele upon shifting to the restrictive temperature.</p><p>In order to determine how Dis3 contributes to mitotic progression, and more importantly, whether this represents a role for Dis3 ribonuclease in kinetochore formation/function, we have focused on the <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant of fission yeast. Here, we report that the <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutation resides in the Dis3 RNB domain, and that the mutant protein contains a reduced RNase activity. We show that the spindle-kinetochore interaction is abnormal in <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells and that this is associated with mitotic arrest at a pre-anaphase stage, which is dependent on the essential spindle assembly (mitotic) checkpoint protein, Mad2. We also show evidence that Dis3 is involved in a heterochromatic silencing process within the centromere.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Arrested <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells show an elongated metaphase-like spindle</title><p>Cold-sensitive <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells grown at 33&#x000b0;C were shifted to the restrictive temperature of 20&#x000b0;C and incubated for 4 hr to induce the nuclear division arrest phenotype. Arrested cells were fixed with methanol and the chromosomal DNA and microtubules were stained using DAPI and anti-tubulin antibodies, respectively.

Mutant cells expressing GFP-tubulin both at restrictive (20&#x000b0;C) and permissive (33&#x000b0;C) temperatures were examined using a confocal microscope system equipped with a temperature control unit. Time-lapse images of cells cultured at 20&#x000b0;C and 33&#x000b0;C were obtained (representative cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000317.s002">Movies S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000317.s003">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000317.s004">S3</xref>) and used for quantitative measurements of spindle lengths following initiation of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). At the restrictive temperature of 20&#x000b0;C, phase 1 (period of spindle formation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Nabeshima2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>) occurred normally in <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells with an initial spindle length of 2.5&#x02013;3.0 &#x000b5;m, however, the cells then appeared to remain in phase 2 (constant spindle length period; metaphase) as the spindle slowly reached a length of 4&#x02013;6 &#x000b5;m within 90 min. Phase 3 (spindle extension period; anaphase B) did not take place and the spindle often collapsed after prolonged incubation at 20&#x000b0;C (indicated by white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells grown at the permissive temperature (33&#x000b0;C) displayed normal spindle elongation and completed anaphase with a long anaphase B spindle within 30 min after entry into phase 1.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells cultured at 20&#x000b0;C were arrested at a pre-anaphase stage or following the switch to anaphase, the <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutation was combined with a chromosomally integrated copy of a GFP-tagged Cut2/securin gene under the control of its native promoter. Cut2/securin acts to prevent sister chromatid separation during metaphase and is degraded upon the triggering of anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Funabiki1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In wild-type cells, Cut2-GFP signals were associated with condensed chromosomes during metaphase and disappeared in all anaphase and post-anaphase cells. In contrast, <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells cultured at 20&#x000b0;C constantly showed intense Cut2-GFP signals that remained with the condensed chromosomes and did not disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This confirmed that anaphase (sister-chromatid separation) did not occur and <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells were indeed arrested at a pre-anaphase stage. Taken together, the above data indicates that a pre-anaphase spindle is produced in arrested <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells grown at the restrictive temperature, which remains present for 60&#x02013;80 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mitotic arrest of <italic>dis3-54</italic> involves the checkpoint protein Mad2</title><p>Correct progression through mitosis is essential for cell survival and it is therefore carefully monitored by several proteins that prevent completion of the mitotic cycle should a potentially lethal problem be encountered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Kim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Mad2 is known to restrain the mitotic progression by preventing the activation of ubiquitin-dependent anaphase promoting proteolysis. Although <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells were found to be arrested at a pre-anaphase stage, it was unclear whether this was due to the <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutation directly preventing sister chromatid separation, or due to <italic>dis3-54</italic> resulting in activation of the mitotic checkpoint to halt mitotic progression at the pre-anaphase stage.</p><p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first investigated the localization of two spindle assemble checkpoint proteins, Mad2 and Bub1, in wild-type and mutant cells using chromosomally integrated GFP-tagged versions of these genes driven by their native promoter. Intense kinetochore dot signals corresponding to Mad2-GFP were observed in most <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells arrested at 20&#x000b0;C, whereas such signals were only normally seen in a small number of wild-type mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similar results were also obtained from the analysis of Bub1-GFP. In wild-type cells, Bub1-GFP was only observed in early mitotic stages, however. Intense kinetochore localization of Bub1-GFP was observed in most of the arrested <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the observed presence and kinetochore localization of Mad2 was functionally contributing to the mitotic arrest in <italic>dis3-54</italic>, the mutant cells were crossed with a Mad2 deletion mutant (<italic>&#x00394;mad2</italic>). In striking contrast to that of single <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutants, the spindle was fully extended in the double mutant cultured at 20&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) and similar to that observed in wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Analysis of GFP-tagged Cut2/securin localization in the double mutant also revealed loss of Cut2 associated with the appearance of daughter nuclei following pre-anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). This was similar to that observed in wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and demonstrated that in the absence of Mad2, <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells are able to overcome the arrest at pre-anaphase and proceed to anaphase. Two daughter nuclei that were asymmetrical in size or lagging chromosomes were often observed in the <italic>dis3-54 &#x00394;mad2</italic> double mutant cells, suggesting that although the spindle was extending normally, chromosome segregation was unequal. In both fission yeast and animal cells, the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and Bub1 have been shown to be recruited to kinetochores that are not attached by kinetochore microtubules or in which the stable bipolar attachment is not established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Toyoda1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Garcia1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The above data strongly indicates that normal bipolar attachment between the kinetochore and spindle is impaired in <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells, and the resulting spindle checkpoint inhibits the metaphase/anaphase transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sister chromatid separation and abnormal segregation in <italic>dis3-54 &#x00394;mad2</italic></title><p>To investigate further whether sister chromatid separation could occur when the spindle checkpoint was compromised in <italic>dis3-54</italic> cells, the nuclear phenotype of both single <italic>dis3-54</italic> and double <italic>dis3-54 &#x00394;mad2</italic> mutants was examined over an extended time period following shift to the restrictive 20&#x000b0;C temperature. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g004">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, almost all single mutant cells contained the typical <italic>dis</italic>-like pre-anaphase nuclei (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, the proportion of cells with the &#x0201c;asymmetrical daughter nuclei&#x0201d; phenotype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g003">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) greatly increased in the double mutant cells and approximately 60&#x00025; of the double mutant cells showed the asymmetrical nuclei phenotype by 4 hr after the shift to 20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To directly observe how the sister centromeres were segregating in individual <italic>dis3-54</italic> and double <italic>dis3-54 &#x00394;mad2</italic> mutant cells, we crossed these mutants with a strain that expresses LacI-GFP and contains lacO repeats integrated at the <italic>lys1</italic> locus that is close to the centromere of chromosome 1 (<italic>cen1</italic>-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Nabeshima2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>).

On the other hand, one or two <italic>cen1</italic>-GFP spots on the single pair of condensed chromosomes could be observed in the single <italic>dis3-54</italic> mutant cells arrested at 20&#x000b0;C, consistent with the notion that they were arrested at a metaphase-like stage. In the double mutant <italic>dis3-54 &#x00394;mad2</italic> cells, however, approximately 55&#x00025; of anaphase cells showed the two segregated spots as seen in wild-type. The remaining double mutant cells contained two closely situated spots within the same daughter nucleus, suggesting that the sister chromatids had separated but did not move to opposite nuclei. This data indicates that although sister chromatid separation occurred in the double mutant upon loss of the mitotic checkpoint, chromosome segregation towards the opposite poles became abnormal, possibly due to lack of bi-orientation in paired sister centromeres that then moved to the poles in an apparently random fashion and caused the high frequency of unequal segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Hypersensitivity to a microtubule poison</title><p>Fission yeast mutants defective in kinetochore-microtubule attachment are usually hypersensitive to microtubule destabilizing drugs such as thiabendazole, TBZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Toyoda1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Umesono1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Kadura1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

This phenotype is similar to that in <italic>alp5-1134</italic>, a histone acetyltransferase component mutant, which was reported to be required for silencing at the central core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Minoda1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>alp5-1134</italic> mutant also causes a chromosome segregation defect that results in activation of spindle checkpoint in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Minoda1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Like the Alp5 protein, Dis3 may have an important function in silencing at core centromere to ensure the faithful kinetochore function, but not in the maintenance of the structure itself.</p><p>Centromeric transcripts derived from outer centromeric repeats are known to be processed by the RNAi machinery to mediate heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Volpe1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Motamedi1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was shown that heterochromatin spreading and silencing of reporter genes neighboring outer centromeric repeats requires an endonucleolytic cleavage (slicing) activity by the Ago1 RNAi component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Irvine1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Significantly, the cleavage products resulting from wild-type Ago1 slicing activity accumulated in mutants that lacked the Rrp6 nuclear-specific exosome subunit, indicating that the nuclear exosome is involved in processing these transcripts. In the absence of Ago1 slicing activity, heterochromatin structure was only slightly reduced at the outer centromeric repeats, whereas silencing of the <italic>otr::ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> reporter gene was lost. This is similar to the phenotype observed here for <italic>dis3-54</italic>. The Dis3 subunit was also recently shown to be responsible for core exosome activity and to have a nuclear function that partially overlaps with Rrp6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000317-Dziembowski1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus highly likely that Dis3 also processes centromeric transcripts, possibly even those cleaved by the Ago1 protein. Although further study is required, the above data support a hypothesis that the Dis3 activity is involved in a heterochromatin silencing process that may be linked to its role in the formation of a function kinetochore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000317-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains and culture media</title><p>Culture media used was YPD (1&#x00025; yeast extract, 2&#x00025;polypeptone, and 2&#x00025; glucose).

Synthetic defects were observed at semi-permissive temperatures for the double mutants as indicated. (B) One model for the role of Dis3 in correct kinetochore formation and function. Dis3 exosome activity is involved in heterochromatin silencing at regions neighbouring centromeric repeats, possibly processing transcripts cleaved by Ago1. This processing mechanism would also be important for establishment of a functional kinetochore and microtubule attachment. Dis3 activity (either directly or indirectly) is then monitored as a key step by the mitotic checkpoint, preventing serious errors in the absence of correct kinetochore formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000317.g008"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work was supported by a Specially Promoted Center of Excellence (COE) grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to M.Y., a Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) research grant from the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST) to M.Y., and a grant from the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM067014) to R.M.
