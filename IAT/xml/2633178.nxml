However, the mechanisms for aldosterone-induced TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression have not been clearly determined in mesangial cells. We examined the role of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the aldosterone-induced TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression in rat mesangial cells. TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> protein in the conditioned medium released from rat mesangial cells was measured by sandwich ELISA, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting, AP-1 DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA and the ERK1/2, JNK activity was analyzed by western blotting. Aldosterone significantly stimulated TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> protein production and TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> mRNA expression in mesangial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Aldosterone significantly increased AP-1 DNA binding activity in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with AP-1 inhibitor, curcumin, blocked aldosterone-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity as well as aldosterone-induced TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> production. Aldosterone increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, or JNK inhibitor, SP600125 significantly inhibited aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 and JNK activity and subsequently TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> production, respectively.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have shown efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease as well as in decreasing proteinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Recently, emerging and convincing evidences have shown the independent role of aldosterone in the progression of renal disease. In the remnant kidney model using rat, aldosterone induced proteinuria, hypertension and glomerulosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, inhibition of aldosterone by spironolactone not only slowed the development of glomerulosclerosis, but also induced the regression of existing glomerulosclerosis in the same model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Aldosterone infusion developed malignant nephrosclerosis in saline-drinking stroke-prone hypertensive rats, independent of the effects of blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and induced severe inflammation and fibrosis by macrophage infiltration and cytokine up-regulation in saline-drinking rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The role of TGF-&#x003b2; in the aldosterone-induced renal injury has been suggested in animal models of various renal diseases. In a rat model of chronic cyclosporine A (CsA) nephrotoxicity, spironolactone treatment reduced arteriolopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis by prevention of CsA-induced up-regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;, collagen I and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and also prevented the progression of renal injury in preexisting chronic CsA nephrotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Aldosterone also played a role in diabetic renal injury, which was demonstrated by increasing glomerular and tubulointerstitial macrophage infiltration, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and TGF-&#x003b2; expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and by increasing renal tissue and urinary levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 as well as renal macrophage infiltration in type 2 diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Juknevicius and colleagues demonstrated that aldosterone infusion for 3 days in normal rats increased urinary TGF-&#x003b2; excretion without changes in blood pressure or evidence of kidney damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The renal protective effects of inhibiting aldosterone were also demonstrated in chronic kidney disease patients. In a prospective randomized open-label study, spironolactone treatment for 1 yr in patients with chronic kidney disease already treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists significantly decreased proteinuria without any change in glomerular filtration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Similar results were observed in another clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Putting these results from various experimental studies together, it is positive that aldosterone stimulates renal TGF-&#x003b2; expression in the course of progressive renal injury. Recently, Han et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) described the aldosterone stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity and subsequently monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in mesangial cells. However, it has not been clearly determined if aldosterone-induced TGF-&#x003b2; expression was mediated through the extracellular-signal regulated-kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways in mesangial cells.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), transfection of mesangial cells with AP-1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides strongly inhibited high glucose- and angiotensin II-induced TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression. In addition, administration of AP-1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides into streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat kidney using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome method also abolished TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression.</p><p>c-Jun contains a docking site for the JNK, which phosphorylate serines 63 and 73, thereby enhancing its transcriptional potential and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Activation of JNK results in greatly enhanced c-Jun transcriptional activity and induction of the AP-1 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Most cells express two JNK isoforms, 45 kDa and 54 kDa in size and termed JNK1 and JNK2, which are highly similar in their modes of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In our study, aldosterone rapidly induced phosphorylation of JNK and spironolactone abolished aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of JNK. In addition, both JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and spironolactone suppressed aldosterone-induced TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> production, suggesting that blocking JNK activation contributed to the inhibition of c-jun/AP-1 activation, and finally TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression.</p><p>In our study, aldosterone rapidly stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation which led to subsequent increase in the TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> production. Aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 activation has been demonstrated in different in vitro and in vivo studies. Aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 activation has been shown to stimulate collagen gene expression and synthesis in renal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) to induce mesangial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and to increase mytogenic response synergistically with angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, a direct relationship between ERK1/2 activation and TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> up-regulation in mesangial cells has not been clearly determined. In an animal study using aldosterone/salt-induced hypertensive rats, chronic administration of spironolactone inhibited ERK1/2 activity and suppressed expression of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, type I and III collagen, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA, which resulted in the amelioration of perivascular fibrosis and coronary microvascular hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, a direct relationship between ERK1/2 activation and TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> up-regulation was not confirmed in that study. Recently, the role for ERK1/2 in the stimulation of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression was demonstrated in two different cells. In a study done by Huang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), renin induced rapid activation of cellular ERK1/2 in rat mesangial cells and an ERK kinase inhibitor significantly reduced the renin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> mRNA expression. Otsuka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) has reported that liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine activated ERK which led to the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> in macrophages.</p><p>In summary, our data provide an evidence that aldosterone stimulates TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression in rat mesangial cells partly by enhancing ERK1/2 and JNK activities and subsequent AP-1 activity. This study also provides an understanding of a part of intracellular mechanisms for proliferative and fibrotic effect of aldosterone in the inflammatory renal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
