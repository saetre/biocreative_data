In accordance, substantial levels of prM antibodies are found in sera of infected humans. Furthermore, it has been recently described that the rates of prM antibody responses are significantly higher in patients with secondary infection compared to those with primary infection. This suggests that immature dengue virus may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, however, numerous functional studies have revealed that immature particles lack the ability to infect cells. In this report, we show that fully immature dengue particles become highly infectious upon interaction with prM antibodies. We demonstrate that prM antibodies facilitate efficient binding and cell entry of immature particles into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. In addition, enzymatic activity of furin is critical to render the internalized immature virus infectious. Together, these data suggest that during a secondary infection or primary infection of infants born to dengue-immune mothers, immature particles have the potential to be highly infectious and hence may contribute to the development of severe disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue virus represents a major emerging arboviral pathogen circulating in the (sub)tropical regions of the world, putting 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Each of the four circulating serotypes can cause disease ranging from febrile illness to devastating manifestations including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Severe illness is observed in individuals experiencing a re-infection with a heterologous dengue virus serotype and in infants born to dengue-immune mothers, presumably due to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that patients experiencing a secondary infection have elevated levels of antibodies directed against the prM protein of immature dengue virus particles. Although it is known that cells infected with dengue virus release substantial amounts of prM-containing virions, numerous functional studies have demonstrated that immature particles lack the ability to infect cells. Herein, we show that essentially non-infectious fully immature dengue virions become virtually as infectious as wild type virus particles in the presence of prM antibodies. Anti-prM antibodies facilitate efficient binding and entry of immature dengue virus into cells carrying Fc-receptors. Furthermore, furin activity in target cells is critical for triggering infectivity of immature virus.

There are four distinct serotypes of DENV which, according to WHO estimates, infect about 50-100 million individuals annually, mostly in the (sub)tropical regions of the world. While most DENV infections are asymptomatic or result in self-limited dengue fever (DF), an increasing number of patients present more severe, potentially fatal clinical manifestations, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is well established that a major risk factor for the development of DHF/DSS is secondary infection with a heterotypic virus serotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Halstead1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Vaughn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The molecular mechanisms by which antibodies enhance DENV infection however remain elusive.</p><p>DENV, as well as other major human pathogens like West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) belong to the Flavivirus genus within the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Flaviviruses enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fuse from within acidic endosomes, through which the viral genome gains access to the target cell cytoplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-vanderSchaar1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Following RNA replication and protein translation, immature virions, which contain heterodimers of the transmembrane proteins E and a precursor form of M (prM), are assembled within the ER. Subsequently, the particles mature by passing through the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Mackenzie1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the acidic environment of the TGN, the virion undergoes a conformational change and the cellular endoprotease furin cleaves prM into M and a peptide (&#x0201c;pr&#x0201d;) that remains associated with the virion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Yu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon release, the pr peptide dissociates from the virion, resulting in the formation of mature progeny virions.</p><p>Cells infected with DENV secrete high levels (&#x0223c;30&#x00025;) of prM-containing immature particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-vanderSchaar2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Zybert1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that cleavage of prM to M is not efficient. These DENV particles are released from infected cells as fully immature prM-containing particles and partially immature particles containing both prM and M proteins in the viral membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Cherrier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Extensive functional analyses have revealed that fully immature flaviviruses lack the ability to infect cells, as the presence of uncleaved prM in the virion blocks the E glycoprotein from undergoing the pH-induced conformational changes that are required for membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Zybert1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Elshuber1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Stadler1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Although immature particles are therefore generally considered as irrelevant by-products of infected cells, the rates of prM antibody responses are significantly higher in patients with secondary infection compared to those with primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Lai1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is thus quite puzzling if indeed the presence of prM obstructs DENV infectivity, how immature particles contribute to disease pathogenesis and what role do anti-prM antibodies play in the enhancement of infection?

First, the binding of immature virions to K562 cells was determined by quantitative-PCR. In order to determine the number of bound GCP per cell, the amount of virus added per cell was increased 10-fold compared to the concentration used in the infectivity experiments. The results show that antibody-opsonized immature DENV binds approximately 30-fold more efficiently to cells than immature particles in the absence of antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000718-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Indeed, immature particles opsonized with anti-prM bound almost as efficiently to cells as wild-type DENV in the absence of antibody. Moreover, immature DENV particles failed to interact efficiently with baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-15), cells which are highly permissive for dengue infection (data not shown) suggesting that the observed lack of infectivity is partially related to the poor binding efficiency of immature particles to cells. It is likely that binding of virus-antibody complexes is mediated by direct interaction of the antibody with the Fc-receptor expressed on the cell surface. Indeed, treatment of cells with an anti-CD32 antibody to block Fc&#x003b3;II-receptor interaction, or opsonization of particles with mAb70-21 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragments severely reduced virus particle production upon infection of K562 cells with opsonized immature virions, whereas it had no effect on infection with wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000718-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

One could speculate that anti-prM antibody bound to immature virions induces a conformational change that would enable the E protein to trigger membrane fusion irrespective of the presence of prM. Another scenario might be that prM-containing virions mature upon cell entry since furin, although predominantly present in the TGN, also shuttles between early endosomes and the cell surface. To verify the potential involvement of furin during virus cell entry, we investigated the infectious properties of antibody-opsonized immature DENV in cells treated with furin inhibitor, decanoyl-L-arginyl-L-valyl-L-lysyl-L-arginyl-chloromethylketone (decRRVKR-CMK).

Subsequently, DENVprM&#x00394;90 virus and wild-type DENV-2 16681 (generated from pD2/IC-30P) virus were produced by transfection of RNA transcripts derived from the cDNA plasmids into BHK-15 cells.

The presence of physical particles was further evaluated in three-layer ELISA experiments, by coating plates with a similar number of genome-containing DENVprM&#x00394;90 particles and LoVo-derived immature particles. Similar OD values were measured for DENVprM&#x00394;90 and LoVo-derived viruses (data not shown), which confirms the presence of physical particles and suggests that the number of genome-containing particles is accurately determined.

In this report, we show that the lack of infectivity of fully immature particles in the absence of antibodies is primarily related to inefficient binding of immature virions to the cell surface. If binding is facilitated through anti-prM antibodies, immature DENV particles become highly infectious presumably due to efficient intracellular processing of prM to M by the endoprotease furin.</p><p>Maturation upon entry has been previously reported for other enveloped viruses. Zhang and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Zhang2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> showed that the infectivity of immature particles of Semliki Forest virus, an alphavirus, can be triggered by furin during viral endocytosis. It is likely that DENV maturation also occurs within acidic endosomes, since previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have revealed that cleavage of immature particles by furin is dependent on the exposure of the virus to low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Zybert1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that the acidic conditions of the endosome, similar to those in the acidic TGN during processing of newly assembled virions, triggers an initial conformational change in the virion such that furin is able to cleave prM to M and the &#x0201c;pr&#x0201d; peptide. Interestingly, a recent report has shown that upon cleavage of prM a large fraction of pr peptide remains associated with the virion and that back-neutralization to pH 8.0 is required to release the pr peptide from the virion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Yu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors interpreted this as a mechanism preventing newly assembled cleaved virions from undergoing membrane fusion in the acidic TGN. However, this notion is difficult to reconcile with our present observations, since virions that have matured within acidic endosomes of target cells do not return to neutral-pH conditions before initiating infection. One may speculate that the pr peptide stabilizes the E protein to such an extent that it survives the mildly acidic lumen of the TGN (&#x0223c;pH 6.0), but is released at the more acidic pH of endosomes (&#x0223c;pH 5.0) such that the E proteins have the capacity to rearrange to their fusion-active conformation. Another possibility is that upon cleavage of prM the pr peptide associates with the prM antibody instead of the E protein, thereby enabling the E proteins to adopt the fusion-active conformation.</p><p>The observed infectious potential of immature DENV virions in the presence of anti-prM antibodies may have important implications for our understanding of the processes involved in dengue pathogenesis. We speculate that in the early stages of a primary infection, before the appearance of virus-specific antibodies, immature virions would fail to penetrate host cells and therefore are of minor significance in disease development. On the other hand, during a secondary infection or primary infection of infants born to dengue-immune mothers, immature particles may become highly infectious due to the presence of anti-prM antibodies and hence may contribute to an increased dengue-infected cell mass and a high circulating virus titer, one of the preludes for the development of severe disease symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Vaughn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Libraty1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000718-Wang2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, sera from 2 out of 7 patients significantly enhanced the infectious properties of immature particles. This suggests that individual patients develop different responses to prM. On the basis of these results, we believe that it is important to further investigate the antibody responses in DENV-infected patients and to unravel if patients with prM antibodies are more susceptible to develop severe disease.

Alternatively, K562 cells were pretreated with 25 &#x000b5;g/ml of anti-Fc&#x003b3;RII antibody (MCA1075PE, Serotec) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, after which access antibody was removed by extensive washing. In furin blockage experiments, cells were treated with 25 &#x000b5;M of furin-specific inhibitor, decanoyl-L-arginyl-L-valyl-L-lysyl-L-arginyl-chloromethylketone (decRRVKR-CMK) (Calbiochem) prior and during virus infection. In control sample for the decRRVKR-CMK activity, additional 25 &#x000b5;M of the inhibitor was added to ensure blockage of the progeny virus maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Binding assays</title><p>To determine the number of bound genome-containing particles per cell, virus or virus-antibody complexes were incubated with 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> K526 cells at MOG 1000 for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.
