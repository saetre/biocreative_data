Single oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers have been used to generate such fingerprints, with the same primer being present at the 5' end of both strands for every PCR product. We used three arbitrary oligos, individually and in pairs, to generate six different genomic fingerprints of the same mouse genomic DNAs. Fewer than half of the products in genomic fingerprints generated using the oligos in pairs were the same as those produced by AP-PCR using one of the three oligos alone. Thus, a few oligos could be used in a very large number of single and pairwise combinations, each producing a distinct AP-PCR fingerprint with the potential to identify new polymorphisms. For example, 50 oligos can be used in a matrix of pairwise combinations to produce 2,500 fingerprints, in which at least half the data can be expected to be unique to each pair. We demonstrate this principle by using two oligos, alone and together, to generate three sets of fingerprints and map thirteen polymorphisms in the C57BL/6J x DBA/2J set of recombinant inbred mice.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0165-a" xlink:role="5276"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0167-a" xlink:role="5278"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5275"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5276"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5277"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5278"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5279"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
