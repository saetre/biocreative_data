In addition to regulating MMP activity, TIMPs are also involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. In a series of initial studies, we determined that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity was present in protein extracts from early (4 days old, estrus = day 0), mid (10&#x02013;12 days old) and late (16 days old) CL (n = 3 for each stage). Reverse zymography revealed four metalloproteinase inhibitory protein bands with relative molecular masses that are consistent with those reported for TIMP-1 to -4. In order to gain a better understanding of TIMPs and their role in luteal function, we further characterized this inhibitory activity with a particular focus on the temporal and spatial expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the bovine CL. Northern blotting revealed that the TIMP-1 transcript (0.9 kb) was expressed at a higher (p &#x0003c; 0.05) level in early and mid cycle CL than in the late stage. In contrast, two TIMP-2 mRNA species, one major 1 kb species and one minor 3.5 kb species, were significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) increased in the mid and late cycle CL than in the early. Western blotting analyses demonstrated no differences in TIMP-1 (29 kDa) protein levels between early and mid stages, while its levels decreased (p &#x0003c; 0.05) from the mid to late stage CL. Conversely, TIMP-2 (22 kDa) protein was detected at a low level in the early CL, but significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) increased in the mid and late stages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both TIMP-1 and -2 were localized to large luteal cells from all three ages of CL. TIMP-1 was also localized in capillary smooth muscle cells, while TIMP-2 was restricted to the endothelial cells in the capillary compartment. In conclusion, the different temporal expression patterns of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 suggest that TIMP-1 may be important for luteal formation and development, while TIMP-2 may play significant roles during luteal development and maintenance. Furthermore, the distinct localization of these two inhibitors in the vascular compartment indicates that they may serve diverse physiological functions during different stages of luteal angiogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient, dynamic endocrine gland, which develops from the postovulatory follicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Dramatic structural and functional changes are associated with the development, maintenance and regression of the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These remodeling events require the participation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a growing family of zinc and calcium dependent proteolytic enzymes that collectively digest all known macromolecules constituting the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Generally, the catalytic activity of the MMPs is highly regulated at three levels, gene expression, proteolytic activation of latent proenzymes, and inhibition of activity by binding of endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to the catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Four TIMPs, TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], TIMP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and TIMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], have been identified. Among them, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are the two most studied inhibitors. TIMP-1, a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa, was the first member of this family to be cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. TIMP-1 can bind the active forms of all known MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the latent form of MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to suppressing the activity of MMPs, TIMP-1 also possesses mitogenic activity for a variety of cell types, such as gingival fibroblasts and erythroid precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TIMP-1 may regulate steroidogenesis in that it stimulates progesterone production by rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In CL from a variety of species, the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-1-like proteins and messenger RNA has been determined, including cow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>TIMP-2 is an unglycosylated protein with an approximate molecular mass of 22 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. TIMP-2 is also able to bind most active MMPs and inhibit their proteolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Among the members of the MMP family, TIMP-2 preferentially binds to MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Paradoxically, however, TIMP-2 may also be involved in pro-MMP-2 activation by participating in the formation of a membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP)/TIMP-2/pro-MMP-2 tri-molecular complex on the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Similar to TIMP-1, TIMP-2 stimulates proliferation of a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. TIMP-2 mRNA expression has been determined in the sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], cow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] CL, while a TIMP-2-like protein was detected in the cow CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The variety and intensity of events that occur over the CL life span suggest a tightly regulated temporal and spatial interplay between MMPs and TIMPs. Our previous studies demonstrated that remodeling of the bovine CL involves a variety of MMP species, for example, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP. In the present study, we determined TIMP inhibitory activity and profiled the coordinate mRNA and protein expression patterns and cellular distribution of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in early, mid, and late stages of the bovine CL obtained over the estrous cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal Model and Tissue Collection</title><p>Corpora lutea were collected from cyclic, nonlactating dairy cows, which were housed at the University of New Hampshire Dairy Teaching and Research Center. CL were removed by colpotomy on day 4, 10, and 16 of the estrous cycle (day 0 = estrus; n = 3 per day). For day 4 CL, the ovary was removed by an ecraseur after the cow received an epidural anesthetic [2% (w/v) mepivacaine hydrochloride; 0.01 mL/kg BW; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI], and the CL was then dissected from ovarian stroma. The day 10 and 16 CL were enucleated from the ovarian stroma. Based on progesterone concentrations determined by radioimmunoassay, the CL collected on day 16 of the estrous cycle were functionally active (8.99 &#x000b1; 1.84; ng/ml &#x000b1; SEM). The luteal tissue was subsequently used for total RNA and protein extraction. All animal experimentation protocols in the present study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of New Hampshire.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiometric MMP Assay</title><p>Total protein was extracted from luteal tissues in a lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 10 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin (Sigma, St Louis, MO), 1 &#x003bc;g/ml aminoethyl benzenesulphonyl fluoride (Sigma, St Louis, MO)] which we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Equivalent amounts of luteal protein extracts were added to wells of 96-well microtiter plates containing polymerized <sup>14</sup>C-acetylated collagen in the presence of a known amount of MMP-1 activity from the conditioned medium of bovine corneal explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The plates were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2.5 hours, after which the supernatant containing degraded <sup>14</sup>C-acetylated collagen fragments was collected and counted in a scintillation counter. A unit is defined as the amount of protein required to inhibit one unit of corneal collagenase by 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse Zymography</title><p>In order to simultaneously distinguish the activity of TIMP proteins in bovine CL, reverse zymographic analysis was performed. Equivalent aliquots of CL tissue extracts were mixed with loading buffer [2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8] and applied to 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.5 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were rinsed twice with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by incubation with conditioned medium of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, which is a rich source of various MMPs, for 4 hours to degrade gelatin. After rinsing, gels were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in substrate buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0). Subsequently, gels were stained for 30 minutes with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250, and destained with a solution of 30% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. Whereas the MMPs present in the HT-1080 conditioned medium digest the gelatin within the gel, the TIMPs in the luteal samples inhibit MMP action, and were visualized as dark bands on a clear background. Prestained SDS-PAGE protein standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were run in an adjacent lane.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern Blotting</title><p>TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression in the CL was studied by Northern blotting as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from luteal tissues using TRIZOL (GIBCO-BRL, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty micrograms of total RNA were fractionated on 1.0% (w/v) agarose gels containing formaldehyde and were transferred onto Hybond&#x02122;-N<sup>+ </sup>nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were first incubated in pre-hybridization buffer [50% (v/v) formamide, 5&#x000d7; SSC, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, and 2% (w/v) blocking reagent] for two hours at 42&#x000b0;C. Hybridization was carried out in the hybridization buffer containing TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], or cyclophilin (a generous gift from Dr. Robert Thompson, University of Michigan) cDNA probes at 55&#x000b0;C overnight. These cDNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP using the DIG DNA Random-primed Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The blots were then washed twice at room temperature in 2&#x000d7; SSC with 0.1% (w/v) SDS, followed by higher stringency washes in 0.2&#x000d7; SSC with 0.1% SDS at 65&#x000b0;C. Hybridized probes were detected using an anti-DIG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (used at 1:5000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) in 1% (w/v) blocking reagent. The signals were detected by CSPD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), a chemiluminescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase. The blots were visualized by developing Kodak XAR-5 films with a Konica Medical Film Processor (Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blotting Analysis</title><p>Equivalent amounts of tissue protein extracts were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions before transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Keene, NH). Prestained SDS-PAGE protein standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were also loaded in an adjacent lane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in TBST [0.01 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 8.0] for 2 hours. Two primary antibodies, mouse anti-human TIMP-1 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) and mouse anti-human TIMP-2 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), were used at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml and 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. After an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, the membranes were washed five times with TBST (each time for 15 minutes), followed by a 1-hour incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:15,000, Pierce, Rockford, IL) at room temperature. The blots were then washed with TBST, and developed using the SuperSignal<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Frozen tissue sections (6 &#x003bc;m) were cut onto Superfrost<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA).

Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% (w/v) BSA for 30 min. Sections were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with a 1:40 dilution of mouse anti-human TIMP-1 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, CA) or with a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-human TIMP-2 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, CA).

In the pseudopregnant rat, a different pattern emerges whereby the strongest TIMP-1 mRNA expression is observed during CL formation and regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Clearly, there are species differences with regard to the temporal expression of TIMP-1 transcript in the CL.</p><p>The expression of TIMP-1 protein in three ages of bovine CL was also demonstrated in the present study. Reverse zymography demonstrated that TIMP-1 was the predominant TIMP in the bovine CL, similar to the finding in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the present study, the patterns of TIMP-1 protein and mRNA paralleled each other, being high in the early and mid stages, but decreased in the late cycle CL. The high levels of TIMP-1 in the early and mid cycle CL may participate in regulating the extensive tissue remodeling events that occur during CL formation and development. The reduced TIMP-1 mRNA and protein expression in the late stage CL may portend the decline of this inhibitor observed during luteal regression in bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], ovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and primate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] CL. Collectively, these data implicate TIMP-1 as an important player in the physiology of the CL.</p><p>The TIMP-1 protein was localized in large luteal cells of early, mid, and late stage bovine CL. In the ovine CL, TIMP-1 was co-localized with oxytocin in secretory granules of large luteal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, TIMP-1 expression was also detected in isolated ovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] large luteal cells, and luteinized human granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The presence of TIMP-1 in steroidogenic cells may be associated with its ability to enhance steroid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This may be related in part to a 124 bp-nucleotide sequence similarity between the protein coding region of the bovine steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) gene and the 5' non-coding region of TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Additionally, although female mice lacking the TIMP-1 gene do not show detectable differences in serum estradiol-17&#x003b2; concentrations when compared to the wild type, the TIMP-1 deficient male mice have higher concentrations of total serum testosterone than the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, cell culture studies demonstrated that TIMP-1 is able to increase estradiol-17&#x003b2; production by granulosa cells from both TIMP-1 deficient and wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and estradiol-17&#x003b2; and progesterone production from porcine thecal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, the strong expression of TIMP-1 in large luteal cells may be related to its collateral role in steroidogenesis.</p><p>Because of the predominant expression of TIMP-1 in large luteal cells, this inhibitor is used as a cellular marker for this cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, other cell types in the CL are positive for TIMP-1 expression as well. For example, the present study showed that TIMP-1 was also localized in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of the bovine CL. Although the cellular source was not specified, the capillary compartments in ovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] CL stain positively for TIMP-1. The localization of TIMP-1 in the vascular smooth muscle compartment supports its potential role during angiogenesis and vascular maintenance. Indeed, overexpression of TIMP-1 in VSMC by exogenous gene transfer reduced VSMC cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In addition, stimulation of TIMP-1 expression impaired angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These data collectively suggest that TIMP-1 may act as a negative regulator of blood vessel formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Extensive angiogenesis occurs during early CL development when theca-derived luteal cells and fibroblasts invade through the breached basement membrane into the cavity of the ruptured follicle. These early events in the angiogenic process require MMP activity. However, in the last step of angiogenesis, recruitment and maintenance of pericytes (VSMC) are critical for vascular maturation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, the high level of TIMP-1 expression in VSMC of 4-day old bovine CL may provide an environment where MMP action was curbed as the vasculature matures. As the CL ages, its structure remains relatively stable. Although angiogenesis is ongoing, it is slowed during CL maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This may be the reason for the absence of TIMP-1 in the VSMC compartment at this stage of the bovine estrous cycle. In the 16-day old CL, TIMP-1 was detected again in the VSMC compartment. This localized expression of TIMP-1 is consistent with the hypothesis of Redmer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], who proposed that maintenance of the vasculature may be necessary for the transport of degraded products during luteal regression, which ultimately results in a massive decrease in CL size and weight as regression ensues.</p><p>Although TIMP-1 was the most abundant TIMP in luteal tissues, the other three TIMPs were also detected in the bovine CL by reverse zymography. Among them, we chose to focus our attention on TIMP-2. It has been reported that TIMP-2 may be involved in the pro-MMP-2 activation process by binding an MT1-MMP to form a "co-receptor" for pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This bound pro-MMP-2 would then be presented to an adjacent MT1-MMP for activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although a transmembrane-deleted MT1-MMP is capable of activating pro-MMP-2 without the participation of TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], TIMP-2 deficient mice have a dramatically reduced ability to activate pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. In the present study, both TIMP-2 mRNA and protein levels were low in the early CL, but significantly increased in the mid and late stages. This expression pattern was similar to that for active MT1-MMP and MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], suggesting that the MT1-MMP/TIMP-2/pro-MMP-2 tri-molecular system may be available for MMP-2 activation in vivo in the bovine CL. The coordinate expression of these three molecules is also observed during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], which supports the presence of this activation system in a variety of tissue types.</p><p>In addition to the temporal correlation of TIMP-2 with active MT1-MMP and MMP-2 expression in the CL, TIMP-2 was also co-localized with these two molecules in endothelial and large luteal cells. TIMP-2 has a variety of functions in endothelial cells. On the one hand, the stoichiometrically correlated expression with MT1-MMP and pro-MMP-2 may facilitate the activation process of pro-MMP-2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which is critical for the angiogenesis process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. On the other hand, inhibition of angiogenesis by TIMP-2 cannot be excluded since TIMP-2 has now been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of both physiological and stimulated angiogenesis in vivo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and over-expression of TIMP-2 blocks vascular smooth muscle cell invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and reduces angiogenic ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. The latter observation is due, in part, to down-regulation of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p><p>The localization of TIMP-2 in large luteal cells may also contribute to the activation of pro-MMP-2 in this cell type by assembling the trimeric complex on the cell membrane. The in situ activated MMP-2 is then able to bind integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], where localized pericellular proteolysis ensues. This resulting degradation of the ECM is needed to accommodate the enlargement of large luteal cells from the early to mid and late stages. Although there is no direct evidence demonstrating involvement of TIMP-2 in steroidogenesis, the dynamic interactions between large luteal cells and their local ECM may induce biochemical changes related to the steroid biosynthetic process in this cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. For example, disruption of the links between ECM, integrins, and the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] may perturb the intracellular transport of substrates, such as cholesterol, for steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to elucidate the physiological roles of these TIMPs in this ovarian endocrine gland.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 exhibit a coordinated expression pattern in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle. The distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 suggest that these two inhibitors may have multiple and complementary roles in luteal development and angiogenesis during the life span of the CL. Taken together, the expression of these multi-functional TIMPs and MMPs during the bovine estrous cycle suggests that they are key regulators of CL physiology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gwen Louis for her assistance with the radiometric MMP assay.
