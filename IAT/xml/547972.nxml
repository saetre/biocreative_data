Consequently, these receptors are important targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. A thorough understanding of NHR fat regulatory networks has been limited, however, by a lack of genetically tractable experimental systems. Here we show that deletion of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> NHR gene <italic>nhr-49</italic> yielded worms with elevated fat content and shortened life span. Employing a quantitative RT-PCR screen, we found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> influenced the expression of 13 genes involved in energy metabolism. Indeed, <italic>nhr-49</italic> served as a key regulator of fat usage, modulating pathways that control the consumption of fat and maintain a normal balance of fatty acid saturation. We found that the two phenotypes of the <italic>nhr-49</italic> knockout were linked to distinct pathways and were separable: The high-fat phenotype was due to reduced expression of enzymes in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, and the shortened adult life span resulted from impaired expression of a stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Despite its sequence relationship with the mammalian hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 receptor, the biological activities of <italic>nhr-49</italic> were most similar to those of the mammalian PPARs, implying an evolutionarily conserved role for NHRs in modulating fat consumption and composition.

To test this hypothesis, we identified from a survey of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome 65 genes predicted to participate in fatty acid synthesis, &#x003b2;-oxidation, desaturation, elongation, and binding/transport, in addition to 16 genes expected to function in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose transport, and eight genes involved in the glyoxylate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We then employed quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) to measure the expression of all 89 of these genes in WT and <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant worms. For the purpose of our survey, gene expression was measured in all four larval stages (for a complete dataset, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Our screen revealed that deletion of <italic>nhr-49</italic> significantly altered the expression of 13 genes, including six genes predicted to be involved in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, three genes involved in fatty acid desaturation, two genes involved in fatty acid binding/transport, and two genes involved in the glyoxylate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

The phenotypes of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> were attributable to deficiencies in two different metabolic pathways, fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and fatty acid desaturation. The high-fat phenotype is explained by lowered expression of &#x003b2;-oxidation enzymes, and the shortened life-span phenotype results from reduced expression of the <italic>fat-7</italic> SCD.

Acyl-CoA synthetases activate fatty acids for many different metabolic pathways; in particular, mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetases are likely to activate fatty acids for transport into the mitochondrial matrix, where the fatty acids are then subject to &#x003b2;-oxidation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

These subsets may differ by fatty acid chain length or tissue distribution. As both <italic>acs-2</italic> and <italic>nhr-49</italic> are expressed in numerous <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> tissues, regulation of fat consumption by <italic>nhr-49</italic> may occur throughout the animal.</p><p>Although <italic>acs-2</italic> is related (with approximately 25&#x00025; identity) to multiple mammalian acyl-CoA synthetases, mammals contain a particular homolog with approximately 41&#x00025; identity to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> ACS-2 protein; this mammalian ACS protein is yet to be characterized. It will be interesting to determine whether the mammalian counterpart of <italic>acs-2</italic> also serves as an important focal point for gene networks that regulate fat utilization in mammals.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> stimulates expression of a carnitine palmitoyl transferase (F09F3.9). Carnitine palmitoyl transferases execute the step immediately downstream of acyl-CoA synthetase in mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation, directly shuttling activated acyl-CoAs into the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, <italic>nhr-49</italic> appears to target multiple enzymes involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). RNAi of F09F3.9 did not detectably alter overall fat content, however, suggesting that interference of F09F3.9 expression alone is not sufficient to affect overall fat consumption under the conditions surveyed in our study.</p><p>In contrast, we found that RNAi of <italic>ech-1,</italic> another &#x003b2;-oxidation gene targeted by <italic>nhr-49,</italic> was sufficient to increase overall fat content; thus it is likely that the reduced expression of <italic>ech-1</italic> also contributes, in some fashion, to the high-fat phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041).</italic> Thus, we have demonstrated that <italic>nhr-49</italic> strongly promotes the expression of three separate enzymes predicted to participate in mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation. Consequently, we suggest that <italic>nhr-49</italic> plays a prominent role in promoting the breakdown of fatty acids in mitochondria, and that, through control of &#x003b2;-oxidation, <italic>nhr-49</italic> influences overall fat storage.</p><p>In addition to its effect on &#x003b2;-oxidation, we found that <italic>nhr-49</italic> helps to maintain the balance of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. By stimulating the expression of three fatty acid &#x00394;9-desaturase genes, <italic>nhr-49</italic> facilitates the conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids, and consequently, <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> mutant animals are high in saturated fat and lower in monounsaturated fat.

However, a dramatic reduction in <italic>fat-7</italic> expression, either by <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> deletion or by <italic>fat-7</italic> RNAi, did not significantly affect PUFA synthesis. This result suggests that a normal level of FAT-7 expression is not necessary for PUFA synthesis, likely because FAT-6 is the principle enzyme in this pathway, or because FAT-6 is capable of substituting for reduced FAT-7 activity. In either event, we propose that the primary effect of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on fatty acid composition is a modulation of the ratio of C18:0 to C18:1n9 fatty acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>nhr-49</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> also affect PUFA synthesis in a more localized manner, for example, specific cell types, such that changes in PUFA abundance are not detected in our whole-worm analysis.</p><p>Our results also indicate that the short life-span phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> is due, at least in part, to reduced expression of <italic>fat-7.</italic> The strong correlation between the increase in C18:0 saturated fatty acid and the shortening of life span is compelling. Several reports in mammals have described changes in fatty acid composition during aging, and it has been argued that an alteration of fatty acid saturation ratios in mitochondrial membranes may affect the rate of aging &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although SCDs have not yet been linked to life span in mammals, studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> have identified <italic>fat-7</italic> as one of the targets of the mechanisms that extend longevity through the insulin pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it will be interesting to determine if the shortened life-span phenotype of <italic>nhr-49(nr2041)</italic> and <italic>fat-7 RNAi</italic> animals results from an improper ratio of saturated and monounsaturated fats, and if the mechanistic cause of the reduced life span is related to accelerated aging or to another pathology.</p><p>Although it is clear that <italic>nhr-49</italic> independently promotes the expression of genes in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and desaturation, we found that downstream components of these pathways do indeed communicate with each other. By inhibiting the expression of genes involved in &#x003b2;-oxidation, including the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes <italic>acs-2</italic> and <italic>ech-1, fat-7</italic> works against the actions of <italic>nhr-49,</italic> acting to hinder fat consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, our results reveal an elegant feedback mechanism: <italic>nhr-49</italic> induces the expression of &#x003b2;-oxidation enzymes&#x02014;thus promoting fat consumption&#x02014;yet by independently stimulating <italic>fat-7</italic> expression, <italic>nhr-49</italic> tempers the expression of the very same &#x003b2;-oxidation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, we suggest that <italic>nhr-49</italic> serves as a key regulator of fat usage, governing pathways that consume fat for energy and partition fat for storage, potentially shifting the balance in response to changing energy needs. Indeed, we have found that in response to starvation, <italic>nhr-49</italic> selectively modulates the expression of these two pathways in order to increase fat consumption (M. R. Van Gilst and K. R. Yamamoto, unpublished data).</p><p>As the predominant function of <italic>fat-7</italic> is to convert C18:0 to C18:1n9 fatty acid, it is tempting to speculate that one of these two fatty acid species serves as a signal to modulate the feedback effect of <italic>fat-7</italic> on fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this scenario, C18:0 could be serving as an activator of &#x003b2;-oxidation gene expression, C18:1n9 could be functioning as a repressor, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030053-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although it seems reasonable to propose that an NHR would communicate this fatty acid signal, we found that the effects of <italic>fat-7</italic> on fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation were not dependent on <italic>nhr-49;</italic> hence, one of the other 283 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> NHRs may mediate this effect.</p><p>Despite its strong sequence similarity with the mammalian HNF4 receptors, the overall biological effects of <italic>nhr-49</italic> on metabolism, fat storage, and life span are remarkably similar to those of the mammalian PPARs.

In mammals, the &#x00394;9-desaturase SCD1 is a lipogenic enzyme that is controlled by several key regulators of fat storage, including PPAR&#x003b1;, leptin, and sterol response element-binding protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the multicircuited regulatory networks governing fat usage appear well conserved between <italic>C. elegans nhr-49</italic> and the mammalian PPAR&#x003b1;.</p><p>Although we have not yet determined whether or not the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes identified in this study are direct transcriptional targets, each is homologous to known transcriptional targets of the PPARs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Because NHR-49 and the PPARs are clearly regulating similar physiological processes and gene networks, we believe that they are likely to be using similar molecular mechanisms, including direct transcriptional regulation. However, it is possible that <italic>nhr-49</italic> controls fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and desaturation through an indirect mechanism, functioning upstream of the transcription factors that directly act on the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent genes identified in this study. The latter possibility would also be intriguing, as it would demonstrate NHR involvement in fat regulation at a point upstream of a PPAR-like factor.</p><p>As the physiological functions and regulatory targets of <italic>nhr-49</italic> are highly similar to those of the mammalian PPARs, it seems reasonable to speculate that, like the PPARs, NHR-49 may be regulated by fatty acid ligands. By binding directly to ingested lipids and/or their metabolic products, NHR-49 could serve both as a sensor of intracellular fatty acid levels and an effector, responding to changes in fatty acid composition through modulation of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and desaturation. Interestingly, the mammalian HNF4 receptors, whose LBDs share 33&#x00025; identity with the NHR-49 LBD, can bind to several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, including stearic and oleic acid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;; the mammalian PPARs also bind to many types of fatty acids, although they interact preferentially with PUFAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030053-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. It will be interesting to determine if mammalian HNF4 receptors harbor an undiscovered capacity to regulate fat metabolism in mammals, or if PPARs have adopted their regulatory functions by evolving from an ancestral HNF4 gene that had properties similar to <italic>nhr-49</italic> and the modern PPARs. Alternatively, the PPARs and <italic>nhr-49</italic> may have acquired their activities through convergent evolution.</p><p>Precise regulation of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and desaturation is crucial for physiological homeostasis; imbalance in these metabolic pathways in humans can lead to disorders such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and accelerated aging. However, although NHRs are important targets for drugs that moderate these metabolic disorders, the NHR-mediated regulatory networks that govern fat usage are notably complex and poorly understood. We showed here that many features of <italic>C. elegans nhr-49</italic> regulation of fat metabolism are closely analogous to those of the mammalian PPARs, key targets for the treatment of metabolic disease. Moreover, our <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> studies revealed that <italic>nhr-49,</italic> like PPAR&#x003b1;, oversees a branch point for two separate circuits within a network that controls fatty acid consumption and composition.</p><p>The extent of the functional homology between <italic>nhr-49</italic> and PPAR&#x003b1; remains to be determined, that is, whether or not <italic>nhr-49</italic> also functions by binding to fatty acid ligands and directly regulating gene transcription. Nevertheless, our finding that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is a key regulator of fat metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> represents a considerable advance in our understanding of NHR control of fat storage and composition in invertebrates. Consequently, we suggest that these and future studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> will continue to enhance our understanding of the complex roles of NHRs and their ligands on gene networks governing fat physiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>RNAi constructs</title><p>All of the RNAi constructs used in the NHR screen were created by cloning full-length NHR cDNAs into the vector L4440 (Andy Fire, Stanford University).
