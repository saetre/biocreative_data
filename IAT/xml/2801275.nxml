These acidic polysaccharides form a large pool of negative charge on the cell surface that TAT PTD binds avidly. Additionally, sulfated glycans have been proposed to aid in the interaction of TAT PTD and other arginine-rich PTDs with the cell membrane, perhaps aiding their translocation across the membrane. Surprisingly, however, TAT PTD-mediated induction of macropinocytosis and cellular transduction occurs in the absence of heparan sulfate and sialic acid. Using labeled TAT PTD peptides and fusion proteins, in addition to TAT PTD-Cre recombination-based phenotypic assays, we show that transduction occurs efficiently in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in glycosaminoglycans and sialic acids. Similar results were obtained in cells where glycans were enzymatically removed. In contrast, enzymatic removal of proteins from the cell surface completely ablated TAT PTD-mediated transduction. Our findings support the hypothesis that acidic glycans form a pool of charge that TAT PTD binds on the cell surface, but this binding is independent of the PTD-mediated transduction mechanism and the induction of macropinocytotic uptake by TAT PTD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cationic peptide-mediated cellular transduction represents a cell entry modality with enormous potential for the delivery of macromolecular therapeutic agents. The human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein basic domain (RKKRRQRRR) and other protein/peptide transduction domains (PTDs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> have been used to deliver a wide variety of bioactive cargo into cells in culture and preclinical models <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Efficient delivery of peptide, nucleic acid, and full-length protein cargoes by cationic PTDs has been demonstrated by many groups, and several clinical trials are currently under way using PTD-mediated delivery. Despite a number of studies on the mechanism used by PTDs to enter cells, many questions about their uptake remain unanswered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) have previously shown that TAT PTD and other cationic PTDs induce a ubiquitous form of fluid-phase endocytosis termed macropinocytosis and enter cells in this manner. However, many mechanistic aspects of TAT PTD transduction remain poorly defined. For instance, we have yet to identify the molecules that TAT PTD binds on the cell surface to induce macropinocytosis, and we do not know how escape across the endosomal lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm is accomplished.</p><p>Using fluorescently labeled peptides, it has previously been reported that TAT PTD avidly binds to sulfated glycans and that the presence of acidic polysaccharides like heparin and chondroitin sulfate in solution can compete with TAT PTD for binding to the cell surface and inhibit transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Based on these observations, several studies argue for a significant role for glycans in the transduction of cationic PTDs, with some researchers concluding that transduction is dependent on heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, these studies relies predominantly on both flow cytometry and microscopic visual observations of fluorescently labeled PTD peptides and are therefore did not necessarily assay for the amount of PTD cargo that has escaped from endocytic vesicles into the cytoplasm. We refer to these observations as &#x0201c;cell association&#x0201d; because they do not sufficiently distinguish between cells that have taken up fluorescently labeled PTDs in endocytic vesicles (or bound to the cell surface) and PTD peptide and cargo that have actually escaped endosomes into the cytoplasm. This distinction is critical because the inside of the endosome is essentially the outside of the cell; no biological response will be elicited simply by uptake into vesicles. Indeed, endosomal escape is requisite for transduction of cargo into the cytoplasm to induce phenotypic responses, and the majority of labeled TAT PTD taken up by cells is present in endosomes, with only a small fraction actually escaping into the cytoplasm.</p><p>Here, we sought to explore the role of glycans in TAT PTD-mediated transduction using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) glycan-deficient cell lines that are genetically deficient for cell-surface expression of heparan and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans or sialic acids (SAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although previous studies using fluorescently labeled PTD peptides indicated a requisite role for HS in transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), surprisingly, we found, via a phenotypic assay, that cells lacking HS are in fact fully functional for TAT PTD-mediated transduction. Moreover, transduction occurs efficiently in cells completely lacking all glycosaminoglycans, including HS, in cells lacking SAs, and in cells depleted of both together. Our findings support the hypothesis that acidic glycans form a pool of negative charge that TAT PTD binds on the cell surface but are dispensable for cationic PTD-mediated transduction into cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Generation of Stable Cell Lines</title><p>Parental CHO-K1 cells and glycosaminoglycan mutant pgsA (745) cells lacking xylosyltransferase necessary for glycosaminoglycan chain initiation were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Esko (University of California, San Diego).

To avoid these pitfalls, we assayed HS- and SA-deficient cells for induction of a cellular phenotype that is dependent on PTD cargo escape into the cytoplasm/nucleus. Previously, we devised a TAT PTD-Cre-LSL-GFP reporter system as a readout for TAT PTD-Cre transduction. Entrance of TAT PTD-Cre into the nucleus results in recombination and elimination of the LSL-GFP transcriptional terminator, resulting in expression of GFP. Unlike visual assays employing fluorescently labeled proteins or peptides that may inadvertently measure cell-surface binding and endocytotic uptake (in the absence of endosomal escape), TAT PTD-Cre-induced recombination and GFP expression are an unequivocal measure of transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Because of its stringency, this system may underestimate the efficiency of the transduction phenomena being observed, yet it gives an unparalleled phenotypic measure of transduction with minimal potential for false positives or misinterpretation.</p><p>We analyzed TAT PTD-Cre transduction in stable LSL-GFP clones of parental glycan-positive wild-type CHO-K1 and derivative glycan-deficient pgsA and Lec2 cell lines.

This demonstrates the ability of TAT PTD-Cre to enter cells and transit to the nucleus to recombine the LSL genetic element in the absence of HS and SA.

Our observations with mutant CHO cell lines could be due to compensation for a deficiency that is evident only after acute depletion, or a strong phenotype might be evident only in cells lacking HS and SA in combination. Efficient removal of cell-surface HS and SA was accomplished using heparinase and sialidase enzymes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.021964/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></ext-link>).

We originally intended to use HS-deficient mutants as transduction-null cells to facilitate our research into the mechanism of transduction. Our original hypothesis was that a HS proteoglycan served as a receptor for TAT PTD and was responsible for stimulating macropinocytotic uptake. However, to our surprise, experiments using a cellular phenotypic assay, not merely visualization, demonstrated that cells lacking HS or SA are fully competent to efficiently transduce TAT PTD-Cre into cells.</p><p>To further explore our unexpected preliminary findings, we first looked at cell association of fluorescent TAT PTD-FITC peptide and TAT PTD-Cre-Alexa Fluor 546 in wild-type and glycan-deficient cells. Our data corroborate the work of previous researchers indicating a reduction in cell association of labeled TAT PTD peptide and labeled TAT PTD-Cre protein in glycan-deficient cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, the differences we see are not so dramatic as to warrant the conclusion that transduction is not occurring in these cells: the cell association of TAT PTD-FITC and TAT PTD-Cre-Alexa Fluor 546 is well above the control in both HS- and SA-deficient cells. Nevertheless, there are clear and consistent differences in the magnitude of transduction we see in glycan-deficient cells that likely explain the conclusions of previous authors that transduction does not occur in cells lacking HS. The differences we see in cell association in cells lacking glycans correlate well with differences in extracellular binding of TAT PTD peptide and TAT PTD-Cre protein. This indicates that the minor differences seen in cell association are due to a reduced extracellular TAT-PTD-binding capacity of glycan-deficient cells rather than a deficiency in transduction pathways.</p><p>To further explore transduction in the absence of glycans, we sought to generate a transduction data set based on a phenotypic assay rather than using cell association of labeled TAT as an approximation of transduction. To accomplish this, we generated stable Cre-responsive cell lines from CHO-K1, pgsA, and Lec2 cells using a LSL-GFP reporter gene. As we have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), cell lines with an integrated LSL-GFP construct do not express GFP in the absence of Cre recombinase. However, after treatment of LSL-GFP cells with exogenous recombinant TAT PTD-Cre protein, GFP expression is induced. Using this system, we can determine the relative efficiency of TAT PTD transduction without the caveats of visualization based on labeled peptides and proteins. Assays that rely on fluorescent tags to measure cellular uptake cannot discriminate between endosomal and cytosolic fractions of the cell and may grossly overestimate the actual fraction of peptide and cargo that has transduced into the cell (escaped from the endosome). We prefer to refer to these measures as cell association because they do not sufficiently distinguish cells that have fluorescent label in endocytic vesicles or bound to the cell surface from cells where the peptide and cargo have actually escaped endosomes into the cytoplasm. This distinction is important because endosomal escape is requisite for transduction; the majority of labeled TAT PTD taken up by cells is present in endosomes, and most researchers would agree that only a small proportion escapes to the cytoplasm. In addition, for the purposes of most therapeutic interventions, the inside of the endosome is essentially the outside of the cell; no biological response will be elicited simply by uptake into vesicles. The importance of escape is further illustrated by the increase in transduction efficiency seen with endosome-disrupting peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Treatment of Cre-responsive cells with TAT PTD-Cre revealed a trivial difference between wild-type and HS- or SA-deficient cells. If transduction were not occurring in these cells, we would expect to see a reduction to the base line as seen with recombinant Cre lacking TAT PTD or treatment with cytochalasin D. The efficient manner with which TAT PTD-Cre enters glycan-deficient cells is strong and convincing evidence that transduction occurs in the absence of extracellular glycosaminoglycans and SAs.</p><p>Further evidence that transduction is occurring in these cells is the existence of TAT PTD-induced macropinocytotic uptake of 70-kDa neutral dextran in glycan-deficient pgsA and Lec2 cells. If these cells were refractory to transduction or if there were another pathway for entry, we would not expect to see dextran uptake increased in response to TAT PTD. Furthermore, the mode of uptake is macropinocytosis in wild-type and glycan-deficient cell lines, as evidenced by the similar reductions in transduction efficiency seen after treatment with chemical inhibitors of macropinocytosis.</p><p>We have shown here, in an extensive exploration, that TAT PTD-mediated transduction does not require HS or SAs; it occurs efficiently in their absence. As shown by our very stringent Cre-LoxP system and by more conventional fluorescent visualization and cytometry, TAT PTD enters cells lacking HS or SA and cells that have been depleted of both in combination. Furthermore, TAT PTD-induced macropinocytotic fluid-phase uptake is intact in glycan-deficient cells, indicating that TAT PTD does not require these glycans to stimulate endocytosis. By contrast, depletion of cell-surface proteins with protease results in drastically reduced transduction efficiency, indicating that a cell-surface protein is necessary for TAT PTD transduction (although not necessarily as a receptor). These data suggest that cationic peptides like TAT PTD may induce macropinocytotic uptake and transduction via binding to a protein on the cell surface rather than through interactions with glycans or direct interaction with the membrane.</p><p>Together, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the dense forest of extracellular glycans forms a pool of negative charge that TAT PTD binds on the cell surface. Differences in this charge pool affect the efficiency of TAT transduction to varying degrees but are independent of the ability of PTDs to transduce cells or to induce macropinocytotic uptake. Further study to determine the extracellular proteins required for transduction will offer important insights into the mechanism of transduction of TAT PTD as well as other PTDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_285_2_1500__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.021964_jbc.M109.021964-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN1"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.021964/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN2"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">PTD</term><def><p>protein transduction domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">HS</term><def><p>heparan sulfate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">CHO</term><def><p>Chinese hamster ovary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">SA</term><def><p>sialic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">EGFP</term><def><p>enhanced green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">FITC</term><def><p>fluorescein isothiocyanate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">TMR</term><def><p>tetramethylrhodamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">LSL</term><def><p>LoxP-STOP-LoxP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">PBS</term><def><p>phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">FACS</term><def><p>fluorescence-activated cell sorting.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meade</surname><given-names>B.
