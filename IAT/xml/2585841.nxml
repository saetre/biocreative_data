Mutation of an inhibitory wedge motif in CD45 (E613R) results in hyperresponsive thymocytes and B cells on the C57BL/6 background, but no overt autoimmunity, whereas Fas deletion results in a mild autoimmune disease on the same genetic background. In this study, we show that these two mutations cooperate in mice, causing early lethality, autoantibody production, and substantial lymphoproliferation. In double-mutant mice, this phenotype was dependent on both T and B cells. T cell activation required signaling in response to endogenous or commensal antigens, demonstrated by the introduction of a transgenic T cell receptor. Genetic deletion of B cells also prevented T cell activation. Similarly, T cells were necessary for B cell autoantibody production. However, B cells appeared to be intrinsically activated even in the absence of T cells, suggesting that they may drive the phenotype of these mice. These results reveal a requirement for careful control of B cell signaling and cell death in preventing inappropriate lymphocyte activation and autoimmunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In the adaptive immune system, multiple barriers minimize the likelihood that a randomly generated antigen receptor will recognize and initiate a response to self-peptide. These barriers are at work throughout the lifetime of antigen receptor&#x02013;bearing cells, starting with the elimination of self-reactive cells during their development and followed by mechanisms that induce anergy, suppression, or apoptosis of any self-reactive cells escaping to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In some rare, inherited autoimmune syndromes, single-gene defects trigger a failure of one of these processes. However, for most autoimmune diseases, including lupus and arthritis, multiple interacting loci with relatively small individual effects are generally necessary for disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Studying how genetic modifiers cooperate to cause disease is thus critical to our understanding of autoimmunity.</p><p>CD45 plays an essential role in the immune system, regulating lymphocyte development and activation through Src family kinases (SFKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). CD45 maintains SFKs in a primed, quiescent state by dephosphorylating both inhibitory and activating tyrosines. These unphosphorylated SFKs assume an open conformation that can be rapidly activated by phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In the absence of CD45 activity, the inhibitory tyrosine is phosphorylated by the kinase Csk, and the SFK adopts a closed, inactive conformation.</p><p>One means of regulating CD45 is by spontaneous homodimerization, which inhibits its activity, preventing SFK activation and antigen receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The crystal structure of a related phosphatase, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase &#x003b1; (RPTP&#x003b1;), revealed a possible mechanism for inhibition by dimerization. The membrane-proximal phosphatase domain of RPTP&#x003b1; crystallizes as a symmetric dimer in which a helix-turn-helix motif of one molecule forms a &#x0201c;wedge&#x0201d; and inserts into the catalytic site of the partner molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The wedge is highly conserved in CD45. Mutating the acidic amino acid at its tip prevented dimerization-mediated inhibition in vitro and, moreover, led to a lupus-like syndrome in mice when knocked into the endogenous CD45 locus (E613R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In a mixed C57BL/6 (B6) and 129 genetic background, the CD45 wedge mutant mice develop a pronounced lymphoproliferative disease (LPD), autoantibodies, and immune complex&#x02013;mediated glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, as with many autoimmune phenotypes, much of the disease resolved on a homogenous B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). B6 CD45 wedge mice still develop very mild lymphoproliferation and elevated IgM levels, but autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis are absent. B cells remain hyperresponsive to various stimuli, suggesting that the CD45 wedge mutant behaves as a hypermorphic allele, but is insufficient to cause autoimmunity on the B6 background.</p><p>In this study, we ask whether the wedge mutation could act as a genetic modifier with other mutations, predisposing mice, and potentially humans, to autoimmunity. We chose to study the complement C4 knockout and a naturally occurring Fas mutation, <italic>lpr,</italic> based on their ability to induce a mild, slowly progressing autoimmunity on the B6 background. Complement is a component of the innate immune system involved in opsonization and clearance of pathogens and possibly apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Fas, when bound by Fas ligand (FasL), frequently triggers apoptosis on activated cells, and hence is part of the activation-induced cell death (AICD) pathway. In mice, the phenotypes of the C4 knockout and <italic>lpr</italic> mutation are highly dependent on strain background. Both mixed B6 &#x000d7; 129 C4 knockout and MRL/<italic>lpr</italic> mice develop robust autoimmune lupus-like disease, characterized by lymphocyte activation, autoantibodies against nuclear components, immune complex deposition, and glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, backcrossing both C4 and <italic>lpr</italic> to the B6 background mitigates most of their phenotype. In these mice, low levels of autoantibody are detected only in older mice, without evidence of overt organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Here, we find that combination of C4 deficiency and the CD45 wedge mutation does not alter disease compared with single-mutant mice. However, the wedge mutation and <italic>lpr</italic> act synergistically, markedly accelerating autoantibody production, lymphocyte activation, and lymphoproliferation. Thus, the CD45 wedge mutation acts as a potent modifier with the <italic>lpr</italic> mutation, but not C4 deficiency. In addressing the mechanisms behind the wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> phenotype, we further demonstrate that T cells, and specifically signaling through the TCR, and B cells are required for lymphoproliferation, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop between these two cell types. Moreover, B cells appear to be intrinsically activated, and therefore their activation may be the primary event driving lymphocyte activation and expansion.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>CD45 wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice die at an accelerated rate with autoantibody production</title><p>We generated wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> double-mutant mice and followed cohorts consisting of 10 mice, 5 male and 5 female, from WT, single-, and double-mutant backgrounds over the course of 1 yr. Of these cohorts, wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> double-mutant mice showed accelerated autoantibody production and mortality. 100% of wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice developed antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) by 2 mo of age, dsDNA antibodies by 3 mo, and died by 9 mo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). As previously reported, B6 <italic>Lpr</italic> mice did not develop low-titer ANAs until 6 mo of age and dsDNA antibodies until 9 mo of age (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In contrast, autoantibodies were not detected in wedge, C4, and wedge/C4 mice throughout the yearlong experiment.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CD45 wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> double-mutant mice show early lethality and autoantibody production.</bold> (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curve from aging cohorts. <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 mice per group, 5 males and 5 females.

Proteinuria is commonly used as a marker for kidney damage in these mice, but surprisingly neither immune complex deposition nor proteinuria were detected in CD45 wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice as late as 9 mo of age (unpublished data). Histological examination of kidneys from 6&#x02013;9-mo-old wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice did, however, reveal increasing amounts of perivascular lymphocyte accumulations with age. The accumulations were most prominent in kidney and lung and, to a lesser extent, the liver (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). We speculate that progressive accumulation of lymphocytes, combined with compression of the lungs from mediastinal lymphadenopathy, contribute to the death of wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice from asphyxiation (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1</ext-link>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the cells to consist almost exclusively of CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (Fig. S1, D&#x02013;G). In addition to the perivascular infiltrates, kidneys from older wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice appeared pale and contained enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli, which could represent early, subclinical renal ischemia (Fig. S1, H&#x02013;K).</p></sec><sec><title>Wedge and <italic>lpr</italic> mutations cooperate to induce lymphocyte activation and expansion</title><p>On gross examination, the most striking feature of wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice was marked lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, which progressed with age (Fig. S1, A and B). Both splenic weight and lymph node cellularity in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> double-mutant mice were increased up to 10-fold compared with single-mutant and WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The breakdown of lymphocyte subsets is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>. In general, the composition of lymphocytes in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice is similar to that of wedge mice, which have a greater fraction of CD3 versus CD19 cells and a slightly skewed CD4 to CD8 ratio. The notable exceptions are the reduced percentage of CD4 and, more dramatically, CD8 cells as they are replaced by the substantial increase in CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4/CD8 double-negative (DN) T cells. This is a unique subset of T cells found in <italic>lpr</italic> mice, but is much more prominent in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice. The origin of these DN cells is controversial, but they are believed to represent a population of activated T cells that fail to undergo AICD as a result of the Fas mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Although the percentage of some subsets was reduced, the absolute number of all lymphocyte subsets was much higher in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice as a result of the overall increased cellularity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Based on BrdU incorporation, lymphocyte expansion was a consequence of increased proliferation in vivo. In wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice, &#x0223c;60% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and CD19 B cells, had divided and incorporated BrdU over 10 d, a significantly higher percentage than wedge, <italic>lpr</italic>, and WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lymphocyte expansion in CD45 wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice is accompanied by increased cell proliferation.</bold> (A) Splenic weight of 2-, 4-, and 6-mo-old mice.

In 2-mo-old mice, up to 90% of CD4 and 75% of CD8 T cells in the spleen had already acquired a memory phenotype, defined by up-regulation of CD44 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1</ext-link>). An unusual population of CD4 cells found in <italic>lpr</italic> mice that have up-regulated CD44, but failed to down-regulate CD62L, was likewise expanded in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> double mutants. The wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> memory phenotype cells showed a strong Th1 polarization. A large fraction of wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD44<sup>high</sup> cells produced IFN-&#x003b3;, but not IL-4 or -17, upon direct ex vivo stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. S2 C and not depicted). In addition to increased memory cell markers, wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice have a higher fraction of cells expressing the immediate activation marker CD69 (Fig. S2 B), which is suggestive of ongoing T cell activation. Analysis of B and myeloid cells indicates that these lineages were also activated, as measured by MHC class II and CD86 up-regulation, in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice relative to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>T and B cells from wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice show signs of activation.</bold> (A) Representative flow cytometric analysis of CD4 memory phenotype cells from 2-mo-old mice.

Based on our observations that wedge B cells are hyperresponsive to stimulation, we hypothesized that wedge T cells might also have a reduced threshold for activation and thus be more susceptible to Fas-mediated AICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Surprisingly, in vitro AICD assays did not reveal any differences in the apoptosis of wedge versus WT T cells (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1</ext-link>). <italic>lpr</italic> and wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> T cells were resistant to death in these experiments, indicating that induction of death was Fas dependent (Fig. S3 and not depicted). There was also no difference in CD3 plus CD28&#x02013;induced in vitro proliferation of CD4 or CD8 T cells from young mice among the four genotypes at multiple doses and time points (unpublished data). These results raised the possibility that the wedge mutation has different effects on responses to strong in vitro stimulation versus in vivo endogenous signals.</p></sec><sec><title>TCR antigen recognition and B cells are required for lymphoproliferation</title><p>To examine the role of endogenous signaling through the TCR, we restricted the T cell repertoire to a single TCR using the ovalbumin peptide&#x02013;reactive OT2 TCR transgene. The OT2 TCR transgene completely eliminated the presence of memory phenotype T cells in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In these mice, the small fraction of T cells escaping OT2 TCR restriction showed a slight increase in the percentage of memory cells compared with WT OT2. The degree of activation in these cells likely depends on the specific TCR transgene, the efficiency of restriction, and the strain background (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081204/DC1</ext-link>). Restricting the TCR repertoire also corrected the lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, as well as the survival defect seen in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). None of the mice in a cohort of 6 wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> OT2 mice had died at 6 mo compared with the 50% mortality seen at this time point in nontransgenic wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice (unpublished data). Genetic elimination of T cells using TCR&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also prevented lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Furthermore, wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> TCR&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice failed to produce autoantibodies by 5 mo of age (unpublished data).

CD45 regulates lymphocyte signaling through the modulation of SFK activity. SFKs control both the early activation of lymphocytes in response to foreign antigen and the low-level survival signal antigen that receptor cells produce in response to continuous exposure to endogenous antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Mutation of the CD45 wedge results in a hypermorphic CD45 allele that is more competent for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Thus, instead of the low-level signal required for maintaining naive cell survival, enhanced signaling in CD45 wedge mutant cells chronically activates a subset of these cells. Several recent studies have suggested that Fas deletes such chronically activated cells. In these studies, deleted cells were activated in response to either endogenous antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) or persistent foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Fas is likely to be important in deleting wedge mutant T and B cells activated by endogenous antigens as well. However, once Fas is removed, these cells survive and proliferate.</p><p>Although both T and B cells show increased activation and turnover in wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice, neither cell type alone is sufficient to cause lymphoproliferation. Neither T cell&#x02013; or B cell&#x02013;deficient wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice develop lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. This phenomenon has also been previously documented for B cell deficiency in mixed background wedge mutant mice, MRL/<italic>lpr</italic> mice, and aged B6/<italic>lpr</italic> mice, which fail to develop lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Together, these data suggest the presence of a positive feedback loop between B and T cells that lead to their mutual expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). In wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice, activated APCs, and more specifically B cells, are responsible for initiating this loop. Wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> B cells express increased levels of the activation markers MHC class II and CD86, even in the absence of T cells. The elevated levels of these markers appear to be cell intrinsic and might make the B cells more effective at presenting endogenous antigens. We postulate that increased presentation of endogenous antigens then activates autoreactive T cells. These activated T cells further activate B cells, resulting in autoantibody production and proliferation of both cell types.</p><p>We have shown that the CD45 wedge mutation can act as a genetic modifier for the development of autoimmunity, but not in all contexts. When combined with the <italic>lpr</italic> mutation in Fas, the wedge mutation dramatically accelerates and exacerbates the loss of tolerance, lymphocyte activation, and lymphoproliferation. In contrast, the wedge mutation and C4 deficiency do not cooperate despite the strong predisposition of C4 deficiency to result in a lupuslike syndrome. Interestingly, genetic modifiers may be an important factor in a human disease caused by Fas mutations called autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Even though Fas mutations are autosomal dominant, parents of ALPS patients may carry the same mutation but not display any symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Subtle differences in the signaling threshold of lymphocytes from these individuals may account for this variable penetrance. Wedge and wedge/<italic>lpr</italic> mice may therefore serve as useful tools to begin understanding not only the pathogenesis of ALPS but also the roles of B cells and antigen receptor cell responses to endogenous antigens in other autoimmune conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>CD45 E613R mice, backcrossed at least nine generations to C57BL/6, were bred to C57BL/6 <italic>lpr</italic> and C4 knockout mice (The Jackson Laboratory).
