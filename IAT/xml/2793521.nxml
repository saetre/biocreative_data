SEB binds to the MHC-II&#x003b1; chain and is recognized by the TCR&#x003b2; chain of the V&#x003b2;8 TCR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. The binding of SEB to V&#x003b2; chain results in rapid activation of T cells and production of inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interferon-&#x003b3; and Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#x003b1; which mediate TSS. Although IL2 was originally identified as the T cell growth factor and was proposed to contribute to T cell differentiation, its role in TSS remains unexplored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Mice were injected with D-Gal (25 mg/mouse). One hour after D-Galactosamine (D-Gal) injection each mouse was injected with SEB (20 &#x000b5;g/mouse. Mice were then observed for 72 hrs and death was recorded at different times. We tested Interleukin-12, IFN&#x003b3;, and IL-2 deficient mice (IL-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), but only the IL-2 deficient mice were resistant to SEB induced toxic shock syndrome. More importantly reconstitution of IL-2 in IL-2 deficient mice restored the shock. Interestingly, SEB induced IL-2 production from T cells was dependent on p38MAPK activation in macrophages as inhibition of it in macrophages significantly inhibited IL-2 production from T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows the importance of IL -2 in TSS which has not been previously explored and it also shows that regulating macrophages function can regulate T cells and TSS.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>TSS is a superantigen-mediated disease. Superantigens are a group of proteins (<italic>S aureus</italic> toxins in the case of TSS) that are able to activate the immune system by bypassing certain steps in the usual antigen-mediated immune response sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Schrock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Superantigens are not processed within the antigen-presenting cell before being presented to T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Acharya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, instead, they bind directly to the alpha chain of the major histocompatibility complex, class II (MHC-II), and are recognized by the V&#x003b2; chain of T cell receptor to trigger a massive T-cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Papageorgiou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB), a superantigen, is among the toxins produced by toxigenic strains of <italic>S aureus</italic>, and it can cause TSS in a variety of settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Saha1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. SEB is the toxin that most commonly causes classic food poisoning. It has also been demonstrated to cause a non-menstrual TSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Lee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, staphylococcal infection in surgical operations can also cause TSS. It is viewed that the mechanism of SEB-induced TSS is a massive T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Herman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. While conventional antigens activate only about 0.01&#x00025; to 0.1&#x00025; of the T-cell population, super antigens can activate 5&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; of the entire T cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Davison1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Superantigens lead to a rapid burst of cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 and IL-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Kotzin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Miethke1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore we compared SEB induced TSS in BALB/c and IL-2 deficient (IL-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) in BALB/c background mice. Since activation status of antigen presenting cells (APCs) may also play a role in TSS and the crucial role of p38MAPK has already been shown in APCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Aicher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we studied the role of p38MAPK in SEB induced TSS.

This study reveals that mice deficient in IL-12 or IFN&#x003b3; are susceptible to SEB induced TSS whereas the mice deficient in IL-2 are absolutely resistant to SEB induced TSS. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are shown to be involved in mediating the TSS, but the mice deficient in IL-2 have comparable amounts of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and CD8&#x0002b; T cells, which proliferate more than WT T cells indicating that there could be some other mechanism of TSS induction. Indeed, it is the IL-2 produced TNF-&#x003b1; which causes TSS as deficiency of IL-2 reduced TNF-&#x003b1; in T cells as well as in the serum of IL-2 deficient mice. Higher proliferation of IL-2 deficient T cells was due to IL-2 induced IL-10 production from T cells, which acts as a regulatory control and regulates T cell proliferation. This phenomenon also helps in maintaining the homeostasis between regulatory T cells and effector T cells. Our study shows that TNF-&#x003b1; plays a key role in the induction of TSS, and complete removal of TNF-&#x003b1; makes the mice more susceptible to diseases like cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008473-Batten1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study shows that deficiency of IL-2 reduces the TNF-&#x003b1; production but does not inhibit it completely. This reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; production inhibits TSS in mice and hence could be better a strategy to understand the molecular mechanism of TSS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experiments were performed under guidelines and approval of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) and Institutional Animal Care of National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), India and used Committee and Institute approved protocols for the animal experimentation.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>(1) Mice and Other Reagents</title><p>SEB, purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO) was used in all the experiments.
