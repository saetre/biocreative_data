This involves the proliferation of spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes and the differentiation of spermatids into spermatozoa. It is a complex developmental program in which myriad events take place to ensure that the germ cells reach their proper stages of development at the appropriate times. Normal spermatogenesis requires a well-regulated balance of several processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.</p><p>Apoptosis is a key phenomenon during spermatogenesis. For instance, an early, massive wave of germ cell apoptosis occurs at puberty. This event takes place during postnatal weeks 2 to 4 in mice, with a peak after 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that 75% of spermatogenic cells undergo apoptosis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], ensuring the maintenance of a critical ratio between maturing germ cells and Sertoli cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Sporadic apoptosis also occurs, primarily in spermatogonia and spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], eliminating defective germ cells with mutated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Rhomboid family comprises polytopic membrane proteins, which may be the most widely-conserved membrane proteins identified to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. They share conserved biochemical properties in all biological kingdoms. Rhomboid proteases, which have been well studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, appear to regulate EGF receptor signalling pathways, thereby controlling growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, some yeast Rhomboid proteases have been found to play important roles in mitochondrial membrane remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while some parasite proteases containing a Rhomboid domain are important for invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Vertebrate rhomboid genes have been grouped into three classes: (1) active cellular rhomboids, including RHBDL1, RHBDL2, RHBDL4 and RHBDD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; (2) inactive cellular rhomboids, including RHBDL5 and RHBDL6; (3) a mitochondrial rhomboid, PARL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the physiological functions of these proteases remain to be clarified. Recently, RHBDL2 was found to cleave thrombomodulin and ephrin B3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. An exciting finding in this field was the discovery of PARL (Presenilin-associated rhomboid-like), the function of which appears to be associated with apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Rhomboid 7 is believed to be associated with spermatogenesis, as male mutants tend to be afflicted with familial sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>mRHBDD1 is the first Rhomboid serine protease known to be involved in mammalian spermatogenesis. We found that RHBDD1, which contains a Rhomboid domain, is highly expressed in testes and is involved in regulating apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, the roles of mRHBDD1 in germ cell apoptosis and mouse spermatogenesis were investigated. We found that it is involved in regulating apoptosis in a mouse spermatagonia cell line, GC-1, and is essential for their capacity to differentiate into spermatids in mouse seminiferous tubules.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>mrhbdd1 </italic>and <italic>rrhbdd1 </italic>are polytopic genes that are highly expressed in testis</title><p><italic>mrhbdd1 </italic>and <italic>rrhbdd1 </italic>were expressed in a variety of mouse and rat tissues, and the highest levels of gene products were found in the testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Stable mRHBDD1 knockdown shRNA and negative control shRNA GC-1 cells were constructed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;E</xref>). Because RHBDD1 regulates apoptosis in some somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the occurrence of apoptosis in mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells was determined after challenges with apoptotic stimuli, PS341 and UV irradiation. Procaspase 3 cleavage was indicated by an increase in p17 or p12, its cleavage products during apoptosis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, these apoptosis markers were more prominent in the mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells than in the negative control GC-1 cells after exposure to apoptosis inducers, PS341 and UV irradiation. We also confirmed by FACS analysis that apoptosis increased in stable mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells after UV stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>).

To investigate an <italic>in vivo </italic>role for mRHBDD1, mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells and negative control GC-1 cells were transplanted into mouse seminiferous tubules and their survival and differentiation into spermatids were studied.

An early wave of germinal cell apoptosis during the first round of spermatogenesis in the immature testis is probably a critical requirement during testis development because it maintains a balanced ratio of germ cells to Sertoli cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, the elimination of supra-optimal production of spermatogonia by apoptosis is common in the adult testis, where it is primarily restricted to spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, apoptosis of defective germ cells is also essential for maintaining genetic fidelity in the development and survival of offspring. RHBDD1/mRHBDD1 may play a role in regulating these events.</p><p>The testis cell transplantation method has been developed as a powerful approach for studying spermatogenesis. It is also used to examine spermatogenic defects, to correct male infertility and to generate transgenic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Primary germ cells are the best model to perform these experiments, but there are some puzzles: 1) It is difficult to obtain enough spermatogonia cells from seminiferous tubules since these cells are a minority among germ cells. 2) The transfection efficiency of pRNAT-H1.1/Hygro-6# into spermatogonia is very low. 3) Most of spermatogonia transfected by plasmids will undergo death. To resolve the above problems, we have established a method for studying mammalian spermatogenesis using a GC-1 spermatogonia line transplantation model. Its distinct advantage is to make it much easier to obtain highly-purified GC-1 spermatogonia cells for experiments than by purifying primary spermatogonia cells from mouse seminiferous tubules.</p><p>The results of the current study show that transplanted control GC-1 cells can differentiate from spermatogonia into spermatids, indicating that they possess the properties of germ stem cells, capable of differentiating in an <italic>in vivo </italic>microenvironment. Furthermore, the appearance of spermatids derived from control GC-1 cells and from the residual endogenous germ cells that had resisted busulfan treatment in the seminiferous tubules showed that these damaged tubules maintained the ability to generate spermatids from spermatogonia. Thus, the disappearance of the mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells from the seminiferous tubules 8 weeks after transplantation is the direct result of endogenous mRHBDD1 suppression.</p><p>mRHBDD1 has anti-apoptotic potential, and its suppression in GC-1 cells vitiates spermatogonia survival and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells did not disappear from the mouse seminiferous tubules because they entered a morbid state and died; they showed normal survival and differentiation <italic>in vitro </italic>like the negative control GC-1 cells. Although the mechanism by which mRHBDD1 regulates mammalian spermatogenesis needs to be clarified, it seems quite logical that it occurs by regulating germ cell apoptosis, because mRHBDD1 knockdown GC-1 cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli than negative control cells. An apparently indispensable role for mRHBDD1 during this process has been demonstrated by the present <italic>in vivo </italic>results. This warrants additional studies to determine whether malfunction of this enzyme may be a basis of male infertility. This information may be useful for the development of a male contraceptive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mRHBDD1 gene may be associated with the regulation of mammalian spermatogenesis by regulating apoptosis in spermatogonia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>GC-1 cells, a mouse-derived spermatogonia line, were purchased from ATCC (ATCC number: CRL-2053) and cultured in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubators at 37&#x000b0;C.

A sample of approximately 10 &#x003bc;L of cell suspension was injected into the recipient mouse testis by the rete testis, whereby approximately 60%&#x02013;90% of the surface tubules were filled with cells. For each recipient mouse, one testis was used as the test site for the transplanted stably expressed pRNAT/H1.1/Hygro-negative and the contralateral testis was used for transplantation of the stably expressed pRNAT-H1.1/Hygro-6#.</p><p>At 8 weeks after transplantation, the treated and control testes were excised for histological examination. The testis tissues were embedded in O.C.T compound, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryosectioned. Forty sections were prepared from each testis and examined by fluorescent microscopy (Microphot Nikon) to identify the donor-derived germ cells. Sections were selected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, stained with TRITC/Rhodamine conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) (Sigma) to visualize acrosomes, followed by staining with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to visualize nuclei and re-examined by confocal laser microscopy (Leica, Germany).</p><p>In our experiment, approximately 80% of the surface tubules were filled with cells in the control and test testis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. Statistical comparisons used Student's t-test. P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YW, WS, SL and XG carried out all experiments.
