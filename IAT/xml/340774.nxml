The isolated reconstituted particles were partially digested with ribonuclease A, and the RNA fragments protected by the proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to sequence analysis. Protein S7 alone gave no protected fragments, but S7 together with S14 and S19 protected an RNA region comprising the sequences 936-965, 972-1030, 1208-1262 and 1285-1379 of the 16S RNA. Addition of increasing amounts of protein S9 to the S7/S14/S19 particle resulted in a parallel increase in the protection of the hairpin loop between bases 1262 and 1285. The results are discussed in terms of the three-dimensional folding of 16S RNA in the 30S subunit.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0034-a" xlink:role="3660"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0035-a" xlink:role="3661"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0037-a" xlink:role="3663"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3653"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3654"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3655"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3656"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3657"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3658"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3659"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3660"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3661"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3662"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3663"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3664"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3665"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3666"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3667"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3668"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3669"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00253-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3670"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
