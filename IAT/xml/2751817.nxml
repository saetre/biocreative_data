It provides an elegant mechanism that allows relatively few Dendritic cells (DCs) to initiate primary immune responses while avoiding the consumptive nature of pathogenic infection. CD8 T cells play a major role in anti-bacterial immune responses; however, the contribution of cross-presentation for priming CD8 T cell responses to bacteria, <italic>in vivo</italic>, is not well established. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Listeria</italic>) is the causative agent of Listeriosis, an opportunistic food-borne bacterial infection that poses a significant public health risk. Here, we employ a transgenic mouse model in which cross-presentation is uniquely inactivated, to investigate cross-priming during primary <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. We show that cross-priming deficient mice are severely compromised in their ability to generate antigen-specific T cells to stimulate MHC I-restricted CTL responses following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. The defect in generation of <italic>Listeria</italic>-elicited CD8 T cell responses is also apparent <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, in this setting, the endogenous route of processing <italic>Listeria</italic>-derived antigens is predominant. This reveals a new experimental dichotomy whereby functional sampling of <italic>Listeria</italic>-derived antigens <italic>in vivo</italic> but not <italic>in vitro</italic> is dependent on cross-presentation of exogenously derived antigen. Thus, under normal physiological circumstances, cross-presentation is demonstrated to play an essential role in priming CD8 T cell responses to bacteria.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antigen processing and subsequent presentation to specific T cells is necessary for effective bacterial immune responses involving both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

Such proteins are digested by the proteasome and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the transporters associated with antigen processing, TAP1 and TAP2 for loading on MHC I.

A key role of cross-priming <italic>in vivo</italic> has been demonstrated to initiate CTL immunity during virus infection in a system where only non-hematopoetic cells were infected and bone marrow-derived APCs were shown to be required to capture viral antigens from infected cells by cross-priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Sigal1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cross-presentation of bacterial antigens on MHC I has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Pfeifer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and several groups have provided data for a mechanism whereby apoptosis of infected cells would provide the source of antigen and result in uptake of bacteria-encoded antigens by bystander DCs which have the capacity to activate na&#x000ef;ve T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Yrlid1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Winau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, pathogen-infected APCs may be functionally compromised and DCs may not be directly infected. Thus, we pose that an exogenous pathway for processing bacterial-derived antigens to prime CD8 T cell responses would indeed be required; however, this has not been directly addressed. The contribution of cross-priming versus direct priming in immunity to such intracellular pathogens <italic>in vivo</italic> is therefore not well established owing to difficulties associated with distinguishing these mechanisms of initiating cellular immune responses.</p><p>Recent data from our laboratory demonstrated that MHC I trafficking is controlled by a highly conserved tyrosine located in the cytoplasmic tail of the class I molecule. Transgenic mice expressing either the wild type H-2K<sup>b</sup> MHC I allele (K<sup>b</sup>WT), or H-2K<sup>b</sup> containing a single point mutation substituting a phenylalanine residue for the conserved tyrosine in exon 6 of the molecule (&#x00394;Y) were generated and bred onto a H-2<sup>K</sup> background by backcrossing transgenic founders with C3H/He mice. Our results showed that the highly conserved MHC I cytoplasmic tyrosine residue forms part of an intracellular targeting motif that is required for routing of MHC I molecules through endolysosomal compartments in DCs where MHC I loading of cross-presented exogenous peptides occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Lizee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The functional consequences of the cytoplasmic tail mutation were demonstrated for two anti-viral CTL responses <italic>in vivo</italic> whereby the tyrosine mutation abrogated cross-priming of those viral epitopes. Here, we are using this transgenic model system to address the contribution of cross-priming during intracellular bacterial infection.</p><p><italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Listeria</italic>) is a gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen. It is the causative agent of listeriosis, a food borne disease characterized by systemic infection of <italic>Listeria</italic> disseminating from the intestine into the blood stream and organs. Listeriosis is the leading cause of death among pathogenic bacteria. Pregnant women, neonates, and elderly or immunocompromised individuals are particularly at risk from infection but apparently healthy individuals may also be affected. Listeriosis is normally sporadic with few cases per year but outbreaks of epidemic proportions still occur. Following entry into the host cell <italic>Listeria</italic> expresses a virulence factor, Listeriolysin O (LLO). This lyses the phagosomal membrane and allows the bacteria to escape the phagosome into the cytosol where it survives and replicates. <italic>Listeria</italic> infection can spread from cell to cell without entering the extracellular domain and therefore a functional CD8 T cell response is required for clearance of the bacteria and development of protective immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Unanue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Ladel1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Listeria</italic>-derived MHC I- restricted peptides may be generated from proteins secreted into the cytosol such as the virulence determinant, LLO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Villanueva1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, secreted bacterial proteins may be directed through the classical endogenous route of processing for presentation on MHC I.

Therefore, professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs) such as DCs may internalize antigens from infected cells or bacterially-derived apoptotic debris for initiation of CD8 T cell responses.</p><p>DCs are now considered essential for priming of na&#x000ef;ve CD8 T cell responses owing to their unique maturation and migration ability, high expression of co-stimulatory molecules, and unique pH sensing and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Savina1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, transgenic mice showed increased susceptibility to infection compared to wild type C57BL/6 regardless of the route of administration and therefore required a 20-1000 fold reduction in the dose of bacteria used for infection. This may be due in part to the different background strain of the transgenic mice since the expression of the H-2K<sup>b</sup> and &#x00394;Y H-2K<sup>b</sup> mutant genes have been bred to C3H/He animals and particular strains of mice have been shown to have distinct differences in resistance or susceptibility to <italic>Listeria</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007210-Cheers1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The novel findings that antigen-specific T cells are deficient in number and in function in &#x00394;Y mice following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrates that development of functional Ag-specific T cells is severely impaired following infection due to the MHC I cytoplasmic tail mutation and implies a dependence on MHC I targeting and cross-presentation of bacterial antigens for loading and subsequent priming of CD8 T cells. The failure of the CD8 Ag-specific T cells from &#x00394;Y mice to expand following infection could also be detected as a significantly lower total number of CD8 T cells recovered after infection. A model of early events in the T cell response to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection has been described whereby almost all peripheral T cells become partially activated within one day.

In this work, we have used the MHC I cytoplasmic tail transgenic mice to dissect the importance of the mechanism of cross-presentation within the overall context of MHC I presentation following bacterial infection. We observed that dose-dependent T cell responses are activated following infection of K<sup>b</sup>WT and &#x00394;Y bmDCs, indicating that the endogenous route of processing is predominant following direct infection.

However, we also observed that DCs from &#x00394;Y mice showed significantly reduced ability to activate T cells following direct infection with <italic>Listeria</italic>-OVA <italic>in vitro</italic> indicating the contribution of cross-presentation, probably due to the presence of extracellular dead bacteria.

It is proposed that surface K<sup>b</sup>WT molecules form an abundant source of MHC I for endosomal and lysosomal peptide-loading of exogenously-derived bacterial antigens. We examined loading of <italic>Listeria</italic>-OVA-derived antigens on APCs following direct infection of APCs and staining of MHC I-OVA complexes and despite significant differences between &#x00394;Y and K<sup>b</sup>WT APCs to stimulate T cell responses, were unable to detect significant differences in processing and loading of <italic>Listeria</italic>-derived OVA antigen. However, significant differences in the level of surface H-2K<sup>b</sup>-OVA<sub>(257&#x02013;264)</sub> complexes could be detected following infection and peptide pulsing. Considering our previous results, we propose that following infection, MHC molecules internalizing from the surface do not sort to compartments compatible with cross-presentation for recycling to the surface, causing an overall decrease in the level of H-2K<sup>b</sup>-OVA<sub>(257&#x02013;264)</sub> complexes present. The equilibrium of surface levels of MHC I molecules is a balance between new synthesis and constitutive internalization for degradation or recycling. Therefore, we conclude that aberrant recycling of MHC I molecules on &#x00394;Y APCs following infection may contribute to the decreased overall levels of surface H-2K<sup>b</sup>-OVA<sub>(257&#x02013;264)</sub> complexes, the differences of which are only detectable following peptide pulsing.</p><p>Overall, the contribution of cross-presentation is likely to differ depending on mode of infection i.e. direct infection of APCs versus oral infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007210-g007">Figure 7</xref> describes mechanisms of cross-presentation that may occur depending on the route of infection.

However, our data suggest that escape of the bacterium into the cytosol is predominant following infection <italic>in vitro</italic> whereby the bacterium is subsequently targeted for proteosome &#x02013;mediated degradation and endogenous processing. Conversely, our results establish that, indeed cross-priming of CD8 T cells is an essential mechanism required to generate primary cellular immune responses following <italic>in vivo</italic> infection with <italic>Listeria</italic>. A mechanism for priming of CD8 T cells following bacterial oral infection across the gastrointestinal barrier is likely through bystander acquisition of bacterial antigen.
