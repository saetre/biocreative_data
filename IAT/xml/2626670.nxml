The use of recombinant MTB antigens as subunit vaccines is a promising approach, but requires adjuvants that activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for elicitation of protective immunity. The mycobacterial cord factor Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM) and its synthetic analogue Trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) are effective adjuvants in combination with MTB subunit vaccine candidates in mice. However, it is unknown which signaling pathways they engage in APCs and how these pathways are coupled to the adaptive immune response. Here, we demonstrate that these glycolipids activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) via Syk&#x02013;Card9&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;Malt1 signaling to induce a specific innate activation program distinct from the response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. APC activation by TDB and TDM was independent of the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1, but required the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif&#x02013;bearing adaptor protein Fc receptor &#x003b3; chain (FcR&#x003b3;). In vivo, TDB and TDM adjuvant activity induced robust combined T helper (Th)-1 and Th-17 T cell responses to a MTB subunit vaccine and partial protection against MTB challenge in a Card9-dependent manner. These data provide a molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of TDB and TDM and identify the Syk&#x02013;Card9 pathway as a rational target for vaccine development against tuberculosis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>K.

In addition, the existing live vaccine, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG, lacks efficacy in most developing countries where the major burden of disease occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). This failure has been attributed to exposure to environmental mycobacteria that induces low-level antimycobacterial immunity and blocks the BCG vaccine &#x0201c;take&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The development of recombinant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) antigens as subunit vaccines is an attractive strategy, because they are not affected by prior exposure to mycobacteria and, in contrast to BCG, are safe in immunocompromised persons. However, elicitation of protective immunity to intracellular pathogens with recombinant subunit vaccines has not been straightforward.</p><p>During infection, or vaccination with BCG, the innate immune system recognizes so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in the activation of APCs. PAMPs derived from different classes of pathogens bind to diverse families of pattern recognition receptors that include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, or NOD-like receptors. These interactions decode pathogen information by triggering distinct signaling pathways to differentially activate APCs, thereby directing the adaptive effector response in a manner that is specifically tailored to the invading microbe. Ligands for TLRs, such as bacterial CpG DNA or LPS, activate signaling via the adaptor protein Myd88 and induce T helper (Th)-1&#x02013;directing cytokines like IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In contrast, the binding of the &#x003b2;-glucans Curdlan or Zymosan to the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 activates the kinase Syk, initiating signaling via the Card9&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;Malt1 pathway, and it can direct Th-17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Other immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)&#x02013;coupling receptors can trigger Syk&#x02013;Card9 activation in myeloid cells via the adaptor proteins Dap12 or Fc receptor &#x003b3; chain (FcR&#x003b3;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), but their effects on adaptive immune responses are not known.</p><p>Protection against MTB infection requires antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th-1 T lymphocytes producing IFN-&#x003b3;, which enables macrophages to kill intracellular mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The induction of IL-17&#x02013;producing Th-17 cells after immunization was recently shown to contribute to protection by rapid recruitment of effector cells, including Th-1 cells, to the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>Because recombinant protein antigens usually do not activate APCs, for successful use as subunit vaccines the addition of adjuvants is necessary. The adjuvant most widely used in humans is aluminum hydroxide, which induces antibody responses but only inefficiently primes T cell responses required for control of intracellular infections. CFA, an emulsion made of killed MTB, efficiently induces Th-1 responses in mice, but is too toxic for use in humans. In the search for adjuvants that are both safe and effective, purified PAMPs and their synthetic analogues have been investigated. The mycobacterial cell wall component Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM), also known as cord factor, has potent inflammatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and is used alone or in combination with a TLR4 ligand as an experimental adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The less toxic, synthetic cord factor analogue Trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB; for structures see Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) induces robust Th-1 immunity after vaccination with the recombinant MTB antigen H1, conferring protection to infection challenge with a reduction in mycobacterial load comparable to the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; BCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). H1 is a fusion of the MTB proteins Ag85B and ESAT-6 that is currently being tested as a subunit vaccine candidate in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). However, the mechanism(s) by which the glycolipid adjuvants TDB and TDM initiate protective T cell immunity, particularly how they activate APCs, are unknown.</p><p>Here, we report that the mycobacteria-derived glycolipid TDM and the synthetic adjuvant analogue TDB selectively activate the FcR&#x003b3;&#x02013;Syk&#x02013;Card9 pathway in APC to induce a unique innate immune activation program that directs protective Th-1 and -17 immunity after subunit MTB vaccination.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Priming of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 production by the adjuvant TDB</title><p>To characterize the adjuvant activity of TDB, we first immunized mice with H1 together with TDB or the TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1826, and investigated the priming of Th-1 and -17 T cell responses by restimulating lymph node cells with H1 in vitro. Both TDB and CpG induced a robust Th-1 T cell response characterized by profound antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, only TDB, and not CpG, also activated a strong H1-specific Th-17 T cell response, indicating that this glycolipid has an adjuvant activity that differs fundamentally from that of a classical TLR agonist (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because the immunostimulatory capacity of TDB presumably depends on direct effects on the innate immune system, we next analyzed the ability of TDB to activate APCs in vitro.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Th1/Th17 induction by TDB correlates with a distinct APC activation program.</bold> (A) C57BL/6 mice were s.c. immunized twice with H1 antigen mixed with CpG (CpG) or DDA-TDB (TDB) or left untreated (control). 2 wk after the last injection, draining lymph node cells were restimulated with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml H1 antigen for 96 h, followed by detection of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17.

TDB, as well as the cord factor TDM, induced substantial amounts of NO, especially after priming with IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, compared with CpG, the kinetics of TDB-mediated NO production was delayed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To investigate the differences in the effects of TDB and CpG on myeloid cell activation more generally, we next measured global changes in gene expression over time. As expected, both stimuli induced substantial transcriptional reprogramming, again with an overall slower response to TDB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We also observed qualitative differences in gene expression, as a hierarchical clustering revealed TDB-selective (cluster C) or CpG-selective gene induction (cluster D) in addition to common down- and up-regulated target genes (cluster A, B1) and genes induced early by CpG and later by TDB (cluster B2). Selected examples of TDB-induced genes were confirmed at the protein level, validating the microarray data (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1</ext-link>). We then focused on differentially expressed cytokines that can direct Th cell differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E&#x02013;G</xref>). IL-12p40 was strongly induced by CpG but not by TDB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), whereas IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; were expressed transiently after CpG and delayed after TDB treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). Notably, TDB, but not CpG, triggered a significant release of IL-1&#x003b2; into the culture supernatant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). We also analyzed the ability of TDB to activate DCs as the most potent APC. We found that TDB caused up-regulation of MHC-II and of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) and triggered cytokine and NO release in DCs in a manner similar to that in BMMs (Fig. S3). Thus, the adjuvant TDB potently activates APCs, in which it triggered a different expression program compared with TLR stimulation and presumably activates a distinct intracellular signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement for Syk and Card9 in TDB-/TDM-induced APC activation</title><p>Diverse pattern recognition receptor families use different proximal signaling proteins to mediate myeloid cell activation. Whereas most TLRs signal via the adaptor protein MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), certain ITAM receptors or ITAM-coupled receptors like C-type lectins use the kinase Syk for downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). To study whether any of these pathways are required for TDB-mediated cell activation we used MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). As expected, control stimulation with TLR agonists resulted in normal production of NO in Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, but was ineffective in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs. In contrast, TDB and TDM induced NO production in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells to a similar extent as in wild-type cells, but did not stimulate NO synthesis in the absence of Syk. Furthermore, the TDB-stimulated expression and production of IL-6 by Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs was largely intact (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1</ext-link>), whereas Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs failed to produce IL-6 and -1&#x003b2; (Fig. S5). As the small molecule Syk inhibitor Piceatannol blocked NO release induced by TDB and TDM from BMMs in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S6), the enzymatic function of Syk is essential for the Myd88-independent innate immune cell activation in response to these glycolipids in vitro<italic>.</italic> Interestingly, Geisel et al. reported that Myd88 is required for cord factor&#x02013;induced inflammation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Further, we have recently found that Myd88 is required for the Th1-directing adjuvant effect of TDB in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Because TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 were not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), the phenotype of Myd88 knockout mice in vivo may indicate a defect in the glycolipid-induced effector phase, e.g., downstream of the IL-1 receptor.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TDB-/TDM-induced APC activation is independent of Myd88, yet requires Syk activity.</bold> (A and B) Wild-type, Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs primed with IFN-&#x003b3; were stimulated for 60 h (A) and 96 h (B) before NO release was measured.

We therefore used Card9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs to test whether APC activation by TDB requires this adaptor protein. Similar to Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs, cells lacking Card9 failed to produce NO in response to TDB (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1</ext-link>) and to up-regulate expression of iNOS, IL-6, or IL-1&#x003b2;, whereas the CpG-mediated expression of these molecules was largely unaffected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Gene expression profiling was used to determine whether Card9 is required for all transcriptional responses to TDB stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The &#x003b2;-glucan Curdlan, which is a ligand of the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 that is known to signal via Card9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and TDB induced very similar genome-wide transcriptional responses that were distinct from the pattern of CpG-induced activation. In the absence of Card9, responses to TDB and Curdlan were almost completely abrogated, whereas CpG-triggered gene expression was unaffected. To further study the function of Card9 in TDB-induced APC activation, we also analyzed DCs and found that the release of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1;, as well as nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, was triggered by TDB in a strictly Card9-dependent manner (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9). In contrast to BMMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), DCs also produced IL-12p40 after stimulation with TDB or Curdlan, as well as IL-12p70 and -23, which are all dependent on Card9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Notably, LPS was a far stronger inducer of these Th differentiation factors than TDB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Curdlan was comparably weak in IL-12 induction, in agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). It is known that Card9 can couple to the downstream adaptor and scaffold proteins Bcl10 and Malt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Using TNF-&#x003b1; production by DCs as readout for Bcl10 and Malt1 signaling, we found an additional requirement for these molecules in the response to TDB and TDM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Thus, these experiments demonstrate on a genetic and transcriptional level that TDB and TDM engage a specific innate pathway that depends on Syk kinase activity and the adaptor proteins Card9, Bcl10, and Malt1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>TDB/TDM activate APCs via Card9&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;Malt1.</bold> (A) BMM were stimulated with 1 &#x003bc;M CpG or 40 &#x003bc;g/ml TDB for 72 h.

In addition, the expression of Nos2 and IL-1&#x003b2; after stimulation with TDB, TDM, and LPS was independent of Dectin-1 (Fig. S10, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081445/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, Dectin-1 is not required for TDB-/TDM-induced macrophage activation. In contrast to Dectin-1, which possesses an ITAM-like motif in its cytoplasmic region, a large number of Syk-activating myeloid cell receptors are associated with one of the ITAM-bearing adaptor proteins Dap12 or FcR&#x003b3; (encoded by the <italic>Fcer1g</italic> gene). To gain further insight into the signaling requirements of APC activation by TDB and TDM, we used Dap12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Fcer1g<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). Expression of Nos2 was independent of Dap12 in response to TLR ligands, Curdlan, and TDB/TDM. In contrast, in Fcer1g<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, BMM expression of Nos2 and production of NO were specifically abrogated after stimulation with TDB or TDM, whereas TLR-triggered and Dectin-1&#x02013;induced activation was intact. The specific requirement for FcR&#x003b3;, but not Dap12, was also found for TDB-/TDM-induced expression of IL-6 (Fig. S11). Therefore, the ITAM-bearing adaptor FcR&#x003b3; is critical for linking TDB and TDM recognition to the Syk&#x02013;Card9 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of TDB-/TDM adjuvant activity in Card9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>The Syk&#x02013;Card9 pathway is a pattern recognition pathway that can couple to adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).

This protective effect correlated with the Card9-dependent induction of antigen-specific Th-17 cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes after vaccination, but not with the frequency of H1-specific IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>).

The precise receptor(s) that recognize(s) TDB or TDM remain(s) to be determined. As we have excluded an essential role of Dectin-1, its contribution to the activation of APCs by whole mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) is likely caused by mycobacterial ligands distinct from TDM. Given the multitude of receptors that can activate Syk&#x02013;Card9 in myeloid cells, our finding that the ITAM-bearing adaptor FcR&#x003b3;, but not Dap12, is essential for activation of macrophages by TDB and TDM provides a starting point for the isolation of pattern recognition receptors for these mycobacterial glycolipids. Although Dap12-coupled molecules like TREMs, Sirpb, and PILR-b are unlikely to be involved, some C-type lectins (e.g., Mincle, Dectin-2, and DCAR), as well as other FcR&#x003b3;-coupled proteins (e.g., OSCAR and PIRA), can be considered candidate receptors.</p><p>Our results further indicate that TDB and TDM constitute adjuvants with a now molecularly defined mode of action that is distinct from TLR-triggering adjuvants engaging Myd88 (CpG and IC31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) or Trif (Monophosphoryl Lipid A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). It is intriguing that the innate activation program induced by the mycobacterial cord factor and its analogue TDB instructs the development of the appropriate, protective Th-1 and -17 response. Consistent with recent findings that established the importance of Th-17 cells after subunit vaccination using a TDM-containing adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), the degree of Th-17 cell induction correlated with protection to MTB-challenge in our experiments. According to the current concept of murine and human Th-17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), TDB likely operates through the combined induction of IL-1&#x003b2;, -6, and -23 from APCs, whereas CpG may inhibit Th-17 differentiation through IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Our finding that the glycolipid adjuvants TDB and TDM mediate their protective effects via Syk&#x02013;Card9 signaling provides a rational basis for the further development of efficient TB immunization strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan-Winkelmann.
