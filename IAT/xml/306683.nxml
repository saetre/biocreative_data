We isolated several clones of Dhm1, a mouse homolog of dhp1+, from mouse spermatocyte cDNA library and determined its nucleotide sequence. The Dhm1 gene consists of an open reading frame predicting a protein with 947 amino acids and molecular weight of 107,955. Northern blot analysis revealed that Dhm1 is transcribed at high level in testis, liver and kidney. The predicted product of Dhm1 (Dhm1p) has a significant homology with Dhp1p, Hke1p/Rat1p/Tap1p and Dst2p. In particular, Dhm1p, Dhp1p and Hke1p/Rat1p/Tap1p share strong similarity at the two regions of their N- and C-terminal parts. The Dhm1 gene on a multicopy plasmid rescued the temperature-sensitivity of dhp1ts and lethality of dhp1 null mutation, suggesting that Dhm1 is a mouse homolog of S.pombe dhp1+ and functions similarly in mouse as dhp1+.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0060-a" xlink:role="360"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0060-b" xlink:role="360"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="357"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="358"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="360"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="361"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
