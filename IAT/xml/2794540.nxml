All SUMOs are synthesized as propeptides that are post-translationally cleaved prior to conjugation. After processing, SUMOs become covalently conjugated to cellular targets through a pathway that is similar to ubiquitination. <underline>U</underline>biquitin <underline>l</underline>ike protein <underline>p</underline>roteases/<underline>Sen</underline>trin specific <underline>p</underline>roteases (Ulp/SENPs) mediate both processing and deconjugation of SUMOs. The action of Ulp/SENPs makes SUMOylation a highly dynamic post-translational modification. To investigate how Ulp/SENPs are regulated in a developmental context, we isolated and characterized all Ulp/SENPs in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. <italic>Xenopus</italic> possess homologues of mammalian SENP3, 5, 6 and 7. All of these enzymes reacted with HA-tagged vinyl sulfone derivatives of SUMO-2 (HA-SU2-VS) but not SUMO-1 (HA-SU1-VS), suggesting that they act primarily on SUMO-2 and -3. In contrast, <italic>Xenopus</italic> possess a single member of the SENP1/SENP2 subfamily of Ulp/SENPs, most closely related to mammalian SENP1. <italic>Xenopus</italic> SENP1 reacted with HA-SU1-VS and HA-SU2-VS, suggesting that it acts on all SUMO paralogues. We analyzed the mRNA and protein levels for each of the Ulp/SENPs through development; we found that they show distinct patterns of expression that may involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, we have characterized the developmental function of the most abundant Ulp/SENP found within <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, SENP3. Depletion of SENP3 using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (morpholinos) caused accumulation of high molecular weight SUMO-2/3 conjugated species, defects in developing embryos and changes in the expression of some genes regulated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) pathway. These findings collectively indicate that SUMO proteases are both highly regulated and essential for normal development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>SUMOs are among the most important and widely studied Ubiquitin-like proteins, with diverse roles in almost every critical aspect of nuclear function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-GeissFriedlander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Hay1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Seeler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mature SUMO proteins become covalently conjugated to other proteins through isopeptide linkage between their C-termini and &#x003b5;-amino groups of lysines within the targets. Budding and fission yeast both express a single SUMO protein, while vertebrate cells express three major SUMO paralogues (SUMO-1-3). After processing, mature SUMO-2 and -3 are &#x0223c;95&#x00025; identical to each other, while SUMO-1 is &#x0223c;45&#x00025; identical to SUMO-2 or -3. Where they are functionally indistinguishable, SUMO-2 and &#x02212;3 will be collectively called SUMO-2/3 in this report. Modification of proteins by SUMOylation is transient and dynamic, due to the rapid turnover of conjugated species by SUMO proteases.

The roles of individual SUMO pathway enzymes in controlling developmental events have not been well characterized.</p><p>To develop a better understanding of the developmental control of Ulp/SENPs, we have cloned a comprehensive set of Ulp/SENPs from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. Interestingly, while clear homologues exist for mammalian SENP3, SENP5, SENP6 and SENP7, there was a single member of the SENP1/SENP2 branch of evolutionary tree in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, which we will call SENP1 here. SENP1 reacted with HA-tagged vinyl sulfone derivatives of both SUMO-2 (HA-SU2-VS) and SUMO-1 (HA-SU1-VS), suggesting that it recognizes all SUMO paralogues in a manner similar to mammalian SENP1. By contrast, all other <italic>Xenopus</italic> SENPs showed a strong preference for HA-SU2-VS, suggesting that they primarily act on SUMO-2/3. We analyzed the complement of SENPs present in eggs and early embryos, and found that SENP1, 3, 6 and 7 are detectably present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs. SENP1 and 3 persisted throughout development, although there was some variation in SENP1 levels near the midblastula transition (MBT). SENP6 and 7 were also clearly detectable in early embryos but declined dramatically in abundance around Stage 26 (tail bud stage). Finally, we characterized the developmental function of the most abundant Ulp/SENP found within <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, SENP3. Depletion of SENP3 using morpholinos caused changes in the profile of SUMO-2/3 conjugated species, defects in developing embryos and changes in the expression of some genes regulated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) pathway. Our findings collectively indicate that SUMO proteases are both differentially regulated and essential for development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of <italic>Xenopus</italic> SENPs</title><p>As a prelude to developmental analysis of the Ulp/SENPs, we used <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> databases to identify cDNAs and genomic sequences encoding Ulp/SENPs. We initially found five <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cDNAs encoding proteins with Ulp/SENP catalytic domains. Comparison of these sequences to mammalian SENPs indicated that they corresponded to SENP1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008462-t001">Table 1</xref>). These assignments were similar both in the context of the full sequences of each protein, and in the context of the catalytic domains alone, and were also consistent with earlier reports related to SENP proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Yun1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Yukita2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The most remarkable feature of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> sequences was the absence of an apparent homologue to mammalian SENP2. We considered the possibility that this cDNA was underrepresented within the database. We examined the genomic sequence of a closely related species, <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, and found that it had a similar complement of five Ulp/SENPs that lacked SENP2.

However, Western blots with antibodies against other SENPs showed no significant shift toward reduced mobility forms upon incubation with HA-SU1-VME (data not shown), indicating that the bulk of these proteins had not formed adducts with HA-SU1-VME. The SENP1-HA-SU1-VME adduct consistently showed a dip in abundance around Stage 11 (gastrula), but returned higher levels during Stage 15-26, in parallel with modulations of its mRNA. Consistent with this finding, antibodies against SENP1 recognized a band that showed adduct formation with HA-SU1-VME as well as HA-SU2-VME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008462-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), and that showed a comparable variation in abundance during development.

Some of them (SENP1, SENP3 and SENP6) showed correspondence between the mRNA and protein levels through Stage 26. Changes in SENP1 mRNA and protein levels around the MBT were particularly striking, and may suggest that SENP1 undergoes turnover and re-synthesis around this time. While the SENP7 mRNA showed changes in abundance that were similar to the SENP1 mRNA, SENP7 protein levels did not change in close parallel. After Stage 26, SENP1, SENP6 and SENP7 protein levels all declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008462-g003">Figure 3</xref>), despite the persistence of corresponding mRNAs. It is thus possible that these SENPs are subject to post-transcriptional regulation during later development.

In comparison, less than 30&#x00025; of Control-MO-injected embryos showed similar deformities. Considering these features separately: 31&#x00025; of control embryos showed defects in body structure. The level of body defects was enhanced roughly two-fold in the SENP3-MO-injected embryos, to around 61&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008462-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). A more dramatic difference was observed in eye development; only 9&#x00025; of the Control-MO-injected embryos showed ocular defects. By contrast, 77&#x00025; of the SENP3-MO-injected embryos showed ocular defects, roughly a 8.5-fold increase over the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008462-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We were not able to rescue the developmental defects of SENP3-MO-injected embryos through microinjection of mRNA encoding SENP3. Interpretation of our results may therefore be limited by some possibility that the SENP3-MO also disrupts the expression of other mRNAs. More likely, however, this failure to rescue may reflect a requirement for high levels of SENP3 protein expression or for precise regulation of SENP3 expression that could not be recapitulated by the exogenous mRNA. Despite these limitations, our findings collectively suggest that SENP3 is essential for the maintenance of an appropriate spectrum of SUMOylated species during early development, and they are consistent with the notion that disruption of this spectrum has severe consequences for developing embryos, particularly for ocular structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Disruption of Gene Regulation in SENP3-Depleted Embryos</title><p>Given the links between SUMOylation and the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Lee1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Imoto1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Long1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Long2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Daniels1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Lin1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008462-Liang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, we speculated that the defects we observed in eye development might reflect disregulation of this signaling cascade.

While these findings may help to account for the developmental phenotypes of SENP3-depleted embryos, they do not provide a direct mechanism of action for SENP3 in this pathway.
