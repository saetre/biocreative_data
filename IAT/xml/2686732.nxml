S100A12 is an important factor in host/parasite defenses and in the inflammatory response. Like several other S100 proteins, it binds zinc and copper in addition to calcium. Mechanisms of zinc regulation have been proposed for a number of S100 proteins e.g. S100B, S100A2, S100A7, S100A8/9. The interaction of S100 proteins with their targets is strongly dependent on cellular microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The aim of the study was to explore the factors that influence S100A12 oligomerization and target interaction. A comprehensive series of biochemical and biophysical experiments indicated that changes in the concentration of calcium and zinc led to changes in the oligomeric state of S100A12. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed that the presence of both calcium and zinc is essential for the interaction of S100A12 with one of its extracellular targets, RAGE &#x02013; the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products. By using a single-molecule approach we have shown that the presence of zinc in tissue culture medium favors both the oligomerization of exogenous S100A12 protein and its interaction with targets on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that oligomerization and target recognition by S100A12 is regulated by both zinc and calcium. Our present work highlighted the potential role of calcium-binding S100 proteins in zinc metabolism and, in particular, the role of S100A12 in the cross talk between zinc and calcium in cell signaling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>S100A12 and other proteins of this family have been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Human S100A12 was discovered in blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It was estimated that it constituted about 5% of total cytosolic protein in resting neutrophils. Soon after this discovery the first data on S100A12 functional activity were reported. A calgranulin-related protein (CGRP) was purified from the extracts of the human parasite <italic>Onchocerca volvulus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A search for S100A12 binding sites on another helminth, <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>, resulted in the identification of paramyosin, a muscle protein localized just below the parasite's cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A further search of S100A12 targets led to the discovery of RAGE &#x02013; the Receptor of Advanced Glycation End products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor and a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RAGE is linked to cellular dysfunction in several inflammatory disorders, in tumors and in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was proposed that the interaction of RAGE with S100A12 mediates proinflammatory effects on lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Existence of another receptor, different from RAGE, was suggested in the recent report on the effect of S100A12 and its "hinge" peptide on mast cell and monocyte recruitement. Interactions with an as yet unidentified G-protein coupled receptor were proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These and other data indicate that extracellular S100A12 interactions with its diverse targets may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] including some neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. High-resolution structural data of RAGE/S100 complex are still unavailable. However, a significant impact on the mechanism of these interactions has been made by X-ray crystallography of S100A12 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and NMR studies of RAGE/S100A12 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>A few intracellular targets of S100A12 namely cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase A (aldolase), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenese (GAPDH), annexin V and S100A9 have also been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The ability of S100A12 for translocation to the cellular membrane and its secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] raises a question whether some of its targets are able to form a complex with a transport function. These putative "S100 transporters" are still unknown. However S100A13 multiprotein secreted complex has recently been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Several S100 proteins bind zinc. Two major types of zinc-binding sites (with and without cysteine residues) have been identified. The cysteine free Zn-binding site was fully characterized from the 3D structure of S100A7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and S100B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Different zinc-binding motifs containing cysteine were suggested for S100A2 based on the NMR data and homology modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. S100 proteins were characterized by a wide range of zinc binding constant (S100B [Kd 90 nM], S100A2 [Kd 25 nM], S100A3 [Kd 1.5 &#x003bc;M], S100A5 [Kd 2 &#x003bc;M], S100A6 [Kd 0.1 &#x003bc;M] and S100A7 [Kd 100 &#x003bc;M]), and in each case a conformational change was observed upon binding of Zn<sup>2+ </sup>ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Zinc binding constant for pig S100A12 was estimated from fluorescence titration curves (Kd &#x0003c; 10 nM), binding of zinc caused a large increase (~1500-fold) in its affinity for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An opposite effect has been shown for S100A2 protein. Recent findings suggest that Zn<sup>2+ </sup>might deactivate S100A2 by inhibiting response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The role of Zn in S100 Ca binding proteins is so far not clear. However, evidence of the influence of zinc on the levels of the intracellular calcium started to emerge. In particular, changes in the extracellular zinc concentrations triggered a release of calcium from the intracellular pools in colonocytic cell line HT29, so the presence of an uncharacterized zinc-sensing receptor was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In another study, zinc inhibited calcium influx by blocking store-operated calcium channel (SOCC) in human salivary gland cells suggesting redox-dependent regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Despite its clinical importance little is known about cellular signaling mechanisms that sense changes in extracellular zinc concentration. A missing link between extracellular zinc and regulation of cellular physiological processes might be an important cellular transduction pathway in the cross talk between the cell and its microenvironment. Although the total zinc concentration in serum is about 15 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], almost all of that is bound to the proteins, with a very wide range of zinc affinity from picomolar to micromolar levels, which means that zinc is exchangeable and this exchange depends on the local concentration of zinc binding proteins with different Zn<sup>2+ </sup>affinity.</p><p>Our present work draws attention to a potentially significant role of S100 proteins in Zn metabolism. Zn binding to S100A12 protein provides a greater diversity of protein conformational changes and therefore may dramatically modulate its function as a result of changes in the cellular microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>S100A12 binds to the cellular surface in a zinc dependent manner</title><p>The viability and growth of tissue cell culture cell lines depend on the presence of metal ions in a cell culture medium. Fluctuations of extracellular zinc appear to be a significant aspect of cellular signal transduction. Several well established tissue cell culture mediums contain remarkably different concentrations of divalent cations such as calcium, zinc and copper (see Methods). Though the experiments with cells exposed to Zn or Cu are sometimes difficult to interpret numerous data indicate a target upstream of the intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p>We analyzed the binding of S100A12 to the cellular surface of human gastric carcinoma MKN74 cells in RPMI-1640 and F12 medium. This cell line expresses an elevated level of endogenous RAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To reduce the rate of endocytosis the binding reaction was performed at 10&#x000b0;C or at room temperature. We demonstrated that S100A12 could be detected on the cellular surface by using near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). Remarkably the S100A12 binding in F12 medium containing zinc showed a different binding pattern compared to that of zinc depleted RPMI-1640 medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Morphologically many bright speckles (0.6 clusters/square micrometer) of fluorescence were detected on the cell surface in the F12 zinc containing medium. In the RPMI-1640 medium the number of fluorescent dots were markedly decreased to less than 0.2 clusters/square micrometer. We suggest that incubation of MKN74 cells in the Zn containing medium in the presence of exogeneous recombinant S100A12 led to the more efficient binding of S100A12 to cell surface receptors or other molecules. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Although these results do not allow us to distinguish between the various dimeric, tetrameric and hexameric structures suggested by X-ray analysis and other analytical techniques, it is obvious that clustering and assembly of S100A12 with extracellular receptors in the presence of zinc are significantly enhanced. It is very likely that oligomerisation occurs in the solution and oligomers are then trapped on the cellular surface as large clusters in the range of 100&#x02013;400 nm. We can suggest that such observed clustering is a combined result of S100A12 and receptor aggregation. It was intriguing to speculate that S100A12 cellular binding activity could be a property associated with protein conformational changes mediated by the action of both Ca and Zn ions.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>NSOM topography and fluorescent images of MKN74 cells treated with S100A12</bold>. in F12 (<bold>A</bold>) and RPMI 1640 (<bold>B</bold>) cell media. Major fraction of the clusters detected has an intensity of ~2 MHz (million counts per second). Fractions with intensities ~4, 8, and 10 MHz were also detected suggesting the presence of S100 aggregates greater than hexamers. Total number of clusters detected was ~500/image.

Cells were stained with affinity-purified rabbit anti-S100A12.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-11-1"/></fig><p>These results were also confirmed by confocal fluorescent microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D, E</xref>). Both sets of data provide evidence that the presence of Zn in cell culture medium is important for S100A12 oligomerization and its binding to cell surface molecules. Cellular assays at this stage of research were postponed due to a very complicated interpretation of S100A12 binding targets. It was shown that different extracellular molecules such as heparin sulphate proteoglycans were able to bind S100A12 and other S100 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. RAGE receptor &#x02013; the primary S100A12 target &#x02013; is not uniformly glycosylated <italic>in vivo </italic>and only a small proportion of RAGE molecules are able to form a productive complex with its ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], (Srikrishna &#x00026; Freeze, unpublished results). Therefore our further experiments were focused on <italic>in vitro </italic>studies to demonstrate that zinc/calcium-dependent oligomerization of S100A12 may be an additional and very important factor contributing to its target interactions; this was probed on the example of the best known interaction partner, RAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface plasmon resonance</title><p>We have exploited surface plasmon resonance technique to analyze the binding of S100A12 to immobilized RAGE with different Ca and Zn concentrations in greater detail <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results show that the interaction of these molecules depends both on Ca and Zn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). More detailed studies on affinity and on/off-rates could not be calculated from these SPR curves as they do not fit into any reliable binding model. Therefore we used immobilized S100A12 to show affinity of the S100A12/RAGE interaction, which is in the nanomolar range [4.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>M], and calculated kon [6.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>1/(M&#x000d7;s)], koff [3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>1/s] and Chi<sup>2 </sup>[0.47] values after fitting the response curve to a 1:1 Langmuir model.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Surface plasmon resonance analysis of S100A12-RAGE interaction</bold>.

Kinetic and affinity analysis of RAGE binding to immobilized S100A12. Recombinant human RAGE/Fc (125 nM) was injected over a surface where recombinant S100A12 was immobilized at a density of 2,933 RU on a CM5 chip using amine coupling chemistry. Samples were injected for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 &#x003bc;l/min. HBS-P buffer (Biacore) containing 1 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and 20 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2+ </sup>was used as sample and running buffer. The sensorgram obtained after injection of 125 nM RAGE (straight line) was perfectly fit to a 1:1 Langmuir model (dotted line; BIAevaluation software; Biacore) for calculation of affinity and on-/off-rates. The K<sub>D</sub>, kon, koff and Chi<sup>2 </sup>values were calculated to: 4.6 &#x000d7; 10-9 M; 6.8 &#x000d7; 104 1/Ms; 3.2 &#x000d7; 10-4 1/s; and 0.47, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-11-2"/></fig><p>The most likely explanation for the differences in the SPR results for binding of RAGE to immobilized S100A12 vs that of S100A12 to immobilized RAGE lies in the different ways the proteins are attached to the surface. Because we used amine coupling, we are unable to say for sure how exactly each of the proteins was attached. We can suppose, however, that in the case of S100A12-to-RAGE there was more hindrance of the immobilized protein (in other words &#x02013; the recognition site was partially obstructed). Moreover, each of the proteins could be attached by a number of different sites, and this possibly complicated the analysis of the results for the case of immobilized RAGE. Nevertheless, the main aim of the study, namely, showing the effect of calcium and zinc on the interaction between S100A12 and RAGE has been achieved.</p></sec><sec><title>Translational Diffusion of S100A12 in the presence of Zn and Ca ions</title><p>Large biomolecular oligomers scatter light disproportionally stronger than the monomers resulting in a dynamic light scattering (DLS) bias towards multimers. Solution NMR experiments are more sensitive to the smaller oligomers, thus, presenting a complimentary approach to DLS. Pulsed field gradient NMR experiments were used to measure translational diffusion coefficient of the apo-form of S100A12 and its divalent complexes with Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively. Fitting the experimental data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) to the theoretical dependence of the signal attenuation on the strength of the gradient field (Eq 6 and 7), we obtained the values for the translation diffusion coefficients for apo-, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+ </sup>forms of S100A12 of 1.12 &#x000b1; 0.07&#x000b7;10<sup>-10 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s, 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.06&#x000b7;10<sup>-10</sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s, and 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.07&#x000b7;10<sup>-10</sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. According to (Eq 5), ratio between translational diffusion coefficients is inversely proportional to the ratio of hydrodynamic radii of the oligomers. Based on the NMR data we have obtained the value for the ratio between radii of 1:1.18:2.11 for apo-S100A12, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 respectively. This value can be directly compared to the ratio derived from the DLS data 1:1.25:3.09 (data not shown). The difference between the DLS and NMR results suggests that binding of divalent ions to S100A12 produces a complex mixture of exchanging oligomers in solution. Both the size and the relative population of the oligomers are increasing with the addition of Zn ions.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Decay of the integrated NMR signal intensity</bold>. of the apo-S100A12 (squares), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 (circles), and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 (triangles) as a function of the magnetic field gradients.

In contrast, slower migrating bands could be detected when the same amount of the protein was run in 2 mM Ca (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), these possibly corresponded to the tetramers and a much smaller amount of hexamers. In the presence of 5 &#x003bc;M Zn the bands possibly corresponded to a tetramer-hexamer transition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and with 10 &#x003bc;M Zn &#x02013; hexamers or some degree of aggregation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). These bands could represent the tetramers and hexamers that were suitable for detection by size exclusion chromatography and MS. In the presence of both Ca and Zn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) only a single band was visible. Both TPEN (zinc-chelator) and EDTA (divalent ion-chelator), but not BCS (copper I-chelator) inhibit hexamer-formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). S100A12 was next pre-treated with TPEN to remove all zinc from the preparations. The protein was then dialyzed back into a Zn-free and TPEN-free buffer, and re-substituted with Zn, Cu, or Ca before loading the gel. There were no tetramers/hexamers in the absence of zinc, which is also not influenced by addition of copper. When re-substituting Zn, there is a tetramer/hexamer formation, which is also induced to a lesser extent by adding calcium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Native PAGE and overlay of size-exclusion chromatograms of S100A12 in the presence of EDTA and different cations</bold>.

When the buffer contained 10 &#x003bc;M zinc the protein size corresponded to a tetramer. With 1 mM calcium it was mostly a dimer, but with a "shoulder" of a tetrameric fraction, with higher calcium concentration this "shoulder" reshaped forming a low peak closer to a hexamer, and finally, in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M zinc only 2 mM calcium was enough for a complete transition to a hexameric form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ESI-MS analysis of S100A12 and its complexes with the group IIa and IIb metals</title><p>We first determined the capillary potential in the ion source required to observe metallo-S100A12 complexes in the gas phase, since excessively high capillary potential causes dissociation of non-covalent complexes.

At this potential, dimers containing two zincs ions persisted, whereas for apo-S100A12, only monomers were evident. Thus, metal-bound complexes are more stable than apo-complexes in the gas phase that has also been previously observed by Alfonso et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>We also examined the binding of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+ </sup>and Co<sup>2+ </sup>ions to S100A12 dimers. Fully saturated complexes were formed at Cu concentrations above 10 &#x003bc;M (not shown) and at calcium concentrations above 100 &#x003bc;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). However, adding Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+ </sup>and Co<sup>2+ </sup>did not result in any new species in the mass spectra (not shown), suggesting that Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding to S100A12 dimers is specific.</p><p>Next we assessed calcium binding to S100A12 dimers in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M Zn; at this concentration each S100A12 dimer contained predominantly two Zn ions. At 1 &#x003bc;M calcium, one or two calcium ions were bound to S100A12 dimers, whereas no calcium was bound to apo-S100A12. At a Ca concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M, up to three calcium ions were bound to each S100A12 dimer, and the average number of calcium ions bound was 1.1 per dimer <italic>versus </italic>0.16 per dimer in the absence of Zn ions. When the Ca concentration was increased to 100 &#x003bc;M, no signal was observed, suggesting that larger oligomeric species were formed. The intensity of each species present at different calcium concentrations is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>. These data show that bound Zn increases the affinity of the S100A12 dimers for Ca.</p><p>To detect oligomeric species in the presence of Ca and Zn ions, we increased the concentration of S100A12 to 200 &#x003bc;M. Adding 100 &#x003bc;M Zn and 200 &#x003bc;M Ca produced S100A12 dimers, tetramers and hexamers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Increasing the concentration of Zn and Ca ions to 200 &#x003bc;M and 400 &#x003bc;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), respectively, shifted the equilibria towards the higher order oligomers, with hexamers as the dominant species and dimers almost absent from the spectrum. Hexamers were observed in the +16, +17 and +18 charge states, while tetramers were observed in the +13, +14 and +15 charge states. Spectra with no metal ions contained dimers and some tetramers, but no hexamers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><p>The total ion signal intensity decreases with increasing concentrations of metal ions. This decrease correlates with the binding affinity of the ions for S100A12 (data not shown). For example, to decrease the signal intensity by 50%, Zn, which binds to S100A12 with the highest affinity, required the lowest concentration (1 &#x003bc;M) followed by Cu (10 &#x003bc;M) and Ca (100 &#x003bc;M). The most likely explanation for this decrease is protein aggregation. Results using DLS and size exclusion chromatography confirm the presence of highly oligomerised species. Finally, the presence of a substantial population of tetrameric intermediates suggests that formation of S100A12 hexamers may not be cooperative as is the case for the formation of insulin hexamers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tyrosine fluorescence titration of S100A12 with bivalent metal cations</title><p>We used intrinsic protein fluorescence as a sensitive assessment of ion binding and changes in protein conformation. Two tyrosine residues, Y17 and Y86 contribute to the intrinsic fluorescence of S100A12. We monitored the changes in tyrosine fluorescence as a result of titration with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and a combination of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The addition of 50 &#x003bc;M EDTA into the solution of S100A12 did not result in any noticeable change in the protein fluorescence (data not shown) that confirmed the apo-state of the prepared and purified protein. Titration of S100A12 with Ca at pH 7.4 (10-mM HEPES buffer) resulted in a gradual decrease in the tyrosine fluorescence intensity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>) with a minor peak shift of 1&#x02013;2 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The change in the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence intensity with Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was well fit to one-site binding model (eq. 1). Since S100A12 has two Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sites, we assume that one site does not affect the tyrosine fluorescence. This is in agreement with similar observations we have made earlier [unpublished data] for S100A4 protein and its mutants lacking N-terminal or C-terminal tyrosines. The best fit gave an estimated value of <italic>K </italic>= (5.9 &#x000b1; 1.7)*10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>-1 </sup>for the equilibrium constant of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding reaction. This value was higher than the previously reported one, (1.9 &#x000b1; 0.4)*10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>-1 </sup>for pig granulocytes S100A12 at pH 7.4 in Tris-HCl buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For comparison, we repeated the fluorescence titration experiment in 25-mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer and obtained the value of (1.2 &#x000b1; 0.7)*10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>-1</sup>, which is consistent with the previously reported result.</p><p>In contrast to calcium, S100A12 titration with zinc resulted in non-monotonic changes in tyrosine fluorescence that might indicate the occurrence of at least two different binding sites for this ion. However, (i) the predominant dimeric appearance of apo-S100A12 and (ii) strong protein aggregation in the presence of a small amount of Zn complicates the interpretation of the fluorescence titration data (see Discussion). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, the peak fluorescence intensity decreases sharply by ~5% at low Zn<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations (from 2 &#x003bc;M to 6 &#x003bc;M) and increases at higher concentrations reaching a level exceeding the initial intensity by ~10% at sub-millimolar Zn concentrations (intensity changed from 309&#x02192;295&#x02192;337 a.u.). It is interesting, that previously, a steady increase in fluorescence intensity for Zn titration curves has been reported for S100A12 obtained from pig granulocytes, and a single high affinity Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding site per a monomer has been proposed. A non-monotonic fluorescence change on zinc titration has been reported also for S100A8/A9 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

Calcium titration curve for the protein at low zinc concentration was completely different, with a very gradual increase of the intensity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>); this could be interpreted as weak calcium binding to the aggregated protein. It is noteworthy here that we are not reporting on the quantitative aspects of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding (exact number of binding cations per protein molecule) but presenting qualitative fluorescence data, which show that the presence of zinc ion can dramatically change the affinity and fluorescence response to calcium ion.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Tyrosine and TNS fluorescence of S100A12/metal complexes</bold>.

In addition, the TNS fluorescence peak showed a blue shift in the presence of Zn relative to the fluorescent peaks obtained in the presence of calcium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The latter may indicate the accessibility of a larger hydrophobic surface to TNS upon Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding.</p><p>In contrast to the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence, TNS indicated a one-step reaction only on S100A12 titration with Zn<sup>2+</sup>.

However the binding of the second Zn<sup>2+ </sup>ion resulted in a substantial increase in the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence intensity. The addition of a small amount of Zn<sup>2+ </sup>to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded S100A12 did result in protein structural changes and the appearance of an accessible hydrophobic surface since the TNS fluorescence showed a sharp change. Furthermore, the observed blue shift of TNS fluorescence peak upon Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding to apo S100A12 protein disappeared in the case of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

The crystal structure of S100A7 revealed the location of the Zn-binding site, which was composed of an N-terminal histidine and an aspartic acid from one subunit and two C-terminal histidines from a second subunit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). Sequence comparison suggested that S100A8, S100A9, S100A12 and S100B could have similar Zn-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Involvement of the C-terminal HisxxxHis motif of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 in zinc binding had previously been predicted on the basis of sequence alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, based on sequence/structure comparisons, it is possible that S100A6 bound zinc in a similar way, although it lacked one of the C-terminal zinc-binding residues.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of zinc and copper binding sites in S100 proteins</bold>.

Binding of Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and Cu<sup>2+ </sup>resulted in some similar conformational changes upon formation of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-S100B and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 complexes. Significant changes at the putative target-binding site upon copper binding were observed for S100A12 protein, including the extension of the C-terminal helix and closer contacts between dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. These changes were also observed for S100B upon Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding. However, no changes in the interhelical angle similar to those observed in S100B-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Zn<sup>2+ </sup>system were found upon addition of Cu<sup>2+ </sup>to the S100A12-Ca<sup>2+ </sup>complex. Thus, the binding of copper and zinc may result in different changes in the target binding site.</p><p>TNS fluorescence data have demonstrated a significant difference between three ion loading modes of S100A12. In particular, a blue shift in the TNS fluorescence peak was found for Zn<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 complex which was not evident for either Ca<sup>2+ </sup>nor Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+ </sup>bound proteins. Hydrophobic amino acid residues responsible for this blue shift might contribute to different conformations of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12. We tentatively attribute the blue shift in TNS fluorescence to a stronger hydrophobic environment experienced by the TNS molecules bound to Zn<sup>2+</sup>-S100A12 complexes. In the case of Zn<sup>2+ </sup>bound S100A12, analysis of the amino acid sequences of Helix III and Helix IV, the linker loop, the C-terminus and the N-terminus of the other subunit, all of which contribute to the target binding site, pointed to Lys residues with long hydrocarbon chains as the possible candidates for contributing to the blue shift of the TNS fluorescence peak. A huge observed increase in TNS fluorescence upon Lys-TNS binding in water (data not shown) caused us to conclude that the orientation between Helix III and IV, which buries certain Lys residues, may be critical for target protein binding. These could be the Lys residues from the linker loop (or "hinge" region) &#x02013; region between helices III and IV, the importance of which for S100A12 function has recently been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Tyrosine fluorescence titration experiments suggested the presence of at least two Zn-binding sites in S100A12 with significantly different affinities. However, a large increase in TNS fluorescence was evident only at the first stage of titration with Zn. Our previous studies indicated that TNS was more sensitive to aggregation due to hydrophobic interactions than just the appearance of accessible hydrophobic surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, TNS fluorescence titration might indicate a strong aggregation of S100A12 at low Zn<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations. We hypothesize that even one Zn<sup>2+ </sup>per dimer is sufficient to induce the aggregation. Binding a second Zn<sup>2+ </sup>per dimer occurs under aggregated conditions and might exhibit a different affinity despite the binding site (considering the S100A12 monomer) being the same. This hypothesis agrees well with both NMR (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref> and figure legend) and ESI-MS data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Our surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that indeed the interaction of S100A12 with its cell surface receptor RAGE was facilitated with increasing Ca and Zn concentrations, likely due to the fact that under these conditions more oligomers formed which could bind to RAGE. Available data <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>open the possibility that the cellular pool of Zn may be sufficient to bind to S100 proteins. Zn ions are generally tightly bound by the proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and it has been proposed that Zn is normally transferred directly from a donor to an acceptor molecule. However recent studies have demonstrated the importance of weakly bound Zn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The physiological significance of potential intracellular S100A12 aggregation in the presence of very low concentrations of zinc ions has a rational explanation. In resting neutrophils the level of Ca is very low and is not enough to saturate any of the S100 proteins with Ca. The binding of zinc to S100A12 may lead to its localization in large oligomeric form (larger than hexamers), thus preventing the free distribution of S100A12 within the cytoplasm and leading to its accumulation in specific locations. In addition, the presence of Zn may increase the sensitivity of S100A12 to Ca up to 1500 fold. This phenomenon has been confirmed for both human and pig S100A12. Ca import into cells activates S100A12 to bind to its putative transporter and/or to other intracellular targets and to translocate toward the cellular membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The calcium activated translocation has been demonstrated by Guignard et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A very interesting hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] based on the earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] has been suggested; that at low oxidative stress several Zn-binding proteins may release free Zn and that this Zn is able to regulate the activity of S100 proteins. Under oxidative conditions in neutrophils, it is possible that Zn ions released from the cysteine-containing Zn binding proteins could be accepted by other proteins with histidine Zn binding motifs. Due to the high level of expression in neutrophils S100A12 may be a good acceptor of escaped zinc. We proposed that S100A12 is also regulated in the same manner by binding various amounts of zinc and changing its oligomeric status. On the other hand, the binding of S100 proteins to Zn attenuates a potential toxicity by sequestering Zn ions. Outside the cell where Zn concentration depends on the local microenvironment and the Zn level can rapidly rise and fall, all types of S100A12 oligomers may exist in equilibrium depending on the local Zn concentration. This may explain how S100 proteins are managed to specifically interact with different extracellular receptors supporting and regulating signal transduction pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Graphical representation of hypothetical mechanism on the effect of calcium and zinc on the S100A12 assembly, translocation and interaction with extracellular targets</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-11-11"/></fig><p>Oligomeric S100A12 species have been discovered in blood serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The latter study investigated the presence and deposition of S100A12 and other family members in familial (PS-1) and sporadic AD cases. In all cases 70-kDa S100A12 species have been found. The higher affinity of oligomeric S100A12 to RAGE demonstrated in our recent and current studies could explain the elevated level of S100A12 high-molecular weight species in AD brain samples. The changing extracellular environment is a mechanism that may effectively modulate the structural properties of S100A12 and its ability to bind RAGE.</p><p>The existence of zinc binding sites in S100 proteins that are able to transmit signals through RAGE and other putative extracellular receptors raises a very important question about the role of S100 proteins in the cross-talk between zinc and calcium. In this model the role of S100 signalling is likely to be similar to the role of Zn sensing receptors. S100 signals could be accepted by extracellular receptors coupled with G-proteins, with further activation of PLC and a rise in Ca concentration. It was demonstrated that the cellular response to S100A12 was abolished by inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin dependent kinase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>This hypothesis provides a simple integration mechanism that is able to transmit a signal from the cellular microenvironment when local changes of Zn concentration and pH are generated by physiological and pathophysiological events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><sec><title>S100A12</title><p>Recombinant full-length human S100A12 was expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>from the modified pQE60 vector containing S100A12 gene.
