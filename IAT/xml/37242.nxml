DOTAP formulated test molecules were added to the hepatocyte cultures at 4&#x02013;5 hours after the time of seeding. After 30&#x02013;45 hours transfection time the expression of G<sub>i2&#x003b1;</sub> protein was decreased in ribozyme-treated cells, while no significant effect was seen with its non-cleaving form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

To investigate the functional roles of G<sub>i2</sub> on ERK1/2 activation, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in ribozyme-treated cells following PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, D</xref>). The basal level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (i.e. in the absence PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> stimulation) was not reduced following ribozyme treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

In contrast, the total ERK1/2 protein level was not affected by the treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, upper panel). To further confirm the decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we also assessed their activity in response to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A marked inhibitory effect was found in ribozyme-treated cells. The activation of ERK1/2 by EGF was, however, reduced to a lesser extent.

The data obtained with the ribozyme suggest that G<sub>i2</sub> is an important factor in ERK1/2 activation.</p><p>G<sub>i</sub> proteins are believed to be involved in regulation of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and a role in activation of ERK1/2 is reported in different cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In hepatocytes it has been observed that PTX inhibited activation of ERK1/2 both by agents acting on G protein coupled receptors including vasopressin, angiotensin II, norepinephrine and PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> as well as by agents that bind to receptor tyrosine kinases like EGF and HGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], also suggesting roles of G<sub>i</sub>. In the present study we explored closer the G<sub>i</sub> dependency of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> -induced ERK1/2 activation, which is strongly PTX-sensitive. We used a ribozyme approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which has been examined in a variety of experimental models to suppress gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], including in human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Notably, ribozymes were recently reported to effectively suppress the expression of the &#x003b3;7 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins in HEK 293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Pretreatment of the hepatocytes with the G<sub>i2&#x003b1;</sub> ribozyme resulted in a marked inhibition of the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> -induced ERK1/2 activation. The findings might be explained by the ability of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> to act through receptors that couple directly to G<sub>i</sub> in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the G<sub>i2&#x003b1;</sub> ribozyme resulted in a partial decrease of the EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation, in accordance with a role of G<sub>i</sub>. However, the explanation for an involvement of G<sub>i</sub> in this pathway is not known. Observations in different cell types have indicated that G<sub>i</sub> might play a role in EGF-induced cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and in hepatocytes a direct coupling of the EGF receptor to G<sub>i</sub> has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. One explanation is that receptor-independent functions of G<sub>i</sub> may be involved in signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases as well as from seven transmembrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Since cyclic AMP was found to exert a negative control of ERK1/2 activation in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it can be speculated that the decreases in ERK1/2 responses observed subsequent to inhibition of G<sub>i</sub> function might be caused by an elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. However, in experiments using pertussis toxin there were no detectable alterations of the cyclic AMP level under basal conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in the present study ribozyme treatment of the hepatocytes did not decrease the basal ERK1/2 activation thus suggesting no significant alteration of cyclic AMP level under these experimental conditions.</p><p>The present data show a close correlation between the inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activation produced by the G<sub>i2&#x003b1;</sub> ribozyme compared to the effects obtained with PTX. This suggests that the PTX effects that have been observed, at least on ERK1/2 activation in response to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> as well as EGF stimulation, reflect G<sub>i2</sub>-mediated mechanisms. However, the present data do not rule out a possible contribution of G<sub>i3</sub> in ERK1/2 activation. In this regard, it is of note that observations in endothelial cells have suggested a role for G<sub>i2</sub> proteins, but not G<sub>i3</sub>, in ERK1/2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Further studies involving specific inhibition of G<sub>i3</sub> proteins will be needed to clarify this issue in the hepatocyte model.</p><p>Previous findings have demonstrated that G<sub>i</sub> dependent activations of ERK1/2 are mediated through &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits. These results were derived from studies where ERK activation was elicited by overexpression of &#x003b2;&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], or antagonized by the &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-inhibitory peptide &#x003b2;1ct (C-terminal fragment of the &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor kinase-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although a possible role for &#x003b2;&#x003b3; in ERK1/2 activation can not be ruled out, the present data might be compatible with a role for the &#x003b1; i2 subunit. This interpretation agrees with observations reported by Hedin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] who found that in Jurkat T lymphocytes the &#x003b4;-opioid activation of ERK1/2 was PTX-sensitive, but unaffected by &#x003b2;1ct treatment, suggesting an involvement of &#x003b1;<sub>i</sub>. However, it should be noted that a strategy based on targeting a particular subunit of a G protein might affect the overall function of the heterotrimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study gives further support to a role of G<sub>i</sub> proteins in ERK1/2 activation in hepatocytes and suggests a role of G<sub>i2</sub>. On the other hand, the data can not exclude a possible involvement of G<sub>i3</sub> in the mechanisms of ERK1/2 activation in these cells or define the precise contribution of the G protein subunit &#x003b1;<sub>i2</sub>. The observation that primary hepatocytes are efficiently transfected with ribozymes may facilitate studies of cell signaling in this model system which represents features of normal cells. Thus, it will be interesting to explore the roles of different heterotrimeric G proteins and their subunits in activation of ERK1/2 as well as other mitogen-activated protein kinases by the nucleic acid enzyme strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Waymouth's medium MAB 87/3, penicillin and streptomycin were from Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.

Subsequent to transcription ribozymes were PAGE gel-purified, ethanol-precipitated and then dissolved in water. The concentration was determined by assessment of absorbency at 260 nm. A non-cleaving form of the ribozyme was made by deleting the G12 from the catalytic core as indicated by lower case letter. The ribozyme short target was synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of a synthetic DNA template with the T7 RNA polymerase. Subsequent to transcription, the gel-purified RNA was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphate and then 5'-end labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup> P]ATP. The ribozyme sequence is: 5'GGCAGCACAGCU GAUGAGUCCGUGAGGACgAAACAGUGCGAACAGC3'. The sequence of the targeted site is: 5'GCUGUUCGCACUGUCCUGUGCUGCC3'.
