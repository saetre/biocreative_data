Missense mutations have been identified in the <italic>BLM</italic> gene (encoding a RecQ helicase) in affected individuals, but the molecular mechanism and the structural basis of the effects of these mutations remain to be elucidated. We analysed five disease-causing missense mutations that are localized in the BLM helicase core region: Q672R, I841T, C878R, G891E and C901Y. The disease-causing mutants had low ATPase and helicase activities but their ATP binding abilities were normal, except for Q672, whose ATP binding activity was lower than that of the intact BLM helicase. Mutants C878R, mapping near motif IV, and G891E and C901Y, mapping in motif IV, displayed severe DNA-binding defects. We used molecular modelling to analyse these mutations. Our work provides insights into the molecular basis of BLM pathology, and reveals structural elements implicated in coupling DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding. Our findings will help to explain the mechanism underlying BLM catalysis and interpreting new BLM causing mutations identified in the future.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA helicases are important in DNA metabolism and are involved in genome replication, DNA repair, recombination, transcription and telomere maintenance (1,2). Helicases function as molecular motors. They use the energy from nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to translocate along a nucleic acid strand, and separate complementary strands of a nucleic acid duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The conversion of the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis into unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids is coordinated by seven sequence motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI); these sequence motifs are features of superfamily-1 and -2 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Motif 0, N-terminal to motif I, is an additional motif that is also conserved in proteins of the RecQ family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A similar element called a &#x02018;Q motif&#x02019; has also been characterized in DEAD-box RNA helicases where it is important for NTP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Crystal structures of a catalytic core fragment of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ helicase show that motifs 0, I and II are important in ATP binding and hydrolysis by RecQ helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Studies of SF-1 helicases (PcrA and Rep) have identified several highly conserved residues in the seven motifs as being involved directly or indirectly in linking DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis. The crystal structures of HCV, PcrA, Rep and DEAD-box protein Vasa revealed that motifs Ia, IV and V bind the phosphate backbone of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). Several highly conserved residues in motif IV, including two Arg residues and one Asn residue in PcrA and Rep, have been observed to interact directly with ds or ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Although no crystal structure of the RecQ helicase&#x02013;DNA complex is available, it is widely thought that RecQ helicases bind DNA in a similar manner to other helicases (SF-1 and SF-2). Most RecQ family proteins have a conserved RecQ-Ct domain immediately downstream from the conserved seven signature motifs that is unique to the RecQ family helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The RecQ-Ct subdomain, as detailed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ crystal structure, contains a platform of alpha helices with four conserved cysteine residues that bind a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion and winged helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The helicase and RecQ-Ct domains combine to form the catalytic &#x02018;helicase core&#x02019; domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ, containing the sequence motifs necessary for its ATPase and DNA unwinding activities.</p><p>The RecQ family of DNA helicases has received much attention in the past few years because mutations in three RecQ helicases are associated with genome instability and cancer susceptibility, and give rise to the human disorders: Bloom syndrome (BS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), Werner syndrome (WRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is characterized by growth deficiency, unusual facies, immunodeficiency, male sterility/female subfertility and an increased risk of a broad spectrum of cancers that develop at a young age. Although Werner syndrome and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome individuals also develop cancers, BS is the only RecQ-related disorder that causes cancers of the types observed in elderly general populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Cells from BS patients exhibit chromosomal instability characterized by elevated rates of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), loss of heterozygosity and quadriradials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). BS cells exhibit hyper-recombination and abnormalities in DNA replication involving an extended S phase and accumulation of an abnormal profile of replication intermediates. Thus, the BLM protein is expected to play a central role in one or more DNA metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>BLM</italic>, the gene mutated in BS, encodes a 1417 amino acid protein which has amino acid sequence similarities with the RecQ family of DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The natural DNA substrates of BLM in the cell have not been identified. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that BLM unwinds the canonical Watson&#x02013;Crick duplex, and recognizes and disrupts alternative DNA structures including Holliday junctions, triple helices and the highly stable G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24 B25">21&#x02013;25</xref>). In addition to its DNA unwinding activity, BLM displays a strand annealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). BLM's helicase activity is necessary for the correction of the genomic instability of BLM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Like other RecQ family helicases, BLM interacts physically and functionally with numerous proteins in the cell to perform its diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic presentation of distribution of the identified mutant alleles in BLM patients (red).

The most frequent mutations include stop codons, insertions and deletions that generate frameshift mutations and missense mutations. Seven disease-causing missense mutations have been described: Q672R, I841T, C878R, G891E, C901Y, C1036F and C1055S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>). Five of these mutations have been mapped to the seven sequence motifs that are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The seminal work of the Keck laboratory on the atomic structure of RecQ helicase has provided new insight into the structural consequences of some missense mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Biochemical and structural characterizations of the mutations C1036F and C1055S, localized in the RecQ-Ct domain, have shown that both mutations affect sites directly involved in the formation and stability of the zinc binding domain; the zinc binding domain plays an essential role in protein folding and DNA substrate recognition and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Q672R and I841T, mutations localized in the helicase core domain, have been characterized using partially purified enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>): both mutants have been shown to be deficient in ATPase and helicase activities, but the molecular basis of their mutagenic effects remains to be determined. In this study, we analysed the five disease-causing mutations found in the helicase core, using molecular modelling and biochemical and biophysical approaches. Studies of these mutants help elucidate the possible molecular bases of the BLM disease-causing mutations, and also to provide information on the conserved mechanisms employed by the RecQ family helicases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>A plasmid for producing the BLM helicase core consisting of amino acid residues 642&#x02013;1290 was generated by inserting the corresponding gene between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the expression plasmid pET15b (Novagen).

All other mutants displayed no significant DNA unwinding activity at the protein concentrations used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). As BLM helicase unwinds forked duplex DNA more efficiently than partial duplex DNA, we characterized the DNA unwinding activity of the five mutants with forked duplex DNA substrates. BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup> unwound forked DNA efficiently. C878R unwound DNA only at high protein concentrations, and the other mutants did not unwind partial duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). We studied the DNA unwinding activity of these mutants with various protein concentrations. Under similar experimental conditions, only C878R was able to unwind DNA to similar levels as the BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup> protein fragment, and this required a 10-fold greater protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). This suggests that the mechanisms of impairment of DNA unwinding differ between C878R, which retain intrinsic DNA unwinding ability under certain conditions, and the other mutants.

Combination of the biochemical study and the molecular modelling approaches improve our understanding of the molecular basis of how these mutations affect BLM enzymatic functions, thereby perturbing the integrity and stability of chromosomes. These analyses have also provided new insight into how the RecQ family helicases couple DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding, and how this coupling is impaired in the BLM misense mutants.</p><sec><title>Residue Q672 is involved in ATP binding</title><p>The BLM missense mutation, Q672R, is naturally occurring and causes Bloom's syndrome, and has been mapped to motif 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Several additional mutations found in various species have indicated that this residue is crucial for enzyme function. The <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ in complex with ATP&#x003b3;S structure shows that motif 0 forms a loop connecting two helices creating a pocket that accommodates the adenine base of the ATP&#x003b3;S molecule. OE1 and NE2 atoms of the C-terminal Gln residue 672 (Q672 in BLM is equivalent to Q30 in <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ) of motif 0 form hydrogen bonds with the N6 and N7 atoms of the adenine, specifically binding ATP. Consistent with the previous results obtained with the partial purified full length BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), our data indicates that Q672R displays normal DNA binding activity, but its ATPase activity is significantly impaired. This implicates Q672 in either ATP binding or hydrolysis. The <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values obtained from the ATP saturation curves show that the Q672R turnover rate for ATP hydrolysis is similar to that of the BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup>, but that its ATP binding affinity is significantly lower. Our direct ATP binding experiment confirms that the ATP binding ability of Q672R is dramatically decreased. These findings are consistent with the data from the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ in complex with ATP&#x003b3;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and our molecular modelling structure of the BLM helicase core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The Q672R mutant protein tended to aggregate. This suggests that either residue Q672 or ATP binding is important in protein folding as the mutant protein Q672R is deficient in ATP binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Residue I841 contributes to stabilize the residues involved in ATP hydrolysis</title><p>Motifs I and II (Walker A and B motifs, respectively) are highly conserved in SF-1 and SF-2 helicases, and have residues that interact with MgATP/MgADP. Our molecular BLM model, consistent with the crystal structures of PcrA, Rep and <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ helicases, shows that the carboxyl of the highly conserved D795 coordinates the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP through outer sphere interactions, and that E796 may act as a catalytic base in ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Residues D795, E796, A797 and H798 map in a loop connecting a &#x003b2;-strand and a &#x003b1;-helix in our model. The spatial positions of the crucial residues D795 and E796 are further stabilized by a conserved hydrophobic pocket involving residues A797, and I841 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Replacement of residue I with T in position 841 inserts a polar group that may disrupt the coherence of this pocket, and affect the interactions involving residues D795, E796, A797 and H798 in motif II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). These structural modifications may have direct consequences on the orientation of motif II with regard to the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP. The modifications may disturb the position of E796, (equivalent to E147 in RecQ from <italic>E. coli</italic>) which acts as the catalytic base that polarizes a water molecule for attack on the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP. The modifications may also affect the position of D795 (equivalent to D146 in RecQ from <italic>E. coli</italic>) that coordinates the catalytic ion Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, the mutation I841T may have an effect on the positions of D795 and E796, which are both predicted to be directly involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. This is in agreement with our biochemical data showing that this mutation impairs the ATPase and helicase activities whereas DNA and ATP binding activities remain unchanged.</p></sec><sec><title>Residue C878 may connect the zinc binding motif and lobe 2, and to enhance DNA binding</title><p>The C878R mutant can unwind partial and forked duplex DNA at high protein concentration and displays low, but detectable ATPase activity. However, its DNA binding ability is substantially below that of the BLM<sup>62&#x02013;1290</sup> fragment. The modelled BLM structure reveals two structural features related to C878 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C): (i) residue C878 is close to the hydrogen bonds between K869 and D997, and its sulphur atom is 5.22 &#x000c5; from the side chain of K869. The hydrogen bond interactions between K869 and D997 are highly conserved from bacteria to human, and may contribute to the stabilization of the zinc binding motif relative to the lobe 2 of the helicase domain, thereby stabilizing DNA binding. (ii) C878 is also part of an &#x003b1;-helix connected to a lysine-rich loop (residues 869&#x02013;873), which is unique to BLM. The lysine-rich loop<sup>869&#x02013;873</sup>, comprising four lysine residues and a proline, constitutes a flexible and positively charged surface and is totally accessible to solvent. This loop is very close to the dsDNA binding sites in both the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ helicase model and our BLM model, and may contribute to DNA binding and substrate specificity. The mutation C878R, involving a very large and very positively charged residue, may interfere with the K869&#x02013;D997 hydrogen bond linking the zinc binding motif to lobe 2, and thus displace the zinc binding motif from lobe 2, thereby affecting DNA binding. Indeed, mutant C878R displays a detectable unwinding activity at high protein concentration indicating that its intrinsic ATPase and helicase activities are not abolished, but that a high protein concentration is required to enhance DNA binding. We also measured ATPase activity of C878R with increasing DNA concentration as additional indication of the ability of the mutant enzyme to bind DNA. We found that the mutant C878R needs 12-fold higher ssDNA concentration to achieve the same extent of ATPase stimulation by the BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup> (data not shown). These various findings suggest that residue C878 may link the zinc binding motif and lobe 2 to enhance DNA binding. The BLM protein preferentially unwinds or migrates recombination intermediates, including Holliday junctions and D loops; possibly, the molecular basis for the pathological effects of the C878R mutant is that it fails to recognize, bind and unwind its substrate in cells during the DNA transaction process.</p></sec><sec><title>Residue G891 is involved in coupling DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis</title><p>The ATPase and DNA helicase activities and DNA binding are severely compromised in G891R although its ATP binding activity appears essentially normal. This implicates G891 in the coupling of DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Residue G891 is distant from the ATP binding/hydrolysis sites, so it is reasonable to assume that the mutation G891R causes long-distance structural modifications, thereby affecting ATP hydrolysis. Residue G891 of motif IV contributes to a hydrophobic site with several conserved residues that constitute parallel-strand beta-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). These hydrophobic interactions probably greatly stabilize the spatial position of beta strand 12. Residue R959 is on top of the beta strand 12 and forms a salt bridge with D983 which may spatially restrict the position of the arginine residue 982, the only residue of lobe 2 expected to be involved in ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Replacement of the small apolar glycine residue 891 with a large and positively charged arginine residue undoubtedly destabilizes the local conformation near position 891, particularly beta strand 12 where R959 is implicated in stabilization of the putative arginine finger. R959 is only 5 &#x000c5; from residue G891, so the side chain of the mutated 891 may directly disturb R959 through charge repulsion. As a consequence, R959 may not be properly oriented in the mutant to interact with D983.</p><p>Replacement of G891 with an arginine not only impairs ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities, but also results in DNA binding defects. At first glance, it is surprising that G891 in motif IV contributes to DNA binding. However, the crystal structures of Rep bound to ssDNA, PcrA bound to a hybrid DNA with both single-stranded and duplex segments, HCV helicase bound to ssDNA and DEAD-box helicase Vasa in complex with ssRNA indicate that motifs Ia and IV contribute substantially to the specific interactions with oligonucleotides. Several conserved residues in motif IV, including Asn, Arg and Lys, are directly involved in oligonucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). No crystal structure of RecQ helicase in complex with DNA is available, so it is hard to ascertain whether G891 interacts directly with the oligonucleotide or stabilizes the relevant &#x003b2; strands through hydrophobic interactions, thereby ensuring a suitable conformation for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). In the light of our findings, it is reasonable to suppose that G891 contributes to coupling DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis. DNA binding may result in a subtle change in the conformation of several &#x003b2; strands around G891 and in particular &#x003b2; strand 12. R959 is on top of the &#x003b2; strand 12 and interacts with D983. The spatial orientation of R959 may be altered upon DNA binding, affecting the arginine finger position through the D983&#x02013;R959 salt bridge and activating ATP hydrolysis. <table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Helicase motif IV is specifically involved in oligonucleotide binding</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Residue numbers in Motif IV</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequences</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interactions</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PcrA (355&#x02013;365)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AVLY<underline>R</underline>T<underline>N</underline>AQS<underline>R</underline></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R359 binds DNA and forms a salt bridge to E600; N361 interacts with ssDNA and R365 close to dsDNA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rep (346&#x02013;356)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AILY<underline>R</underline>G<underline>N</underline>HQS<underline>R</underline></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R350, N352, H353 and R356 interact with ssDNA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RecQ (237&#x02013;258)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">KSGIIYCNS<underline>R</underline>AKVEDTAAR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R246 equivalent to R365 of PcrA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BLM (898&#x02013;907)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DSGIILCLS<underline>R</underline>RECDTMADT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R898 and R899 equivalent to N361 and R365 of PcrA, respectively</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HCV(365&#x02013;372)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LIFCHS<underline>K</underline>K</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">K371 interacts with ssDNA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DEAD-box Vasa (493&#x02013;500)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IVFV<underline>E</underline>T<underline>K</underline>R</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">E497 and K499 interact with ssRNA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>This possibility is in good agreement with our biochemical data showing that this mutation impairs ATPase, DNA helicase and DNA binding activities.

Crystal structures of several helicases in complex with oligonucleotides have shown that some conserved residues in motif IV are involved in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). PcrA and BLM display a similar fold of motif IV. Residues R898 and R899 (equivalent to N361 and R365 from PcrA) of motif IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F) may play a key role in ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Moreover, the &#x003b1;-helix of motif IV may swing as a rigid body due to thermodynamic movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Such a mobile &#x003b1;-helix may be unfavourable for DNA binding and must be further restricted to a spatial position appropriate for DNA binding. In our BLM molecular model, residue C901 is associated with an intriguing cluster of 3 cysteines and 1 methionine (C895, C901, M904 and C944). The distances between the cysteine or methionine side-chain sulphur groups are all 3.4 &#x000c5; and close to the ideal distance (2.35 &#x000b1; 0.09 &#x000c5;) for structural metal-coordination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It is possible that the &#x003b1;-helices of the motif IV are maintained in the spatial orientation appropriate for DNA binding by this metal-binding motif including C901. Preliminary biochemical characterization indicates that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is not involved in the formation of the putative metal-binding motif. The relevance of this putative metal-binding motif and the nature of the metal are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Alternatively, C901 may form disulfide bridges with one of its neighbour cysteines to stabilize the &#x003b1;-helix of motif IV.</p><p>In mutant C901Y a medium-sized polar cysteine residue (valine in RecQ from <italic>E. coli</italic>) is replaced with a large and planar tyrosine residue with an OH group. This is expected to disrupt the metal-binding motif or the putative disulfide bridges and consequently destabilize the helix of motif IV carrying residues that may be involved directly or indirectly in DNA binding. This model predicts that the residues in the helix are important for ssDNA binding, contributing to the formation of the BLM&#x02013;DNA complex. Consistent with the model, mutant C901Y exhibited significant reduction in dsDNA binding and even greater loss of ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>The C901 involved in the putative metal-binding motif is not a conserved residue in RecQ family helicases. ATPase and helicase activities are common to all DNA helicases, so a fundamental question is how deficiency of a particular helicase gives rise to the characteristic biochemical, cellular, genetic and organismal consequences observed in helicase mutants. It is plausible that each helicase recognizes its own substrate in the cell: the structural feature involved in motif IV in BLM may have a physiological relevance in DNA substrate specificity recognition.</p><p>Although Cheok and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) did not observe the strand annealing activity with BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup>, we did detect the strand annealing activity with BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup> at protein concentrations above 80 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). More interestingly, some mutants displayed stronger strand annealing activity than the intact BLM<sup>642&#x02013;1290</sup> fragment, demonstrating that the DNA unwinding and the strand annealing activities could be uncoupled. The same phenomenon was also observed in RECQL4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The observations that the missense mutants lost helicase activity, but still possess the strand annealing activity indicated that the helicase activity or its coordination with the strand annealing is essential for the integrity and stability of chromosomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by the grant from the Institut National du Cancer (France) to M.A.-G. and X.G.X., the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
