Defining these pathways and how they contribute to the anti-retroviral immune responses would assist in the development of more effective vaccines for retroviral pathogens such as HIV. We have investigated the roles played by CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) and by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways in the generation of an anti-retroviral immune response against a mouse retroviral pathogen, Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV). Specific deletion of DCs during F-MLV infection caused a significant increase in viral titers at 14 days post-infection, indicating the importance of DCs in immune control of the infection. Similarly, Myd88 knockout mice failed to control F-MLV, and sustained high viral titers (10<sup>7</sup> foci/spleen) for several months after infection. Strikingly, both DC-depleted mice and Myd88 knockout mice exhibited only a partial reduction of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses, while the IgG antibody response to F-MLV was completely lost. Furthermore, passive transfer of immune serum from wild-type mice to Myd88 knockout mice rescued control of F-MLV. These results identify TLR signaling and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs as playing critical roles in the humoral response to retroviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Efforts to develop vaccines against the retrovirus HIV by inducing immune responses involving antibodies or T cells have been unsuccessful. Although antibodies can be generated against HIV, they fail to neutralize the virus. Thus, a more fundamental understanding of how neutralizing antibody responses to retroviral pathogens are generated is required. We have used a mouse retrovirus to demonstrate that Myd88, a molecule centrally involved in innate immune system signaling, is required to generate an antibody response during retroviral infection. Myd88 also contributed to, but was not strictly required for, the T cell response. Myd88 is known to participate in a signaling pathway that activates inflammation in response to microbial molecules. Understanding how this pathway contributes to anti-retroviral antibody responses may be useful for the development of a vaccine that can effectively block HIV.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The HIV pandemic has spurred intensive research into retroviruses, and yet an effective vaccine for HIV has remained elusive.

SFFV encodes a protein, gp55, which binds to the erythropoietin receptor and causes hyper-proliferation of erythroid precursors and splenomegaly. The susceptibility of mice to F-MLV is affected by a number of host genes. In mouse strains such as Balb/c, immune responses are ineffective and sustained high virus titers eventually lead to erythroid leukemia. In C57BL/6 mice, acute infection is controlled by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and neutralizing antibodies, but the virus is not completely cleared and establishes a low level persistent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000298-Dittmer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Retroviral particles for HIV and F-MLV possess potential TLR ligands, and could conceivably be detected by TLR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000298-Meier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several cell types, including DCs, macrophages and B cells, are capable of antigen presentation to T cells, but for most pathogens it is unclear which of these cell types is explicitly required for the generation of specific immune responses. To investigate the role of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in immune function, we previously developed transgenic mice that express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the CD11c promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000298-Jung1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have also identified a significant but less critical role for TLRs in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses to retroviral infection. Myd88-deficient mice sustain high titers of F-MLV for several months post-infection, indicating that the response is not simply delayed.

Furthermore, they found this defect to be at least partly B cell intrinsic, since mice lacking mature B cells due to a disruption of the Ig &#x003bc; chain (&#x003bc;MT mice) that had received B cells lacking Myd88, but not mice that had received wild-type B cells, also had defective antibody responses. This view has been challenged by Gavin and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000298-Gavin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> who found that <italic>Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x0003b;Trif<sup>LPS2/LPS2</sup></italic> mice were able to mount apparently normal antibody responses to the model antigen trinitrophenol-hemocyanin given in complete Freund's adjuvant.

TLR signaling in DCs promotes the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 that are important for triggering CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, in turn, play an important role in activating B cells. Thus, the effect of DCs and TLR signaling on B cell responses could be mediated through CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. However, upregulation of CD80 on the DC population (CD11c&#x0002b;, B220&#x02212;, CD8&#x003b1;&#x02212;) that is known to control CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses was only slightly reduced in the absence of Myd88. Similarly, the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response to F-MLV was reduced but not absent in Myd88 knockout mice. DCs are known to activate B cells directly in a T cell independent manner by Fc&#x003b3;RIIB-mediated recycling of whole antigen, but this process is not known to be TLR dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000298-Bergtold1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conditional deletion of Myd88 in DCs or B cells would address the relative contribution of Myd88-dependent signaling in these cell types.</p><p>These results also suggest that DC-independent and Myd88-independent pathways contribute to the development of the T cell responses. Since retroviral genomes fold into structures that contain dsRNA, it is possible that TLR3 and TRIF could be involved.

Foci were then visualized by adding Amino ethyl Carbazole/Hydrogen peroxide substrate (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Bone marrow chimeras and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC depletions</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 mice at 6&#x02013;8 weeks of age were lethally irradiated with two doses of 550 Rads separated by six hours and then injected intravenously with bone marrow cells from wild-type or CDllc-DTR transgenic mice. The chimeras were then kept for 6 weeks to permit engraftment of donor bone marrow. During this period, the mice were supplied with antibiotics in their drinking water to prevent infection. Depletion of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells was carried out by fifteen days of daily intraperitoneal injection of 200 ng of diphtheria toxin (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Intracellular cytokine staining</title><p>Splenocytes were plated in RPMI containing 50 ng/mL PMA and 1 uM ionomycin plus GolgiStop (BD Biosciences). After 3 h stimulation, cells were washed in PBS and stained for cell surface markers. The cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in permeabilization-fixing buffer (BD Biosciences). After incubation at 4&#x000b0;C for 45 minutes, the cells were washed and resuspended in permeabilization/wash buffer containing anti-IFN&#x003b3;-PE antibody. Staining was carried out at for 45&#x02013;60 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Finally, the cells were washed in 1&#x02013;2 mL BD perm/wash buffer and resuspended in PBS for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Neutralizing antibody titers</title><p>To measure neutralizing antibody titers in infected mice, peripheral blood was obtained by retro-orbital bleed, and serum extracted by centrifugation. The serum was diluted in a two-fold dilution series, and mixed with an F-MLV sample before plating on <italic>Mus Dunni</italic> cells. Three days later, when the <italic>Mus Dunni</italic> cells were confluent, infected foci were visualized. The neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the maximum serum dilution that reduced the number of F-MLV foci by at least 75&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>F-MLV&#x02013;specific IgG assay</title><p>Serum samples from infected or na&#x000ef;ve mice were diluted in phosphate buffer saline with 2&#x00025; fetal bovine serum.

The cells were then washed twice and resuspended in PBS/FBS. Secondary staining using Allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (eBiosciences) was performed, then the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Statistical
