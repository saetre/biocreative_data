A structure-based understanding of their molecular mechanisms of function has been elusive until the recent determination of the x-ray structure of an archaeal transporter, Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. Glt<sub>Ph</sub> exists as a trimer, with each subunit containing a core region that mediates substrate translocation. In the present study a series of molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted and analyzed in light of new experimental data on substrate binding properties of EAATs. The simulations provide for the first time a full atomic description of the time-resolved events that drive the recognition and binding of substrate. The core region of each subunit exhibits an intrinsic tendency to open the helical hairpin HP2 loop, the extracellular gate, within tens of nanoseconds exposing conserved polar residues that serve as attractors for substrate binding. The NMDGT motif on the partially unwound part of the transmembrane helix TM7 and the residues Asp-390 and Asp-394 on TM8 are also distinguished by their important role in substrate binding and close interaction with mediating water molecules and/or sodium ions. The simulations reveal a Na<sup>+</sup> binding site comprised in part of Leu-303 on TM7 and Asp-405 on TM8 and support a role for sodium ions in stabilizing substrate-bound conformers. The functional importance of Leu-303 or its counterpart Leu-391 in human EAAT1 (hEAAT1) is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and Na<sup>+</sup> dependence assays conducted with hEAAT1 mutants L391C and L391A.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>R33 GM068400</grant-num> (to I.

When an action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters, the extracellular (EC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> concentration of neurotransmitters may increase by several orders of magnitude. Transporters on neurons and glia clear neurotransmitters and regulate the extent of receptor activation. Among them, glutamate transporters allow cells to maintain a substantial concentration gradient of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). In fulfilling this function, each glutamate molecule is co-transported with three sodium ions and one proton followed by the counter-transport of a potassium ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Binding of substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> also activates an uncoupled chloride conductance, and thus, the transporter also functions as a ligand-gated anion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Glutamate transporters have a major impact on developmental plasticity and long term potentiation, and they have been implicated in many pathological conditions including stroke, epilepsy, cerebral ischemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). However, the molecular interactions and structural mechanisms that mediate the transport of glutamate and co-transported ions have been difficult to resolve in the absence of high resolution structural information for the carrier family.</p><p>A major breakthrough came with the resolution of the x-ray structure of the archaeal glutamate transporter (Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> under different conditions by Gouaux and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is a homotrimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) with the subunits forming a bowl-shaped concave basin toward the EC side. Each subunit is comprised of eight transmembrane (TM) helices, TM1-TM8, and two helical hairpins, HP1 and HP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), which partially span the lipid bilayer. These structural elements are organized into an N-terminal, outer cylinder region made up of TM helices TM1-TM6 and a C-terminal core comprised of TM7, HP1, HP2, and TM8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The core region is known to encompass the elements of the transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>The crystallographic structural data obtained for Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) agree, in general, with models based on biochemical and mutagenesis experiments conducted for mammalian excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). For example, biochemical studies on human EAAT2 showed that the transporter exists as a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>); cross-linking of pairs of cysteines introduced at the tips of HP1 and HP2 loops, on HP1 tip and TM7, and on HP2 tip and TM7 suggested that these regions are located within close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), in accord with their spatial distances observed in the resolved Glt<sub>Ph</sub> structure. Additionally, residues in the mammalian EAATs equivalent to the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> residues Asp-394 and Arg-397, the serine-rich motif (Ser-277-Ser-279), and the conserved NMDGT motif have been proposed to be involved in substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), consistent with their interaction with the bound aspartate observed in the high resolution structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>.</p><p>These structural data along with the fact that Glt<sub>Ph</sub> shares about 36% sequence identity with eukaryotic EAATs suggest that Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and its mammalian orthologues share similar structural and biophysical features. The Glt<sub>Ph</sub> structure may, therefore, serve as a prototype for gaining new insights into the molecular interactions and mechanisms of glutamate uptake by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate transporter family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of an archaeal glutamate transporter (Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) resolved by Yernool <italic>et al.</italic> (</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><bold>6</bold></xref><bold>) (PDB code 1xfh).</bold><italic>A</italic>, top view (<italic>left</italic>), viewed from the EC region, and side view (<italic>right</italic>).

These motions open up the conserved charged or polar residues in the core regions to the central aqueous basin. Exposure of these residues prompts the directed diffusion of substrate toward the putative binding site, provided that the substrate is located within an interaction range in the basin. The intrinsic, structure-induced ability of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> to sample the conformational motions that facilitate substrate binding conforms to the functional dynamics observed both experimentally and computationally for many allosteric enzymes and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Additionally, simulations permit us to visualize the sequence of events that lead to the sequestering of the substrate at the binding site as well as the important role of bound Na<sup>+</sup> in controlling EC gate motion and ensuring the tight confinement of the substrate in the core. A well defined pathway is identified where water molecules enter the binding site in single file via a passage between two highly conserved aspartates, Asp-390 and Asp-394, on TM8. Binding of a water molecule to Thr-314 on the NMDGT motif plays a key role in mediating the cooperative rearrangement of amino acids that coordinate the bound substrate. Finally, the residue Leu-303 on TM7 (Leu-391 in hEAAT1) appears to serve as a binding site for Na<sup>+</sup>. We tested this possibility by examining the Na<sup>+</sup> dependence of transport for two human EAAT1 (hEAAT1) mutants (L391A and L391C). The results from these experiments support the significance of this newly defined site for Na<sup>+</sup> binding/uptake. Overall, the present structure-based simulations and experiments shed light for the first time on the time-resolved mechanisms of EC gate opening, substrate recognition, and binding and the role of Na<sup>+</sup> in modulating the structural dynamics of the transporter.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>MD Simulations</italic>&#x02014;We simulated the dynamics of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> embedded in a bilayer-solvent environment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) using the GROMACS program 3.2.1 with the Gromacs force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). The crystal structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) was used as the initial conformation (PDB code 1xfh). Missing atoms on the side chains of some residues were constructed using Xplor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Constant number of particles (<italic>N</italic>), pressure (<italic>P</italic>), and temperature (<italic>T</italic>) conditions, with a pressure of 1 bar and a coupling constant of &#x003c4;<sub>p</sub> = 1.0 ps, were adopted. Water, protein, and lipid molecules were coupled separately to a temperature bath at 310 K using a coupling constant of &#x003c4;<sub>t</sub> = 0.1 ps. The van der Waals interactions were calculated using a cutoff distance of 10 &#x000c5;, and long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method. The single point charge model was adopted for water molecules as a plausible model for lipid simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) along with the lipid parameters used in our previous MD simulations of other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The membrane consisted of 353 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine molecules, and the system was solvated with &#x0223c;23,000 water molecules. Simulations were preceded by energy minimization with steepest descent followed by equilibration periods of 200 ps during which the protein backbone atoms were restrained by harmonic potentials so as to allow for the packing of lipid molecules around the protein. The constraints were then removed for the productive runs.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of MD runs. MD0 was performed to examine the intrinsic dynamics of the transporter. MD1 and MD2 were generated to examine the substrate binding events using two different initial positions for the substrate (4.5 and 8.8 &#x000c5; away from the base of the basin, respectively, along the central cylindrical (<italic>z</italic>) axis). The substrate was seen to drift away to the EC region in the first 1-ns portion of the MD2 trajectory. This was prevented by applying on the substrate backbone nitrogen an acceleration of 10 nm/ps<sup>2</sup> along the <italic>z</italic> direction, toward the basin, similar to the approach used in other applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). The acceleration had no radial component and was turned off after 1 ns to observe the intermolecular interactions that drive substrate diffusion. The role of sodium ions was examined in the runs MD3 and MD4. MD5 and MD6 were conducted to examine and compare the diffusive properties of aspartate and glutamate at physiological levels in the EC and intracellular (IC) regions.

Strikingly, an increase of more than 8 &#x000c5; was observed in subunit A (<italic>black curve</italic> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>panel A</italic>) succeeding the reconfiguration of the HP2 loop, which literally acts as an &#x0201c;EC gate.&#x0201d; Subunit B (<italic>red</italic> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) exhibits a displacement of about 7 &#x000c5; at 17 ns, whereas subunit C (green) remains closed throughout the entire duration of the run MD0. Once the original tight packing of the two hairpins in the core is disrupted, the HP2 loop tends to remain open and disordered as indicated by the large fluctuations in the HP1-HP2 distance time profile for both subunits A and B.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Opening of EC gate upon disruption of the interaction between the tips of the HP1 and HP2 loops.</bold><italic>A</italic>, time evolution of the distance between Gly-354 (O) and Ser-278 (N) at the HP2 and HP1 tips, respectively, observed for subunits A (<italic>black</italic>), B (<italic>red</italic>), and C (<italic>green</italic>) in run MD0.

Largest motions occur at the loop residues Ala-353-Gly-359 between the helical branches HP2a and HP2b of HP2. This loop contains four highly conserved glycines, Gly-351, -354, -357, and -359. Conceivably, these glycines play a dual role of (i) facilitating the sampling of entropically favored (disordered) conformations (open state of the EC gate) by providing access to a broad range of rotameric angles &#x003d5; and &#x003c8; and (ii) assisting in the stabilization of the substrate through exposure of their backbone polar groups and opening up a cavity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) that will bind the substrate.</p><p>The propagation of the motion of the HP2 loop to the helical segment HP2a is restrained by its tertiary contacts with TM7. In particular, the interhelical contacts between Gly-354 (HP2 tip) and Ile-309 (TM7) and between Ala-345 (HP2a) and Gln-318 (TM7) limit the motion of HP2 from two ends, thus preventing the wide opening of the EC gate. See <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> for the position of these residues in the core domain. Supplemental Fig. S3 shows the high stability of the contacts between Gln-318 and the near neighboring residues on HP2a, supporting a role of Gln-318 in controlling the EC gating.</p><p>The tendency of the HP2 loop to dissociate from the HP1 loop and interact instead with the aqueous environment is invariably confirmed in three independent runs, MD0, MD5, and MD6. In each case, one or more subunit(s) exhibited this structure-induced tendency to &#x0201c;open up&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), apparently yielding to the competing effect of water molecules that disrupt the interaction between the HP1 and HP2 tips. Note that both helices TM7 and TM8 are partially unwound at this region, and the manifested mobility may partly result from the need to release the internal strain or to satisfy these &#x0201c;frustrated&#x0201d; structural elements including in particular the <sup>310</sup>NMDGT<sup>314</sup> motif on TM7, as will be further elaborated below. The time profiles in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>A-C</italic></xref>, show that the transition of HP2 from closed to open form is an abrupt change, suggestive of a conformational &#x0201c;switch.&#x0201d; The onset of the first opening varies from 1.5 ns (MD0, subunit A) to 15 ns (MD5, subunit C). No net correlation was detected between the opening events of the individual subunits. The occurrence of two &#x0201c;states,&#x0201d; open and closed, is also supported by the histograms in <italic>panels A</italic>&#x02032;<italic>-C</italic>&#x02032;. A bimodal distribution is seen therein for the distance between the tips of HP1 and HP2 loops. The narrow peak around 2 &#x000c5; refers to the closed form. The open form, on the other hand, samples a broad range of distances, consistent with its disordered state.</p><p><italic>Diffusion of Glutamate toward the Binding Site</italic>&#x02014;The cavity that opens up to the aqueous basin upon EC gating (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) contains charged/polar residues (<italic>e.g.</italic> Arg-276 and Ser-277-Ser-279 on HP1 and the NMDGT motif on TM7, all conserved among different subtypes of EAATs) with a high affinity for attracting the substrate. HP2, thus, serves not only as an EC gate permitting the entry of the neurotransmitter but also as an attractor driving the diffusion of the substrate toward the binding site.</p><p>Next, we explored the possibility of such a directed diffusion of the substrate toward the putative binding site between HP1 and HP2 tips. To address this issue, we performed the runs MD1 and MD2 using as initial conformation an open form of the transporter, <italic>e.g.</italic> the conformation visited at 5 ns in MD0 where subunit A was open (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The glutamate was observed to spontaneously move toward the open subunit (subunit A) and slide into the putative binding site in between HP1 and HP2 (Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and supplemental Movie 2) within a nanosecond when it was placed at a position sufficiently distant from the EC region in the aqueous basin. Note that the original radial distance between the glutamate substrate and the closest residues on HP2 was more than 20 &#x000c5; in both of these simulations and decreases to less than 2 &#x000c5; within 1 ns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, the recognition of the substrate by the open subunit A and the radial diffusion of the substrate toward this particular subunit are achieved without exerting any external forces/biases in that direction but as a result of the long-range attraction exerted by the polar/charged groups exposed to the basin upon HP2 opening.</p><p>The runs MD1 and MD2 demonstrate that the substrate is readily driven toward the open subunit provided that it reaches a relatively deeper position in the basin. Next, we investigated the diffusion of the substrate from the outside (EC region) to the basin. To this aim we conducted two runs, MD5 and MD6, with glutamate and aspartate molecules included at random positions in the EC and IC regions but not in the basin. We also included in the bulk environment sodium, potassium, and chloride ions at physiological levels. No substrate molecule was observed to diffuse to the basin, although the simulations were extended up to 50 ns in each case. These results suggest that the diffusion of the substrate from the EC region to the interior of the basin could be a rate-limiting process in substrate binding. Once the substrate enters the basin, on the other hand, it takes only nanoseconds to &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; the open hairpin HP2 and diffuse to this highly attractive region to reach a low energy state.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>EC gate opening events observed in three independent runs.</bold><italic>Panels A-C</italic> refer to the respective runs MD0, MD5, and MD6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Because MD6 was conducted with near-physiological concentrations of ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the comparison with MD0 may provide insights into the effect of ionic strength on conformational dynamics.

However, a closer examination (essential dynamics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>)) of all trajectories in the context of the Na<sup>+</sup> effect on substrate binding clearly shows how the subunit mobilities tend to be enhanced with higher concentrations of ions in the bulk. The <italic>left two panels</italic> in supplementary Fig. S4 display the dispersion of the modes obtained from the runs MD0 and MD6 for the hairpin HP1 (<italic>dotted</italic>) and HP2 (<italic>solid</italic>) in the three subunits A (<italic>black</italic>), B (<italic>red</italic>), and C (<italic>green</italic>). The ordinate provides a measure of the amplitudes of motions driven by the individual modes (rank-ordered along the <italic>abscissa</italic>, starting from the lowest frequency mode). Clearly, the HP2 hairpin in the subunit that opens up (<italic>A, black</italic>) exhibits the largest mobility in the slowest mode compared with the other subunits, and these differences in mobility vanish at higher modes. What is remarkable, however, is the significant enhancement in the mobility of the same subunit in the medium with the higher ionic strength (compare the root mean square amplitude of &#x0223c;6.5 &#x000c5; in MD6 and 3.5 &#x000c5; in MD0 in mode 1).

In particular, the hydrogen bonds formed with the hydroxyl groups on the Ser-277-Ser-278-Ser-279 motif play a major role in stabilizing the substrate, confirmed in both MD1 and MD2, and gradually pulling the substrate deeper into the binding pocket (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The interactions with Ser-277-Ser-278-Ser-279 are closely maintained once formed (<italic>black curve</italic> in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). We also repeated our simulations by using aspartate and compared the binding pose from simulations with that observed in the high resolution structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Supplemental Fig. S5 shows the similarity between the protein-substrate interactions observed in simulations and experiments.</p><p><italic>The Substrate, Once Bound, Does Not Dissociate, but Inserts Deeper into the Binding Pocket</italic>&#x02014;Remarkably, as soon as the glutamate slips into the binding site, the hairpin HP2 moves closer toward HP1 so as to optimize its interaction and maintains a relatively closer interaction with the core residues near the binding site. No escape of glutamate to the aqueous basin was observed in any run. This is consistent with the kinetic data reported by Otis and Jahr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) where the forward rate constant for glutamate binding is 6 orders of magnitude larger than the backward reaction (dissociation) rate constant. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref> illustrates the close coordination of the substrate at the binding at the end of MD1. Residues involved in stabilizing the substrate (labeled in the diagram) are in agreement with those coordinating the bound aspartate in the high resolution structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). As will be shown below, water molecules and Na<sup>+</sup> further contribute to stabilizing the substrate.</p><p><italic>Mediating Role of Water Molecules and Continual Hydration of Thr-314</italic>&#x02014;In addition to the glutamate, the water molecules in the basin exhibit a tendency to diffuse to the binding site and to move in and out through the putative EC gate before glutamate binding. But once the glutamate blocks the EC gate upon binding, they find another entry through an interstitial region between HP2 and TM8. Two highly conserved aspartic acids on TM8, Asp-390 and Asp-394, are instrumental in facilitating their entry. TM8 has been pointed out to form a portion of the transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Supplemental Fig. S6 and Movie 3 illustrate the trajectories of five water molecules located at distant positions at the beginning of the run MD1, which enter the binding site at around 3.5 ns.

In the absence of glutamate, when the putative EC gate was open, an exchange of water molecules was observed at this site (see supplemental Fig. S7), but once the glutamate was bound, the bound water molecule remained locked at this precise position throughout the rest of the simulations in both MD1 and MD2. The equivalent residue Thr-402 in human EAAT1 is functionally dead when mutated to alanine (data not shown).

Binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to the substrate-bound subunit, on the other hand, exhibits a severe suppression in the mobility of the EC gate, in favor of the closed form, as evidenced by the lower panel. These two runs were conducted with two different states of substrate-bound transporter, where the EC gate in subunit A was originally open (MD3) or closed (MD4), and in either case the closed form, evidenced by inter-hairpin distance of about 3 &#x000c5;, was attained shortly after Na<sup>+</sup> binding, and this form remains stable.

This propensity is supported by a new crystal of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in complex with the non-transportable blocker <sc>dl</sc>-<italic>threo</italic>-&#x003b2;-benzyloxyaspartate in which the HP2 loop is dislocated from the substrate binding site compared with the substrate bound structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Gly-354 and Gly-357 (Gly-442 and Gln-445 in hEAAT1) play a dual role in this process: they impart high flexibility to this hairpin, and they assist in recognizing the substrate. Interestingly, the equivalent residues Ser-440 and Ser-443 in GLT-1 have been implicated in Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).</p><p>Within the time frame of our simulations we have observed the opening of one or two subunits but not all three subunits at the same time. This raises the issue of a possible interdependence between the three subunits which may preclude the simultaneous opening of the three gates. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the statistical distribution of open and closed states. The fraction of time a given subunit resided in the closed form, averaged over all subunits and all runs in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, was found to be 0.562. Using this prior probability and assuming the three EC gate opening events to be independent, the expected probabilities of observing 0, 1, 2, or 3 subunits open at a give time are 0.18, 0.42, 0.32, and 0.08, respectively. The fractional residence times of these respective states observed in our simulations are on the other hand, 0.20, 0.44, 0.36, and 0.0. The high correlation (0.98) between the observed distributions and those expected from independent dynamics of the three HP2 loops is in accord with recent studies suggesting that individual subunits function independently for both substrate transport and anion channeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). The fact that the state with all three HP2 loops open was not observed may be due to inadequate sampling of rare events in MD, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a weak effect induced by intersubunit coupling.</p><p><italic>Directed Diffusion and Binding of Substrate within Nanoseconds</italic>&#x02014;The EC gate opening would not be so effective if it were not for the polar groups and, in particular, a sequence of three serines (Ser-277-Ser-278-Ser-279) on HP1 tip that were exposed to the aqueous basin upon opening of the EC gate. These residues serve as efficient attractors directing the diffusion of the glutamate. The substrate remains bound in the core domain for tens of nanoseconds.</p><p>The present study underscores the importance of the HP1 serines (Ser-364-Ser-365-Ser-366 in EAAT1). The uptake activities of several EAAT carriers are significantly impaired when residues in this serine stretch are mutated or substituted with cysteine and modified with sulfhydryl modifying reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Other charged/polar residues that come into play include Asp-390, Asp-394, Arg-397, and Thr-398 on TM8 and Asp-312-Thr-314 on TM7, illustrated in Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Notably, these are all conserved residues among the members of the human EAAT family. Asp-394 and Arg-397 have been proposed to interact with the amino and &#x003b3;-carboxyl oxygens of the substrate, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Asp-312-Thr-314 belongs to the conserved NMDGT motif. The role of Asp-439 (EAAC1), equivalent to Asp-390 (Glt<sub>ph</sub>), has been recently confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). That of Thr-398 awaits further experimental verification.</p><p><italic>Role of Water Molecules</italic>&#x02014;Glutamate binding is preceded by the association of a water molecule with Thr-314, which in turn stabilizes a Na<sup>+</sup>. These observed interactions presumably compensate for the broken hydrogen bonds at the NMDGT motif of TM7, thus stabilizing a region that is energetically frustrated before substrate/ion binding. In the substrate-bound subunit, water molecules find their way into the binding site through another narrow region, near Asp-390 and Asp-394 on TM8. TM8 forms a kink near Asp-390, centered at Gly-388, and again, similar to the unwound central portion of TM7, this region exhibits a high avidity for forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules and/or salt bridges with the substrate or sodium ions.</p><p><italic>Functional Significance of the Unwound Regions of TM Helices</italic>&#x02014;The above results provide evidence for the role of the unwound regions on TM7 and TM8. The marginal (in)stability of these regions predisposes them to engage in intermolecular contacts. Structural models generated by Weinstein and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>) for neurotransmitter/Na<sup>+</sup> symporter family members using the resolved leucine transporter (LeuT) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) as a template also showed that the charged moieties of the substrate interact with the unwound region in the helix TM1. TM1 in LeuT is the structural counterpart of TM7 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (or EAATs). As noted by Gouaux and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), TM1(LeuT)/TM7(Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) exhibit similar Na<sup>+</sup> binding motifs at their unwound regions despite the low sequence similarity of the families EAATs and neurotransmitter/Na<sup>+</sup> symporters. Our study confirms the role of the unwound region on TM7 and also invites attention to that of the unwound region in TM8.</p><p><italic>Na</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Binding and Stabilization of the EC Gate</italic>&#x02014;In our simulations one of the sodium ions selects a highly stable conformation coordinated by Asn-310 and Asp-312 on the NMDGT motif and Gly-404 on TM8. It has been proposed that at least one Na<sup>+</sup> binds before substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). Interestingly, the equivalent residue of Asp-312 in EAAC1 (D367) has been proposed to be involved in the Na<sup>+</sup> binding before substrate binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Therefore, we propose that this could be the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site before substrate binding. In MD4, two Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites were observed, the first very close to that observed in the x-ray structure, and the second in the vicinity, although not identical. At the second binding site in the x-ray structure, the Na<sup>+</sup> interacts with residues on HP2a and Thr-308 on TM7, whereas in the MD simulations, the cation interacts with the bound glutamate, water molecules, and Ala-307 on TM7. During the crystallization of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, thallium was used to enhance the anomalous scattering signaling. Although competition experiments were performed to confirm that the thallium anomalous density peak could be diminished by Na<sup>+</sup> competition, it is possible that the actual residues contributing to Na<sup>+</sup> binding differ from those obtained in the presence of thallium. Our functional assays with two mutants L391A and L391C (Leu-391 is the equivalent residue in hEAAT1 of Leu-303 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) showed a substantially increased Na<sup>+</sup><italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> on both of these mutants, suggesting that Leu-303 could be involved in Na<sup>+</sup> binding. Whether Leu-303 directly binds Na<sup>+</sup> or whether the experimental data reflect a less direct structural effect remains to be further established.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>FIGURE 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Histogram of HP1-HP2 distance reflecting EC gate dynamics, shown for subunit A in all simulations.</bold> The figure displays the bimodal distribution of the HP1-HP2 tip distances in MD0 (<italic>yellow</italic>), MD1 (<italic>red</italic>), MD2 (<italic>orange</italic>), MD3 (<italic>blue</italic>), MD4(<italic>cyan</italic>), and MD6 (<italic>pink</italic>), consistent with two states, open and closed, sampled by the EC gate. The narrow peak around 0.2 nm corresponds to the closed state, whereas the broader peak around 0.9 nm corresponds to the open state. Na<sup>+</sup> binding strongly favors the closed state as evidenced by the contributions of MD3 and MD4 to the peak corresponding to the closed state.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0430851900010"></graphic></fig></p><p>A summary of the results from all runs presented in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> permits us to better assess the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> binding on EC gate dynamics. The figure shows histograms derived from the essential dynamics analysis of the HP2 motions, which unambiguously display a bimodal distribution of conformations sampled by the EC gate with two peaks corresponding to open and closed states (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). In the absence of bound substrate, the subunits exhibit a higher tendency to sample the open state (MD0 and MD6), and this tendency is maintained, albeit at a lesser extent, in the presence of bound substrate (MD1 and MD2). Strikingly, Na<sup>+</sup> binding significantly enhances the propensity for closed conformation (MD3 and MD4).</p><p><italic>Insights into the Structure and Function of the Mammalian Orthologues</italic>&#x02014;On a broader perspective, the intrinsic ability of the transporter to drive the diffusion of the neurotransmitter to its binding site and effectively stabilize it in a constricted region before its release to the IC region is consistent with recent studies pointing to the structure-induced tendency of allosteric enzymes and receptor proteins to undergo conformational changes that are functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). These observations further suggest that three-dimensional structures have evolved to favor functional motions. Glt<sub>Ph</sub> shows a close sequence similarity to its eukaryotic counterparts. Information on the dynamics of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, thus, provides insights into the mechanism of function of mammalian orthologues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The similarities in the Na<sup>+</sup> coordination geometry (supplemental Fig. S9) and aspartate coordination (supplemental Fig. S5) with the x-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) also support mechanisms shared by conserved residues in glutamate transporters.</p><p>A widely held view with regard to glutamate transport has been the &#x0201c;alternating access&#x0201d; model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) in which the binding sites for substrates and co-substrates are alternatively exposed to the EC and IC regions via large scale conformational changes in the transporter. Recent studies, on the other hand, point to small-scale motions that accomplish glutamate uptake in EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), and a series of small conformational changes have been proposed to propagate across the transporter structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Our simulations also support the importance of local motions for glutamate binding. However, the present study focused on recognition and binding events in substrate transport, and it is conceivable that such events which occur on the nanoseconds regime involve local movements. Further permeation into the protein and release into the cell interior, on the other hand, may require larger scale cooperative motions of the domains and subunits. Coarse-grained normal mode analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) may shed light into allosteric mechanisms that enable the permeation and translocation of substrate, as suggested by applications to other multimeric membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800889200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800889200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="M800889200_md0_core1.avi"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="M800889200_md1_core1_glu.avi"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="M800889200_md1_core_h20.avi"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="M800889200_md2_core_na_h2o.avi"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Amara, S.
