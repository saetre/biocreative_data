However, its contribution to synapse formation and organization remains unclear. Using a combined electron microscopic, genetic, and pharmacological approach, we uncover a new mechanism through which PSD-95 regulates synaptogenesis. We find that PSD-95 overexpression affected spine morphology but also promoted the formation of multiinnervated spines (MISs) contacted by up to seven presynaptic terminals. The formation of multiple contacts was specifically prevented by deletion of the PDZ<sub>2</sub> domain of PSD-95, which interacts with nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). Similarly, PSD-95 overexpression combined with small interfering RNA&#x02013;mediated down-regulation or the pharmacological blockade of NOS prevented axon differentiation into varicosities and multisynapse formation. Conversely, treatment of hippocampal slices with an NO donor or cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue induced MISs. NOS blockade also reduced spine and synapse density in developing hippocampal cultures. These results indicate that the postsynaptic site, through an NOS&#x02013;PSD-95 interaction and NO signaling, promotes synapse formation with nearby axons.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AMPA, &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; DETA, diethylenetriamine; DIV, day in vitro; L-NAME, <sc>l</sc>-<italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-nitroarginine methyl ester; LTP, long-term potentiation; MIS, multiinnervated spine; nNOS, neuronal NOS; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, NO synthase; PSD, postsynaptic density.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Postsynaptic scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, which includes such members as postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), SAP-97, or SAP102, play major roles in synapse organization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funke et al., 2005</xref>). Among these proteins, PSD-95 has been particularly studied because in the central nervous system it is one of the major constituents of excitatory PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), and it is directly involved in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>). Overexpression of PSD-95 in neurons is associated with modifications in the properties of synaptic transmission, which mimic and occlude long-term potentiation (LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stein et al., 2003</xref>). This effect appears to be related to a role of PSD-95 in the synaptic targeting of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnell et al., 2002</xref>) and in their regulated expression during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004</xref>). For this, PSD-95 interacts with the AMPA receptor&#x02013;associated protein stargazin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnell et al., 2002</xref>) and regulates not only the surface expression of AMPA receptors but also their diffusion and trapping at synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bats et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to synaptic function, PSD-95 has also been proposed to affect synapse maturation and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Roo et al., 2008</xref>) and, thus, synapse number. Acute knockdown of PSD-95 reduces the development of synaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrlich et al., 2007</xref>), and PSD-95 mutant mice exhibit variations in spine densities in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vickers et al., 2006</xref>). However, these mechanisms remain essentially unexplained but could depend on several interesting properties of the protein. PSD-95 shows a continuous dynamic regulation between intracellular and synaptic pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bresler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2006</xref>) and also interacts with several important synaptic proteins, including synaptic GTPase-activating protein, neuroligins, or nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), which might mediate trans-synaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Sheng, 2004</xref>) for synapse formation or stabilization.</p><p>To examine these issues, we used a quantitative electron microscopic analysis of serially sectioned dendritic segments of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slice cultures and found that overexpression of PSD-95 not only affected the morphological characteristics of dendritic spines but also resulted in the formation of spines contacted by several different presynaptic partners. Through genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we provide evidence that this effect depends on an interaction between PSD-95 and NOS and requires NO signaling. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism through which expression of PSD-95 promotes synapse formation with nearby axons, a result that strongly emphasizes the importance of the postsynaptic element in driving contact formation during synaptogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ultrastructural analyses of PSD-95&#x02013;transfected pyramidal neurons</title><p>To examine the effect of PSD-95 overexpression on spine morphology, we transfected hippocampal organotypic slice cultures with a PSD-95 tagged with EGFP using a biolistic approach. 2 d after transfection, neurons showed the classical punctuate PSD-95 staining of synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).

The spine volume increased by factors of 2.3 and 2.8 when compared with either EGFP neurons (0.144 &#x000b1; 0.023 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> vs. 0.064 &#x000b1; 0.011 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>) or nontransfected neurons (0.051 &#x000b1; 0.006 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>; P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

MISs contacted by two terminals can be observed in the hippocampus in vivo and in vitro and account for a small fraction of all spines, although during the early postnatal development, dendritic protrusions exhibiting multiple synaptic contacts are rather prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>). PSD-95 transfection resulted in a significant increase in the number of MISs (mean number: EGFP control, 2.0 &#x000b1; 1.3%; nontransfected, 1.8 &#x000b1; 1.1%; PSD-95, 29.1 &#x000b1; 2.9%; P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and in their complexity. On some dendritic segments, their occurrence increased markedly, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> in which 16 out of 28 spines exhibited synaptic contacts with multiple presynaptic terminals. The increased complexity of these structures is indicated by the number of presynaptic terminals making contact with a single spine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). This number varied between two and seven in PSD-95&#x02013;transfected cells, whereas the maximum observed under control conditions was only two (see Fig. S2 for a distribution of the number of contacts). Furthermore, in the case of MISs, the individual PSDs could show a complex organization with perforated or segmented PSDs in the synaptic contacts made by several axons on the same spine (Videos 1 and 2). A final characteristic of MISs is their unusually large size (0.29 &#x000b1; 0.028 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> compared with 0.064 &#x000b1; 0.011 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> in EGFP-transfected cells) and the fact that they exhibit large PSD areas both at individual contacts (0.164 &#x000b1; 0.012 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> compared with 0.033 &#x000b1; 0.004 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in EGFP-transfected cells; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 190 and 175 PSDs, respectively; P &#x0003c; 0.01) and on the entire spine (sum of all PSDs on a given spine, 0.466 &#x000b1; 0.047 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 68 MISs; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>MISs induced by PSD-95 overexpression.</bold> (A) EM picture of a section through an MIS showing three axonal terminals (arrowheads) making synaptic contacts with a transfected spine.

Numerous interactions of PSD-95 occur through its PDZ domains that typically bind PDZ domains or specific carboxy-terminal sequences in target proteins. We started by generating PSD-95 mutants with deletions in the PDZ<sub>2</sub> and PDZ<sub>3</sub> regions. PDZ<sub>2</sub> binds synaptic GTPase-activating protein, an adhesion molecule implicated in the regulation of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>), and neuronal NOS (nNOS), the source of a possible trans-synaptic messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tochio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sunico et al., 2005</xref>), whereas the PDZ<sub>3</sub> domain is involved in interactions with neuroligin, another adhesion molecule implicated in synapse formation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerrow et al., 2006</xref>).

Their proportion did not change, nor did the mean spine volume or PSD area of three-dimensionally reconstructed spines as compared with PSD-95&#x02013;transfected neurons (MISs, 22.1 &#x000b1; 4.5% vs. 29.1 &#x000b1; 2.9%; spine volume, 0.168 &#x000b1; 0.012 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> vs. 0.144 &#x000b1; 0.023 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>; PSD area, 0.169 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> vs. 0.189 &#x000b1; 0.043 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 and 7 cells for PDZ<sub>3</sub> mutant and PSD-95&#x02013;transfected cells, respectively; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;E</xref>).

For this, we performed two groups of experiments to examine whether suppression of NOS activity in cells overexpressing PSD-95 prevented the formation of MISs. First, we used an NOS siRNA, which markedly inhibited nNOS expression in fibroblasts (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805132/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805132/DC1</ext-link>) and also interfered with NOS expression at synapses (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

The expression of PSD-95 resulted in changes in spine shape, a marked increase of the spine volume, and an enlargement of the PSD, resulting in the formation of synapses with complex and perforated or segmented PSDs. The effect is very significant because, on average, the PSD area increased by a factor of six to eight, and the spine volume increased about threefold, emphasizing the close relationship existing between spine volume and PSD size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Stevens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 1992</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that PSD-95, as a major scaffold protein, shapes the PSD and regulates the expression of several proteins or receptors that are important for synaptic function and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), including NOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2006</xref>). This probably accounts for the general increase in synaptic efficacy and AMPA receptor&#x02013;mediated currents reported at individual synapses in PSD-95&#x02013;transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004</xref>). It is also interesting that the changes associated with PSD-95 overexpression share many similarities, both at the functional and morphological level, with those reported after LTP induction. At the functional level, PSD-95 overexpression mimics and occludes LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004</xref>), whereas at the morphological level, the two situations seem to involve an enlargement of the spine and the formation of spines with complex, perforated PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geinisman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchs and Muller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>). One possibility with regard to these changes in spine volume and efficiency is that they promote spine stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The most intriguing finding of this study, however, is the observation that overexpression of PSD-95 results in the formation of MISs. Although dendritic spines connected by two distinct presynaptic terminals can occasionally be found in the hippocampus, their number is usually low, in the range of a few percentages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>). However, MISs are regulated under various conditions involving enhanced synaptogenesis such as the blockade of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrak et al., 2005</xref>) or induction of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>). There is also one study suggesting the existence of MISs in a hibernating mammal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Popov et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we found that overexpression of PSD-95 increased their occurrence by a factor of 10 as well as their complexity because MISs contacted by three to seven different axon terminals were frequently observed. It is interesting that these conditions of enhanced spine innervation and synaptic efficacy were actually associated with a reduction of spine density. The mechanisms remain unclear but could involve a kind of homeostatic process through which activity may regulate the number of synapses.</p><p>The importance of these findings resides in the new understanding of the role of PSD-95 and of its interaction with nNOS for mechanisms of synaptogenesis and their regulation of presynaptic differentiation and contact formation. Our results demonstrate that PSD-95 controls synapse formation through its regulation of nNOS expression at the synapse, the release of NO, and most likely the activation of cGMP signaling in presynaptic axons. This conclusion is supported by several observations: (a) PSD-95 overexpression is associated with an increased expression of nNOS in PSDs and the formation of MISs; (b) deletion of the PDZ<sub>2</sub> domain of PSD-95 specifically prevented the increased expression of nNOS and the formation of MISs; (c) overexpression of PSD-95 together with siRNA down-regulation of nNOS also markedly reduced nNOS expression at the synapse and prevented formation of MISs; (d) the pharmacological blockade of nNOS prevented MIS formation; and, conversely, (e) the exogenous application of the NO donor DETA NONOate or enhancement of cGMP signaling, a classical downstream target of NO, reproduced MIS formation in the entire slice culture and without alterations of PSD size. Also, DETA NONOate treatment was able to rescue the absence of MISs in PDZ<sub>2</sub>-transfected cells, and, finally, the pharmacological blockade of nNOS interfered with spine and synapse development under control conditions. Thus, PSD-95 and nNOS are key regulators of the mechanisms of synapse formation.</p><p>This conclusion is consistent with and could account for the defects in synapse development reported upon suppression of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrlich et al., 2007</xref>). This is also in line with the variations in spine density found in various brain areas in PSD-95 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vickers et al., 2006</xref>), although some compensatory mechanisms could probably be involved. Most importantly, however, these results may help to understand the function of PSD-95 in the stabilization of new synapses. During development, spine turnover in cortical structures is rather high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Roo et al., 2008</xref>), and recent evidence indicates that newly formed spines do initially grow without a PSD and possibly without a presynaptic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arellano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Roo et al., 2008</xref>). PSDs, and particularly PSD-95, start to be expressed after a few hours, a step that is critical for the stabilization of the newly formed spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marrs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prange and Murphy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Roo et al., 2008</xref>). Our current results suggest a scenario in which PSD-95 expression at a new protrusion, through association with nNOS and NO production, would stimulate the differentiation of a close-by axon into a presynaptic varicosity and the establishment of a morphologically mature synapse. NO release would therefore represent a signal informing axons in the vicinity of the existence of a potential postsynaptic partner, and absence of NO or failure of axons to respond could then result in elimination of the protrusion.</p><p>Upon overexpression of PSD-95, this mechanism is overemphasized, and more axons located around the spine become stimulated by NO, start to differentiate into varicosities, and then form MISs, an effect that could be mediated by activation of cGMP signaling in presynaptic structures. Alternatively, the excess of NO release could represent a local neurotoxic situation to which axons respond by increasing synaptogenesis. Although difficult to exclude, this possibility seems unlikely because MISs are formed exclusively with PSD-95&#x02013;overexpressing spines and not with other spines in the area, indicating specificity. Furthermore, the role of PSD-95 and NO uncovered in this study is likely to be physiologically relevant for different reasons. First, it certainly operates under control conditions for the formation of synapses involving a single presynaptic partner because, as shown in this study, the acute blockade of nNOS resulted in a marked reduction in the density of dendritic spines and of synapse formation. Second, these mechanisms can also account for the formation of MISs both in control brain tissue and under conditions in which MISs are increased, such as after the blockade of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrak et al., 2005</xref>) or induction of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>). A role for NO in these mechanisms would actually be in line with previous work showing that the application of an NO donor to hippocampal slice cultures results in an increased dynamic and growth of presynaptic varicosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonenko et al., 2003</xref>). Third, this mechanism could also account for the observation that newly formed spines in adult tissue or on newly generated neurons very often target existing terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Toni et al., 2007</xref>), providing a means through which newly formed dendritic protrusions can enter into competition with preexisting synaptic contacts. The role of PSD-95 in regulating these mechanisms might therefore be instrumental for the stabilization and pruning of synaptic networks and emphasizes the critical role played by the postsynaptic structure in driving the selection of the presynaptic partner. Finally, these mechanisms might also be implicated in some neuropathological aspects because multiinnervated giant spines have been reported along Purkinje cells during malnutrition or in the cortical tissue surrounding tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Hillman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiala et al., 2002</xref>). Excessive expression of PSD-95 or nNOS under these conditions could account for these abnormalities. In conclusion, the molecular regulation between PSD-95 and nNOS uncovered in this study provides a new mechanism through which postsynaptic structures can promote synapse formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Slice cultures, constructs, and siRNAs</title><p>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from 7-d-old rat pups as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoppini et al., 1991</xref>), and all experiments were performed with slice cultures maintained 11&#x02013;15 d in vitro (DIV).</p><p>The PSD-95&#x02013;EGFP fusion construct prepared in the GW1 mammalian expression vector was a gift from D.S.

Usually, one out of four transfected slice cultures (with 1&#x02013;10 transfected pyramidal cells per slice) showed efficient transfection of pyramidal cells.
