Our data have shown that LRP-5, one of two canonical Wnt signaling receptors, is required for ductal stem cell maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since several Wnt family genes are differentially expressed in the virgin, pregnant, and lactating mammary gland, some of them regulated by ovarian hormones, it would not be surprising if these Wnt proteins have other, as yet unidentified functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>During pregnancy, mammary glands undergo substantial changes induced by steroid and peptide hormones. Progesterone signaling is predominantly responsible for the growth and differentiation of the lobuloalveolar lineage that is characteristic of early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Brisken et al (2000) concluded that Wnt4 expression was important to side-branching and lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy, and was regulated by progesterone/PR signaling. Thus, <italic>Wnt4 </italic>null epithelium failed to form side-branches and lobuloalveoli in transplanted mammary fat pads during early pregnancy (12 days of pregnancy). Early developmental defects were overcome in late stage of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, Wnt4 expression was induced in vitro in cultured mammary epithelial cells by estrogen and progesterone, and also in vivo in a progesterone-dependent manner during the estrus cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus Wnt4 is considered a downstream mediator of progesterone/progesterone receptor (PR)-induced signaling.</p><p>Wnt4 is key to several developmental processes. Wnt4 null mice have no kidneys, due to early failure of the nephric mesenchymal-epithelial transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Wnt4 is also key to establishing gonadal identity in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Decidualization (uterine stromal differentiation) is induced by progesterone/BMP2, and requires Wnt4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is active during motorneuron specification (together with Wnt5a and-b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which Wnt4 induces proliferation and morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells has not been investigated. Therefore, for the present study, we developed bi-transgenic mice that express Wnt4 in mammary epithelial cells in response to tetracycline. By mating tet-operator driven Wnt4 transgenic mice with mice expressing reverse tetracycline trans-activator (rtTA) under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-LTR promoter, we were able to induce expression of transgene in mammary glands by doxycycline administration. Unexpectedly (perhaps), ectopic Wnt4 expression did not induce hyper side-branching and lobuloalveolar development in virgin mammary glands. This was despite clear evidence that Wnt16, a Wnt4 transactivation target, was induced in response to tetracycline. Thus, we propose that Wnt4 is required but not sufficient for early lobuloalveolar side-branch development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of tetracycline-inducible Wnt4 transgene cassette and generation of doxycycline-inducible Wnt4 transgenic mice</title><p>To construct a doxycycline-inducible Wnt4 transgene cassette (TMILA-Wnt4), mouse Wnt4 cDNA was subcloned downstream of tet operator sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and a minimal CMV promoter into the first cistron of a bicistronic construct.

There were no overt changes in early morphogenesis during pregnancy, or during the first 5 days of pseudo-pregnancy (after mating with a vasectomized male; data not shown). In line with their normal virgin morphology, the mitotic indices of these bitransgenic glands were also normal (measured using Ki67 immunohistochemistry, or BrDU incorporation; data not shown). We conclude that ectopic Wnt4 expression is not sufficient to induce hyper side-branching.</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt4 does not induce canonical Wnt signaling reporter gene expression in mammary epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro</title><p>Recent studies suggest that the receptor species available determine the Wnt signaling responses, rather than any particular Wnt ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, Wnt ligands can induce so-called "canonical" Wnt signaling by forming a tertiary complex with Frizzled and LRP-5/6, while non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are mediated through Frizzled alone or atypical receptor tyrosine kinases such as Ryk and Ror [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate whether mammary epithelial cells in culture could respond to Wnt4 with the activation of canonical Wnt signaling, we measured Wnt transactivation using a TCF-&#x003b2; catenin reporter assay. Primary mammary epithelial cells (prepared from adult virgin mammary glands) were transfected with Wnt ligand expression plasmids together with the superTOP-Flash reporter plasmid (encoding a luciferase gene downstream from eight TCF/LEF binding sites). Wnt1, a commonly used inducer of canonical Wnt signaling in mammary gland, was used as a positive control. Although ectopic Wnt1 expression induced reporter gene expression in mammary epithelial cells, Wnt4 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The specificity of this reporter gene assay was confirmed using a scrambled superFOP-flash reporter plasmid (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Wnt4 does not induce canonical Wnt signaling in mammary epithelial or fibroblast cells <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>.

Therefore, we tested the canonical response of mammary fibroblast cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Again, we showed that reporter gene expression was easily induced by Wnt1 in a dose dependent manner, but not by Wnt4. Therefore, we conclude that Wnt4 is not a canonical effector in either cell context.</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt4 is biologically active</title><p>The lack of functional activity associated with Wnt4 in these <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>analyses led us to examine whether the Wnt4 expression vector was generating biologically active protein. Zebrafish embryos have long been used to study the role of various Wnt ligands during development, and the expression pattern and functionality of Wnt ligands is remarkably highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish. Ectopic misexpression of zebrafish Wnt4 (zWnt4; zebrafish homolog of Wnt4) during embryogenesis has been characterized. At 26 hours, zWnt4 mRNA-injected embryos display phenotypes (such as cyclopia, notochord defects, misfolding or laterally displaced hindbrain, and shortened trunk and tail) that arise from an inhibition of convergence and extension movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Taking advantage of this, we injected mouse Wnt4 (mWnt4) mRNA (transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>) into fertilized zebrafish embryos (1~4 cell stage) and examined the gain of function phenotypes after 24~26 hours. As predicted by the fact that mWnt4 and zWnt4 share over 80% identity in amino acid sequences, ectopic misexpression of mWnt4 displayed similar gain of function phenotypes to those previously reported zWnt4-induced phenotypes, including cyclopia, shortened tail and trunk, and abnormalities in brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), thought to be the result of abnormal cell movement. Furthermore, phenotypes induced by mWnt4 were different from mWnt1. Although ectopic misexpression of mWnt1 also displayed developmental abnormalities in brain and shortened trunk and tail, mWnt1 induced unique dorsalization phenotypes such as "tail-up" and "bustled" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We classified the gain of function phenotypes into 4 groups (severe, strong, mild and none), and quantified the phenotypes induced by different mRNA injection doses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The quantification showed that both Wnt4 and Wnt1 induced the gain of function phenotypes in a dose dependent manner. Thus, we confirm that mouse Wnt4 is a biologically active protein that generates distinct phenotypes from Wnt1 (perhaps because of cell type-specific expression of Frizzled (or other) receptors).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Ectopic mouse Wnt4 expression induces a non-canonical Wnt phenotype during zebrafish development</bold>.

The Wnt signaling specific array has 96 primer sets that include most Wnt signaling components and some housekeeping controls.

However, only 18% of the reconstituted glands displayed the "pregnant-like" phenotype, while 55% of the reconstituted glands had normal virgin mammary gland structures. The authors proposed that this might be the result of a low infection efficiency or low dose of Wnt4 protein. It could be that retroviral transduction favors fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and that these cells modify the colonization pattern of mammary epithelial cells, without having a robust effect.</p><p>Alternatively, it is possible that Wnt4 may induce ductal side-branching only in the presence of the correct endocrine environment. Thus, there is evidence that progesterone induces Wnt4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The hormone-induced program includes many different subprograms, and we propose that a cooperating factor is required for Wnt4-induced development. A good candidate as this cooperating factor is the b-HLH protein, Id4, one of the main factors induced in vivo by progesterone-exposure of PR-expressing luminal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Loss of function of Id4 induces hypomorphic side-branching (Yi Li, personal communication), and gain of function induces hyperplasia (but not normal side-branching; John Lydon, personal communication). The requirement of (an)other progesterone-induced factor in addition to Wnt4 during lobuloalveolar development is shown in summary in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Another formal possibility to explain a lack of physiological response is that the relatively higher levels of Wnt4 (mRNA) we observe in transgenic glands (1.5&#x000d7; early pregnancy levels) is too high, or that the Wnt4 protein is unavailable to the responder cells (expressed predominantly in MMTV-positive luminal cells).s</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme of potential pathway for induction of lobuloalveolar development</bold>.

Taken together, we propose that Wnt4 is required, but not sufficient for lobuloalveolar development during early pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt4-induced signaling; Canonical or non-canonical?</title><p>Wnt4 has been classified as a non-canonical ligand. Thus, unlike canonical Wnt ligands such as Wnt1 and Wnt3a, Wnt4 was not able to transform C57 MG cells (an immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cell line of uncertain origin) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], or stabilize endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with those observations, we have shown that Wnt4 had no effect on superTOP-flash reporter gene expression in primary mammary epithelial cells and mammary fibroblast cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Moreover, injection of mouse Wnt4 to zebrafish embryos induced similar phenotypes to zWnt4, classified in the same functional group as Wnt5a, a prototype agonist of non-canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, recent studies have shown that when provided with correct species of Frizzled and sufficient LRP protein, Wnt5a can act as a canonical agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Indeed, Wnt4 activates canonical responses in MDCK kidney cells, and binds Fzd6, though this receptor is unlikely to be signaling receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Receptor context is therefore key to the functional readout.</p><p>Often, Wnt4-dependent physiologies involve more than one cell type. For example, Wnt4 is required for tubulogenesis during kidney development (perhaps a similar epithelial process to ductal side-branch formation), and is induced in mesenchymal cells by an epithelial cell-derived signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Wnt4 expression induced the canonical reporter gene (TOP-gal) in mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and ectopic &#x003b2;-catenin expression was sufficient to replace Wnt4-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In a renal injury model, Wnt4 was able to stabilize endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin and induce reporter gene expression in certain myofibroblast cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, Wnt4 activated canonical signaling in MDCK (Mardin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, other data suggests that Wnt4 inhibited canonical signaling by redirecting the subcellular localization of &#x003b2; catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], or that it is key to hematopoiesis through a &#x003b2; catenin-independent activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These data show that although Wnt4 can function as a canonical signaling agonist in complex cell systems, it has other activities. Interestingly, expression of Wnt1 (a prototype agonist of canonical Wnt signaling) in mammary ductal epithelial cells through either MMTV-LTR promoter or recombinant retrovirus also causes hyper side-branching that cannot be recapitulated by expression of the downstream intracellular transactivator, &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These observations support the idea that canonical signaling activation by soluble Wnt ligands in nearby mesenchymal cells through a paracrine mechanism is necessary for ductal side-branching morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Using qPCR-based array analyses, we found that Wnt16 expression is induced by Wnt4 <italic>in vivo </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study showed that expression of both Wnt4 and Wnt16 is regulated by PR and FOXO1 (forkhead transcription factor 1) during differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into decidual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, knockdown of FOXO1 using small interfering RNAs down-regulates Wnt4 and Wnt16 expression, and knockdown of PR disrupts the regulation of Wnt4 by FOXO1 in human endometrial stromal cells. These data indicate that Wnt16 is a downstream target gene of PR-Wnt4 signaling axis. Interestingly, however, our data also show that ectopic Wnt4-Wnt16 expression is not sufficient to induce side-branching development, suggesting that other cooperating factors need to be provided. Taken together, we propose that PR signaling activates not only Wnt4-Wnt16 expression, but also other cooperating factors, and the orchestrated crosstalk is required for lobuloalveolar development during early pregnancy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we show that Wnt4 expression may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to induce lobuloalveolar development.
