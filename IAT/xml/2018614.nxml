They consist of a metabolite-sensitive aptamer and an adjoining expression platform. Here, we describe ligand-induced folding of a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) responsive riboswitch from <italic>Escherichia coli thiM</italic> mRNA, using chemically labeled variants. Referring to a recent structure determination of the TPP/aptamer complex, each variant was synthesized with a single 2-aminopurine (AP) nucleobase replacement that was selected to monitor formation of tertiary interactions of a particular region during ligand binding in real time by fluorescence experiments. We have determined the rate constants for conformational adjustment of the individual AP sensors. From the 7-fold differentiation of these constants, it can be deduced that tertiary contacts between the two parallel helical domains (P2/J3-2/P3/L3 and P4/P5/L5) that grip the ligand's ends in two separate pockets, form significantly faster than the function-critical three-way junction with stem P1 fully developed. Based on these data, we characterize the process of ligand binding by an induced fit of the RNA and propose a folding model of the TPP riboswitch aptamer. For the full-length riboswitch domain and for shorter constructs that represent transcriptional intermediates, we have additionally evaluated ligand-induced folding via AP-modified variants and provide insights into the sequential folding pathway that involves a finely balanced equilibrium of secondary structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among all three domains of life, gene regulatory systems have evolved that do not require assistance of proteins and that basically act on the level of RNA. So-called &#x02018;riboswitches&#x02019; are represented by non-coding regions of mRNA that selectively recognize metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). Depending on metabolite concentration, two mutually exclusive structures are adopted according to the ligand-bound versus unbound state. This structural response is harnessed by the RNAs to lead to the sequestration or accessibility of Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequences, the formation or destabilization of transcription terminator stems, the activation of ribozymes or the activation of splice sites. A riboswitch consists of an aptamer domain that upon ligand binding is stabilized and thereby alters the base-pairing arrangements in the adjoining expression platform. While the aptamer segments are highly conserved in sequence, the expression platforms are variable. The sequences in the platform determine the &#x02018;ON&#x02019; or &#x02018;OFF&#x02019; character of a riboswitch, meaning that gene expression is either turned on or off in case of ligand binding, and they typically determine the functional level (transcription, translation or splicing).</p><p>The thiamine pyrophosphate-sensing riboswitch accounts for one of the earliest discovered representatives, and it is most widespread among bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">6&#x02013;11</xref>). The very motif also exists in tandem riboswitch modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and in all cases, this riboswitch class controls genes that are involved in the synthesis or transport of thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives. The structure of the TPP-bound aptamer reveals a complex folded RNA in which one subdomain forms an intercalation pocket for the pyrimidine moiety of TPP, whereas another subdomain offers a wider pocket using bivalent metal ions together with water molecules to make contacts to the pyrophosphate moiety of the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structure of the <italic>thiM</italic> riboswitch aptamer from <italic>E. coli</italic> in complex with thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); (<bold>A</bold>) Secondary/tertiary structure presentation in <italic>Leontis&#x02013;Westhof</italic> nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); (<bold>B</bold>) Chemical formula of TPP; (<bold>C</bold>) Cartoon representation of the overall fold of the RNA/ligand complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm580f1"/></fig></p><p>Despite the scores of detailed structural and biochemical studies on TPP riboswitches, the TPP-induced folding process of its aptamer and its full-length domains has not yet been kinetically investigated by biophysical methods, such as fluorescence spectroscopy. This is mainly due to the fact that selective labeling of RNA with the respective size of 50&#x02013;200&#x02009;nt is synthetically highly challenging. Moreover, the ligand TPP and its binding-competent analogs are non-fluorescent and thus cannot be applied for fluorescence studies on ligand-binding kinetics, as has been demonstrated previously in case of FMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and purine riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>), whose ligand FMN and ligand analog 2-aminopurine provide effective fluorescence emission.</p><p>In the present study, we have assessed ligand-induced folding of the <italic>Escherichia coli thiM</italic> riboswitch by a fluorescence spectroscopic approach that we have previously applied successfully to rationalize folding of a different class of riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). For the TPP aptamer domain investigated here, we observe adaptive recognition of the ligand TPP and we reveal the temporal progress of tertiary structure formation. Moreover, while the full-length riboswitch domain remains completely responsive to TPP with kinetic parameters comparable to the aptamer domain alone, ligand binding to RNA variants that represent shorter transcriptional intermediates is hindered. This behavior can be rationalized by competing alternative conformations that are adopted during sequential folding and that are incompetent of ligand binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of riboswitch AP variants</title><p>The 72, 81, 82, 109, 125 and 151&#x02009;nt <italic>thiM</italic> RNAs containing site-specific 2-aminopurine labels were accessible by means of chemical solid-phase synthesis and enzymatic ligation using T4 RNA and/or T4 DNA ligase together with DNA and/or 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl RNA templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref>), as previously described for 2&#x02032;-methylseleno modified and AP-modified purine riboswitch domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>).

The structure reveals a number of nucleobases that can be substituted individually by the fluorescent nucleobase analog 2-aminopurine (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32">26&#x02013;32</xref>) without disturbing the overall fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Following the criteria of retaining hydrogen-bonding patterns and of maintaining highly conserved sequence portions, we selected seven positions of nucleobases that participate in crucial tertiary structure interactions of the aptamer, and synthesized the corresponding RNA variants, each of them labeled with an individual AP at a particular position (A69, G72, U79, U62, U46, A53, A85; <italic>thiM 82</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Based on their fluorescence response upon addition of TPP, binding was confirmed for all variants and binding constants were in the submicromolar range at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1), being well comparable to reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for TPP riboswitch aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Further evidence for the correct functionality of the AP variants came from the observation that their fluorescence emission did not change when thiamine monophosphate or thiamine was added in the same concentration range (10-fold excess over RNA). These control experiments with structurally closely related compounds of TPP confirmed the high specificity of the AP riboswitch variants for their dedicated ligand (Supplementary Figure S2). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><italic>ThiM</italic> TPP riboswitch sequences used in this study; individual nucleobase replacements by 2-aminopurine (AP) are indicated by a circle and the corresponding number of position in red; (<bold>A</bold>) Chemical formula of an AP nucleotide unit; (<bold>B</bold>) Aptamer sequence <italic>thiM 82</italic> (the number in the term indicates the sequence length of 82&#x02009;nt); the truncated aptamer version <italic>thiM 72</italic> is boxed; the sequence refers to the one used for crystal structure determination by Serganov <italic>et al</italic>.

Also nucleotide U79 which resides in the opposite strand of the P4/P5 interface is forced into an extrahelical position and protrudes into solution upon TPP binding (Supplementary Figure S3C). The rate constant measured for the corresponding U79AP variant was slightly higher (<italic>k</italic><sub>25&#x000b0;C</sub> = 12.0 &#x000b1; 0.42 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The 5&#x02032;-helical domain consists of stems P2 and P3 with junction J3-2 shaping the binding pocket for the pyrimidine ring of TPP. Junction J3-2 consists of the sequence 5&#x02032;-U(39)GAGAA adopting a highly complex fold making direct hydrogen-bonding contacts (G40) and direct stacking interactions (G42/pyrimidine/A43) to the pyrimidine ring of TPP. The arrangement is further characterized by non-canonical base pairs, A43&#x000b7;U39 and G42&#x000b7;G19, and by water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks (A41&#x000b7;G18). In principle, one of the J3-2 nucleotides (A44) could be substituted by AP without major structural impairment. However, we decided not to even slightly perturb this highly conserved recognition element and selected the adjacent single nucleotide bulge U46 (of stem P2) for a replacement by AP to detect conformational changes within the 5&#x02032;-helical domain. Like U62 and U79, U46 is unstacked in the ligand-bound state and protrudes into solution (Supplementary Figure S3D). Upon TPP addition to the U46AP variant, we observed a defined fluorescence increase and determined a rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>25&#x000b0;C</sub> of 7.53 &#x000b1; 0.23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The three-way junction connecting stems P1/P2/P4 comprises junction J2-4 and is stabilized by two stacked tetrades in the TPP-bound state. A close-up shows that A53 forms a non-canonical base pair with A84 via the Hoogsteen face and that the nucleobase is sandwiched between U52 and G83 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>)]. The corresponding A53AP variant shows a weak but defined fluorescence enhancement. We determined the rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>25&#x000b0;C</sub> to be only 3.85 &#x000b1; 0.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, the AP replacement at position 85 allowed us to monitor the structuring of the three-way junction via formation of the first base pair of stem P1 (A85:U14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). The rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>25&#x000b0;C</sub> of 2.30 &#x000b1; 0.20 &#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) measured for the corresponding A85AP variant was also significantly smaller compared to the rate constants for AP movements in the helical domains.</p><p>Among the AP-modified aptamer variants studied, U62AP <italic>thiM 82</italic> showed the most prominent fluorescence response during ligand-induced folding. This can be rationalized by the structural change that resembles single nucleotide flipping and unstacks the nucleobase. Because of its high sensitivity and because of its position at the binding site, U62AP represents the most indicative label to assess binding of TPP in a direct manner. In this sense, we synthesized <italic>thiM 72</italic> as U62AP variant lacking all of stem P1 except the first potential base pair (A85:U14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This variant did not respond to addition of TPP in 10-fold excess (and it hardly responded to a 100-fold excess of TPP) although all primary recognition elements for TPP are available within the two large helical domains. The simple connection of these domains by junction J2-4 hence does not provide sufficient entropic stabilization to support binding.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for TPP-induced folding of the aptamer&#x02014;recognition of TPP by the two helical domains is significantly faster than formation of the three-way junction</title><p>Our fluorescence study on the <italic>E. coli thiM</italic> TPP aptamer corroborates a folding model that is characterized by the adaptive recognition of TPP. Strategic positioning of AP fluorescent labels allows us to spectroscopically monitor the individual nucleobase movements in the various subregions until the final fold of the aptamer/TPP complex has been adopted. For each AP movement, an individual rate constant has been assessed and we find a remarkable 7-fold differentiation among the values. This range is large when compared with ligand-induced folding of the equally sized adenine riboswitch aptamer that we investigated previously and where rate differentiation was just &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In the present case of the TPP aptamer, the pronounced differentiation in regional AP folding rates can be well rationalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The &#x02018;fast&#x02019; rate constants concern AP replacements (G72AP, U62AP, U79AP) very close to the pyrophosphate recognition site in the 3&#x02032;-helical domain (P4/P5). Variant A69AP&#x02014;for which the highest rate constant is measured&#x02014;also resides in the 3&#x02032;-helical domain (L5) and is a sensor for formation of tertiary contacts between loop L5 (3&#x02032;-helical domain) and stem P3 (5&#x02032;-helical domain). The AP label of aptamer variant U46AP resides in the 5&#x02032;-helical domain (P2, P3, J3-2) very close to the pyrimidine recognition site and is therefore appropriate to reflect its reorganization. U46AP gives a rate constant somewhat slower than G72AP and U79AP, but still comparable to the rate of U62AP at the pyrophosphate recognition site. Variants A53AP and A85AP whose AP replacements are accommodated in the three-way junction (J2-4, P1) lead to a subset of &#x02018;slow&#x02019; rate constants; their responses reflect reorganization of J2-4 and completion of stem P1, respectively. In the free RNA aptamer, stem P1 seems to be partly preformed since the corresponding A12AP variant remains unaffected upon TPP addition (Supplementary Figure S3E), suggesting that the base pair AP12:U87 may already exist. In contrast, A85AP results in a defined fluorescence decay that can be attributed to formation of the stem-closing base pair (A85:U14) at the three-way junction. Importantly, variant U62AP <italic>thiM 72</italic> which lacks stem P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) did hardly respond to TPP. Formation of stem P1 is therefore a strict requirement for TPP binding although it is not directly involved in ligand recognition. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Proposed model for ligand-induced folding of the <italic>thiM</italic> TPP riboswitch aptamer based on the 7-fold differentiation of rate constants observed for the individual AP variants. Upon TPP binding, base&#x02013;base and base&#x02013;backbone interactions between nucleotides of L5 and P3 are formed (circle 1). Recognition of the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP by the 3&#x02032;-helical domain (P4/P5) occurs almost simultaneously with recognition of the pyrimidine moiety by the 5&#x02032;-helical domain (J3-2) (circle 1 and circle 2). Formation of the three-way junction and closure of stem P1 result from this initial recognition/folding process and require significantly more time to be fully accomplished (circle 3).

TPP acts like a clamp between the two large helical domains and supports&#x02014;on the same timescale&#x02014;formation of tight hydrogen bonding and stacking networks between interdomain (L5/P3) nucleobases that are distant from the three-way junction. Formation of the three-way junction and closure of stem P1 result from this initial recognition/folding process and require significantly more time to be fully accomplished. Based on this chronological formation of structure interactions, we favor the view that the large 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-helical domains of the free aptamer are preorganized in parallel orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>It is important to be aware that the AP approach used here is inherently able to detect local conformational rearrangements and remains speculative on global folding. Strictly spoken, the AP approach is able to cover spectroscopically the very final time period of a global folding event starting from the point at which contacts between nucleotides are beginning to emerge until their hydrogen-bonding patterns and stacking interactions have completely evolved. However, we cannot easily distinguish between a preceding global movement of existing domains (that contain the AP sensor in a non-changing micro environment until tertiary interactions take place) and preorganization (of the very domains). Nevertheless, since the AP approach delivers a series of individual rate constants for the various regions of an RNA fold, the differentiation of these values provides some valuable hints on the succession of global motions and/or on potential preorganization of particular domains as suggested above.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-induced folding of the TPP full-length riboswitch domain and of aptamers with 3&#x02032;-flanking sequences mimicking transcriptional intermediates</title><p>Previous biochemical and structural studies on the <italic>E. coli thiM</italic> TPP riboswitch suggested a model on translational control that is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. In the absence of TPP, interaction of the anti-Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD) sequence (orange; nucleotides 108&#x02013;111) with the anti-anti-SD sequence (red; nts 83&#x02013;86) allows P8* pairing. This interaction permits the ribosome to access the SD element (blue; nts 126&#x02013;129), and thus translation is on-regulated. In the presence of TPP, the obligate formation of stem P1 sequesters a portion of the anti-anti-SD element (red; nts 83&#x02013;86) and by formation of stem P8, the SD-sequence (blue; nts 126&#x02013;129) becomes inaccessible to the ribosome, and consequently, translation is off-regulated. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><italic>ThiM</italic> TPP riboswitch; (<bold>A</bold>) Original model of the <italic>in vivo</italic> response mechanism proposed by Winkler <italic>et al</italic>.

The structure is characterized by an ACCA tetraloop (nt 96&#x02013;99) and a 40&#x02009;nt long unstructured 3&#x02032;-terminus (up to nucleotide 165) containing the SD sequence.

Unfortunately, for both variants, hardly any fluorescence change was detected upon TPP titration. A likely explanation is that the full-length riboswitch construct investigated in this study adopts a conformation <italic>in vitro</italic> that is already very close to the TPP-bound conformation with stems P1/P8 mostly developed as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B (Supplementary Figure S9). An alternative explanation is that the AP modification may reside in two chemical microenvironments that cause it to give a nearly identical fluorescence report although two different overall global folds are involved (see conformations C, D and D&#x000b7;TPP in Supplementary Figure S9).</p><p>When we investigated shorter than full-length riboswitch constructs which mimic transcriptional intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), the AP approach provided insight into the obligate interplay between stems P1/P8 versus P8* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). For these experiments, we used the highly sensitive label at position 62&#x02009;at the TPP recognition site. Variant U62AP <italic>thiM 109</italic> lacks the SD element, and not unexpectedly, we observed that TPP binding was significantly hampered as can be deduced from the weak relative fluorescence change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). This behavior can be rationalized by adoption of an alternative fold characterized through formation of a stable 3&#x02032;-terminal stem-loop structure involving anti-SD (orange) and anti-anti-SD (red) pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and Supplementary Figure S10). This structure comprises the characteristic ACC(A99)-loop segment corresponding to the fold described by Famulok. As soon as the SD element (blue) becomes available, represented by variant U62AP <italic>thiM 125</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D and Supplementary Figure S10), ligand-binding capacity is already significantly restored as reflected in a definite fluorescence increase upon TPP addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). This can be understood by the availability of a terminal 3&#x02032;-sequence stretch, which competes for masking of the anti-SD element (orange), resulting in a shift towards the ligand-binding competent fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). When the 3&#x02032;-sequence stretch is further extended&#x02014;like in the <italic>U62AP thiM 151</italic> derivative&#x02014;almost complete TPP-binding capacity is retained, supported by formation of the larger and hence more stable 3&#x02032;-stem-loop element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and E, and Supplementary Figure S10). Taken together, the fluorescence experiments on transcriptional intermediate mimics, U62AP <italic>thiM 81, 109, 125</italic> and <italic>151</italic>, well support a finely balanced structure equilibrium that is required for the riboswitch's ability to function as genetic control device.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In the present study, we have applied chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation to obtain a large set of <italic>thiM</italic> TPP aptamer variants with site-specific 2-aminopurine labels at positions that are non-perturbing with respect to the RNA overall fold. These RNA probes allow to study TPP-induced individual conformational changes in the various regions of the aptamer by their fluorescent response. From the remarkable 7-fold differentiation of the rate constants, it can be deduced that recognition of the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP by the 3&#x02032;-helical domain (P4/P5) occurs almost simultaneously with recognition of the pyrimidine moiety by the 5&#x02032;-helical domain (J3-2), thereby tightening the interdomain nucleotide interactions (L5/P3) on the same timescale. Formation of the three-way junction and closure of stem P1 result from this initial recognition/folding process and require significantly more time to be fully accomplished. Moreover, the AP-labeled mimics of transcriptional intermediates provide insight into potential alternative secondary structures that are involved during transcription for the nascent RNA. Importantly, the full-length riboswitch domain recognizes TPP with kinetic parameters as performed by the aptamer alone.</p><p>The present study on the TPP riboswitch and our previous studies on adenine riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) demonstrate that the AP approach will be a powerful tool to kinetically characterize ligand-binding interactions and ligand-induced folding of other riboswitch classes as well.
