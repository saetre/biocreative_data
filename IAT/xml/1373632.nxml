Two totally distinct classes of putative membrane-bound progestin receptors have been reported in vertebrates. A first class of receptors, now termed progesterone membrane receptor component (PGMRC; subtypes 1 and 2) has been studied since 1996 but never studied in a fish species nor in the oocyte of any animal species. A second class of receptors, termed membrane progestin receptors (mPR; subtypes alpha, beta and gamma), was recently described in vertebrates and implicated in the progestin-initiated induction of oocyte maturation in fish.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In the present study, we report the characterization of the full coding sequence of rainbow trout PGMRC1 and mPR beta cDNAs, their tissue distribution, their ovarian expression profiles during oogenesis, their hormonal regulation in the full grown ovary and the in situ localization of PGMRC1 mRNA in the ovary.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results clearly show, for the first time in any animal species, that rainbow trout PGMRC1 mRNA is present in the oocyte and has a strong expression in ovarian tissue. In addition, we show that both mPR beta and PGMRC1, two members of distinct membrane-bound progestin receptor classes, exhibit highly similar ovarian expression profiles during the reproductive cycle with maximum levels during vitellogenesis and a down-expression during late vitellogenesis. In addition, the mRNA abundance of both genes is not increased after in vitro hormonal stimulation of full grown follicles by maturation inducing hormones.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, our findings suggest that PGMRC1 is a new possible participant in the progestin-induced oocyte maturation in fish. However, its participation in the process of oocyte maturation, which remains to be confirmed, would occur at post-transcriptional levels.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Steroids may exert their action by two distinct ways 1- a direct control of gene transcription involving classic nuclear receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; 2- a rapid non-nuclear action, independent of direct regulation of gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This second type of steroid action has been proposed to be involved in steroid-induced oocyte maturation in lower vertebrates. Thus, in amphibians, it has been assumed for a long time, that the actinomycin D-insensitive progesterone-induced oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] was mediated by a membrane steroid receptor rather than a nuclear receptor. The recent cloning and sequencing of a gene coding for a membranous progesterone receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) brought evidence for the existence of both intracellular and membrane progestin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In fishes, 2 distinct progestins, 17,20&#x003b2;-dihydroxy-4pregnen-3one (17,20&#x003b2;P) and 17,20&#x003b2;,21-trihydroxy-4pregnen-3one (17,20&#x003b2;,21P), have been identified as the natural Maturation-inducing steroids (MIS), depending on the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. High affinity binding for 17,20&#x003b2;P, the MIS in salmonids, has been found in ovarian plasma membranes of rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], brook trout (<italic>Salvelinus fontinalis</italic>) and Artic char (<italic>Salvelinus alpinus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This specific 17,20&#x003b2;P binding was high in non-matured post-vitellogenic rainbow trout and medaka (<italic>Orizias latipes</italic>) oocytes, but low in matured oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, both nuclear and membrane progestin receptors were fully characterized in the spotted seatrout (<italic>Cynoscion nebulosus</italic>), the membrane receptor being more specific for 17,20&#x003b2;,21P, which is the MIS in this species, than the nuclear receptor which exhibited a higher affinity for 17,20&#x003b2;P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, membrane receptor capacity of the spotted seatrout ovary has been shown to be correlated with oocyte responsiveness to 17,20&#x003b2;,21P for maturation, assessed by the occurrence of germinal vesicles breakdown (GVBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, the cDNA encoding for a putative membrane progestin receptor (mPR) was recently cloned in spotted seatrout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It belongs to a novel family of putative membrane receptors genes present in various vertebrates and displaying three subtypes (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To date, the 3 forms have been identified in human, mouse, catfish (<italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>) and fugu (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), while 2 forms, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, have been reported in pig and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and only 1 form in African clawed frog (&#x003b2;), goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>) (&#x003b1;) and spotted seatrout (&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The recombinant protein produced in an <italic>E. coli </italic>expression system using the spotted seatrout mPR&#x003b1; cDNA sequence exhibited a specific and saturable progesterone binding. Steroid competition studies showed that binding was highly specific for progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. However, no displacement of tritiated progesterone was observed with 17,20&#x003b2;,21P, the natural spotted seatrout MIS, which has been hypothesized to be due to a lack of adequate post-translational modifications in the <italic>E. coli </italic>expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Microinjection of mPR&#x003b1; antisense nucleotide in oocytes resulted in an almost complete inhibition of 17,20&#x003b2;P-induced oocyte maturation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] while a partial inhibition was observed in goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similar experiments conducted in zebrafish oocytes using the mPR&#x003b2; subtype resulted in an almost complete inhibition of oocyte maturation suggesting that mPR&#x003b2; could also participate in the control of oocyte maturation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, within the same experiment, the maximum inhibition was observed using the mPR&#x003b2; subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Finally, mRNA tissue distribution of the 3 subtypes have been studied in catfish and mPR&#x003b2; showed a predominant expression in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Apart from oocyte maturation, mPR&#x003b1; protein has been detected by Western blotting in Atlantic croaker (<italic>Micropogonias undulatus</italic>) sperm, a species in which a 17,20&#x003b2;,21P action on spermatozoa motility was suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Some years ago, a totally distinct progesterone binding protein was isolated from porcine liver microsomal membranes and partially sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This protein, originally termed membrane progesterone receptor, is now termed progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (PGMRC1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Porcine PGMRC1 cDNA was subsequently cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] as well as the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] orthologs. In addition, a related sequence, PGMRC2, belonging to the same family was also reported in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Human PGMRC1 mRNA has been detected in a wide variety of tissues (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and has a predominant expression in liver and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, PGMRC1 and PGMRC2 mRNAs have been found in human spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. PGMRC1 and PGMRC2 cDNAs were also generated from several species subjected to massive cDNA sequencing programs, including mouse, chicken, African clawed frog and zebrafish, and the corresponding sequences deposited in GenBank (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Antibodies raised against porcine PGMRC1 can mitigate the progesterone induced acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. PGMRC1 protein was also detected in human spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and an antibody raised against PGMRC1 could suppress the rapid progesterone-initiated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux observed in sperm. Together, this suggests that PGMRC1, if present in the oocyte, is a candidate for mediating progestin-induced oocyte maturation in fish. However, besides sequences originating from genome sequencing programs, PGMRC1 was never characterized in any fish species. Furthermore, to our knowledge, PGMRC1 protein or mRNA expression was never reported in the oocyte of any vertebrate species (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequence accession number, cDNA source or expression data and sequence identity with rainbow trout (rt) PGMRC1 of vertebrate PGMRC1 and PGMRC2 proteins.

In addition, in order to evaluate PGMRC1 eligibility as a possible participant in the progestin-induced oocyte maturation, we aimed at performing a similar analysis for the so far unknown rainbow trout mPR&#x003b2; subtype that has recently been implicated in the control of meiosis resumption in zebrafish, a species exhibiting the same maturation-inducing steroid (17,20&#x003b2;P) than rainbow trout. Among mPR subtypes, mPR&#x003b2; was chosen because it has a predominant expression in catfish ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and exhibits the maximum oocyte maturation inhibition in antisense oligonucleotide studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Rainbow trout were obtained from an experimental fish farm (PEIMA, Sizun, France) and held during spawning season in a recirculated water system, at 12&#x000b0;C, under natural photoperiod (SCRIBE, Rennes, France) until tissue collection. Ovaries were sampled from distinct females exhibiting the following ovarian developmental stages: ovarian differentiation (1000 degree. days after fertilization, N = 5), pre-vitellogenesis (N = 6), early vitellogenesis (N = 6), mid-vitellogenesis (N = 6), late vitellogenesis (N = 6), post-vitellogenesis (N = 6) and final oocyte maturation (N = 5). Late vitellogenic samples were obtained 3&#x02013;4 weeks before spawning period. Post-vitellogenic samples were obtained during spawning period but before any morphological evidence of oocyte maturation (cytoplasmic clearing or GVBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To collect ovarian tissue, trout were deeply anaesthetized in 2-phenoxyethanol, killed by a blow on the head and bled by gill arch section. The abdominal cavity was opened and the ovaries were removed, dissected and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. For the tissue distribution study, different tissues were sampled from 3 post-vitellogenic females. Unfertilized eggs were sampled from 3 freshly ovulated females and testis samples were also obtained from 3 different males at stage II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] of spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA cloning and sequence analysis</title><p>PGMRC1 and mPR&#x003b2; rainbow trout cDNA sequences were identified using a reciprocal blast strategy. A tblastn comparison was performed against all rainbow trout expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in dbEST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] using the target amino acid sequence as a query. Comparison was performed using catfish mPR&#x003b2; as well as porcine PGMRC1 amino acid sequences. The identity of selected cDNAs was subsequently checked using a blastx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] comparison against the nr database.

Both mPR&#x003b2; and PGMRC1 clones were fully sequenced and missing 5' sequence of PGMRC1 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from a rainbow trout testis cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The corresponding 650 bp PCR product was cloned in PGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Subsequently, a PCR amplification was performed in order to confirm the assembled sequence of PGMRC1 cDNA.</p><p>Predictions of potential N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites as well as putative transmembrane domains of PGMRC1 and mPR&#x003b2; deduced amino acid sequences were performed using the prediction server of the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk"/>.

Briefly, ovarian tissue was homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) at a ratio of 100 mg per ml of reagent. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol procedure and resuspended in water. In order to ensure optimal RNA quality, RNA samples with high yolk contamination were further purified using a Nucleospin RNA II kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Macherey Nalgel, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany). Three micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine Leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 0.5 &#x003bc;g random hexamers per &#x003bc;g of RNA (Promega) according to manufacturer's instruction. RNA and dNTPs were denatured for 6 min at 70&#x000b0;C, then chilled on ice for 5 min before the reverse transcription master mix was added. Reverse transcription was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour and 15 min followed by a 15 min incubation step at 70&#x000b0;C.

Reverse transcription products were diluted to 1/50 and 5 &#x003bc;l were used for each real-time PCR reaction. Triplicates were run for PCR reaction. Real-time PCR was performed using a real-time PCR kit provided with a SYBR Green fluorophore (Eurogentec, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 600 nM of each primer. PCR primers were designed in order to generate a short PCR product: PGMRC1 (forward CCCAACCAAGCAGAGAGAAA; reverse AGAGGCCAAGCAGACTCAAA), mPR&#x003b2; (forward CCCAGCAACAGGTGTGTTC; reverse AAGGAGGGAGGAAAGAGGT) and 18S (forward CGGAGGTTCGAAGACGATCA; reverse TCGCTAGTTGGCATCGTTTAT). After a 2 min incubation step at 50&#x000b0;C and a 10 min incubation step at 95&#x000b0;C, the amplification was performed using the following cycle: 95&#x000b0;C, 20 sec; 62&#x000b0;C, 1 min, 40 times. For each target gene, the relative abundance of cDNA within sample set was calculated from a serially diluted ovarian cDNA pool using the I-Cycler IQ software. Subsequently, real-time PCR data were normalized using 18S RNA abundance.

Partially purified gonadotropins were obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] from an affinity chromatography on a concanavalin A sepharose of a pool of salmon pituitaries sampled during spawning season, a period when luteinizing hormone (LH) is predominantly synthesized.

In addition, a dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of estradiol was previously found to significantly inhibit oocyte maturation in rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. After a 20-hour incubation, follicles were removed and processed for RNA extraction. Follicles originating from each well were processed separately for RNA extraction. For each treatment, 3 wells were used for RNA extraction from intact follicles. Before in vitro incubation, intact and deyolked follicles were sampled. Follicles were deyolked as previously described by firmly pressing the tissue between 2 mesh screens under constant ice-cold mineral medium aspersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Intact and deyolked follicle samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction.

PGMRC1 was previously cloned from several mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Northern studies showed that the human mRNA was expressed in a wide variety of tissues with a predominant expression in liver and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In other vertebrate species, the cognate cDNA was found in a chicken 2-week old embryo library, a western clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>) whole body library, an African clawed frog embryo library and a zebrafish liver library (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A PGMRC1 protein sequence was also deduced from the tetraodon (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>) genome (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PGMRC1 protein (also termed Hpr6 in humans) was also found to be expressed in a panel of human tumor cell lines from breast, cancer and colon and was overexpressed in breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. PGMRC1 protein was also detected in human spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no information is available on PGMRC1 mRNA or protein expression in the oocyte of any animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], although an inner zone antigen of the rat adrenal (IZA), which is in fact PGMRC1, has been immunodetected in the rat ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Interestingly, IZA has been also involved in progesterone metabolism, especially 21-hydroxylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In the present study, we observed PGMRC1 mRNA in many tissues, including ovary. While the strong expression observed in liver and trunk kidney is in good agreement with existing data on PGMRC1 tissue distribution in mammals, the present work is the first report of PGMRC1 mRNA expression in a vertebrate ovary.</p><p>In addition, we showed that, within ovarian tissue, PGMRC1 mRNA was localized to the oocyte. PGMRC1 mRNA was detected by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in the ooplasm of previtellogenic oocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) and the comparative expression study performed using intact and deyolked ovarian follicles clearly showed that PGMRC1 mRNA is present in the full-grown oocyte (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Indeed, PGMRC1 mRNA abundance was 5 times higher in intact ovarian follicles than in deyolked follicles. Detected levels in deyolked tissue can easily be explained by the presence, within the extrafollicular tissue that remains attached to the follicle, of pre-vitellogenic oocytes that also express PGMRC1 mRNA, as shown by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. Surprisingly, no signal was observed by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in mid-vitellogenic oocytes. However, during vitellogenesis, oocytes undergo a dramatic volume increase (over 100-fold) that can explain the lack of signal. Indeed, such an increase would necessarily induce a decrease of the signal even if the number of mRNA copies per oocyte remained unchanged.</p><p>Interestingly, PGMRC1 mRNA ovarian expression profile during reproductive cycle is similar to mPR&#x003b2; profile with a maximum during mid-vitellogenesis. Together, our observations suggest that PGMRC1 mRNA is expressed in the rainbow trout oocyte throughout oogenesis and that its abundance in the ovary tends to decrease during late vitellogenesis. Indeed, in the post-vitellogenic follicle, PGMRC1 mRNA abundance is not increased after <italic>in vitro </italic>hormonal stimulation with 17,20&#x003b2;P or gonadotropin. As a matter of fact, we even observed a significant decrease of PGMRC1 mRNA abundance in gonadotropin (188 ng/ml)- and 17,20&#x003b2;P-stimulated full-grown follicles in one experiment. In rat brain, PGMRC1 (also termed 25-Dx) mRNA abundance has been shown to be repressed by progesterone and it was suggested that such mechanism completes an autoregulatory feedback loop, typical of membrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Even if not significant in all experiments, the observed decrease of PGMRC1 mRNA abundance could correspond to an induction of protein synthesis. Indeed, very low PGMRC1 mRNA levels were observed in metaphase 2 oocytes (unfertilized eggs, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting that its has been degraded during oocyte maturation. In mice, it has been shown that some mRNAs that accumulate in the oocyte during oogenesis are degraded during oocyte maturation when the corresponding protein is being synthesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>The bioinformatic analysis of rainbow trout PGMRC1 protein sequence showed the presence of a putative transmembrane domain that was also found in mammalian PGMRC1 protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, PGMRC1 protein was localized to cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the rainbow trout ovary, PGMRC1 mRNA was only detected in the oocyte. It can therefore be hypothesized that PGMRC1 mRNA encodes for a membrane-associated protein of the rainbow trout oocyte.</p><p>Some years ago, a 28 kDa protein, purified from pig liver membranes and exhibiting high binding affinity for progesterone was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The protein was partially sequenced and corresponded to the amino acid sequence deduced from the PGMRC1 cDNA that was subsequently cloned from porcine smooth-muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. PGMRC1 cDNA was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and led to increased microsomal progesterone binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, an antibody directed against the recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>PGMRC1 protein was able to suppress the rapid progesterone-initiated Ca<sup>2++ </sup>increase in sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Besides PGMRC1, a closely related protein termed PGMRC2 was also identified in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and other vertebrates. All PGMRC proteins exhibit a b5-like ligand-binding domain which is the steroid binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Indeed, these authors have proposed that b5 domains may have served as template for recent evolution of membrane-associated binding domains. According to these authors, PGMRCs may represent an adaptation by which cells could start making use of steroids as triggers for rapid response mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Similarly to mammalian PGMRCs, the deduced rainbow trout PGMRC1 protein sequence exhibits a clear b5-like domain. It seems therefore likely that rainbow trout PGMRC1, similarly to its cognate mammalian forms, would also exhibit progestin binding capacities. However, this remains to be demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>mPR&#x003b2; characterization and regulation</title><p>In the present study, we characterized the cDNA sequence and mRNA ovarian expression profile of rainbow trout mPR&#x003b2;. The beta form of the recently identified membrane-bound progestin receptor (mPR) class had previously been identified in several species, including human, pig, mouse, African clawed frog, zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

In rainbow trout, we observed a predominant expression in reproductive tissues and brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

In the present study, mPR&#x003b2; mRNA abundance peaked during vitellogenesis. However, significantly lower levels were observed in the preovulatory ovary (late vitellogenic, post-vitellogenic and oocyte maturation stages). In catfish, the mRNA abundance was measured by quantitative PCR in full-grown ovarian follicles hormonally treated for 8 and 16 h with either human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), 17,20&#x003b2;P or estradiol (E2). Besides a down-regulation observed after a 8-hour incubation with 17,20&#x003b2;P, no significant change in mPR&#x003b2; mRNA abundance was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In zebrafish, similar results were obtained after incubating follicles in vitro with hCG (30 IU/ml) for 5 or 10 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, a recent study reported a stimulation of mPR&#x003b2; mRNA levels in zebrafish follicles incubated <italic>in vitro </italic>with hCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. However, it should be noted that this was observed using a very high hCG concentration (100 IU/ml) that induced only 20% oocyte maturation (GVBD occurrence). In the present study, after a 20-hour incubation, no significant difference in mPR&#x003b2; mRNA abundance was observed between control and gonadotropin or 17,20&#x003b2;P stimulated groups, even though gonadotropin treatment induced 100% GVBD. In zebrafish, a fish species exhibiting the same maturation-inducing steroid than rainbow trout, it was suggested that mPR&#x003b2; does participate in the control of meiosis resumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Assuming a similar involvement of mPR&#x003b2; in rainbow trout oocyte maturation, our observations suggest that luteinizing hormone-induced final oocyte maturation does not require mPR&#x003b2; mRNA overexpression. It is however possible that a luteinizing hormone induction of mPR&#x003b2; protein expression occurs. These conclusions are in total agreement with conclusions recently made in catfish and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we showed that rainbow trout PGMRC1 and mPR&#x003b2; mRNAs are expressed in the preovulatory oocyte. Both mRNAs, while belonging to 2 different classes of membrane bound progestin receptors, exhibit similar ovarian expression profiles during the reproductive cycle and are not up-regulated by 17,20&#x003b2;P and maturing gonadotropin. Therefore, the suggested involvement of mPR&#x003b2; in 17,20&#x003b2;P-induced oocyte maturation in another fish species strongly suggests that PGMRC1 mRNA ovarian expression pattern is compatible with a participation in the control of oocyte maturation. Such participation in the maturation process would probably imply a regulation at post-transcriptional levels (e.g increase of PGMRC1 protein levels).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BM performed sequencing, tissue collection and real-time PCR experiments.
