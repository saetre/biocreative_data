The evolutionary origin of this family is still uncertain and most studies have examined mammalian family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have performed an extensive search in several teleost genomes to establish the <italic>s100 </italic>gene family in fish. We report that the teleost S100 repertoire comprises fourteen different subfamilies which show remarkable similarity across six divergent teleost species. Individual species feature distinctive subsets of thirteen to fourteen genes that result from local gene duplications and gene losses. Eight of the fourteen S100 subfamilies are unique for teleosts, while six are shared with mammalian species and three of those even with cartilaginous fish. Several S100 family members are found in jawless fish already, but none of them are clear orthologs of cartilaginous or bony fish <italic>s100 </italic>genes. All teleost <italic>s100 </italic>genes show the expected structural features and are subject to strong negative selection. Many aspects of the genomic arrangement and location of mammalian <italic>s100 </italic>genes are retained in the teleost <italic>s100 </italic>gene family, including a completely conserved intron/exon border between the two EF hands. Zebrafish <italic>s100 </italic>genes exhibit highly specific and characteristic expression patterns, showing both redundancy and divergence in their cellular expression. In larval tissue expression is often restricted to specific cell types like keratinocytes, hair cells, ionocytes and olfactory receptor neurons as demonstrated by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The origin of the S100 family predates at least the segregation of jawed from jawless fish and some extant family members predate the divergence of bony from cartilaginous fish. Despite a complex pattern of gene gains and losses the total repertoire size is remarkably constant between species. On the expression level the teleost S100 proteins can serve as precise markers for several different cell types. At least some of their functions may be related to those of their counterparts in mammals. Accordingly, our findings provide an excellent basis for future studies of the functions and interaction partners of <italic>s100 </italic>genes and finally their role in diseases, using the zebrafish as a model organism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In mammals the family of S100 calcium binding proteins has been a target of intensive study for over 40 years, since the first two family members were purified from bovine brain. Until today at least 20 members were described in humans and a growing number in several other mammalian species. They share an average identity of 40&#x02013;60% on the amino acid level, but key features are more highly conserved. The <italic>s100 </italic>genes code for small, cytoplasmic or secreted proteins that exhibit a common structure consisting of two calcium-binding loops each flanked by two alpha-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The N-terminal domain is a low affinity S100-specific domain, whereas the other one is a classical EF-Hand. A variable hinge region connects both domains. Structural examination revealed a hydrophobic region being exposed upon calcium binding which is thought to interact with hydrophobic regions of the target proteins. The calcium-binding domains also exhibit affinity for other divalent cations such as copper and zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Some family members possess dysfunctional calcium-binding domains, but there is also evidence of calcium-independent interactions in this family (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). For human S100 family members more than 90 potential target proteins, both intra- and extracellular ones, have been reported. Among the interacting partners are other calcium-binding proteins (several members of the annexin family), enzymes (e.g. aldolase A/C), cytoskeletal components (actin, tubulin), cell cycle regulator genes (p53), second messenger-synthesizing enzymes (adenylate and guanylate cyclase) as well as kinases. Accordingly, S100 proteins take part in many cellular processes which may be divided into five major groups: a) modulation of the activity of some protein kinases b) modulation of other enzymatic activities c) maintenance of cell shape and motility d) modulation of signal transduction pathways and e) regulation of calcium homoeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The active forms of S100 proteins often consist of homo- or heterodimers and even tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or higher aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The expression pattern of the S100 family exhibits a remarkable degree of cell and tissue-specificity, so that many tissues and cell types have their unique protein composition and expression level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>There is no evidence for S100 proteins in invertebrates, however, the evolutionary origin of the family has not been studied much [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. By far most publications deal with the mammalian family members, and in fact no systematic study has been performed in teleosts. With an intent to infer properties of the family in the most recent common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods we have characterized the S100 family both in shark and lamprey, and in teleosts. We identified in each teleost species thirteen to fourteen <italic>s100 </italic>genes, which are under strong negative selection. Several of these genes appear to be considerably more ancient than the teleost speciation events taken into account here. Several mammalian <italic>s100 </italic>genes were found to have counterparts in teleosts, but eight novel genes restricted to teleosts were also detected. Furthermore we have investigated the expression of ten <italic>Danio rerio s100 </italic>genes by RT-PCR and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and report highly distinctive and specialized expression patterns, suggestive of similarly specialized functions of the different family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The repertoire size of the S100 family of thirteen to fourteen genes is remarkably conserved across six divergent teleost species</title><p>The S100 proteins constitute a small family of calcium-binding proteins with highly specific expression patterns in mammals. So far the evolution of this family has not been studied in teleosts. Up to date only two <italic>s100 </italic>genes were reported in fish: a homologue of the mammalian S100A was found in loach and trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and a new family member, ictacalcin, is present in several fish species (catfish, pufferfish, loach, trout and zebrafish), but absent in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the notion that the S100 family may be already well established in teleost fish, but may also diverge considerably from the mammalian repertoire. We therefore performed extended searches in the genomes of five different teleost species to establish the complete S100 repertoire in fish.</p><p>A recursive search strategy in the NCBI and Ensembl databases using the complete repertoire of human <italic>s100 </italic>genes as reference set, in combination with retrieval of automated ortholog predictions (see Methods) uncovered a total of 97 fish <italic>s100 </italic>genes. Fourteen <italic>s100 </italic>genes each were identified for zebrafish and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, and thirteen genes each for three-spined stickleback, medaka, and <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>. In addition, fourteen <italic>s100 </italic>genes were found in EST libraries of another teleost, <italic>Salmo salar</italic>. All of these genes are novel, with the exception of one zebrafish and one <italic>Takifugu </italic>gene (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We believe that the result of the data mining approach used reflects the total repertoire of the <italic>s100 </italic>genes in the cases of <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oryzias latipes, Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>. In the case of <italic>Salmo salar </italic>several transcripts were found for each gene predicted, so that the repertoire reported here may approximate the complete S100 family present in this species.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic tree of the teleost and human <italic>s100 </italic>gene family</bold>.

We suggest the following criteria (in order of importance):</p><p>1. If any ortholog of the gene was described previously, that name is kept. This is the case for A1, A10, A11, B, P and Z members of the S100 family, which have mammalian orthologs, and for the fish-specific S100I.</p><p>2. Whenever new closely related genes correspond to a single named ortholog, that name is used, together with an additional numeral or letter to distinguish the fish genes from each other. This is the case e.g. for A10a and A10b of the S100 family.</p><p>3. Novel fish-specific genes and subfamilies are named consecutively by so far unused letters, starting with the letter Q onwards.</p></sec><sec><title>S100 family size in cartilaginous and even jawless fish may be similar to that of bony fish</title><p>We have searched the available databases for S100 family members in cartilaginous fish (<italic>Callorhinchus milii </italic>and <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>) and a jawless fish, <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>. We report ten different S100 family members in <italic>Petromyzon marinus </italic>and five <italic>s100 </italic>genes in <italic>Callorhinchus milii </italic>plus one gene in <italic>Squalus acanthias </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). All genes are novel, except three genes from <italic>Petromyzon</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], see also Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. The reported repertoire is expected to be incomplete, especially in the case of <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, for which only 1.4 fold genomic coverage is currently available, and of course <italic>Squalus acanthias</italic>. Thus the total size of the cartilaginous and jawless fish S100 repertoires may be rather similar to that of teleost fish, despite marked sequence divergence. The latter necessitated further rules for nomenclature:</p><p>4. If a gene from a basal taxon is clearly related to two named genes of more derived species, we suggest to always use the preceding letter.</p><p>5. If no clear orthologs to any named gene can be delineated, the genes are named provisionally with x1, x2 etc. not to foreclose a coherent nomenclature for <italic>s100 </italic>genes from basal taxa, which will only be possible after completion of the respective genome projects.</p></sec><sec><title>S100 is an ancient family with a complex pattern of gene gains and losses</title><p>In order to better understand the relationships and evolutionary history of the S100 family members we performed a phylogenetic analysis, using the Neighbor-Joining method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], as well as Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses using the PHYLIP package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (for details see Methods). Full length coding sequences of all teleost S100 genes were analyzed together with human S100 genes, using troponins, calmodulins and other related calcium binding protein with EF-Hand motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] as outgroup (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and data not shown). This phylogenetic analysis shows twenty-seven different groups of orthologs, i.e. 27 different genes as the combined repertoire analyzed here (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Six of these genes are organized in closely related gene pairs (<italic>s100a1/z</italic>, <italic>s100s/t, s100a10a/b</italic>). The delineation of the <italic>s100 </italic>gene family, the identification of ortholog groups and the association in gene pairs were supported by all three tree-building algorithms used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Nearly a third of the family members are present only in fish &#x02013; S100I and seven novel proteins, S100Q, S100R, S100S, S100T, S100U, S100V, and S100W.</p><p>Remarkably, very few of these fish-specific genes have the full set of five orthologs out of five fish genomes analyzed. When salmon is taken into account, only a single gene, <italic>s100w</italic>, is found in all 6 teleost species. In four other genes one ortholog is missing, the <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>gene in <italic>s100i</italic>, the <italic>Oryzias latipes </italic>ortholog in <italic>s100u</italic>, and the <italic>s100s, s100t </italic>genes in <italic>Salmo salar</italic>. Only four and three species have representatives of the <italic>s100v </italic>and <italic>s100q </italic>genes, respectively. Finally, subfamily S100R is only found in pufferfish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On the other hand, restricted duplication events have occurred for S100I, S100V (zebrafish, salmon) and S100 U (pufferfish).</p><p>All teleost-restricted genes that contain both a zebrafish and another teleost representative (S100I, S, T, U, V, W) should have been present at least in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of <italic>Neoteleostei </italic>and <italic>Ostariophysii </italic>(zebrafish lineage diverged early from the more modern neoteleosts, to which the other four species analyzed here belong, salmon takes an intermediate position, closer to the <italic>Neoteleostei </italic>than zebrafish). Thus, the partial absence of several genes, e.g. S100I in pufferfish (<italic>cf</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggests a partial loss of these genes in the pufferfish family (<italic>cf</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) although it cannot be ruled out with certainty that some apparent gene losses are actually caused by inadequacies of the currently available databases. Other examples for restricted loss in some teleost species concern S100Q, U, V and the gene pair S100S/T (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>cf</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Estimated minimal evolutionary age of S100 family members</bold>. Open rectangles represent the gene gain events in each lineage, and black boxes represent the gene loss events. Inside each box is the name of the respective gene(s). A duplication event leading to a gene pair is indicated by a common rectangle. The major phylogenetic transitions are indicated: bo/nobo, bony fish/cartilaginous fish; ac/sa, actinopterygian/sarcopterygian split; os/neo, ostariophysii/neoteleostei segregation. The maximum parsimony principle was followed for construction of this scheme, i.e. minimal gene losses and gene gains were assumed. Thus gene gains are depicted at the last possible stage before additional gains would become necessary for explanation, but may in fact have occurred earlier, accompanied by gene loss in some lineages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-8-48-2"/></fig><p>Two of these teleost-specific <italic>s100 </italic>genes (S100Q, R) were not detected in the zebrafish genome despite extensive searches. The most parsimonious explanation therefore is an absence of these genes in the MRCA of <italic>Neoteleostei </italic>and <italic>Ostariophysii, i.e</italic>. a genesis of these genes in the <italic>Neoteleostei </italic>lineage (<italic>cf</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Six other genes are shared by teleost fish and mammalian species (S100A1, S100A10, S100A11, S100B, S100P and S100Z). Thus, all six genes should be more ancient than the split in <italic>Actinopterygii </italic>and <italic>Sarcopterygii</italic>, the separate teleost and tetrapod lineages. Four genes (S100A1, A10, B and Z) are highly conserved among all six teleost species, with at least one ortholog per species being present. However, other genes, particularly S100P, exhibit the same partial representation in teleost species as described above for some fish-specific <italic>s100 </italic>genes. Thus these genes appear to have been lost in some teleost sublineages. A graphical representation of all these phylogenetic inferences is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><p>Four of the six <italic>s100 </italic>genes found in the shark genome also belong to this group of genes common to teleosts and mammals (the remaining two exhibit no unambiguous orthologs). One is an S100Z ortholog, two are S100B orthologs, and one (S100A1) is situated at the root of the S100A1-S100Z clade (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Thus, genes <italic>s100a1</italic>, <italic>s100</italic>b, and <italic>s100</italic>z appear to have emerged before the divergence of cartilaginous fishes from bony fish. Since the currently available shark genome is bound to be incomplete, it may be expected that about half of the extant <italic>s100 </italic>genes already existed in the MRCA of cartilaginous and bony fish. Moreover, the phylogenetic position of all cartilaginous fish <italic>s100 </italic>genes deep within the teleost phylogenetic tree demonstrates that the S100 family was already well established before the segregation of bony and cartilaginous fish (<italic>cf</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In fact, the S100 family even precedes the earlier split in jawed/jawless vertebrates, because already ten family members were found in lamprey (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). However, with possible exception of two genes related to S100B and one related to S100V, no ortholog relationship is apparent between any of the <italic>Petromyzon marinus s100 </italic>genes and those from more derived species.</p><p>Thus the phylogenetic tree reflects a complex evolutionary pattern characterized by frequent gene losses as well as extended gains of either single genes or whole gene subfamilies. Similar changes in the gene repertoire caused by complex genomic reorganization and translocation events are reported for EF hand proteins in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Moderate overall similarity but high degree of conservation of motifs that are characteristic for the S100 family</title><p>The evolutionary distances between ortholog amino acid sequences range between 0.11 and 0.82 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), whereas paralog distances range between 0.97 and 1.18 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Because of this high heterogeneity among the S100 family and to obtain a second line of evidence in order to classify these genes reliably as members of the S100 family, we next examined the degree of conservation of the fish and mammalian genes. For that purpose, sequence logos from the amino acid alignments of either the fish or mammalian S100 proteins alone and of a combination of all the S100 proteins were created and used for a comparative analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and data not shown). All three sequence logos were very similar and showed the same general conservation pattern. The previously described typical structure of the mammalian S100 proteins formed by four helices (Helix I-IV) separated by a S100 EF hand calcium-binding domain, a hinge and a canonical EF hand calcium-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] is conserved among the fish S100 proteins. A high number of conserved residues and signature motifs in defined positions of the sequence were identified in the teleost S100 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and found to be conserved also among fish and tetrapods, consistent with the origin of the S100 family well before the <italic>actinopterygian/sarcopterygian </italic>split (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These residues are located mainly in the helix domains and the calcium-binding regions, especially in the canonical EF hand. This result is in accordance with a recent study that classifies this region as phylogenetically older than the S100 EF hand domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast, the hinge region and the C-terminus seem to be regions where there is more space for sequence variability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This is in accordance with the observation in mammalian S100 proteins that the selectivity in target binding is mainly assured by the hinge region and the C-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], i.e. in these regions a larger divergence is expected at least between paralogs.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Evolutionary distances and selective pressure on <italic>s100 </italic>genes</bold>.

The S100R protein has lost key residues of the canonical calcium-binding motif in the second EF hand loop, despite a generally good conservation in both domains, similar to the human S100A10 and A14 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The S100V protein has lost most key residues of the canonical motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In four of the five neoteleost S100B proteins a common three amino acid deletion has removed a key residue of the S100-specific calcium-binding loop. Nearly the same deletion also occurs in the S100V and the S100U proteins, as well as in the human S100A7, A10, the medaka S100A10a, and the shark CmS100B2, x2 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The frequency of this deletion suggests a specialized function for such genes, which might act either as competitive antagonists, or alternatively, may adopt the calcium-bound conformation constitutively. Indeed, the latter has been demonstrated for the human A10 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. S100 genes with such deletions do not segregate together in the phylogenetic tree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), and the deletions vary slightly in length (2&#x02013;4 amino acids) and position (2 to 4 amino acids left, right, or central to the conserved G65 in the S100 EF hand, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Thus, this kind of mutation has arisen several times independently. Some of these deletion events must have occurred in the MRCA of cartilaginous and bony fish (S100B), others appear to have originated in the MRCA of teleosts (S100U, V), and some are evolutionary late events restricted to a single species (Ol_S100A10a). In other words, this particular deletion may be considered a local optimum in the state space of S100 sequences, consistent with a particular function for these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Strong negative selection for s100 genes, but virtual absence of positive selection</title><p>As previously mentioned, paralog evolutionary distance at the amino acid level is very high, with an average value of 1.08, and a range from 0.97&#x02013;1.18 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Such high values pinpoint the high variability in the amino acid sequences of these genes found at the intraspecies level. In contrast, the average ortholog evolutionary distance value of 0.44 (with values ranging from 0.11&#x02013;0.82) is about 2.5 fold lower than the one observed for the paralog comparisons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>Prompted by both the high degree of intraspecies variability and the high degree of interspecies conservation of <italic>s100 </italic>genes we decided to investigate the evolutionary constraints that are acting on this gene family. A strong constraint is equivalent to strong negative selection. The degree of selective pressure is measured by investigating the relative frequency of non-synonymous (dN) <italic>vs </italic>synonymous (dS) substitutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When the number of dN equals the number of dS, the dN/dS ratio equals 1, which corresponds to neutral selection.

On the other hand, if the number of synonymous (dS) changes is higher than the number of nonsynonymous changes, then dN/dS &#x0003c;1 and we are in the presence of negative selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Whenever possible, the overall dN/dS ratio within each ortholog group was determined. All the groups show very small values, ranging from 0.05 to 0.24, with an average global dN/dS value of 0.14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which is evidence for strong negative selection.</p><p>These low dN/dS values combined with the high divergence between the S100 genes suggest not only an ancient origin of these genes but also indicate that individual genes of this family are slowly evolving.</p><p>However, as the strong negative selection could be masking some positive selection events at the individual codon level, we also determined the dN/dS ratio separately for each individual sequence position. Results are shown for two of the ortholog groups, the S100I and S100Z. These two clades represent two different evolutionary scenarios, the first showing evidence for recent gene duplications in zebrafish and lacking one ortholog in <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, while the second is a very well conserved group with orthologs in all six fish species. Also they show two different values for their evolutionary distances, of 0.47 and 0.11 respectively (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). As predicted by the global dN/dS analysis, a considerable portion of the total sequence &#x02013; 25% for the S100I and 35% for S100Z &#x02013; is under negative selection, with the second value being closer to the average value of 31 sites per ortholog group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).

In zebrafish the scenario is somewhat similar, with two smaller clusters of 3.5 and 1.0 MB each located on the chromosomes 16 and 19, respectively, and composed of seven (S100A1, S100A10b, S100I.1, S100I.2, S100T, S100V1 and S100W) and four (S100A10a, S100A11, S100S and S100U) genes, respectively. Similarly, in the other teleost fish species analyzed small clusters of maximally five genes are found (<italic>cf</italic>. Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These clusters always contain phylogenetically less related genes and, in contrast to the situation in mammals, cluster gene associations differ between species.

Conversely, a closely related gene pair (S100A1/S100Z) consists of a singleton gene (Z) and a member of a cluster (A1). Thus, among teleost <italic>s100 </italic>genes, genomic linkage is not at all correlated with degree of phylogenetic relationship, consistent with an ancient evolutionary origin of these clusters.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosomal location of the <italic>s100 </italic>genes in zebrafish</bold>.

Two of the three gene pairs observed in the teleost S100 repertoire (S/T, A10a/b) are distributed between these two clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), consistent with a duplication of their ancestral genes by this whole genome duplication nearly 400 million years ago. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the gene pair A10a/b has a single mammalian ortholog.

The cellular morphology, larval staining pattern and the adult expression in gills suggest expression in MR-cells, also known as ionocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These cells control ionic composition of body fluids, especially calcium levels. Results obtained by RT-PCR indicate a much broader distribution, possibly at levels below the threshold for <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Three S100 genes exhibit broad expression in several tissues and cell types</title><p>Zebrafish S100I.1 (Ictacalcin) expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>) was previously described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our data are consistent with their findings of expression in the epithelial cells of barbels, gills, olfactory rosettes and skin. S100I.1 is expressed throughout the whole skin with high levels of expression in the rim of the dorsal (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>) and pectoral (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11F, H</xref>) fin. High expression levels were observed in the urogenital opening (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11D</xref>). Moreover, S100I.1 exhibits also strong expression in cells of the olfactory placode (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11G,K</xref>). Additionally expression can be observed throughout the pharyngeal arches (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11E,I,J</xref>) and the lateral line excluding the neuromasts (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11D</xref>), which appear as light spots in the middle of the larvae. In this respect S100I.1 shows the complementary pattern to S100S, T, which label the neuromasts, but not the surrounding tissue.</p><p>The <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization signals may represent the combined expression pattern of S100I.1 and S100I.2, since their probes share over 90% homology at the nucleotide level, and thus cross-reactivity cannot be excluded. However, RT-PCR results for S100I.1 are expected to be specific, since a primer from its unique, short exon was used. RT-PCR results for S100I.2 probably represent a mix of both S100I transcripts, since no completely specific primers were possible there. The results show expression of both genes in all tissues tested, with exception of muscle, where only S100I.2 could be detected.</p><p>Zebrafish S100A10b (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A&#x02013;F</xref>) exhibits high expression in the lower jaw (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>) in particular in the branchial arches. Epithelial cells are labeled, but cartilaginous tissue is devoid of staining. Olfactory placode and the whole larval trunk do not express S100A10b. Thus this expression pattern is a subset of that observed for S100I.1. Unexpectedly, RT-PCR reveals expression of S100A10b in every tissue examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial correlation of expression pattern similarity with coding sequence similarity</title><p>The highly related genes S100S and S100T show a nearly identical larval expression pattern, and the duplicate S100I genes appear to exhibit a very similar expression pattern as well. However, expression patterns for the duplicate A10a genes are very different, with the A10b pattern a subset of the unrelated S100I.1, I.2, and a completely different pattern being observed for A10a. This partial correlation is consistent with the interpretation that in some cases (S100S, T) regulatory elements have been conserved alongside the coding regions of these genes, which are spread far apart in the genome. Additionally, for the two S100I genes, which are clustered, regulatory elements shared within the cluster might synchronize the expression pattern. In this context it is noteworthy that the close genomic linkage of S100I to S100A10b is conserved in the genome of all fish species that possess both genes, and indeed, A10b expression is quite similar to that of S100I (<italic>cf</italic>. Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>), consistent with partially shared regulatory elements. On the other hand, A11 and S are also linked closely, and their expression patterns are completely different. Thus regulation of <italic>s100 </italic>gene expression follows a complex pattern presumably involving several different mechanisms as suggested for humans, <italic>cf</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>The S100 family represents the largest family of calcium-binding proteins with EF hands. S100 proteins have multiple and essential functions in many different tissues, mainly in cells of epithelial origin. However, most studies have been performed in mammals, and the evolutionary emergence of the family is not clear. We have performed an extensive search in six teleost genomes and identified in total fourteen distinct subfamilies, which constitute the fish <italic>s100 </italic>gene repertoire. Individual species exhibit thirteen to fourteen different <italic>s100 </italic>genes. Upon closer investigation a complex pattern of gene gain and gene loss emerges, which results in a roughly stable total repertoire size for each species. A similar family size is observed in amphibians (13 genes for <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, S.I.K., <italic>unpublished observation</italic>), whereas a preponderance of gene gains leads to an enlarged S100 repertoire size in mammals (23 acknowledged genes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]).</p><p>The presence of several S100 family members from cartilaginous fish (shark) deep inside the phylogenetic tree implies that the S100 family predates at least the segregation of bony from cartilaginous fish. Moreover, already ten members of the S100 family have been identified in a jawless primitive fish (lamprey). Thus the origin of the family may lie with very early vertebrate stages although individual family members only become reliably recognizable in the time period between the jawed/jawless segregation and the divergence of cartilaginous from bony fish around 560 to 530 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The somewhat variable composition of each species repertoire suggests that gene function may be variable between species. In fact, an A11-like gene from <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] is expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, i.e. may have acquired the function served in zebrafish by S100Z. Such flexibility is observed irrespective of a generally strong negative selection within the individual <italic>s100 </italic>genes, i.e. the evolutionary changes within the regulatory regions may be much faster than those within the coding regions.</p><p>On the other hand, some functional specializations appear quite stable, which may be inferred from the expression of human S100A10 in polarized epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] parallel to the expression of the zebrafish S100A10a in the intestinal epithelium. However, it should be noted that human A10 is constitutionally in the, calcium-bound' configuration due to a deletion in the S100 EF hand, in contrast to the zebrafish A10 genes. Moreover, the other member of this gene pair (S100A10b) shows a radically different distribution. Another example is S100B, which is expressed in brain in zebrafish as well as in mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The genomic structure of teleost <italic>s100 </italic>genes is markedly similar to that of mammalian genes, with two to three coding exons in similar distances, and a conserved domain structure of one EF hand per each main exon. Some similarities are also observed for the genomic location. Most mammalian <italic>s100 </italic>genes lie together with some other genes in one large cluster, the so-called epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] for which common regulatory elements have been discussed (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). Two smaller clusters of four to seven members in teleosts are syntenic to the human cluster and thus suggest the presence of an ancestral small cluster of <italic>s100 </italic>genes. Teleost cluster configuration does not correlate with sequence similarity, in contrast to the mammalian EDC. Thus the teleost clusters may represent the ancestral cluster composition more closely, while extended local gene duplications appear to have enlarged the mammalian cluster.</p><p>While the predominantly epithelial and epithelial-derived cellular expression of mammalian <italic>s100 </italic>genes is maintained in zebrafish, the actual regulatory mechanisms responsible for this similar expression may be different. No evidence for shared regulatory elements is observed in teleost fish, as judged from both sequence divergence and expression pattern similarity of neighboring genes (with the possible exception of A10b and I1).</p><p>Zebrafish <italic>s100 </italic>genes exhibit highly specific and characteristically different patterns of expression like their mammalian counterparts (<italic>cf</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). Duplicated genes show both redundancy and divergence in their expression pattern. Larval expression is limited to different types of epithelial cells and neural cells of epithelial origin (olfactory receptor neurons, hair cells and ionocytes). Our findings provide a firm basis for unraveling the molecular nature of the S100-like immunoreactivity observed in teleost fish tissues in several earlier publications, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Taken together we have identified and characterized the teleost <italic>s100 </italic>gene family with respect to gene structure and expression pattern. These genes exhibit characteristics similar to the mammalian gene family in several respects. Considering the importance of <italic>s100 </italic>genes in the pathogenesis of epidermal disease &#x02013; particular S100 proteins are markedly over expressed in psoriasis, wound healing, skin cancer, inflammation, cellular stress, and other epidermal pathological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] &#x02013; it appears advantageous to study these processes in the zebrafish model system (<italic>cf</italic>.

Representative fish genes from each subclade and additionally, 19 human S100 genes (full set excluding close relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]) were used as query in tBLASTN searches in the NCBI nucleotide databases nr/nt, EST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and in the ENSEMBL database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

A logo was generated with 85 teleost and cartilaginous fish S100 amino acid sequences. Sequence alignments were manually edited using MEGA 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and highly divergent pieces between the start codon and the beginning of helix 1 were trimmed to avoid N-terminal length heterogeneity. This did not affect significantly conserved residues. Gap positions present in more than 85% of the sequences were deleted completely.</p></sec><sec><title>dN/dS Analysis</title><p>The global dN/dS ratios for the full length S100 coding sequences of all five teleost species for which full genomic information is available were determined using the HyPhy package on the datamonkey server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], which implements a previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The nucleotide alignment was manually edited and gap positions present in more than 85% of the sequences were removed.</p><p>To make inferences about selective pressure (positive and negative selection) on individual codons (sites) within the S100 coding sequences, the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] was used, which implements the Suzuki-Gojobori method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>The algorithm is briefly outlined. First, a best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was automatically selected by fitting several such substitution models to both the data and a neighbor-joining tree generated from the alignment described above. Taking the obtained substitution rates and branch lengths as constant, a codon model was employed to fit to the data and a global dN/dS ratio was calculated. Then a codon by codon reconstruction of the ancestral sequences was performed using maximum likelihood. Afterwards the expected normalized (ES) and observed numbers (EN) of synonymous (NS) and non-synonymous (NN) substitutions were calculated for each non-constant site. dN = NN/EN and dS = NS/ES were then computed, and if dN &#x0003c; dS (negative selection) or dN &#x0003e; dS (positive selection), a p-value derived from a two-tailed extended binomial distribution was used to assess significance. Tests on simulated data (S.L.K. Pond and S.D.W. Frost, methods available at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] show that p values equal or smaller than 0.1 identify nearly all true positives with a false positive rate generally below the nominal p value; for actual data, the number of true positives at a given false positive rate is lower. In the present study, two thresholds for significance (0.1 and 0.2) were taken into account.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Ten zebrafish (mix of male and female <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, strain Ab/T&#x000fc;) were dissected and several tissues were pooled for each RNA extraction: barbels and lips, bone, brain, eyes, genitourinary, gills, heart, liver, muscle, olfactory bulb, olfactory epithelium, skin. cDNA was generated by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an anchored oligo18(dT) reverse primer.
