Hormonal therapy is based on estrogen receptor (ESR) and progesterone receptor (PGR) status. Trastuzumab (Herceptin&#x02122;, Genentech, Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA) therapy, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is based on HER-2 status.</p><p><italic>ERBB2/HER-2 </italic>(<italic>HER-2/neu</italic>, <italic>NEU</italic>, <italic>NGL</italic>, <italic>HER2</italic>, <italic>TKR1</italic>, <italic>CD340</italic>) encodes a membrane receptor protein in the growth factor receptor gene family presenting tyrosine kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>HER-2 </italic>plays a role in the pathogenesis of a significant number of human tumors. It is altered in approximately 20&#x02013;30% of breast carcinomas and this is manifested as gene amplification and/or protein overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These alterations are associated with a shorter disease free period and overall survival and with resistance to tamoxifen antiestrogen therapy and other chemotherapy regimens, regardless of the nodal or hormone receptor status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, breast carcinoma patients presenting <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplification or overexpression can benefit from anthracycline-based regimens, as well as trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The therapy choice for breast cancer patients depends on the discrimination of HER-2 status. Reliable laboratory data in evaluating HER-2 status is essential, because the treatment is beneficial for advanced breast cancer and avoids potential cardiotoxic effects in women not showing amplification and overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The most commonly used assay in the clinical setting for evaluating HER-2 status is immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH), both approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). More recently, the CISH (chromogenic <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization) methodology, also approved by FDA, has emerged as a potential alternative to FISH. When compared with FISH, CISH has been described as having several advantages. CISH does not require an expensive fluorescence microscope with multi-band-pass filters, it produces a permanent staining and samples can be archived indefinitely, thus avoiding archival recording with an expensive CDD camera. The morphology is easier to analyze, particularly for distinguishing invasive cancer cells and <italic>in situ </italic>components. Moreover, tumor heterogeneity is promptly identified, even at low magnification (20&#x000d7;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In FISH analysis, tissue morphology and gene amplification are primarily disconnected because of tumor cells for signal evaluation are based on nuclear DAPI (4', 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole) or propidium iodide staining, which does not always permit adequate histopathological evaluation of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. CISH is a useful methodology for confirming ambiguous IHC results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technology has been demonstrated to successfully evaluate specific mRNAs, especially those present in low copy numbers in a small number of cells or in small quantities of tissue, and mRNAs expressed in mixed-cell populations. Quantitative real time reverse transcript PCR (qRT-PCR) is a quantitative method easily amenable to standardization. However, qRT-PCR suffers from the same drawback as other PCR-based methods. The tumor cell population within the tissue under evaluation must be isolated, the template quality, operator variability, subjectivity in data analysis and reporting are technical aspects that must be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This procedure is an alternative for scoring <italic>HER-2 </italic>status in human breast cancer. Limitations based on tumor heterogeneity and amplification of <italic>HER-2 </italic>in noninvasive cancer can be eliminated by the use of laser microdissection, although this seems to be impracticable for routine diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to assess agreement between gene amplification detection by CISH and transcript (qRT-PCR) and protein (IHC) expression, as well as to evaluate their relevance for determining <italic>HER-2 </italic>status in breast carcinomas. In addition, the data were correlated with clinicopathological features, such as tumor size, lymph node status, histological grade and Ki-67 status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Seventy-five breast carcinoma samples were obtained between 2000 and 2004, from Amaral Carvalho Hospital, Ja&#x000fa; (SP, Brazil). The patients were accrued consecutively and the criterion for inclusion in the study was no previous histological diagnosis of breast cancer. Patients underwent segmental resection or mastectomy and none of them had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery. All patients were advised of the procedures and provided written informed consent. The Ethics Committee from Amaral Carvalho Hospital Foundation approved this study (CEPFHAC 007/05).</p><p>Seventy tumors were infiltrating ductal and five infiltrating lobular carcinomas, in which most presented operable stage II and III breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes. Most patients were more than 50 years-old (64%) with a mean of 58 &#x000b1; 15.5 years (range, 30&#x02013;94 years); most tumors were more than 2 cm (73.3%) and half of them showed low Ki-67 positivity. The mean follow-up was 49.8 &#x000b1; 20.1 months (varying between 23 to 83 months). During this interval, five patients died due to unrelated causes, two patients presented recurrence in the same breast, eight presented metastasis (two spreading to the bone and six to the lung) and six missed their follow-ups. Patients with a family history of cancer were noted, particularly among first-degree and second-degree relatives, and whenever possible, the cancer was confirmed with documented medical records or ascertained from the death certificate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The patients received different chemotherapy treatments: AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide); FEC (5-fluorouracil, 4-epirubicin, cyclophosphamide); FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide); CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil), at 100% or 70% of the dose, according to the age and clinical status of the patient. Fifty-five patients (73%) received radiotherapy and 51 ESR1 positive and/or PGR positive cases (68%), as determined by IHC analysis, were treated with tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 60 months at the end of the chemotherapy treatment. Some patients presenting intolerance or side effects (postmenopausal) were treated with aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole (1 mg/day) or letrozole (2.5 mg/day).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of clinicopathological features with <italic>HER-2 </italic>status using CISH, qRT-PCR (qPCR), and IHC.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Variables (n)<sup>a</sup></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>CISH</bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>P *</italic></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>qPCR</bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>P *</italic></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>IHC</bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>P *</italic></bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">&#x02264;

HER-2 status is predominantly evaluated by IHC staining, because it is easy to perform and presents a relatively low cost. However, a wide range of sensitivity and specificity was observed among various commercially available antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, FISH is used for those cases that are scored as 2+. The advantage of FISH testing is that the quantitative interpretation of results with experience is relatively straightforward and concordance rates among observers are higher than with IHC in some studies [for review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]]. CISH is an alternative method to evaluate amplifications that requires a conventional light microscopy, permits a more rapid interpretation time and a review of the morphological details. A further advantage of CISH is that the probe signals are permanent and the slides can therefore be archived for long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

This high concordance was also found by several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One of the eight cases displayed a small frequency of cells showing chromosome 17 polysomy by FISH and showed a score 2+ by IHC. Peir&#x000f3; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed that all of the polyploidy tumors analyzed presented 2+ immunostaining. Although a limited number of cases were evaluated by FISH in the present study, the data are in agreement with other studies which indicate that the chromogenic ISH technique seems to be sensitive and specific for the detection of <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplification in human archival tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>CISH analysis revealed intratumoral heterogeneity in three cases. In case A, 50% of cells showed high-level amplification and nonamplified cells. In addition, this case showed discordant data between IHC and qRT-PCR methodologies, probably due to qRT-PCR false-positive results. The major question is whether cells showing different levels of amplification make any difference or whether a threshold (or its value) percentage of amplified tumor cells is required to define nonamplified and amplified tumors. Regardless of the CISH results, these three patients were treated with tamoxifen and radiotherapy (patients A and B) and radiotherapy and CMF (patient C), according to the IHC results. The outcome was favorable for more than 45 months. Further studies should be performed to clarify the tumoral heterogeneity involving <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplifications in breast cancer. These three cases were evaluated by FISH and similar results were observed between CISH and FISH analysis for all the cases. When using FISH, it was not possible to determine the two areas observed by CISH, probably due to the restricted number of cells evaluated. Case A presented a higher frequency of amplified cells by CISH in its area 2 than that observed by FISH. Specifically in this case, the paraffin sections used for CISH and FISH methods were not successive and, most likely, different patterns of tumor heterogeneity were evaluated by both methodologies.</p><p>Comparison between CISH and IHC results revealed six discordant cases (16%). These same cases showed concordance when comparing CISH and qRT-PCR data. Many studies have shown high concordance between IHC and CISH; frequently, the discordant cases were 2+ immunostained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In the present study, all of the samples scored as 3+ by IHC presented <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplification by CISH. In fact, &#x0003e;90% of HER-2 IHC 3+ tumors present <italic>HER-2 </italic>gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The concordance between both methodologies was similar to that observed in other studies, varying from 85% to 95.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Differences exist in tissue screening between these two techniques. While the IHC test requires that a minimum of 10% of tumor cells are reactive to be considered positive, CISH scoring requires that more than 50% of tumor cells show an increase in gene copies to be considered amplified; according the criteria used in the present study. It is conceivable that this difference could account for some of the discordant results observed between IHC and CISH. In the present study, eight cases presenting 2+ and 3+ immunostaining showed <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplification by FISH. The two cases detected as 2+ by IHC and amplified by FISH also presented high-level amplification using CISH. Cases scored as 2+ and amplified by FISH were also observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>A significant correlation was detected between gene and protein expression levels.

However, ten samples scored as 0 or 1+ by IHC showed <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression by qRT-PCR.

Tse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] used a cut-off of RQ&#x0003e;2.2 as positive for <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression by qRT-PCR when it was compared to Elisa, IHC, and FISH on sections obtained from paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas.</p><p>Currently, the most widely used assay to evaluate gene status in cases scored as 2+ immunostaining is FISH. However, qRT-PCR has emerged as a potential alternative technique for assessing <italic>HER-2 </italic>status. The present results demonstrated that 58.3% of the samples presenting a score of 2+ overexpressed the transcript. Among the current samples, four out of five patients that presented discordant results (2+ immunostaining and RQ &#x02264; 2.00) showed a favorable outcome, indicating that <italic>HER-2 </italic>status by qRT-PCR could be performed on 2+ staining tumors with potential value regarding the management of these patients. Of the patients presenting 2+ staining and RQ&#x0003e;2.00 (eight cases), three presented metastasis, one revealing spreading to the bone and two to the lung.</p><p>A higher concordance rate was observed between 3+ score by IHC and overexpression by qRT-PCR. Only one sample that presented 3+ status and <italic>HER-2 </italic>amplification showed transcript downexpression. This case, showing a qRT-PCR false-negative result, probably resulted from the dilution of cells carrying amplified genes among nontumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], although the sample was submitted to microdissection.</p><p>Concordance between the IHC and qRT-PCR results was 78.9%.

Two other possible causes for discrepancy exist: intraobserver error, due to subjectivity of the IHC interpretation; and qRT-PCR analysis, which can cause discrepancies particularly in the initial cycles, which depend not only on the melting temperature of the amplicon, but also on the behavior of the genomic vicinity of the amplicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Using PCR-based methods, the expression of tumor- or tissue-specific genes and the presence of genetic abnormalities can be detected in a clinical specimen with higher sensitivity (one malignant cell out of 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>7 </sup>normal cells) than that of other techniques such as light microscopy (one malignant cell out of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3 </sup>normal cells). Using RT-PCR the nucleic acid molecules can be amplified 10<sup>10</sup>-fold [for review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]]. Moreover, <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression can be detected in 0.1 cell equivalent spiked into 8 mL of peripheral blood using qRT-PCR and the detection limited increases to 10 and 50 cell equivalent per 8 mL in cell lines expressing intermediate and low levels of <italic>HER-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Comparison between qRT-PCR data and CISH results showed that the gene expression median was correlated with gene copy number, a finding also observed by Bergqvist et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. <italic>HER-2 </italic>gene amplification is the most prevalent genetic mechanism driving <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression. The discordant cases (8.1%) showed 2+ and 3+ immunostaining, confirming the CISH results. In this study, the concordance between qRT-PCR and FISH was 100%. High concordances were observed by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, a high correlation rate among the three procedures used to score <italic>HER-2 </italic>status in breast carcinomas was observed. The correlation between CISH and qRT-PCR was higher than CISH and IHC, which was higher than qRT-PCR and IHC for the samples evaluated by all these procedures. In fact, CISH and qRT-PCR are complementary methodologies for evaluating <italic>HER-2 </italic>status.</p><p>No correlation was found between HER-2 expression by IHC or gene copy number and clinicopathological data. However, a significant association was observed between lymph node status and <italic>HER-2 </italic>transcript expression by qRT-PCR. Peir&#x000f3; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] analyzed HER-2 status by IHC and CISH and observed a correlation with histological grade and lymph-vascular invasion, but no association was found with age, tumor size and Ki-67 status. Similarly, the absence of correlation between HER-2 status and clinical and pathological features has been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>No statistically significant difference was observed between ductal and lobular carcinomas evaluated by qRT-PCR. Among the lobular carcinomas, amplification by CISH was observed in one case, followed by <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression and negative IHC staining. In a previous study, this case was confirmed as negative for e-cadherin protein expression and presented <italic>CDH1 </italic>promoter hypermethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Li-Ning-T et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] evaluated five invasive lobular tumors and none showed amplification by CISH, however two cases presented 2+ immunostaining.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that <italic>HER-2 </italic>status can be performed by CISH and qRT-PCR analysis. CISH combines the advantages of IHC and FISH and is a promising practical alternative to FISH, while qRT-PCR is reliable, semiautomated and fast; and both methodologies can be performed in most pathology laboratories. However, there are several limitations to apply qRT-PCR as a routine method for clinical application, including the use of fresh frozen tissue, microdissection procedures and the incapacity to address cell-to-cell variations. In addition, the data confirm that <italic>HER-2 </italic>overexpression is associated with a worst prognostic in human breast tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FER participated in the study design, in defining the casuistic used, carried out the qRT-PCR analysis and helped to draft the manuscript.
