HIV viral strains have been described which use a wide range of different chemokine receptors, although the majority use either CCR5 (R5 strains), CXCR4 (X4 strains) or both of these receptors. Consistent with a requirement for chemokine receptors as cofactors for viral entry, the chemokine ligands have been reported to reduce HIV infectivity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding CCR5, such as the CCR5-&#x00394; 32 allele, provide some protection against HIV infection <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consequently, agents which block HIV interaction with chemokine receptors are candidate antiviral therapies which can be used in conjunction with protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors to attenuate a third phase of the virus life-cycle: cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], in the same way as the novel fusion inhibitor enfuvrtide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]</p><p>Interestingly, the HIV gp120 protein which interacts with the chemokine co-receptor primarily through its V3 loop can induce leukocyte chemotaxis, demonstrating that some intracellular signals are generated through the the virus:receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This signalling occurs even though the site of the gp120 interaction with the chemokine receptors appears to be only partially overlapping with the natural ligand binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>It has been proposed that this chemotactic signalling might play a role during HIV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, possibly by recruiting susceptible T-cells to sites of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In other retroviruses envelope/receptor interactions are known to be mitogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and this may facilitate nuclear translocation and integration of the provirus. In HIV, however, it is not known whether the ability to productively engage the chemokine receptors in this way plays any direct role in acute viral entry and subsequent productive infection of the target cell. Guntermann and colleagues showed that pertussis toxin (which blocks G<sub>i</sub>-mediated signalling through chemokine receptors) block cellular infection with HIV <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Montes <italic>et al</italic>. obtained similar results, and also showed that the MEK inhibitor U0126 could block both chemokine-receptor-induced ERK activity and HIV infection <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, neither pertussis toxin nor MEK inhibition are specific for chemokine signalling pathways: G<sub>i </sub>and ERKs participate in other intracellular signalling pathways, so it is possible that HIV infection was inhibited because of blockade of downstream pathways not initiated through productive occupancy of the chemokine receptors.</p><p>Recently, we have described a new class of chemokine inhibitors, termed Broad Spectrum Chemokine Inhibitors (BSCIs) which block chemokine-induced chemotaxis in a range of leukocytes, irrespective of the chemokine used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These BSCIs are highly selective for chemokines, however, and have no effect on chemotaxis induced by a range of other chemoattractants such as TGF-&#x003b2;, fMLP or C5a. Importantly, the molecular target of the BSCIs is not the chemokine receptors themselves: BSCIs do not bind to chemokine receptors, do not affect chemokine receptor levels on the cell surface, and do not interefere with the binding of chemokine ligands to the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Instead, they are thought to specifically inhibit intracellular signals required for chemokine-induced migration but not for migration induced by non-chemokine pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], although their molecular target has not yet been published. As a result, members of the BSCI family have been shown to be potentially useful new anti-inflammatory agents in a wide range of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>BSCIs provide an ideal tool to probe the importance of chemokine-induced intracellular signalling in HIV infection. Since the effects of these compounds are apparently selective for chemokine receptor-induced signals, if BSCIs interefere with cellular infection by HIV <italic>in vitro </italic>this will indicate that productive signalling by the chemokine co-receptor is likely to be important for successful infection. In the present study, we have investigated whether the first BSCI to be described, termed Peptide 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], affects gp120 binding to chemokine receptors or cellular infection by HIV <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of Peptide 3 on gp120 binding</title><p>The binding of gp120 to chemokine receptors is likely to involve sequences in the V3 loop of gp120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We therefore synthesised peptide sequences from the V3 loop of the M-tropic BaL strain and the T-tropic IIIb strain and analysed the binding of these biotinylated peptides to the THP-1 and Jurkat cells.

Peptide 3 had no effect on the binding of gp120:V3(IIIb) to Jurkat cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), even though it powerfully inhibited SDF-1&#x003b1; induced chemotaxis over the same concentration range (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Under the same conditions, the CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] blocked both gp120:V3(IIIb) binding and SDF-1&#x003b1;-induced migration with similar IC50s (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>).

Jurkat cells were infected with HIV in the presence or absence of Peptide 3 (100 &#x003bc;M) or SDF1&#x003b1; (100 ng/ml) as described above. Approximately 48 h after infection, the cells were attached to glass slides using a cytospin and then fixed by immersion in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 90 seconds. Expression of p24<sup>gag </sup>was determined using quantitative immunofluoresence as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], except that the primary antibody was post-fixed to the section using paraformaldehyde to increase the sensitivity of the technique (see Methods). Viral infectivity was expressed as the number of cells stained for p24<sup>gag </sup>expressed as a proportion of the total number of cells (detected using Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye). Consistent with the reverse transcriptase assay results, SDF1&#x003b1; inhibited viral infectivity by more than 80% (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), while peptide 3 had no effect.</p><p>Infection of THP-1 cells with M-tropic isolates does not generate high levels of virus particles and hence the reverse transcriptase assay is not sufficiently sensitive to monitor the progress of the infection. However, it was possible to assess HIV infectivity of THP-1 cells using high sensitivity immunofluorescent detection of p24<sup>gag</sup>. THP-1 cells were differentiated with hydrocortisone and PMA, then treated with TNF&#x003b1;, resulting in adherent monolayers on glass chamber slides. The THP-1 cells were then treated with either Peptide 3 (100 &#x003bc;M), MIP1&#x003b1; (100 ng/ml) or SDF1&#x003b1; (100 ng/ml) as for the Jurkat cells. THP-1 cells were infected with HIV strain MN at a concentration previously validated to produce easily detectable infection and grown for 72 h prior to fixation and staining for p24<sup>gag</sup>. In contrast to the findings with HIV strain IIIb infection of Jurkat T cells, Peptide 3 inhibited infection of THP-1 cells by more than 80% (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), very similar to the effect of MIP1&#x003b1;. SDF-1a had no statistically significant effect on HIV strain MN infection of THP-1 cells, confirming that the infection was entirely CCR5-dependent, even though THP-1 cells express CXCR4.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together our results suggest that, at least under some conditions, the generation of intracellular signals by the chemokine co-receptor during HIV infection might be necessary for productive infection. Since Peptide 3 powerfully inhibited CCR5-dependent HIV infection of THP-1 cells under conditions where gp120 binding to CCR5 was unaffected but chemotaixs in response to RANTES was profoundly blocked, it is likely that at least some of the signals elicted by CCR5 occupation that result in chemotaxis are required for successful infection of the cell by HIV. Since BSCIs, such as Peptide 3, do not block chemokine receptor internalisation induced by ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], it seems likely that the HIV successfully entered the cell in the presence of Peptide 3, but that some later stage in the viral life cycle was dependent on one or more intracellular signal generated by chemokine receptor occupancy. These results are consistent with, but extend, the findings of Guntermann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Montes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] who saw similar effects with pertussis toxin and a MEK inhibitor.</p><p>It is unclear why Peptide 3 blocked CCR5-dependent HIV infection of THP-1 cells but had no effect on CXCR4-dependent infection of Jurkat T-cells under similar condtions (even though Peptide 3 efficiently blocks SDF1&#x003b1; dependent chemotaxis). It is possible that infection of certain cell types (such as monocyte/macrophage cells) is more dependent on a chemokine receptor-induced intracellular signal than infection of other cell types (such as T-lymphocytes). This may reflect the fact the the Jurkat cells were proliferating at the time of infection, whereas the THP-1 derived macrophages were quiescent. However, it is also possible that this difference is due to the particularly high levels of CXCR4 which are expressed on Jurkat T cells. The high levels of receptor on this cell line might render infection relatively insensitive to intracellular signalling requirements compared with native T-cells or other cell types expressing physiological levels of chemokine co-receptors.</p><p>Irrespective of the reasons for this difference, our preliminary studies illustrate the need to further investigate the role of intracellular signals induced by co-receptor occupancy as participants in the viral life cycle. Furthermore, the recent discovery of much more potent non-peptide BSCIs, such as the acylaminocaprolactams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], opens up the possibility that interfering with chemokine receptor-induced signalling might offer an alternative therapeutic strategy to blocking chemokine receptor binding. The best acylaminocaprolactam BSCIs are cheap, orally bioavailable and apparently free of acute toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and, on the basis of studies such as ours, warrant further investigation as part of an antiviral combination therapy for HIV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that selective inhibition of the intracellular signal(s) generated through interaction of the HIV gp120 envelope protein with its chemokine co-receptor can block productive HIV infection in THP-1 derived macrophages in vitro. However, blockade of CXCR4-mediated signalling in Jurkat T-cells has no effect on HIV infection in vitro. Under certain condtions, therefore, HIV infection may require activation of the chemokine co-receptor signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Peptides</title><p>Peptides were prepared by Affiniti (Exeter, U.K.) using standard solid phase chemistry, followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification to greater than 95% purity.

Stocks of HIV-1 MN strain were prepared in a similar manner, except that H9 T cells were used and the progression of infection was monitored by immunofluoresence (because of the low RT activity) in this strain.</p><p>Experimental infection of Jurkat T cells was performed by incubating cells win the presence of test peptide or chemokine with aliquots of stored virus at the titres described in the text. Thereafter, the cells were fed fresh medium containing test peptide or chemokine where appropriate, every 48 h. Viral replication two weeks after infection was estimated by measuring reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatant using the Potts Mini RT assay as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>THP-1 cells were differentiated prior to infection with hydrocortisone and PMA in 8-well chamber slides. Sixteen hours prior to infection, TNF&#x003b1; was added (100 ng/ml). Twelve hours later, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium containing the test peptides or chemokines as appropriate. After a further four hours, virus from the frozen stocks was adeed to the cells, which were the processed for immunofluoresence between 28 h and 72 h after infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence detection of p24<sup>gag</sup></title><p>Jurkat cells following HIV infection were attached to 8-well chamber slides (Becton-Dickinson) by spinning the slides using a plate rotor in a Labofuge centrifuge (Heraeus) at 3,000 &#x000d7; g for 5 minutes. Attached Jurkat cells or THP-1 cells were then fixed by dipping the slides into ice-cold 70% ethanol for 90 seconds. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation with 3% fatty acid-free BSA in TBS for 1 hour at room temprature. Cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-HIV-1 p24<sup>gag </sup>antibody EH12E1 (ref 38;AIDS Reagent Program, NIBSC) at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml in 3% BSA in TBS at room temperature overnight. Unbound antibody was removed with 3 &#x000d7; 3 min washes in PBS, and bound antibody was then fixed to the slide by incubation with 3.8% phosphate buffered formalin pH7.2 for 10 mins at room temperature, followed by 3 further 3 min washes in PBS. Bound antibody was visualised using donkey anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate (715-095-150; Jackson Immunoresearch) at 30 &#x003bc;g/ml in 3% BSA/TBS + 1 ng/ml Hoescht 33342 for 6 hours at room temperature. Twelve fields of view (100&#x000d7; magnification) were captured from each well of the chamber slide using an Olympus Provis AX electronic microscope connected to a Power Macintosh 8500, running OpenLab image analysis software (Improvision), under both FITC illumination conditions (NIBA filter block; &#x003bb;ex = 470&#x02013;490 nm, dichroic mirror = 505 nm, &#x003bb;em = 515&#x02013;550 nm) and UV illumination conditions (Chroma 31000; &#x003bb;ex = 340&#x02013;380 nm, dichroic mirror = 400 nm, &#x003bb;em = 435&#x02013;485 nm). Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu C4742-05 monochrome digital camera with 10-bit depth in a 1280-1024 pixel field connected to a DIG Snapper frame grabber. The exposure time, amplifier gain and offset values were controlled by the OpenLab software and were held constant throughout the experiment. A background (an image captured without a slide under the objective) was digitally subtracted from every image. A threshold was then applied to each image which was the lowest threhold that detected &#x0003c;1% of the pixels of an image of uninfected cells stained under identical conditions. The number of objects exceeding this threshold in each field of view were counted. A similar procedure was used to determine the total number of nuclei in the same field of view, using the image captured under UV illumination conditions. The ratio of positively stained objects to nuclei in each field of view was reported as the percentage of cells stained for p24<sup>gag</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>DJG is an inventor on a range of patents filed by the University of Cambridge containing composition of matter and pharmaceutical use claims for a wide range of BSCIs, including Peptide 3 used in this manuscript.
