Since the latter is responsible for the cleavage of arachidonic acid at membrane phospholipids, all three proteins modulate eicosanoid production. We have previously shown the association of ANXA1 expression with that of CFTR, the multifactorial protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. This could in part account for the abnormal inflammatory status characteristic of this disease. We postulated that CFTR participates in the regulation of eicosanoid release by direct interaction with a complex containing ANXA1, p11 and cPLA2&#x003b1;. We first analyzed by plasmon surface resonance the in vitro binding of CFTR to the three proteins. A significant interaction between p11 and the NBD1 domain of CFTR was found. We observed in Calu-3 cells a rapid and partial redistribution of all four proteins in detergent resistant membranes (DRM) induced by TNF-&#x003b1;. This was concomitant with increased IL-8 synthesis and cPLA2&#x003b1; activation, ultimately resulting in eicosanoid (PGE2 and LTB4) overproduction. DRM destabilizing agent methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin induced further cPLA2&#x003b1; activation and eicosanoid release, but inhibited IL-8 synthesis. We tested in parallel the effect of short exposure of cells to CFTR inhibitors Inh172 and Gly-101. Both inhibitors induced a rapid increase in eicosanoid production. Longer exposure to Inh172 did not increase further eicosanoid release, but inhibited TNF-&#x003b1;-induced relocalization to DRM. These results show that (i) CFTR may form a complex with cPLA2&#x003b1; and ANXA1 <italic>via</italic> interaction with p11, (ii) CFTR inhibition and DRM disruption induce eicosanoid synthesis, and (iii) suggest that the putative cPLA2/ANXA1/p11/CFTR complex may participate in the modulation of the TNF-&#x003b1;-induced production of eicosanoids, pointing to the importance of membrane composition and CFTR function in the regulation of inflammation mediator synthesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the multisystemic clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF), an abnormal inflammatory condition at the airways represents one of the most prominent morbidity factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Machen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Rubin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in bronchiectasis and respiratory insufficiency.

ANXA1 has been long known to be related to the regulation of inflammation, in particular by inhibition of the cytosolic phospholipase A2&#x003b1; (cPLA<sub>2</sub>), a member of the IV-A group of phospholipases A2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Touqui1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Wallner1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Since cPLA2&#x003b1; releases the acyl chain at the sn-2 position of phospholipids leading to a subsequent synthesis of eicosanoids, the observed decrease in the expression of ANXA1 has been suggested to be at the start point of this cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Bensalem1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Rhen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter constitutes a key pathway in the onset and regulation of proinflammatory responses, including those altered in CF, as some studies have reported increased levels of eicosanoids in bronchoalveolar fluid from CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Konstan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and in the supernatant of epithelial cells expressing the F508del mutation of CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Medjane1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular nature of cPLA2&#x003b1; inhibition is not precisely known. At least two proteins are candidates for regulation of this activity: the already mentioned ANXA1 and the adaptor protein S100A10 (p11), which forms a complex with another member of the annexin family, ANXA2, and coimmunoprecipitates with CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Borthwick1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

The involvement of membrane microdomains in cPLA2&#x003b1; proinflammatory activity inflammation in the context of CF has never been questioned. It has recently been demonstrated a differential distribution of CFTR within membrane microdomains in CFTR-transfected MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Bajmoczi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Kowalski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In basal conditions, mature CFTR is mostly present in detergent soluble fractions (non-DRM, non-rafts), with a minor proportion present in detergent-insoluble microdomains (DRM, rafts). Conversely, upon pathogen infection normal CFTR, unlike the mutated protein, redistributes into DRMs triggering defense reactions against the pathogen, including uptake and apoptosis of host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Kowalski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with earlier reports indicating that the response to pathogens would be associated with the presence of CFTR in a ceramide-rich environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Grassme1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, Dudez et al, have demonstrated that wild-type CFTR, but not a truncated form lacking the C-terminal region, is recruited along with TNFR1 in DRM in response to TNF-&#x003b1; in MDCK transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a recent report, it is claimed that CFTR localization in DRM of CFTR-transfected cells is key in limiting the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B and the synthesis of IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Vij1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the impact of the association of CFTR with DRM on the regulation of the eicosanoid signalling pathway has never been investigated. In this study we analyzed and confirmed the DRM association of CFTR, ANXA1, cPLA2&#x003b1; and p11 under proinflammatory conditions as well as the importance of membrane integrity in the synthesis and release of AA-derived eicosanoids, in an endogenous CFTR-expressing airway cell line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>Calu-3 cells (a human respiratory epithelial gland cell line from ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; foetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C, and a 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Brouillard2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

A 70 mL inoculum of BL21-DE3 cells containing the SMT-3 fusion in the pET 28 expression system was grown overnight in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C with kanamycin (50 ug/mL working concentration) present. Cells were induced with 0.179 g of IPTG, cooled to 15&#x000b0;C overnight, then harvested and pelleted at 4000 RPM at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Each pellet was resuspended in 15 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM L-Arginine, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> hexahydrate, 12.5&#x00025; Glycerol, 0.25 IGEPAL CA630, 2 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 2 mM ATP, pH 7.6). Suspensions were combined into 50 mL conical vials and lysed by sonication after adding lysozyme and incubating on ice for 30 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 45 minutes to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions, and loaded into a pre-equilibrated 5 mL bed of Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Amersham). The column was equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) of Loading Buffer. During this step the elution tubes were prepared with 2 mM ATP and 2 mM 2-mercapto ethanol. The sample was loaded and bound to the column, and washed with 5 CV of washing buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 60 mM Imidazole, 12.5&#x00025; Glycerol, pH 7.6). The sample was eluted in 5 CV of elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 400 mM Imidazole, 12.5&#x00025; Glycerol, pH 7.6).

NBD1 was covalently immobilized <italic>via</italic> primary amino groups onto the sensor chip surface as follows; the carboxymethylated dextran matrix was activated with 35 &#x000b5;l of EDC/NHS (1/1) mixture, 10 &#x000b5;l of NBD1 at a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;g/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was injected and unreacted groups were blocked with 35 &#x000b5;l of ethanolamine (pH 8.5). A separate flow channel on the same sensor chip, reserved for control runs, was subjected to a blank immobilization by preparing it in the same way but without NBD1. The running and dilution buffer had the following composition: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.6), 0.005&#x00025; P20, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 &#x000b5;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The interaction between either p11, ANXA1 or cPLA2/ANXA1 complex and the immobilized NBD1 was monitored by injecting different concentrations (30 &#x000b5;g/ml, 121 &#x000b5;g/ml and 243 &#x000b5;g/ml) of the mentioned purified proteins at 25&#x000b0;C with a flow rate of 30 &#x000b5;l/min, and following the refractive index changes at the sensor surface. The subsequent dissociation phase was followed after each association run by injecting the running buffer alone. In between injections, surfaces were regenerated by three washes with 20 &#x000b5;l of 5 mM NaOH followed by two washes with 20 &#x000b5;l of 1 M NaCl. For all SPR measurements, the recombinant domain was dialysed in the buffer with the desired NaCl concentration and pH, and centrifuged immediately before the runs to minimize possible effects from non-specific aggregation. All association and dissociation curves were corrected for non-specific binding by subtraction of control curves obtained from injection of the different analyte concentrations through the blank flow channel.

The assay is based on the competition between PGE2 (respectively LTB4) and PGE2 acetylcholinesterase conjugate (PGE2-tracer, respectively LTB4-tracer) for a limited amount of monoclonal PGE2 antibody (respectively LTB4 antibody). Because the concentration of the tracer is held constant while the concentration of eicosanoid varies, the amount of tracer that is able to bind to the monoclonal antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of eicosanoid in the well. The eicosanoid-antibody complex binds to a goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG that has been previously attached to the well. Then an acetylcholinesterase substrate (Ellman's Reagent) is added and the product of the reaction is read at 412 nm. The intensity is proportional to the amount of PGE2 (or LTB4).

The maximum release was reached at 1 h, similar to that at 20 min, indicating that no further eicosanoid synthesis occurs beyond this point.

For this purpose, the potential role of a putative CFTR/cPLA2&#x003b1; /ANXA1/p11 complex in the context of DRM and eicosanoid and cytokine synthesis was investigated. The results show that the connection between membrane microdomains and CFTR/cPLA2&#x003b1;/ANXA1/p11 is complicated but fundamental for eicosanoid and IL-8 production during the acute phase of TNF&#x003b1;-induced inflammation (10&#x02013;20 min). Interestingly, the chloride channel function of CFTR seems to regulate eicosanoid synthesis in basal conditions.</p><p>We confirm in Calu-3 cells the previous observations obtained in other models that short TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation induces CFTR recruitment at DRM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Kowalski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we show for the first time a synchronous dynamics of the AA-releasing enzyme cPLA2&#x003b1;, and the cPLA2&#x003b1;-regulatory proteins ANXA1 and p11 (S100A10), and prove that membrane integrity participates in the regulation of eicosanoid synthesis and release. We demonstrate that CFTR interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with the cPLA2&#x003b1;/ANXA1 complex <italic>via</italic> NBD1/p11 binding. The pathway examined in our study, involving AA release and subsequent eicosanoid production, could play a fundamental role in the homeostasis of inflammation in epithelial cells, both by the direct bioactive properties of LTB4 and PGE2 on the surrounding cells and tissues, and by representing a regulatory circuit of the NF-&#x003ba;B and cytokine expression path, as in two different models ANXA1 has been shown to regulate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-deCoupade1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-La1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our central premise was the fact that TNF-&#x003b1; induces, at a short incubation time, both recruitment of certain proteins in DRM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and activation of cPLA2&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Jupp1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. It is tempting to hypothesize that one of the phospholipid cleavage products, namely AA, LPC or their downstream derivatives, might be responsible for CFTR, ANXA1, cPLA2&#x003b1; and p11 recruitment into DRM. We tested the effect of exogenous AA and LPC, and in both cases the result was negative; conversely, preliminary tests with the cPLA2 inhibitor pyrrolidine gave similar results (not shown). It must be considered that TNF-&#x003b1;-induced DRM recruitment is a fast event (10 min) and it is unlikely that downstream products, such as eicosanoids, participate in the mechanism. DRM recruitment could also be explained from an alternative hypothesis. As cPLA2&#x003b1; activity participates in the turnover of membrane phospholipids, a sudden activation would result in a rapid lipid remodeling, leading to a change in the affinity of certain proteins for the surrounding environment and subsequent relocalization to cholesterol-containing DRM domains. Whether this phenomenon can happen in cell membranes and within 10 min remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Concerning TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation of cPLA2&#x003b1; activity, several studies show that two different pathways could be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Jupp1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The first entails the activation of MAPK and subsequent phosphorylation of cPLA2&#x003b1;, and occurs <italic>via</italic> activation of TNFR1. The second pathway would be independent from phosphorylation and would involve a raise in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, leading to translocation of cPLA2&#x003b1; to the activation sites, mainly the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the nuclear envelope. An early work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Grell1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> indicates that the first pathway would be activated by default. Our results suggest that both events triggered by short exposure to TNF-&#x003b1;, i.e. cPLA2&#x003b1; activation and DRM recruitment of CFTR, ANXA1, cPLA2&#x003b1; and p11, may occur independently of one another, as DRM destabilization does not inhibit AA release induced by the cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>A logical question prompted by our observations on DRM relocalization of proteins was that of the impact of DRM disruption on cPLA2&#x003b1; activity and eicosanoid synthesis. This led to the remarkable and surprising finding that all the treatments tested involving depletion of either cholesterol or sphingolipids &#x02013;two lipid classes enriched in DRM- result in increased LTB4 and PGE2 synthesis. Interestingly, long term treatments (mevastatin and fumonisin) have a greater effect on PGE2 than on LTB4, as compared to m&#x003b2;CD. The former may have an impact on COX-2 expression, leading to increased PGE2 production. This has already been evaluated in macrophages, but while fumonisin enhances COX-2 expression in the presence of LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Meli1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, statins are mainly inhibitory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Habib1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results support the hypothesis that the presence of CFTR, ANXA1, cPLA2&#x003b1; and p11 &#x02013;all four altered in terms of function or expression in CF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Bensalem1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>- in DRM would limit eicosanoid synthesis. Nevertheless, even though the increased AA release after m&#x003b2;CD treatment would suggest the regulation of this synthetic mechanism to take place at the cPLA2&#x003b1; checkpoint, our findings do not discard the possibility that m&#x003b2;CD has a direct impact on cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase activities. In particular, the non-inhibition by pyrrolidine of m&#x003b2;CD-induced PGE2 release, strongly suggests a direct activation of cyclooxygenase function. In fact, it has been reported that m&#x003b2;CD induces COX-2 epression and activation in a macrophage cell line, but at a much longer incubation time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Choi1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative hypothesis for the shorter term effect of cholesterol depletion could involve PKC and Src triggering and subsequent activation of COX-2, as both events have been shown independently in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-CabreraPoch1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Hsieh1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Exploration of these or other hypotheses is warranted in order to understand the effects of DRM disruption. The fact that TNF-&#x003b1; and m&#x003b2;CD together seem to exert a greater effect than each stimulus alone, which is especially clear in terms of AA release, suggests a deregulation of the system, probably due to changes in membrane composition that could alter protein-protein interactions. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy to remark that DRM destabilization by m&#x003b2;CD, mevastatin and fumonisin, and the parallel increase in eicosanoid production points to the importance of membrane composition in the inflammatory response.</p><p>It could also be hypothesized that DRM localization would reduce the availability of cPLA2&#x003b1; substrate, since polysunsaturated fatty acid-containing phosphatidylcholine is mostly present in non-DRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Koumanov1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>). Another possibility is that DRM recruitment leads to the formation of a functional complex in response to the inflammatory stimulus that would limit the catalytic activity of cPLA2&#x003b1; by direct binding of ANXA1 and/or p11. The synchronous recruitment in DRM of the four proteins seems to be in agreement with this hypothesis. However, the small proportion of cPLA2&#x003b1; that is relocalized to DRM does not seem to account for a major reduction in its catalytic activity in any of the two cases.</p><p>An alternative possibility could be that the putative complex triggers an unknown regulatory mechanism. The answer may reside in the identification of the other partners that compose the complex. An obvious question that could be raised is if the integrity of the putative complex would depend on CFTR function and/or on TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. In this study we demonstrate for the first time the direct interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> of NBD1 and p11, which could constitute the link between CFTR and ANXA1/cPLA2&#x003b1;. Ongoing studies in our laboratory pursue the identification of additional partners of CFTR. To this respect it cannot be excluded the existence of a functional short-lived dynamic complex which we have already hypothesized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Ollero1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Brouillard3">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An unexpected finding was the stimulatory effect of CFTR inhibition on eicosanoid production in basal conditions, especially considering that LTB4 and PGE2 were found already increased after 20 min of treatment, as compared to the longer period of time (3 h) necessary for their accumulation in the medium after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. The fact that a similar effect was obtained with two independent inhibitors (Inh172 and Gly-101), and that no stimulation was found in the non-CFTR expressing cells HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), give credence to the results and strongly suggests a mechanism involving the chloride channel function of CFTR. Nevertheless, these results must be taken cautiously, as in our experiments cells were not treated with the CFTR activation cocktail. Although Calu-3 cells show a modest but significant CFTR activity in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>), in agreement with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Moon1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Shen1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, we cannot exclude an effect of Inh172 and Gly-101 independent of CFTR inhibition. Longer exposure (up to 24 h) of cells to Inh172 did not change the extent of LTB4 release (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). This suggests that no further synthesis of LTB4 occurs beyond 20 min of incubation. However, one would expect that LTB4 would be taken up and metabolized by cells within 24 h. The fact that LTB4 levels do not return to control values could be due to a raise in the background production as a consequence of CFTR inhibition. Hence, the link between CFTR function, cytokine and lipid mediator production opens an exciting field for future research.</p><p>We also tested whether CFTR function would be necessary for recruitment. This hypothesis was based on our recent results reporting an absence of TNF-&#x003b1;-triggered recruitment of a TRLdel non-functional mutant of CFTR in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Short incubation (20 min) of cells with Inh172 did not show any effect on relocalization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g008">Fig. 8A and 8C</xref>). The experimental conditions used &#x02013;incubation time and inhibitor concentration-, should be sufficient to assure total inhibition of CFTR chloride channel activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Ma1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. As we show the presence of a significant basal activity of CFTR in Calu-3 cells, it can be concluded that CFTR function as a chloride channel is not linked to DRM relocalization of cPLA2&#x003b1; and ANXA1. In fact, we have addressed this point by testing protein recruitment in DRM in conditions of CFTR activation with forskolin, IBMX and cAMP, and no differences were observed as compared to basal settings (data not shown). These results are in agreement with a recent report suggesting no relationship between CFTR chloride channel activity and DRM localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Wang1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, and suggest that an alternative function of CFTR may be involved. However, long term (12 hours) inhibition of CFTR significantly decreased the recruitment in DRM of both cPLA2&#x003b1; and ANXA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g008">Fig. 8B and 8C</xref>). This may be due to an insufficient amount of CFTR at the plasma membrane, since we found that long exposure of Calu-3 cells to Inh172 leads to decreased detection of CFTR. This might obey to decreased expression of CFTR, as our preliminary results show that the amount of CFTR transcripts is diminished after 18 h of treatment of Calu-3 cells by Inh172. Alternatively, the long term effect of Inh172 treatment points towards a scenario in which other functions of CFTR, distinct from the chloride channel activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Ollero1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, may play a role in TNF-&#x003b1;-induced DRM relocalization.</p><p>In both MDCK and CFBE41o cells, it has been demonstrated a link between this relocalization in DRM and the regulation of the TNF-&#x003b1;-induced signaling pathway leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and cytokine synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Dudez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Vij1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In Calu-3 cells, we have found an equivalent function, as TNF-&#x003b1; stimulates IL-8 secretion, which is inhibited by m&#x003b2;CD. In epithelial cell lines and primary cultures, longer inhibition of CFTR by Inh172 (3 to 5 days) results in increased production of IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007116-Perez1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This appears to be in disagreement with our observation that long term Inh172 prevented DRM recruitment, though the conditions and models were different.</p><p>In conclusion, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g009">Figure 9</xref>, acute TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation of Calu-3 cells leads to increased eicosanoid and IL-8 release, the latter relying on the integrity of DRM, which may contain a putative CFTR/cPLA2&#x003b1;/ANXA1/p11 complex. Both membrane destabilization by m&#x003b2;CD and CFTR inhibition, also favor eicosanoid synthesis independently of TNF-&#x003b1;, but tend to counteract the effect of this cytokine on DRM recruitment in certain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Our results show that the signaling events leading to eicosanoid and cytokine production are likely to take very different regulation routes, rendering inflammation treatment in CF especially complex. Considering our results and those of others, several questions await to be answered: (i) the nature of the sensing mechanism responsible for DRM recruitment, (ii) the role of CFTR function in recruitment, (iii) how DRM disruption and CFTR inhibition &#x02013;without the participation of TNF-&#x003b1;- can activate the eicosanoid pathway, and (iv) the functional dynamics of the putative CFTR/ANXA1/cPLA2&#x003b1;/p11 complex, maybe including TNFR1/Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007116-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).
