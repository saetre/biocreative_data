NMR studies show that a locostatin precursor binds to the conserved phosphatidylethanolamine binding pocket of RKIP. However, drug binding to the pocket does not prevent RKIP association with its inhibitory target, Raf-1, nor affect RKIP phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C at a regulatory site. Similarly, exposure of wild type, RKIP-depleted HeLa cells or RKIP-deficient (RKIP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to locostatin has no effect on MAP kinase activation. Locostatin treatment of wild type MEFs causes inhibition of cell migration following wounding. RKIP deficiency impairs migration further, indicating that RKIP protects cells against locostatin-mediated inhibition of migration.

RKIP is also missing or depleted in a number of metastatic tumors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zeng1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), and has been implicated as a metastasis suppressor through regulation of one or more of these signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Fu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-DangiGarimella1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>RKIP, also termed phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-1 (PEBP-1), is a 20&#x02013;25 kDa globular protein that belongs to the PEBP family comprised of over 400 members. The crystal structures of PEPBs from bacteria to humans have revealed a remarkably conserved ligand-binding pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zeng1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In these crystal structures, phosphorylethanolamine as well as other ions are found in the ligand-binding pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Banfield1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and the pocket has been shown to bind hydrophobic ligands such as phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Granovsky2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. While other ligands have also been reported to bind RKIP, the specific ligands that bind RKIP at physiological pH are yet to be defined.</p><p>Since RKIP regulates key physiological processes, it is of interest for therapeutic purposes to identify agents that either prevent or potentiate its ability to inhibit target proteins such as Raf-1. Recently, locostatin ((S)-(&#x0002b;)-4-benzyl-3-crotonyl-2-oxazolidinone) was shown to bind to RKIP and inhibit migration of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zhu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-McHenry1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In this cell type, RKIP depletion also inhibited migration. Consistent with a role in Raf signaling, locostatin prevented co-immunoprecipitation of RKIP with Raf-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overexpression of RKIP in these cells reversed the anti-migratory effect of locostatin and cells adopted a fibroblast-like phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zhu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, locostatin was also observed to impair migration in another cell type, human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), as well as causing these cells to have poor cell-cell adhesive properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-McHenry1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest that locostatin regulates cell migration via an RKIP-dependent, Raf/MAPK-regulated mechanism.</p><p>To address the role of RKIP in locostatin function, we analyzed locostatin interaction with RKIP and the biological consequences of locostatin treatment in both human and murine cell types. Our results suggest that locostatin interacts with the RKIP ligand-binding pocket but its effects on the cytoskeleton, mitotic spindle, and cell migration are independent of RKIP and the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade. Instead, RKIP appears to rescue cells from inhibition of migration by locostatin, raising the possibility that RKIP may function in part to sequester deleterious drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Locostatin precursor binds to the ligand binding pocket of RKIP</title><p>To define the RKIP binding site for locostatin, we analyzed their interaction by NMR. We found that locostatin, a suicide inhibitor that irreversibly attached itself to RKIP, had limited solubility, and addition of locostatin to an NMR sample containing 100 &#x000b5;M RKIP caused RKIP precipitation, rendering NMR characterization of the RKIP-locostatin complex impossible. However, a precursor of locostatin that had the same basic structure but lacked the reactive crotonyl group, (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006028-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>), was compatible with NMR studies. To detect perturbations caused by precursor binding at a single amino acid residue resolution, we obtained <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N single-quantum correlation spectra (HSQC) in which each cross peak representing a directly bonded <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N pair functions as an amide-specific probe in <sup>15</sup>N-enriched proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Shuker1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Clark1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

A comparison of HSQC spectra of wild-type RKIP in the presence or absence of the locostatin precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006028-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>) revealed that a majority of peaks affected by ligand binding were associated with the ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006028-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). The entire rim of the pocket as well as the C-terminal alpha helix were perturbed, and the strongest perturbations seem to cluster near the C-terminal alpha helix and the conserved P74 residue on the opposite face. However, there are almost no perturbations in the region of S153, the site that, when phosphorylated, prevents RKIP binding to Raf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Corbit1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Granovsky2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that a locostatin-related compound indeed binds RKIP and occupies the evolutionarily conserved ligand-binding pocket of RKIP. Given the structural similarity, these results strongly suggest that locostatin also binds to the RKIP ligand-binding pocket.</p><fig id="pone-0006028-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006028.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Binding of the locostatin precursor (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (Sigma #294640) to RKIP characterized by NMR chemical shift perturbation.</title><p>(A) Chemical structure of locostatin and its precursor (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone.

The locostatin precursor binds to RKIP's ligand-binding pocket but has no effect on Ser-153, the known site for PKC phosphorylation of RKIP that leads to dissociation of RKIP from Raf-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Corbit1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, increasing concentrations of locostatin and its precursor had very little effect on RKIP phosphorylation by PKC or RKIP/Raf-1 association. Finally, locostatin in RKIP-depleted and RKIP-deficient cell lines (HeLa and MEFs) had no effect on the EGF-induced activity of MAPK, a downstream signaling target of Raf. Furthermore, our data shows that locostatin is not specific to RKIP and has off target effects. In particular, locostatin reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton, disrupts the mitotic spindle and inhibits cell migration via a mechanism that is independent of the MAPK pathway. The protective effect of RKIP toward locostatin disruption of the cytoskeleton and inhibition of migration indicates that RKIP can influence locostatin action but not necessarily as a mediator. Our results raise the possibility that RKIP may function to trap locostatin, sequestering the toxic drug within the cell.</p><p>Our results add a different perspective to our understanding of locostatin interaction with RKIP. Previous studies have shown that locostatin prevents RKIP from co-precipitating with Raf-1. However, it is possible that the chemically reactive nature of locostatin may have caused other interactions that sterically hinder Raf access to RKIP. The deleterious effects of locostatin on cytoskeletal structures and cell migration even in cells lacking RKIP suggest that locostatin has other targets that may not have been previously identified. One puzzling observation is that locostatin inhibits spindle organization and cell migration at 20&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;M but the precursor binds to RKIP at millimolar concentrations. The reduced apparent affinity of the precursor may be attributable to the different modes of interaction between the two compounds. Locostatin acts as a suicide inhibitor that covalently attaches itself to RKIP, while the precursor lacks a chemically reactive group and binds RKIP in a reversible manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zhu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative explanation for these differences may be the size of locostatin compared to its precursor, which may also cause differences in their effects on cell migration or cytoskeleton, unfortunaletly solubility constraints for the precursor limited our study in an intact cell system. The effect of locostatin is highly concentration-dependent; just a two-fold decrease in dose caused loss of inhibition. Thus, a reduction of the effective concentration of locostatin in cells could significantly diminish its efficacy. RKIP may be present in the cell at sufficient concentrations to promote RKIP-locostatin interaction and sequester the toxic drug. Alternatively, it is also possible that RKIP plays a discrete role in cytoskeletal organization and migration that counteracts the effects of locostatin.</p><p>Cell migration is a key step underlying cellular development as well as other physiological and disease processes but whether RKIP plays a role in regulating this process is still unresolved. In some studies, RKIP overexpression inhibits migration and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Schuierer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Lee1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In other reports, RKIP promotes cell migration by downregulating E cadherin and upregulating &#x003b2;1 integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zhu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-McHenry1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study using MEFs, the presence or absence of RKIP has no effect on the rate of wound healing. The inhibitory action of locostatin on wound healing in the MEFs appears to be associated with changes in the cytoskeleton. We stained cells of varying RKIP genotypes for actin with phalloidin and observed the shortening of stress fibers within the cytoplasm and a concentration of actin around the nucleus. These were exacerbated in MEFs with depleted or absent RKIP and these cells had an increased amount of nuclear bodies with very little actin association compared to their wild-type counterparts. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of locostatin on migration and cytoskeleton was more pronounced when cells were grown to a lower density as opposed to the confluent monolayers described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-McHenry2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and we also observed interbatch variations of locostatin potency. Collectively, these discrepancies may reflect differences in cell type and/or assays and will require further analysis of multiple tissues from RKIP knockout mice.</p><p>At the doses of locostatin used in this study, we have shown that RKIP may not be the only locostatin target regulating cell migration. Previously, &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;locostatin was shown in an association assay to bind to four proteins only, one of which was RKIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Zhu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The other proteins were omega 1-1, prolyl endopeptidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1). However, they reported that ALDH1A1, which belongs to the ALDH family of enzymes and is known to clear the cell of toxic reactive oxygen species byproducts predominantly in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Ma1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, bound to locostatin but was not involved in cell migration. Interestingly, ALDH1A1 was recently shown to mediate cell invasion in pancreatic cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Kuo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that it does play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangement. Therefore, these results raise the question whether ALDH1A1 might function to bind locostatin as a toxic byproduct for its removal from the cell. If this were true, ALDH1A1 function would complement a role for RKIP in binding to locostatin to mop up the drug and subsequently dampen its anti-migratory effect on the cell.</p><p>To our knowledge this report provides the first evidence that locostatin can alter both microtubule (tubulin) and actin-based cytoskeletal elements. We observed that locostatin interferes with the cytoskeleton of MEFs since it caused the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton within the cell and localized actin to perinuclear regions. Locostatin also disrupted mitotic spindle formation in MEFs similar to the effects of Taxol. These results suggest that locostatin plays a role in altering the cytoskeleton via a yet to be defined mechanism warranting future investigation.</p><p>The present study of locostatin binding to RKIP also provides insight into the role of the pocket in Raf-1 interactions. The precursor bound directly to the pocket as shown by the perturbation of key residues in the RKIP ligand binding pocket. Although locostatin's binding to RKIP could not be examined directly by NMR due to its aggregation at high concentrations, it is likely that locostatin binds to the same RKIP pocket residues. The data show precursor binding to the RKIP pocket is not sufficient to interfere with Raf binding, consistent with the observed MAPK signaling in locostatin-treated cells. This result is in contrast to the lipid DHPE that not only binds the pocket but also inhibits RKIP-Raf association. Comparison of these different outcomes suggests that other residues and/or steric features of RKIP as well as size of the ligand are critical for Raf-1 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006028-Granovsky2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>RKIP is a negative regulator of major signaling cascades including MAPK; therefore, the identification of drugs that bind to RKIP and influence its inhibitory function could represent an important therapeutic strategy. Although locostatin is the first described drug to bind RKIP, it is likely that other chemicals also interact with RKIP via the ligand binding pocket. The studies here suggest that it may be possible to find therapeutic agents that either potentiate or suppress RKIP association with kinases and its inhibitory targets. Further studies to characterize the nature of the interactions will be needed to identify the most effective RKIP-modulating drugs. This work also suggests that RKIP might serve as a &#x0201c;reservoir&#x0201d; for hydrophobic chemicals circulating in the blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>(S)-(&#x0002b;)-4-benzyl-3-crotonyl-2-oxazolidinone (locostatin) and its precursor, (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006028-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) used in NMR studies were from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Prior to incubation at 33&#x000b0;C/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, digital images were taken at time zero followed by four, eight and 24 h. Images were taken on a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMIRB, epifluorescence) at &#x000d7;5 magnification. Wound area was determined as a percentage of the wound size at time zero and using the area of the wound as measured by Image J software (NIH). Initial wound area was standardized for all conditions tested and then changes in area over time were expressed as a percentage of the initial time zero wound.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Actin localization and mitotic spindle microscopy</title><p>MEFs of varying genotypes (as indicated) were plated at 2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells per 15 mm coverslip and grown for 48 h. Cells were treated with DMSO only (Control), or locostatin (20 or 50 &#x000b5;M), or paclitaxel (10 &#x000b5;M) for 1 to 6 h (as indicated), followed by fixation with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M Na-phosphate, pH 7.4) for 10 mins at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.1&#x00025; TritonX-100 in PBS for 2 mins at RT, and blocked with 3&#x00025; BSA in PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Alpha-tubulin was detected using a mouse antibody at 1&#x02236;50 dilution and actin was detected using Alexafluor 594-tagged phalloidin (4 U/ml) in 1&#x00025; BSA in PBS for 2 h at RT. The cells were washed 3 times with 1&#x00025; BSA in PBS, and the tubulin antibody detected with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody at 1&#x02236;100 in 1&#x00025; BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS. The second PBS wash contained 1 &#x000b5;g/ml H&#x000f6;echst 33342 to visualize DNA/chromatin. The coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield Hardset. Digital photomicrographs were captured using Openlab Darkroom (Improvision) and a Retiga 1300 color digital camera (Q Imaging).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between locostatin treated or untreated cells were compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006028.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Locostatin disrupts the mitotic spindle and chromosome organization.
