However, it remains largely unknown as to how miRNAs are integrated into the apoptotic program. Mitochondrial fission is involved in the initiation of apoptosis. It is not yet clear whether miRNAs are able to regulate mitochondrial fission. Here we report that miR-30 family members are able to regulate apoptosis by targeting the mitochondrial fission machinery. Our data show that miR-30 family members can inhibit mitochondrial fission and the consequent apoptosis. In exploring the underlying molecular mechanism, we identified that miR-30 family members can suppress p53 expression. In response to the apoptotic stimulation, the expression levels of miR-30 family members were reduced, whereas p53 was upregulated. p53 transcriptionally activated the mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1). The latter conveyed the apoptotic signal of p53 by initiating the mitochondrial fission program. miR-30 family members inhibited mitochondrial fission through suppressing the expression of p53 and its downstream target Drp1. Our data reveal a novel model in which a miRNA can regulate apoptosis through targeting the mitochondrial fission machinery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Apoptosis is related to the pathogenesis of many diseases such as tumors and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders. Apoptosis is controlled by a variety of genes, and among them a protein called &#x0201c;p53&#x0201d; has been taken as a &#x0201c;death star&#x0201d; and is involved in the initiation of apoptosis. The upstream and downstream molecules that control and convey p53 apoptotic function remain to be further identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Mitochondrial fission participates in the initiation of apoptosis and requires the activation of a protein called dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1). Our present work has revealed that miR-30 can target p53, thereby inhibiting p53 expression. Furthermore, our data show that p53 is able to induce mitochondrial fission by transcriptionally regulating Drp1. In addition, miR-30 controls Drp1 activity and the consequent apoptosis through p53. Our findings may warrant future studies to explore the therapeutic approaches for apoptosis-related diseases by targeting the miR-30-p53-Drp1 pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing.

Drp1 can convey the apoptotic signal of p53 by triggering mitochondrial fission. Thus, it appears that p53 and Drp1 constitute an axis in regulating mitochondrial fission and the consequent apoptosis. Strikingly, miR-30 members are integrated into apoptotic program by targeting this axis. Our data for the first time demonstrate that miRNAs are able to regulate mitochondrial fission machinery.</p><p>Drp1 has been shown to participate in initiating mitochondrial fission in apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. For example, staurosporin is able to trigger mitochondrial fission through Drp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000795-Wasiak1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. CD47 is an integrin-associated protein, and it induces apoptosis by causing Drp1 redistributions to mitochondria where it provokes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, production of reactive oxygen species and the disruption of the mitochondrial structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000795-Bras1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the upstream signals that control the expression of Drp1 remain largely unknown.

Thus, it appears that Drp1 expression is under the control of p53.</p><p>The patterns of mitochondrial fission in cardiomyocytes are in part different from that of other cell types. The heart function stringently depends on the ATP-generating pathway, and cardiomyocytes are therefore enriched in mitochondria. In particular, a characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they are beating even in the culture conditions. These lines of evidence may provide an explanation for the features of mitochondrial fission in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>p53 is able to utilize the transcription-dependent pathway to initiate apoptosis.

They all have the same &#x0201c;seed sequence&#x0201d; in their 5&#x02032; terminuses, and are abundantly expressed in the heart under physiological condition.
