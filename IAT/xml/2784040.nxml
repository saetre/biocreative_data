Two types of eukaryotic fatty acid synthases (FAS) can undertake this procedure, their classification depending on the organization of their respective structures. In the associative type 1 system (FASI), the enzyme activities are represented by domains on a single cytoplasmic synthase, whereas in the compartmentalized type 2 system (FASII), each of these activities is dissociated into discrete proteins. FASII has been regarded as typically prokaryotic, with the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> process having been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Rock &#x00026; Cronan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">White <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>;). On the other hand, the existence of mitochondrial FASII in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a relatively recent discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hiltunen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The precise product(s) of yeast mitochondrial FASII, other than lipoic acid, have not yet been positively identified, but it is now clear that a functional FASII is critical for the physiological activity of the organelle. A lesion in any one of the genes encoding FASII proteins results in respiratory deficiency; mutant cells fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, contain only small mitochondria, and do not form cytochrome complexes or produce lipoic acid. Although all of the yeast FASII genes have been revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hiltunen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), including <italic>ETR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Torkko <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), not much is known about their transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter controlling the expression of 2-<italic>trans</italic>-enoyl-ACP reductase Etr1p contains a nucleotide sequence situated 91 bp upstream of the ATG triplet for the translational start codon, which is almost identical to the consensus sequence for an Adr1p-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), termed type 1 upstream activation sequence UAS1, i.e. CYCCR(A/T/G)N4&#x02013;36(T/A/C)YGGRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). DNA microarray analysis performed previously on cells grown under derepressing conditions revealed that the expression of 108 genes, among them <italic>ETR1</italic>, is significantly decreased in the absence of Adr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that the <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter contains a functional UAS1 that complexes with the cognate transcription factor <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Here, the extent of the influence exerted by Adr1p on <italic>ETR1</italic> was scrutinized in wild-type and <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells using an <italic>ETR1-lacZ</italic> reporter gene, and LacZ expression was monitored in cells grown on solid and liquid media. The abundance of Etr1p in wild-type and <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells grown on glycerol medium was investigated by immunoblotting as well as reductase activity assays, and the effect of deleting <italic>ADR1</italic> on lipoic acid biosynthesis was monitored. The results are discussed in terms of a putative mechanism restricting the amount of lipoic acid in the mitochondria of wild-type cells despite the Adr1p-dependent signal to exit glucose repression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

The results, expressed in micromoles of substrate reduced per minute per milligram of protein, showed that <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells producing Etr1p from the multicopy plasmid contained an activity of 6.4&#x000b1;2.7 (mean&#x000b1;SD, <italic>n</italic>=3) whereas wild-type extracts gave rise to an activity level commensurate with 4.4&#x000b1;2.71.5 (mean&#x000b1;SD, <italic>n</italic>=3). To emulate more physiological levels of Etr1p expression, enzyme assays were also conducted on strains expressing this <italic>ETR1</italic> construct from a low-copy centromeric plasmid YCplac22-MRF1&#x02032;; however, these strains produced activities that were below the detection limit of the assay used. Hence, the absence from an enhanced level of 2-<italic>trans</italic>-enoyl-CoA reductase activity in the wild-type strain correlated with the previous immunoblotting result, indicating that Etr1p was neither more ample, nor active in the wild type compared with the situation in the <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Ample lipoic acid biosynthesis in wild-type and <italic>adr 1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells</title><p>If Etr1p is indeed present to the same extent in both strains, it follows that lipoic acid biosynthesis would also be comparable between them. Levels of lipoic acid were determined (in duplicate) in wild-type and <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells derived from two genetic backgrounds, BJ1991 and BY4741, and the values were expressed as nanograms of lipoic acid per gram wet weight of cells. The assay showed no meaningful difference in the lipoic acid content among the four strains that were examined (BJ1991 wild type, 236; BJ1991<italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394;, 237; BY4741 wild type, 229; BY4741<italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394;, 233). The significance of the combined results is discussed below.<?tlsb?></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, the issue of Etr1p abundance in yeast cells was approached using three different methods, and this revealed that despite <italic>ETR1</italic> transcription being governed by Adr1p, at the protein level, Etr1p was not more abundant in wild-type cells than in those lacking the transcription factor. The observations made here were (1) immunoblotting failed to reveal an increased abundance of Etr1p in protein extracts obtained from verifiably derepressed wild-type cells compared with those produced from the <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, (2) reductase assays relying on ectopic Etr1p expression presumed to obey Adr1p regulation detected similar levels of enzyme activity in wild-type and <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; extracts, and (3) physiological quantities of lipoic acid were comparable between the wild type and <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant using two different strain types. Because of the present results with the <italic>ETR1-lacZ</italic> reporter construct, there is no refuting the previous discovery relating to the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of Adr1p to the <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter or the observation that <italic>adr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells express <italic>ETR1</italic> less abundantly compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). However, reasonable doubt has now been cast as to whether transcriptional regulation exerted by Adr1p represents the sole &#x02013; or for that matter &#x02013; the most meaningful layer of control over Etr1p abundance in wild-type cells.</p><p>The reason why Etr1p expression is held back in the wild type is not yet clear. Nevertheless, it is attractive to speculate that this might be due to the potentially deleterious effects of abnormally high levels of lipoic acid or any other presumed FASII end products to the integrity of the mitochondrial compartment. Previous nonphysiological amplification of Etr1p levels obtained by tethering <italic>ETR1</italic> to the promoter of the oleic acid-inducible gene <italic>CTA1</italic> and growing cells on oleic acid resulted in yeast mitochondria that were both fewer in number and larger in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Torkko <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether this mitochondrial abnormality would also be reproducible in cells hosting the aforementioned plasmid expressing <italic>ETR1</italic> fitted between the native promoter and terminator sequences. A feature of Etr1p that has hitherto remained underappreciated is that it is also a nuclear protein that preferentially binds to the T-rich strand forming the core of the autonomous replication sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Yamazoe <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Hence, the inherent possibility of regulation by Etr1p of its own translation must be considered in future work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The technical contributions of Miroslawa Matz from the Medical University of Vienna (MUW) and Johanna Irrgeher from the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences in Vienna (BOKU) are acknowledged.
