Runx1 seems to promote proliferation in progenitor cells, whereas in differentiating cells it cooperates with tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate tissue-specific gene expression. For example, Runx1 cooperates with C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; to regulate hematopoiesis and osteogenesis, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Zhang2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Lian1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The dual role of Runx1 in regulating proliferation and differentiation could depend on differential interactions with protein partners, specific for each stage of cell development. The molecular mechanisms underlying such a switch in Runx1 function remain however to be deciphered.</p><p>Runx1 and CBF&#x003b2; have also been linked to skeletal muscle differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-GonzalezdeAguilar1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Zhu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and prevention of muscle wasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Wang3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In skeletal muscle, proliferation and differentiation are mutually exclusive. Indeed, skeletal muscle terminal differentiation begins with an irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle, followed by muscle-specific marker expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Buckingham1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Irreversible cell cycle exit involves a definitive silencing of proliferation-associated genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Smith1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). Terminal muscle differentiation is orchestrated by myogenic bHLH transcription factors, such as MyoD and Myf5, two master myogenic determination factors. MyoD is expressed in proliferating myoblasts, but is unable to activate its target genes even when bound to their promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Mal1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Ohkawa1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. MyoD therefore may have a repressive role at its target genes prior to initiating chromatin remodeling in differentiating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Mal1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Zhang3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-delaSerna1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In proliferating myoblasts, MyoD is associated with histone deacetylases (HDACs), the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 and heterochromatin protein HP1, and might actively inhibit expression of its target genes by inducing a local repressive chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Mal1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Fulco1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Buckingham2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that CBF associates with MyoD preferentially in proliferating myoblasts, and knockdown of Runx1 or CBF&#x003b2; accelerates cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of CBF slows cell cycle exit and delays muscle differentiation. In proliferating myoblasts, the MyoD/CBF complex contains several chromatin modifying enzymes such as HDACs. In agreement with this, when overexpressed, CBF&#x003b2; maintains histone H3 hypoacetylated, hypomethylated on lysine 4 and hypermethylated on lysine 9, on MyoD target promoters, along with HDAC1 recruitment, even in differentiation conditions. Finally, Runx1 is recruited to MyoD target genes preferentially in proliferating myoblasts, when these genes are repressed. Altogether, our data suggest that CBF transcription factor plays a pivotal role as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CBF Subunits, Runx1 and CBF&#x003b2;, Interact with MyoD in Proliferating Myoblasts</title><p>In an attempt to characterize MyoD protein partners, we carried out double-affinity purification of HA-Flag MyoD stably expressed in HeLa cells (see purification scheme on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009425.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Notably, the displacement of Runx1 in differentiating conditions is concomitant with a strong binding of MyoD to its target promoters (data not shown).</p><p>MyoD and Runx1 are both subject to post-translational modifications. Notably, MyoD is phosphorylated during the cell cycle while it becomes acetylated during differentiation. Runx1 can also be phosphorylated, acetylated or methylated, while these modifications still need to be characterized in muscle cells and during muscle differentiation. We propose that these modifications could favor or impair MyoD interaction with Runx1, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings concerning the role of CBF in the regulation of the proliferation/differentiation balance are in agreement with several reports. CBF was indeed implicated in skin epidermis and hair follicle differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Raveh1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Osorio1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Theriault1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These data support an emerging role for Runx proteins in cell fate regulation in many cell lineages. Furthermore, MyoD was also shown to regulate osteogenic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Hewitt1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that muscle satellite cells can differentiate into osteocytes or adipocytes under some conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Komaki1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009425-Asakura1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our results point to a model in which CBF and myogenic bHLH protein families could act in concert to induce cell-lineage-specific gene expression, dependent on the extra-cellular stimuli.</p><p>In summary, we propose that CBF transcription factor might participate in recruiting chromatin modifying enzymes to repress MyoD early target genes by locally inducing a repressive chromatin structure. Our data reveal a new critical role of CBF in the regulation of the balance between proliferation and differentiation in skeletal muscle cells. They also demonstrate a new mechanism of repression of differentiation genes in proliferating myoblasts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>C2C12, HEK 293 and HeLa-S3 cells were cultured under standard conditions.

Note that in muscle system, proliferation inhibition or cell cycle exit is a pre-requisite to terminal differentiation. Thus, cell cycle exit regulators, such as p21 and cycD3, are activated early during terminal differentiation. Muscle specific early markers, such as myogenin, are also activated before late muscle markers. In proliferating myoblasts, Runx1/CBF&#x003b2; (CBF dimer) proteins repress MyoD target genes, possibly via a direct interaction with MyoD. Thus, in proliferating myoblasts, CBF binds early MyoD target genes via Runx1 subunit and recruits chromatin modifying enzymes such as HDAC1, Suv39h1 and HP1. Upon triggering of terminal differentiation, CBF dissociates from the promoters and MyoD recruits activating chromatin modifying enzymes, such as HATs.
