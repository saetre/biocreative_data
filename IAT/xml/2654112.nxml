In these complex processes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a major role in chronic inflammation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) significantly in tissue remodeling. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Phosphatidyl-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol dimannosides (PIM2), an integral component of the mycobacterial envelope, triggered COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages. PIM2 triggers the activation of Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K) and Notch1 signaling leading to COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-MyD88 dependent manner. Notch1 signaling perturbations data demonstrate the involvement of the cross-talk with members of PI3K and Mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Enforced expression of the cleaved Notch1 in macrophages induces the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9. PIM2 triggered significant p65 nuclear factor -&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) nuclear translocation that was dependent on activation of PI3K or Notch1 signaling. Furthermore, COX-2 and MMP-9 expression requires Notch1 mediated recruitment of Suppressor of Hairless (CSL) and NF-&#x003ba;B to respective promoters. Inhibition of PIM2 induced COX-2 resulted in marked reduction in MMP-9 expression clearly implicating the role of COX-2 dependent signaling events in driving the MMP-9 expression. Taken together, these data implicate PI3K and Notch1 signaling as obligatory early proximal signaling events during PIM2 induced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, infects one-third of the world's population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

PIM2 treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophages triggers the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 both at mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>). PIM2 triggered expression of both COX-2 and MMP-9 transcripts as early as 2 hours, clearly peaking in their expression at 12 hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Accordingly, PIM2 induced COX-2 and MMP-9 protein expression could be detected as early as 2 hours (faint band) up to 16 hours of the post-PIM2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Further, in addition to the release of MMP-9 in the medium, experiments were carried out to explore whether PIM2 increases the cell membrane associated MMP-9 by flow cytometry. PIM2 treatment increased the percentage of cells that were stained positive for membrane MMP-9 compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Confocal microscopy studies further validated PIM2 triggered increased cell-surface association of MMP-9, where in macrophages were stained for nucleus (with nuclear staining dye, Hoechst 33342, blue), plasma membrane (with anti-MHC Class I antibody, red) and for MMP-9 (with anti-MMP-9 antibody, green). The merged images from confocal microscopic analysis revealed that MMP-9 or MHC class I do not colocalize clearly demonstrating a distinct cell-surface association of MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). COX-2 is known to regulate mycobacteria triggered MMP-9 expression and accordingly, when tested, COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 markedly blocked MMP-9 expression both at RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and protein levels clearly implicating the role COX-2 dependent signaling events in PIM2 induced MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In order to further ascertain the specific effect of NS-398, we analyzed the cell-surface expression of MMP-9 upon PIM2 treatment in the presence or absence of NS-398. Flow cytometry results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1E</xref> demonstrate that blocking COX-2 activity by NS-398 significantly reduced PIM2 triggered surface MMP-9 expression. Further, purified PGE2 increased MMP-9 expression in a dose dependent manner in mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In order to exclude the autocrine or secondary effect of macrophage produced cytokines on PIM2 triggered COX-2 and MMP-9 expression, mouse macrophages were treated with PIM2 in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. The data presented clearly demonstrates that PIM2 triggered COX-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression was not affected by cycloheximide clearly ruling out the autocrine effect of PIM2 induced cytokines on COX-2 and MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s004">Figure S4A&#x02013;B</xref>). However, interestingly, cycloheximide augmented PIM2 triggered COX-2 mRNA expression. Extensive literature survey suggests that the regulation of COX-2 gene is complex and transcription of COX-2 is reported to vary across the cell types as well as among responses of a given cell type to variety of stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Dixon1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Newton1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

In these experiments, treatment with the GSI-I resulted in a loss of processed Notch1-NICD (data not shown), which preceded the induction of COX-2 and MMP-9 expression.

Further, siRNA mediated inhibition of Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s008">Figure S8B</xref>) resulted in marked reduction in COX-2 and MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g003">Figure 3G</xref>).

In this perspective, a potential role of CSL/RBP-Jk in Notch1 induced expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 was investigated. The activation of Notch target genes often involves interaction of NICD with DNA binding protein, CSL/RBP-Jk. In order to address the effect of Notch1 signaling on CSL/RBP-Jk activation, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with Hes1-Luc, followed by treatment with PIM2 either in the presence or absence of GSI-I, a Notch1 activation inhibitor. The data presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s009">Figure S9</xref> demonstrates that the inhibition of Notch1 signaling significantly blocks the CSL/RBP-Jk dependent activation of Notch target gene, Hes1 gene transcription.

In this context, we were interested in assessing whether PIM2 triggers activation of MAPK, in addition to PI3K and Notch signaling. Hence, when tested, only U0126 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), but not SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) reduced PIM2 triggered COX-2 and MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

Furthermore, exposure of mouse peritoneal macrophages to PIM2 resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of Raf-1, one of the target proteins for Ras, and ERK1/2 apparent within minutes of PIM2 treatment of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the COX-2 or MMP-9 expression level remained unperturbed when PIM2 triggered activation of p38 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, in order to delineate whether activation of ERK1/2 or Raf-1 by PIM2 involves PI3 Kinase or Notch1 signaling, the phospshorylation of ERK1/2 or Raf-1 by PIM2 was assessed in the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K or GSI-I, &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor.

In this context, inflammatory responses during formation of granuloma in which mycobacteria resides is often associated with tissue remodeling and breakdown of the extracellular matrix. In these complex processes, both COX-2 and MMP-9 play a major role in chronic inflammation in general and MMP-9 significantly in tissue remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases in general can degrade most of the components of ECM and among MMP's, MMP-9 is suggested to have important role in the pathogenesis of the tuberculosis disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Price1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Taylor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. During mycobacteria infection, MMP-9 induction has been implicated in cells recruitment, representing as an obligatory step in the formation of granuloma.

For an example, in case of tuberculous meningitis, increased MMP-9 expression is linked to tissue destruction, a pathological hallmark of inflammatory host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Price1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Lee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, evidences suggest that COX-2 dependent PGE2 regulates macrophage MMP-9 expression and COX-2 expression is induced in response to a variety of inflammatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Pavlovic1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current study attempts to delineate the signaling events that are involved in PIM2 mediated expression of COX-2 and MMP-9. We show that PIM2, an integral component of the mycobacterial envelope, induces the expression of MMP-9 as well as COX-2 in macrophages. We present the evidence that PIM2 triggered expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 involves the activation of PI3K and Notch1 signaling. Perturbation of Notch1 signaling by siRNA to Notch1 or pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 signaling or soluble form of Jagged1, which is suggested to exert dominant-negative effect on Notch1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Vas1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Small1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, markedly inhibited PIM2 triggered Notch1 signaling as well as COX-2 and MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g004">4</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of COX-2 expression results in marked reduction in PIM2 triggered MMP-9 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g001">Figure 1</xref>) clearly implicating the suggested role of COX-2 dependent signaling events in driving the MMP-9 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Basu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, enforced expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) in RAW 264.7 macrophages induces the expression of both COX-2 and MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, our studies suggest that PI3K and Notch1 signaling contributes as an obligatory early proximal signaling event during PIM2 induced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages. It is well known that TLRs significantly participate in wide variety of immune responses and are suggested to play pivotal role in the activation of inflammatory immune responses by mycobacteria. In this context, knockdown of MyD88, a downstream adaptor molecule in TLR signaling pathways resulted in inhibition of the expression and nuclear localization of Notch1 as well as nuclear expression of Hes1, a marker gene for Notch1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The perturbation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 dominant-negative construct also resulted in substantial reduction in Hes1 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, our recent findings suggest that <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG whole bacilli upregulates Notch1 and activates Notch1 signaling pathway in a TLR2-MyD88 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Narayana1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Our report clearly suggested that TLR2 can physically associate with both PI3K and Notch1, which implicates TLR2 triggering by <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG in the activation of PI3K and Notch1. In this context, while PIM2 is suggested to stimulate murine and human macrophages in a TLR2 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Gilleron3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that PIM2 might trigger Notch1 signaling by interaction with TLR2. However, further investigations are required to expand the understanding of the above finding.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the involvement of cross-talk between Notch and PI3K-AKT signaling cascades have been attributed to the overall cellular responses in diverse sets of cell types including CHO cells, primary T-cells and hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-McKenzie1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, data suggesting the physical association of Notch1 with p56lck and PI3K in primary T cells as well as Notch mediated activation of the MAPK in many tumors suggest that regulation of PI3K-AKT -MAPK axis may be important component for Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, transformation of many tumors by Notch requires active signals from the ERK/MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways along with Ras pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Fitzgerald1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, these reports have suggested involvement of PI3K-AKT, ERK 1/2, and NF-&#x003ba;B, as possible downstream regulators of Notch signaling. In agreement with these reported findings, the inhibition of Notch1 or PI3K signaling resulted in significant decrease in phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g002">Figure 2</xref>), Raf-1 and ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6</xref>) clearly implicating PIM2 mediated activation as well as possible cross-interactions between Notch, PI3K and Ras/MAPK signaling molecules. Moreover, our data from inhibition of Notch1 or PI3K signaling intermediates by pharmacological inhibitors or dominant negative constructs suggest the possible positive regulation of PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathway by Notch1. Further, inhibition of PIM2 synthesis markedly compromises <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG ability to trigger Notch1 or COX-2 or MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s013">Figure S13</xref>). These results clearly indicate that PIM2 is an important cell wall antigen that contributes to <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG ability to trigger Notch signaling in macrophages.</p><p>Additionally, PIM2 treatment increases the surface expression of CD44 which associates with enhanced cell-surface MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g007">Figure 7</xref>). CD44 is shown to associate with a proteolytic form of MMP-9 on the surface of various tumor cells (47). Further, disruption of CD44/MMP-9 cluster formation had resulted in reduction of tumor invasiveness <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Yu2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Desai1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In this perspective, it had been postulated that CD44/MMP-9 complex formation on the cell surface might signify as a novel motility-enhancing signal for tumor cells which eventually contributes their invasiveness. Similar to results with MMP-9 expression, inhibitors of PI3K or Notch1 activation, LY294002 (PI3K) or GSI-I abrogated PIM2 mediated expression of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The PI3K or Notch1 signaling mediated activation of a given target gene often requires recruitment of transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Bray1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though, the details of the PI3K mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B are reported, molecular understanding of precise interaction between Notch and NF-&#x003ba;B are not clear. However, recent reports suggest that Notch1 in addition through cross-talk with PI3K or MAPK, may strongly activate NF-&#x003ba;B (p100/p52) expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Oswald1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In this perspective, PIM2 triggered significant p65 NF-&#x003ba;B translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6</xref>) in a Notch-PI3K-MAPK dependent manner. In order to further validate the role of Notch and NF-&#x003ba;B, bioinformatics analysis of mouse COX-2 and MMP-9 promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Cartharius1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> was carried out and analysis predicted the binding site for NF-&#x003ba;B between &#x02212;507 to &#x02212;519 bp and for RBP-Jk between &#x02212;717 to &#x02212;731 bp relative to the &#x0002b;1 transcription start site for COX-2 promoter. In this context, Chromatin immuno precipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out and the data clearly suggested that PIM2 treatment increased binding of NF-&#x003ba;B and RBP-Jk to COX-2 and MMP-9 promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004911.s015">Figure S15</xref> and data not shown). These results further support the earlier observation that both RBP-Jk/CSL and NF-&#x003ba;B exerted positive regulatory roles during PIM2 induced COX-2 and MMP-9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g003">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004911-g006">Figure 6E&#x02013;F</xref>). Our data from experiments on PIM2 induced nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B from cytosol in the presence of Notch or PI3K or MAPK activation inhibitors clearly suggest the possibility of frequent cross-talk between the Notch1 and PI3K-MAPK signaling pathways.

Confocal images were taken on Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope using plan &#x02013;Apochromat 63X /1.4 oil DIC objective and Argon/2 458, 477, 488, 514 nm and HeNe 543 lasers. During colocalization studies, a series of images at an interval of 0.37-mm focal planes were collected into a z-stack to ascertain the actual colocalization. Every single layer of z-stack was subjected to image analysis by LSM 5 image examiner software to visualize and locate protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Flow cytometry analysis</title><p>The cells were washed with PBS and were fixed in 0.1&#x00025; formaldehyde. In order to avoid nonspecific binding, cells were incubated with 0.5 &#x000b5;g Fc blocker (per 10<sup>6</sup> cells) for 30 minutes on ice followed by staining with rabbit anti-mouse MMP-9. This was followed by staining with flouro isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy2 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Similarly, cells were labeled with rat anti-mouse CD44 antibody followed by Cy5 conjugated anti-rat IgG and were analyzed using FACScan (BD Biosciences, USA). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by their forward and side-way light-scattering properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Inhibition of PIM2 synthesis in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG</title><p><italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Pasteur 1173P2 was grown to mid log phase in Souton's medium and treated with D- Mannosamine (ManN) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Cultures were centrifuged after 24 h and aliquots were frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. Representative vials were thawed and enumerated for viable colony forming unit on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco, USA) supplemented with OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase). For macrophage infections, single cell suspension of bacteria were obtained after short pulses of sonication and macrophages were infected at MOI of 1&#x02236;1. Further, in experiments with D-mannosamine, a tested concentration was chosen after careful titration experiments assessing the viability (CFU) of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. The inhibition of PIM2 synthesis was confirmed by the Thin-Layer chromatography of cell wall lipids as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004911-Rojas1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, Bacilli were washed extensively in 0.05&#x00025; Tween 80/PBS followed by a detergent-free wash before extraction in chloroform and methanol. The bacterial pellet was extracted twice in chloroform/methanol (2&#x02236;1 v/v) with sonication. Bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation, and hydrophilic contaminants were removed using a Folch wash. TLC analysis of lipids was performed on aluminum backed plates of silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Germany). The solvent used was CHCl<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>OH/NH<sub>4</sub>OH/H<sub>2</sub>O (65&#x02236;24&#x02236;0.4&#x02236;3.6 v/v). Visualization of resolved lipids was achieved with a charring spray (10&#x00025; CuSO4 in 8&#x00025; phosphoric acid) and heating at 110&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, USA with modifications. Peritoneal macrophages were left untreated or treated with PIM2 for 6 h as in the case of NF-&#x003ba;B or 12 h for CSL/RBP-Jk. The cells were fixed with 1.42&#x00025; formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by inactivation of formaldehyde with addition of 125 mM glycine. Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using anti NF-&#x003ba;B for NF-&#x003ba;B ChIP or anti-Notch1 antibody for RBP-Jk ChIP. Purified DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR by using the SYBR Green method (Finnzymes). Regions with the NF-&#x003ba;B and RBP-Jk binding site in the mouse COX-2 promoter were amplified using primer pairs, NF-&#x003ba;B forward, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ttaaccggtagctgtgtgcgt- 3&#x02032;</named-content>, reverse, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-tctccggtttcctcccagt-3&#x02032;</named-content>; and RBP-Jk forward, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-tcccgtgaaaagagttgctga-3&#x02032;</named-content>, reverse, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ttcatggaactaccctccgg- 3&#x02032;</named-content>.
