We report that expression only of Rrp44 lacking 3&#x02032;-exonuclease activity (Rrp44-exo) supports growth in S288c-related strains (BY4741). In BY4741, <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> was synthetic-lethal with loss of the cytoplasmic 5&#x02032;-exonuclease Xrn1, indicating block of mRNA turnover, but not with loss of the nuclear 3&#x02032;-exonuclease Rrp6. The RNA processing phenotype of <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> was milder than that seen on Rrp44 depletion, indicating that Rrp44-exo retains important functions. Recombinant Rrp44 was shown to possess manganese-dependent endonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic> that was abolished by four point mutations in the putative metal binding residues of its N-terminal PIN domain. Rrp44 lacking both exonuclease and endonuclease activity failed to support growth in strains depleted of endogenous Rrp44. Strains expressing Rrp44-exo and Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo exhibited different RNA processing patterns <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting Rrp44-dependent endonucleolytic cleavages in the 5&#x02032;-ETS and ITS2 regions of the pre-rRNA. Finally, the N-terminal PIN domain was shown to be necessary and sufficient for association with the core exosome, indicating its dual function as a nuclease and structural element.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The exosome complex is implicated in many RNA processing and degradation activities. Ten &#x02018;core&#x02019; exosome components are shared between the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of the complex, and all of these are essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The nuclear exosome participates in many RNA degradation and surveillance pathways, as well as processing the precursors to the 5.8S rRNA and other stable RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The cytoplasmic exosome functions in mRNA degradation, participating in general mRNA turnover and several activated decay and surveillance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Structural and functional analyses indicate that Rrp44 (Dis3) is the only catalytically active 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease in the yeast exosome core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>), whereas the nuclear exosome is associated with a second active nuclease (Rrp6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Rrp44 is related to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase R, a member of the RNase II (RNase B) family of hydrolytic exonucleases. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, Rrp44 has an N-terminal PIN-domain (<underline>Pi</underline>lT <underline>N</underline>-terminus&#x02014;derived from the name of an <italic>E. coli</italic> protein implicated in pilus formation), which is not shared with RNase R or RNase II. Recent studies reported endonuclease activity associated with the PIN-domains of human Smg6 and yeast Swt1, both of which are implicated in mRNA surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and the PIN domain protein Nob1 was predicted to be a pre-rRNA endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The PIN domain in Rrp44 is followed by a putative RNA-binding, cold-shock domain (CSD), for which functional analyses have not yet been reported. The exonuclease activity resides in the RNB domain and this is abolished by the point mutation D<sub>551</sub>N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A C-terminal S1 RNA-binding domain is also important for substrate binding and for activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this is impaired by the G<sub>916</sub>E mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of yeast strains expressing Rrp44-exo.

This strain was transformed with plasmids expressing either WT-Rrp44 or Rrp44 lacking exonuclease activity (Rrp44-exo, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) under the control of the endogenous <italic>RRP44</italic> promoter, or with the empty cloning vector (pRS316). To allow purification of exosome complexes to test for <italic>in vitro</italic> exonuclease activity, the plasmid-expressed proteins also carried C-terminal fusions with a tag containing the streptavidin-binding peptide, TEV cleavage site and two copies of the z-domain of protein A (szz-tag; see Materials and methods section and Table S1).</p><p>The growth of individual transformants was then analyzed under repressive conditions on SD -His/-Ura medium at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Growth of the strain carrying the empty vector was progressively reduced after transfer to glucose. In contrast, growth was fully restored by expression of WT Rrp44. A reduced rate of growth was maintained by expression of the catalytically inactive Rrp44-exo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). After prolonged growth in glucose medium (24 h), the doubling time of strains expressing only Rrp44-exo was &#x0223c;3 h when compared to the WT doubling time of &#x0223c;2 h (data not shown). This indicates that the essential function of Rrp44 <italic>in vivo</italic> does not require its exonuclease activity.</p><p>Genetic depletion of Rrp44 or any other core exosome component results in characteristic defects in 3&#x02032;-maturation of the 5.8S rRNA from the 7S pre-rRNA and in degradation of the excised 5&#x02032;-external transcribed spacer region (5&#x02032;-ETS) of the pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>).

Expression of only Rrp44-exo resulted in the accumulation of truncated 5S rRNA (labeled as 5S*) and the 7S pre-rRNA plus truncated fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 4). Accumulation of longer 3&#x02032;-extended 5.8S species was greater in the Rrp44-depleted strain, whereas the shortened 6S pre-rRNA was reduced, indicating a greater inhibition of processing following depletion of Rrp44 than in the <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> strain. Accumulation of the full length 5&#x02032;-ETS was greater in the Rrp44-depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 6) than in the <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 4), which also showed prominent 5&#x02032;-ETS fragments that were absent from the Rrp44-depleted strain. These observations are consistent with residual degradation activity associated with Rrp44-exo.</p><p>Rrp44-depleted strains also exhibit defects at earlier steps in pre-rRNA maturation on the pathway of 18S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These effects are likely to be indirect, since 18S rRNA synthesis involves only endonuclease activities, and similar defects are seen in many strains with late-acting defects in the 25S and 5.8S rRNA synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Northern analyses of high molecular weight pre-rRNA precursors (35S, 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA and the aberrant 23S RNA) showed only very modest defects in the strain expressing Rrp44-exo (Figure S1, and see below).</p><p>The exonuclease activity of Rrp44 appears to play an important role in maturation of the 7S pre-rRNA, and in degradation of the excised 5&#x02032;-ETS pre-rRNA region and truncated 5S rRNA. In contrast, the exonuclease activity is less required for the, presumably indirect, role of Rrp44 in early pre-rRNA processing steps. However, strains lacking the exonuclease activity of Rrp44 are viable and showed less RNA processing defects than the Rrp44-depleted strain on the pre-rRNA substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of the exonuclease activity of Rrp44 has additive effects with loss of Rrp6</title><p>Constructs expressed under the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter are never fully repressed, and so a low level of Rrp44 will always be expressed in a <italic>GAL::rrp44</italic> strain.

Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), WT Rrp44 (lane 2) exhibited strong 3&#x02032;-exonucleolytic activity in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, completely degrading the substrate to a 4 nt product.

However, in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, both WT and mutant proteins cleaved the RNA, generating very similar degradation products (lanes 5 and 6). From these results, we concluded that Rrp44 harbors two distinct ribonuclease activities, which respond differently to Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.

Rrp44-exo generated a ladder of degradation intermediates from both substrates in the absence of added Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions (lanes 2 and 6), likely due to co-purification of a low level of Mn<sup>2+</sup> bound to the recombinant protein, but the degradation activity was strongly stimulated in the presence of added Mn<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 4 and 8). The ability of the Rrp44-exo mutant to generate degradation intermediates from both 3&#x02032;-labeled and 5&#x02032;-labeled substrates shows that it either carries both 5&#x02032;-exonuclease and 3&#x02032;-exonuclease activities or, more likely, possesses an endonuclease activity.</p><p>To assess if this potential endonuclease activity was associated with the PIN domain of Rrp44, point mutations were introduced at each of the four conserved active-site amino acids (D<sub>91</sub>N, E<sub>120</sub>Q, D<sub>171</sub>N, D<sub>198</sub>N), to create the Rrp44-endo mutant. In addition, the Rrp44-exo mutation was combined with the four PIN-domain mutations (Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo) and with a point mutation in the S1 RNA-binding domain (Rrp44-exo-S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> nuclease assays were performed using recombinant, GST-tagged proteins and a 5&#x02032;-labeled substrate RNA derived from the 3&#x02032; region of the mouse 5.8S rRNA, which has a well defined, stable terminal stem structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). WT Rrp44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 2) partially degraded the substrate to a 10 nt product. In contrast, Rrp44-exo generated a set of fragments with end-points in the loop-region of the substrate RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 3). These fragments were not generated by either the Rrp44-endo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 4) or Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo proteins (lane 5), indicating that their formation required a functional PIN domain. Rrp44-exo-S1 did generate the loop fragments, but lacked the major 10 nt product, suggesting that S1 RNA-binding activity might be more important for the exonuclease activity of Rrp44 than for endonuclease activity. A prominent product that is truncated by &#x0223c;10 nt was detected in some samples. This appears to be due to a contaminating nuclease that is associated with purification of GST-fusion constructs from <italic>E. coli</italic>, as the same band was seen in analyses of other fusion proteins (data not shown). The truncated fragment appears to be very susceptible to degradation by the exonuclease activity of Rrp44, giving rise to the observed variations in signal. The PIN domain alone did not show <italic>in vitro</italic> activity. However, when purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> the PIN domain co-purified, apparently stoichiometrically, with the bacterial chaperone GroEL (indicated with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B), strongly indicating that it is largely misfolded.

In the <italic>GAL::rrp44</italic> strain, expression of Rrp44-endo clearly supported growth when WT Rrp44 was depleted by growth on glucose medium. In contrast, expression of Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo failed to support growth (data not shown), indicating that the endonuclease and exonuclease activities of Rrp44 share some redundant essential function.

A low number of <italic>rrp44&#x00394;</italic> strains complemented by the plasmid expressing Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo could be isolated by plasmid shuffle (data not shown).

These showed that the 5&#x02032;-extended forms of the 5.8S rRNA and truncated forms of the 5&#x02032;-ETS observed in strains expressing Rrp44-exo were suppressed in the <italic>rrp44-endo</italic> strain and altered in the <italic>rrp44-endo</italic>&#x02013;<italic>exo</italic> strain. In particular, 5&#x02032;-ETS fragments accumulating in the <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 4) were clearly reduced in strains expressing Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 8).

The PIN domain alone (PIN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, lane 5) gave a lower signal, but this clearly was above the GST background.

In the event, expression of full-length Ssd1 failed to suppress the sensitivity of W303 to the loss of Rrp44 exonuclease activity.</p><p>The essential function of Rrp44 might be the maintenance of the structure of the exosome complex or binding to either substrates or cofactors. Recombinant GST-Rrp44-exo protein was able to bind to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and the yeast exosome containing Rrp44-exo might thus still be able to recruit RNAs that are normally substrates for Rrp44. Substrates recognized and bound by Rrp44-exo might then be degraded by other nucleases. Loss of Rrp44 exonucleolytic activity is synthetic lethal (sl) with deletion of the nonessential cytoplasmic 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease Xrn1, due to the synergistic inhibition of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This indicates that the <italic>rrp44-exo</italic> mutation blocked the 3&#x02032; degradation of at least some mRNA species <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, BY4741 strains expressing only the Rrp44-exo mutant were viable in the absence of the other exosome-associated 3&#x02032;-exonuclease Rrp6. This finding differs from previous observations made in a W303-related strain (BMA 36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), presumably reflecting the differences in strain background. Recent analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) indicate that functional interactions between Rrp6 and Rrp44 are important for only a subset of Rrp6 substrates.</p><p>The exonuclease activities of the exosome in the nucleus (Rrp44 and Rrp6) likely form part of a redundant network of 3&#x02032;-exonucleases, including the proteins of the Rex family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), which could, for instance, be needed to fine-tune the balance between pre-ribosomal RNA processing and decay. In the cytoplasm, such a fine balance might not be necessary, since RNA decay is the predominant pathway.</p><p>The differences in RNA processing phenotypes between strains depleted of Rrp44 and those expressing Rrp44-exo, suggested that Rrp44 might harbor additional activities. Recent reports of manganese-dependent endonuclease activities associated with other PIN-domain proteins prompted us to determine whether this might also be the case for Rrp44. The endonuclease activity of Rrp44 failed to be observed in previous analyses, probably because in the absence of manganese the exonuclease activity is much more prominent. The concentrations of 0.5 or 5 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> that were used to inhibit exonuclease activity and stimulate endonuclease activity of Rrp44 are much greater than the physiological concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It seems likely that the <italic>in vivo</italic> endonuclease activity of Rrp44 is stimulated by one or more of the many exosome cofactors, allowing it to act at lower Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. However, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the PIN domain primarily functions in RNA substrate binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, with a non-physiological cleavage activity that is induced by high Mn<sup>2+</sup> levels <italic>in vitro</italic>. The range of <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates for the activity of the Rrp44 PIN domain remains unclear but comparison of the RNA processing phenotypes of strain expressing Rrp44-exo and Rrp44-endo&#x02013;exo strongly indicates that these are likely to include the 5&#x02032;-ETS region of the pre-rRNA. However, the putative target sites do not appear to correspond to the known A<sub>0</sub> cleavage at position +470. This suggests that the activity of the Rrp44 PIN domain does not act during pre-rRNA maturation, but rather participates in the degradation of the excised spacer region following A<sub>0</sub> cleavage. Several early acting ribosome synthesis factors are released from the pre-ribosomes in association with the excised 5&#x02032;-ETS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Very efficient degradation of the 5&#x02032;-ETS is therefore likely to be important for the release and recycling of ribosome synthesis factors.</p><p>Analyses <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that the PIN domain of Rrp44 was both necessary and sufficient for association with the 9 subunit exosome core structure. Previous EM analyses indicated that both the Rrp44 N-terminus (where the PIN domain is located) and the C-terminal region form interactions with the exosome core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The data presented here indicate that the N-terminal interactions are more crucial for stable binding. Alterations in the relative positions of the N- and C-terminal regions of Rrp44 seen on association with the core exosome are proposed to be crucial for regulation of its exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), and interactions between the C-terminal region of Rrp44 and the exosome may play an important role in this regulation.</p><p>Within Rrp44, the PIN domain appears to have a dual role, acting to link Rrp44 to the remainder of the exosome in addition to its apparent cleavage activity. This evolution of the region therefore appears to play a crucial part in the functional differences between bacterial RNase R and eukaryotic Rrp44. The structure of the exosome core is related to that of bacterial PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, PNPase can associate with RNase E and other proteins in the degradosome complex, that shows both 3&#x02032;-exonuclease and endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The finding that the eukaryotic exosome also possesses both 3&#x02032;-exonuclease and endonuclease activity underlines the conservation of the RNA processing machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1020/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (to D.T.) and BBSRC (to J.D.B.), a long-term HFSP fellowship (to C.S.) and a PhD studentship from the BBSRC (to E.L.).
