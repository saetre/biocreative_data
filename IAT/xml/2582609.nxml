About half of the patients with CdLS carry mutations in the <italic>NIPBL</italic> gene encoding the NIPBL protein, a subunit of the Cohesin loading complex. Recent studies show association of Cohesin with chromatin-remodeling complexes, either by establishing cohesion or by recruiting Cohesin to specific chromosome locations. In yeast two-hybrid assays, we identified an interaction of NIPBL with the histone deacetylases -1 and -3. These interactions were confirmed in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation and a critical region for interaction was defined to a stretch of 163 amino acids of a highly conserved region of NIPBL, which is mutated in patients with CdLS. Utilizing reporter gene assays, we could show that NIPBL fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) represses promoter activity via the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Interestingly, this effect is dramatically reduced by both <italic>NIPBL</italic> missense mutations identified in CdLS and by chemical inhibition of the histone deacetylases. Our data are the first to indicate a molecular and functional connection of NIPBL with chromatin-remodeling processes via the direct interaction with histone deacetylases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Following replication, sister chromatids are attached to each other prior to segregation in mitosis and meiosis. This association, called sister chromatid cohesion (SCC), depends on Cohesin, a highly conserved complex of proteins. This complex consists of at least four subunits, the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins SMC1 and SMC3, a member of the kleisin protein family RAD21 and SCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Cohesins are thought to form a ring structure that surrounds the replicated sister chromatids, with SMC1 and SMC3 creating a V-shaped heterodimer, bridged by RAD21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). SCC3 binds to this complex via a C-terminal domain of RAD21. The association of Cohesin complexes with chromatin appears to be facilitated by two additional proteins, SCC2 and SCC4.</p><p>Recently, a growing number of Cohesins and its regulatory proteins have been associated with human developmental disorders. Mutations in <italic>ESCO2</italic>, which encodes a factor essential for the establishment of SCC, result in Roberts syndrome and SC phocomelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, about 50% of patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) have mutations in the <italic>NIPBL</italic> gene, the human homolog of the <italic>Drosophila Nipped-B</italic> and yeast <italic>Scc2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Recently, the first missense mutations in <italic>SMC1A</italic> and <italic>SMC3</italic> were identified in patients with mild variants of CdLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although Cohesins were initially identified for their role in SCC, <italic>Drosphila</italic> Nipped-B was isolated as a protein that facilitates transcriptional regulation by remote enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Whether SCC2-like proteins have independent functions in cohesion and transcription, or whether these functions are interconnected remains unclear.</p><p>Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that SCC correlates with chromatin remodeling. The Cohesin's SMC1, SMC3 and Scc1/RAD21 have been found to copurify with a chromatin-remodeling complex containing the ATPase SNF2h, presumably due to a direct interaction between Cohesins and chromatin-remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Additional links are suggested by mutations of the chromatin-remodeling factors RSC and INO80 that result in defects in SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying CdLS, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify binding proteins of NIPBL. We identified a specific interaction of NIPBL with the histone deacetylases-1 and -3 (HDAC1 and HDAC3) that was verified by coimmunoprecipitation in eukaryotic cells. Luciferase reporter gene assays and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses support the model that NIPBL may initiate chromatin-remodeling processes through the recruitment of these HDACs. Furthermore, we could show that missense mutations identified in patients with CdLS influence the interaction of NIPBL with histone deacetylases and result in a decreased activity of this functional interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid assay</title><p>Two overlapping fragments (fragment N, aa 1117&#x02013;1899 and fragment C, aa 1838&#x02013;2597) representing the highly conserved region of NIPBL were used as yeast two-hybrid baits. These fragments were PCR-amplified (primers available upon request) from a marathon-ready human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech-Takara, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France). Fragments were inserted into the Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid Sytem 3 (Clontech-Takara) pGBKT7 plasmid. Yeast cells were transformed according to the Matchmaker 3 manual and bait expression was confirmed by western blotting using an anti-GAL4-DBD antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Human chondrocyte and human ovary cDNA prey libraries were screened according to the manufacturer's protocol (Matchmaker 3, Clontech-Takara). Plasmids from clones obtained under stringent selection were isolated and sequenced. Identity was determined using BlastN and BlastP homology searches. All constructs used were verified by sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Galactosidase assay</title><p>Liquid &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed as per the manufacturer (Matchmaker 3, Clontech). Briefly, NIPBL-subfragments 4&#x02013;8 were generated from fragment C and inserted into the pGBKT7 plasmid. Full-length HDAC1, HDAC3 and HDAC6 were amplified from human fetal brain cDNA (HDAC1) or full-length ORFs containing plasmids (InvivoGen, San Diego, USA), restriction sites added by PCR and inserted into the pGADT7 plasmid (Clontech-Takara). Yeast cells (AH109) were cotransformed with the NIPBL-fragments 4&#x02013;8 and all HDAC containing plasmids, respectively. Proper expression was verified by western blotting using specific anti-GAL4-DBD and anti-GAL4-AD antibodies (Santa Cruz). The overnight cultures were measured at 600 nm, cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer Z (60 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO4, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). An aliquot (<italic>V</italic>) was taken and <italic>o</italic>-nitrophenyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside was added. After a defined incubation period (<italic>t</italic>) reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The solutions were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation and the OD was measured at 420 nm. The &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (U) was calculated by the following equation: U = 1000 &#x000d7; OD<sub>400</sub>/(<italic>t</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>V</italic> &#x000d7; OD<sub>600</sub>). All &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities (U) listed represent the result of at least six independent yeast transformants.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitations</title><p>A volume containing 1 mg of total protein extracts from HeLa cells was dissolved in 1 ml of incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 75 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>) and Proteinase Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). The solutions were precleared with 30 &#x000b5;l of preequilibrated Protein G PLUS/Protein A-Agar Suspension (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) for 60 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 &#x000b5;l of anti-delangin (anti-NIPBL) antibody (Absea, Beijing, China) for 100 min and 60 &#x000b5;l of preequilibrated A/G-suspension slurry for 12&#x02013;16 h. The loaded suspensions were precipitated, washed three to five times with incubation buffer and resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer [62 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% (w/v) bromophenol blue]. All incubations were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C with constant motion using an end-over-end rotor. Precipitates were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blotting using the anti-delangin (Absea), anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz) and anti-HDAC3 antibodies (Santa Cruz).</p></sec><sec><title>Reporter gene assays</title><p>NIPBL fragment 4 was inserted into a pcDNA-GAL4-DBD expression plasmid to obtain the GAL4-NIPBL fusion construct. Full-length HDAC1 was amplified and inserted into pcDNA3.1. HDAC3 and HDAC6 expression plasmids were obtained from InvivoGen. The GAL4-TATA-Luc and the GAL4-<italic>tk</italic>-Luc reporters have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Transient transfection assays of COS-7 and CHO cells were performed in 96 half-area well plates (Corning, Munich, Germany) with Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The phRG-TK Renilla luciferase expression vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was used as a transfection control. Activity of Firefly and Renilla luciferase was measured after 48 h incubation with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a GeniosPro Luminometer (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). All measurements were performed in triplicates. Relative luciferase activity was determined as rate of the average firefly:renilla luciferase activity. To inhibit histone deacetylases, cells were treated with 100 nM Trichostatin A (Merck) and 5 &#x000b5;M Sodium butyrate (Sigma, Taufkirchen Germany), respectively for 24 h prior to measurement. DMSO was used as negative control for Trichostatin A treated cells. All assays had a minimum of six replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays</title><p>As adapted from Wei <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), COS7 cells were transfected with GAL4-<italic>tk</italic>-reporter and either the NIPBL-fragment4 GAL4-DBD or the empty GAL4-DBD expression plasmids as described. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). Proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde to a 1% final concentration. Chromatin was incubated with anti-acetylated histone 3, anti-HDAC1 or anti-HDAC3 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology; Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Precipitated immunecomplexes were treated with proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction for PCR detection with primers flanking the <italic>tk</italic> promoter region of the GAL4-<italic>tk</italic>-luc reporter (5&#x02032;-agcgtcttgtcattggcg-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-ttaagcgggtcgctgcag-3&#x02032;). Amplified fragments (102 bp) were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.

In order to identify direct binding proteins of NIPBL, we used the GAL4-Matchmaker III yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech). <italic>In silico</italic> analyzes of the NIPBL protein predict multiple HEAT-repeats, a glutamine-rich region in the N-terminal part and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, at least two different isoforms of NIPBL exist in humans; a small isoform [2697 amino acids (aa) and a calculated molecular weight (mw) of 304 kDa], and a large isoform (2804 aa and mw 316 kDa). Because of the large protein size, we were unable to express full-length <italic>NIPBL</italic> in yeast cells and created two overlapping fragments (fragment N and fragment C). The latter includes the C-terminal half of NIPBL, which is highly conserved during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Both fragments were used to screen human chondrocyte and ovary libraries. Using fragment C as bait, we isolated more than 250 clones encoding 56 putative NIPBL-binding proteins, which are currently under investigation. Five of these clones encoded three overlapping fragments of the histone deacetylases 1 (HDAC1). Three clones coded for the entire open reading frame of the histone deacetylases 3 (HDAC3), two of which are independent and only differ in the length of the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Predicted structure of the entire NIPBL protein and all fragments used.

Fragments 4&#x02013;8 represent overlapping sub-fragments of fragment C and were used in &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays to narrow down the smallest region necessary for the interaction of NIPBL with HDAC1 and HDAC3. The expression of all constructs was verified by the use of an anti-GAL4-DBD antibody.

As additional control, interaction of HDAC6 with any of the fragments used could be excluded (columns 3 and 6). (<bold>D</bold>) The two human missense mutations R1856G and R1895T were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and the binding capacities to HDAC1 and HDAC3 were analyzed and compared to the wild-type protein, respectively. While both amino acid substitutions do not alter the binding capacities of NIPBL to HDAC1 (compare columns 1 with 2 and 3), the interaction with HDAC3 resulted in a reduction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity to 50% for both mutations compared to the wild-type construct (columns 4&#x02013;6).

To accomplish this, the minimal HDAC-interacting region of NIPBL, fragment 4, was fused to the GAL4-DBD containing plasmid to obtain a GAL4-DBD-NIPBL fusion construct. This fusion protein is able to bind to the promoter regions of reporter plasmids containing GAL4-binding sites 5&#x02032; to the <italic>luciferase</italic> cDNA under the control of the <italic>TATA</italic> box (TATA-Luc) or the <italic>tk</italic> promoter, respectively. Baseline luciferase activities of mammalian COS7 and CHO cell lines transfected with TATA-Luc or the <italic>tk</italic> promoter plasmids were arbitrarily set as 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, column 1). Notably, cotransfection with NIPBL results in a concentration-dependent decrease of reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, columns 2&#x02013;4). To elucidate whether this NIPBL-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-repressional activity may be due to the recruitment of endogenous histone deacetylases, we cotransfected HDAC1 and HDAC3 expression plasmids. Both HDACs-1 and -3 result in additional decrease of the promoter activity, whereas cotransfection with HDAC6 shows no functional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In control samples, overexpression of each histone deacetylase (HDAC-1, -3 or -6) in the absence of the GAL4-DBD-NIPBL construct has no significant influence on reporter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, columns 4, 6 and 8). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>NIPBL-mediated recruitment of HDACs induces transcriptional repression.

Cells carrying a luciferase reporter with GAL4-consensus binding sequences 5&#x02032; to a <italic>LUC</italic> reporter gene were transfected with increasing amounts of NIPBL-frag4. The luciferase activity of cells transfected with an empty GAL4-DBD plasmid was set as 100% (column 1). NIPBL-frag4 reduces the reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (compare columns 1 with 2&#x02013;4). (<bold>B</bold>) Cotransfections with HDAC1- as well as HDAC3-encoding plasmids enhance the transcriptional repression mediated by NIPBL-frag4 (columns 3 and 5), while transfection with HDAC6 does not alter the activity (column 7).

Columns 4&#x02013;6 represent the results of cells transfected with the NIPBL construct. While the transfection with NIPBL-frag4 decreases reporter gene activity down to 50% in nontreated cells (column 4), treatments with TSA and SoBu, respectively, almost completely abolish the <italic>trans</italic>-repressional effect of NIPBL (columns 5 and 6).

These constructs were used to transfect different cell lines carrying the TATA-Luc or <italic>tK</italic> promoter containing reporter plasmid.

To further characterize whether the NIPBL-mediated repression was dependent upon histone deacetylase activity, we utilized sodium butyrate (SoBu) and trichostatin A (TSA), chemical inhibitors of histone deacetylases. Both inhibitors have been shown to result in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, and result in enhanced promoter activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In their presence, the activity of the GAL4-DBD-NIPBL fusion construct was nearly abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), providing further support between the function of NIPBL and histone deacetylation. Notably, TSA- or SoBu-treatment in the presence of the empty GAL4-DBD construct, demonstrate only a minimal increase in reporter gene activity, suggesting the effect is directly on the transcriptional repression by NIPBL, rather than on global up-regulation of transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>NIPBL-mediated recruitment of endogenous HDACs induces histone deacetylation</title><p>To verify that the promoter activity of the GAL4-DBD-NIPBL fusion is a direct consequence of NIPBL-mediated recruitment of endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC3, ChIP assays were conducted. COS7 cells were cotransfected with <italic>tK</italic> reporter and the GAL4-DBD-NIPBL construct. Following formaldehyde cross-linking, anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3 antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. Purified DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and analyzed in electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). A <italic>tK</italic> promoter-specific fragment of 130 bp was identified in both anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3 precipitates, indicating an interaction of both endogenous histone deacetylases with the <italic>tK</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, no signal was detectable in precipitates of cells transfected with an empty GAL4-DBD plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 3).

The precipitated DNA fragments were PCR-amplified and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. An expected 130 bp <italic>tK</italic> promoter-specific fragment can be amplified from control plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 2) and from chromatin prior to precipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4).

However, the <italic>tk</italic> promoter PCR product was detectable in controls using the empty GAL4-DBD plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 6). The acetylation status of the <italic>SV40</italic> promoter that regulates the expression of the NIPBL construct was monitored in parallel (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).

These proteins, required for the loading of Cohesin onto chromatin, have been implicated in double-strand DNA repair and in the regulation of gene expression. Although both isoforms described for the human NIPBL are fairly large, only a few functional domains have been predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses. These include a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal, a glutamine-rich region, an HP1-interacting motif and several HEAT repeats, which have been implicated in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These HEAT repeats are located within the C-terminal part of NIPBL, spanning about amino acids 1300&#x02013;2500, which is highly conserved in different species and expected to be functionally significant. Moreover, a majority of CdLS-associated missense mutations map to this domain.</p><p>In a yeast two-hybrid assay to identfiy NIPBL-binding proteins, we isolated the histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC3, important cofactors that regulate chromatin structure by deacetylating histone proteins. Through the use of truncated NIPBL constructs, we refined the critical region of NIPBL interaction with HDAC1 and HDAC3 to a stretch of 163 aa (1838&#x02013;2000), which contains two of the five conserved HEAT repeats. As the use of partial fragments of NIPBL could result in altered protein binding, we analyzed the interaction of full-length NIPBL with HDAC1 and HDAC3. In immunoprecipitation assays, we were able to verify the interaction of the endogenous NIPBL with both HDAC1 and HDAC3 in mammalian cells.</p><p>To assess relevance of the critical region for the interaction of NIPBL with HDAC1 and HDAC3 to CdLS, we tested two newly identified <italic>NIPBL</italic> missense mutations. One of these we recently identified as a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation (R1895T) and the other was recently described by Selicorni and colleagues (R1856G). Both patients have classical CdLS phenotype without limb abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Each mutation results in decreased binding of NIPBL to HDAC3, whereas the interaction with HDAC1 seems to be unaffected. Both mutations are separated by 39 amino acids and are localized within (R1856G) or adjacent (R1895T) to HEAT-repeat 2.</p><p>In luciferase reporter gene assays we show that this region of NIPBL when fused to the GAL4-DBD modifies reporter gene expression. Using ChIP assays we show that this NIPBL-mediated activity is due to direct interaction with endogenous histone deacetylases. Furthermore, cotransfection of HDAC1 and HDAC3 result in a further decrease of promoter activity, whereas HDAC6, which does not directly associates with the NIPBL fragment, does not modify the reporter gene expression significantly. Interestingly, the two missense mutations analyzed have similar effects on HDAC1 and HDAC3 binding affinities, but exert different functional activities. Mutation R1895T only slightly alters this function, whereas mutant R1856G significantly decreases the activity mediated by NIPBL. Lastly, chemical inhibition of histone deacetylation by treatment of the cell cultures with TSA or SoBu almost completely abolishes the NIPBL-mediated activity. These data are the first to clearly point to a direct functional connection of the mammalian SCC2-like protein NIPBL with the recruitment of histone deacetylating enzymes.</p><sec><title>Histone acetylation, chromatin remodeling and Cohesin</title><p>Although the interplay of chromatin structure and histone modification with Cohesin has been frequently described, the precise function is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that chromatin structure may play an important role in determining whether, and where, Cohesin binds to chromosomes in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>It is known that histone modifications affect the recruitment of Cohesin to particular chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In our ChIP analyses, we could show that aa 1838&#x02013;2000 of NIPBL are able to initiate the deacetylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9), which would allow its methylation. The heterochromatin binding protein 1 (HP1), which was also described to bind NIPBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), recognizes methylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) and deletion of Swi6, the yeast ortholog of HP1, causes a loss of Cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This is consistent with earlier observations that the interaction between the Scc3 Cohesin subunit with Swi6 is needed to recruit Cohesin to centromeric regions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). On the other hand, it was shown very recently, that the Suv39h-HP1 pathway is not essential for the enrichment of Cohesin at centromeres in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These observations clearly indicate differences in the functional connection of HP1/Swi6 and Cohesins in yeast and mammalian cells.</p><p>In addition to the above literature, it has been shown that diminishing HDACs by TSA-treatment or mutation promotes abnormal sister chromatid separation. Sister chromatids do not separate when cells enter mitosis with hyperacetylated histones. Thus, the presence of acetylated histones in mitosis induces both aberrant chromosome numbers (i.e. aneuploidy) and defects in chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Recently, Kimata and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) described TSA-hypersensitivity of a mutant Mis4, a Cohesin loading adherin protein. TSA-treatment of <italic>mis4</italic> mutant cells results in decreasing Cohesin-binding to chromatin in the chromosome arm regions. Furthermore, the correlation of various histone modifications and Cohesin is the subject of a continuously growing number of publications. In human cells, a chromatin-remodeling complex containing the ATPase SNF2h was found to copurify with RAD21 and SMC proteins, presumably due to a direct interaction between Cohesin and this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Mutations in the yeast chromatin-remodeling complex RSC cause modest defects in sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Furthermore, deletions of <italic>Rsc2</italic>, encoding a further alternative variant of the RSC complex, significantly reduces SCC by reducing the amount of chromosome-associated Cohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The function of NIPBL in regulating gene expression</title><p>Although Scc2-like proteins are necessary to recruit the Cohesin complex to chromosomes, patients with CdLS usually do not show significant cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), suggesting that the diverse developmental deficits are caused by gene-expression changes similar to those in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where heterozygous <italic>Nipped-B</italic> mutations also do not result in severe cohesion defects. In yeast, Cohesin binds almost exclusively between genes and most binding sites are between convergent transcription units. Coupled with the finding that Scc2 does not colocalize with Cohesin, this led to the idea that Cohesin loads onto chromosomes at Scc2-binding sites and is subsequently pushed to the end of the genes by RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This contrasts sharply from the data obtained in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Nipped-B was discovered in a genetic screen for factors that facilitate long-range transcriptional activation of the <italic>cut</italic> and <italic>Ultrabithorax (Ubx)</italic> homeobox genes by enhancers positioned some 80 and 50 kb away from the promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It has been shown previously that Nipped-B and Cohesin bind to the same sites throughout the entire nonrepetitive <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. Here, Nipped-B seems to preferentially bind to transcribed regions and overlap with RNA polymerase II. According to these results, high transcriptional activity does not seem to prevent Cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The colocalization of Nipped-B with Cohesin supports the idea that it dynamically regulates binding of Cohesin and suggests additional mechanisms by which Cohesin might affect transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Although we have identified NIPBL-mediated recruitment of histone deacetylases to chromatin, which results in local alterations of the chromatin structure, the precise function of this interaction is still unknown. The numerous genomic loci where Nipped-B has been identified suggest a more general role in transcriptional regulation. Whether NIPBL directly regulates specific promoter activities or may participate in creating a platform for the recruitment of specific transcription (co-) factors needs to be analyzed in future experiments.</p><p>In this report, we show for the first time a direct interaction and functional consequence of histone deacetylating enzymes with the Cohesin-loading protein NIPBL. Although the precise function of this interplay is still unknown, our data presented here give new insight into the molecular pathology of CdLS and further contribute to the hypothesis that it is likely not the result of defects in cohesion; but rather, it is likely due to changes on chromatin structure and effects on gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Medical Faculty of L&#x000fc;beck (E15-2008).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
