The bulk of complement deposited in the glomerulus in acute glomerulonephritis is presumed to come from the circulation, and is synthesized in the liver. This constitutes &#x0201c;systemic&#x0201d; complement synthesis.</p><p>A variety of other cells, however, are capable of synthesizing complement components. Most of these are epithelial; we have shown that renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTEC) synthesize a variety of components in humans and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Witte1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the experiments reported herein, we employ a novel strategy by which animals deficient in C3 undergo hematologic reconstitution with bone marrow from C3 replete animals.

Such a dose regime avoids a substantial amount of gut induced radiation disease, and minimizes gastric distress. To prevent death from nasal pseudomonas, twenty-four hours prior to, and for one week after irradiation, the animals were given tetracycline (6.5 mg/ml terramycin in acidified water, administered ad libitum). On the day following irradiation, each animal received approximately four million bone marrow cells (BMC) that had been harvested by flushing the marrow cavity of femurs and tibiae of donor WT or C3KO mice with DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 1&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT). The BMC were washed several times with PBS and then contaminating red blood cells were lysed with AKC buffer (0.15 M NH<sub>4</sub>CL, 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.35). The BMC were washed, resuspended in DMEM, counted, and injected intravenously via a tail vein using a 26-gauge needle.</p><p>The chimeras created by this process were defined as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>WT<sup>IR</sup>/WT&#x02013;WT background irradiated, reconstituted with WT bone marrow cells</p></list-item><list-item><p>WT<sup>IR</sup>/C3KO&#x02013;WT background irradiated, reconstituted with C3KO bone marrow cells</p></list-item><list-item><p>C3KO<sup>IR</sup>/WT&#x02013;C3KO background irradiated, reconstituted with WT bone marrow cells</p></list-item><list-item><p>C3KO<sup>IR</sup>/C3KO&#x02013;C3KO background irradiated, reconstituted with C3KO bone marrow cells</p></list-item></list><p>The first and fourth groups served as controls for the processes of irradiation and reconstitution.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Induction of glomerulonephritis</title><p>The irradiated and transplanted animals were allowed to recover for 4 weeks, at which time immune complex glomerulonephritis was induced using a method we have described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Each group of transplanted animals was composed of six male mice who were approximately 12 weeks old at the time of induction of glomerulonephritis. Additional groups of six WT and six C3KO animals (also 12 weeks old ) served as vehicle control groups and received 0.2 ml injections of 150 mM NaCl, IP, five days per week.

The concentration of many complement components in plasma is reduced during active glomerulonephritis, and circulating complement component breakdown products can be detected.</p><p>The liver is the source of most circulating complement. For several years, however, it has been appreciated that there is extrahepatic synthesis of a variety of components, both in humans and in experimental animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Passwell1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The in vivo importance of this, however, remains unclear. In a model of murine herpes virus infection, for example, local complement synthesis and activation in the myeloid compartment has been shown to enhance the development of humoral immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Verschoor1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect may be mediated via C3a binding to bone marrow dendritic cells, since inhibition of such binding impairs T cells response to antigen presented by those cells 10&#x0005d;. In vitro, PTEC with bound C3b enhanced alloreactive T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Li1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A number of published studies of extrahepatic complement synthesis have dealt with the kidney and monocytes. Renal complement synthesis was first demonstrated in lupus-prone (NZB) mice by Passwell and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Passwell1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, our laboratory established that the renal proximal tubular epithelium was the source of kidney mRNA for complement components, in both humans and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Witte1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation paralleled other studies of renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Brooimans1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Seelen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The role of this tubular complement synthesis has been examined in experimental animals, based upon observations in human disease. Chronic glomerulonephritis that progresses to ESRD is always accompanied by tubulointerstitial disease: peritubular edema, fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and tubular atrophy. We have employed experimental animals models to support an important role for such tubular complement component synthesis in tubulointerstitial disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch5">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. There is also experimental evidence of a role for local renal C3 synthesis in reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Farrar1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternative pathway complement activation and occupation of the C3a receptor on proximal tubular epithelial cells promotes cytokine expression in a murine reperfusion model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Thurman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The in vivo role of monocyte-derived complement, specifically C3, has been studied much less. Studies in C3KO<sup>IR</sup>/WT chimeras, similar to those we have employed, have suggested a role for local (presumably monocyte/macrophage-derived) C3 in the reticuloendothelial system in the immune response to viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Verschoor1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This study, as is the case in ours, showed evidence of some low-level C3 present in plasma as well. Conversely, other studies have suggested a role for C3 in the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Reis1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The synthesis of monocyte C3 and other complement proteins could theoretically be important in the glomerular component of glomerulonephritis. Many glomerulonephritides, both in humans and in animal models, are characterized by monocytic infiltrate. In vitro, monocyte C3 synthesis is enhanced by stimuli such as cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Drouin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and immune complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Laufer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, both of these stimuli may be in abundance in glomeruli affected by immune complex glomerulonephritis. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that infiltrating monocytes could amplify the inflammatory process by providing a source of local C3.</p><p>Testing this hypothesis in intact animals would be difficult. The presence of circulating liver-derived C3 in plasma would make it impossible to establish the presence of what would likely be quantitatively smaller amounts of locally synthesized protein. Moreover, the known strong in situ hybridization signal from tubular C3 mRNA could overwhelm a weaker glomerular signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To overcome this problem, we employed the construction of &#x0201c;chimeras&#x0201d;, similar to work done by Verschoor et al. who studied the immune response to herpes virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Verschoor1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This strategy permitted us to induce immune complex glomerulonephritis in animals lacking normal systemic C3 synthetic capability, but with a hematopoietic system reconstituted from wild type mice.</p><p>As we have noted previously, the glomerulonephritis model we have employed resulted in marked glomerular hypercellularity. Using immunofluorescent techniques, we demonstrated that much of this hypercellularity is derived from infiltrating monocytes. Additionally, animals with wild type background had evidence of C3 deposition in their glomeruli. Our previous studies have also shown such deposits of C3 in the glomerulus, beginning at about three weeks after induction of glomerulonephritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Although some plasma C3 could be detected in C3KO<sup>IR</sup>/WT chimeric mice, they did not have immunohistochemical evidence of glomerular C3 deposition.</p><p>As would be expected from the work of Drouin and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Drouin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, monocytes from these animals should express C3 mRNA following cytokine stimulation. The presence of detectable C3 protein by ELISA in the plasma collected from our C3KO<sup>IR</sup>/WT chimeric mice confirms this, although the concentration is unlikely to be physiologically important. Some workers have suggested a role for C3 synthesis by monocytes in local inflammatory conditions such as glomerulonephritis and transplant rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Sund1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Jose1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Two lines of evidence in the studies reported herein suggest that such an effect is either nonexistent or trivial.</p><p>First of all, immunohistochemistry for C3 in C3KO animals reconstituted with WT bone marrow cells shows no C3 glomerular deposition, despite active inflammation and trace C3 protein in infiltrating cells. Such experiments are critical to establishing this, since the strong C3 deposition in C3 replete (i.e. WT) mice would overcome any locally synthesized proteins.</p><p>The other important observations relate to the severity of the histologic and clinical disease. There was no difference in two histologic markers of severity (glomerular cell counts and crescents) between C3KO and WT animals, regardless of whether they were reconstituted with WT or C3KO bone marrow cells. Furthermore, there was no difference among groups in proteinuria or renal function. The glomerular histology in these animals did not differ from our previously published observations in untransplanted animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It could be argued that, despite glomerular deposition in WT animals, C3 is not critical to the glomerular component of this model. As our previous studies have shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, a variety of inflammatory mediators are likely present in these affected glomeruli; these are clearly contributing to an exuberant disease regardless of the presence or absence of C3. Indeed, the severity of the glomerular lesion appears to be independent of the presence or absence of systemic C3 synthetic capacity.</p><p>The rationale of these studies, however, was to develop a model that would permit differentiating the effect of systemic synthesis, activation and deposition of a complement component from that which is produced locally, in much smaller quantities and mediates its effects in the immediate microenvironment. Thus, our results suggest that in our specific model of immune complex glomerulonephritis, neither systemic nor locally synthesized C3 is critical to the glomerular inflammatory process. A similar bone marrow transplant strategy could be employed in other models in which the glomerular role of C3 appeared more critical.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the focus of these experiments was exclusively on <underline>glomerular</underline> and <underline>monocytic</underline> C3. Our previous studies have suggested that the importance of locally synthesized complement is most likely in the <underline>tubulointerstitial</underline> component of inflammatory renal disease, where it is synthesized by the renal tubular epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003334-Welch2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These studies demonstrate the importance of examining intact animal models of disease, in addition to in vitro work, when considering the role of locally synthesized inflammatory mediators. Although monocytes clearly are capable of synthesizing the central protein of the complement cascade in response to inflammation, this ability does not appear to have an important role in vivo.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0003334-Witte1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
