With the aim being to achieve individual optimization of co-trimoxazole therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we investigated genetic polymorphisms in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene (which encodes the metabolizing enzyme of sulphamethoxazole). Of 166 patients with SLE, 54 patients who were hospitalized and who received prophylactic doses of co-trimoxazole were included in the cohort study. Adverse events occurred in 18 patients; only two experienced severe adverse events that lead to discontinuation of the drug. These two patients and three additional ones with severe adverse events (from other institutions) were added to form a cohort sample and were analyzed in a case-control study. Genotype was determined using TaqMan methods, and haplotype was inferred using the maximum-likelihood method. In the cohort study, adverse events occurred more frequently in those without the <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>haplotype (5/7 [71.4%]) than in those with at least one <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>haplotype (13/47 [27.7%]; <italic>P </italic>= 0.034; relative risk = 2.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.34&#x02013;4.99).

We conclude that lack of <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>haplotype is associated with adverse events with co-trimoxazole in Japanese patients with SLE.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) is an effective drug in the prevention and treatment of <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a life-threatening condition that mainly occurs in immunodeficient patients. Usage of the drug was recently extended to patients with connective tissue disease, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although co-trimoxazole was confirmed to have prophylactic effect against <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>pneumonia in SLE patients, it often causes adverse events, even at prophylactic doses. Adverse events include life-threatening conditions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), hepatotoxicity, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Of the two chemical components of co-trimoxazole, sulphamethoxazole is thought to be responsible for most cases of hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The major metabolic pathway for sulphamethoxazole is catalyzed by <italic>N</italic>-acetylation by <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). In the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity, the formation of hydroxylamine through oxidization by cytochrome P450 and its subsequent autooxidation to the nitroso metabolite have been implicated, although these are minor metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These toxic metabolites are also detoxified by phase II enzymes and exhibit acetylation by NAT2, glucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphophate-glucronosyltransferase, sulphate conjugation by sulphotransferase, and conjugation with glutathione by glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among those metabolizing enzymes, NAT2 is a key enzyme because it catabolizes sulphamethoxazole and toxic metabolites, and may prevent the formation of hydroxylamine.</p><p>The <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene has at least 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding exon, and 29 NAT2 alleles (haplotypes) have been described in human populations, as shown in the NAT2 nomenclature Web site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition to one wild-type haplotype (<italic>NAT2*4</italic>), the human <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene has four representative clusters of haplotypes that possess specific nucleotide substitutions at positions 341, 590, 857 and 191. These clusters are called <italic>NAT2*5</italic>, <italic>NAT2*6</italic>, <italic>NAT2*7 </italic>and <italic>NAT2*14</italic>, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the members of those clusters are responsible for the slow acetylator phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which is conveniently determined by examining the concentration of caffeine in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Individuals who are homozygous for mutant-type haplotypes exhibit the slow acetylator phenotype, whereas those who carry at least one wild-type haplotype exhibit the fast acetylator phenotype.</p><p>In the present study we examined the association between genetic polymorphisms in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene and adverse events with co-trimoxazole in patients with SLE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and control individuals</title><p>The present study was approved by the Genome Ethics Committee of Tokyo Women's Medical University. A total of 166 patients with SLE were enrolled after they had given informed consent. Of these, 54 were admitted to our hospital between January 2001 and May 2006, and received co-trimoxazole (400 mg sulphamethoxazole and 80 mg trimethoprim) each day for prophylaxis against <italic>Pneumocystis </italic>pneumonia while they were immunosuppressed (CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell count &#x0003c;200/mm<sup>3</sup>). All patients with SLE fulfilled the 1997 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for the classification of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The data from these 54 patients were analyzed, and the patients were divided into two groups: those with adverse events (<italic>n </italic>= 18) and those without adverse events (<italic>n </italic>= 36). Among the 18 patients with adverse events, only two experienced severe events that lead to the discontinuation of co-trimoxazole treatment.</p><p>We collected samples from three additional patients at two other institutions who experienced severe adverse events. The five patients with severe adverse events (two from our institution and three from the other institutions) were combined to constitute a case group in a case-control study.</p><p>We wished to examine whether the genotypes or haplotypes of the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene in SLE patients are different from those in patients with other connective tissue diseases or those from control subject individuals. We therefore obtained genomic DNA from 39 patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) who had fulfilled the criteria proposed by Bohan and Peter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and from 195 healthy donors (all gave informed consent). All patients and control individuals included in this study were Japanese.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of adverse events with co-trimoxazole</title><p>Liver dysfunction was considered to be present when serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were higher than twice the upper limit of the normal range. The patients and control individuals had no history of alcohol abuse and were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count below 100,000/&#x003bc;l. Rashes were variable in severity: TEN was diagnosed when there was widespread epidermal necrolysis with the appearance of scalding (&#x0003e;30% of the body surface area), and epidermal necrolysis that involved less than 10% of the body was diagnosed as SJS.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA isolation</title><p>On admission to the hospital peripheral blood (10 ml) was drawn from each patient into tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. A standard phenol-chloroform extraction procedure was used to extract genomic DNA from the blood samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping at the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene and inference of haplotype combinations</title><p>The <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene has at least 13 SNPs. Genotyping at four SNP sites enabled us to infer the haplotypes and diplotype configurations for the majority of the Japanese individuals. The four SNP sites included a C to T substitution at nucleotide position 282 (rs1041983), a C to T substitution at nucleotide position 481 (rs1799929), a G to A substitution at nucleotide position 590 (rs1799930) and a G to A substitution at nucleotide position 857 (rs1799931). These four SNPs yield six haplotypes in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene in the Japanese population, namely <italic>NAT2*4</italic>, <italic>NAT2*5B</italic>, <italic>NAT2*5E</italic>, <italic>NAT2*6A</italic>, <italic>NAT2*7B </italic>and <italic>NAT2*13</italic>. Of these, <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>is the wild-type haplotype; the remaining haplotypes are mutant types. In the present study, individuals who were homozygous for mutant-type haplotypes were tentatively designated slow acetylators; those who carried at least one wild-type haplotype were designated fast acetylators. A predeveloped TaqMan kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) that contained a set of forward and reverse primers and fluorescent-labelled probes that hybridize either wild-type or mutant-type sequences was used to determine genotypes at the four SNP sites by allelic discrimination chemistry. Genotypes were determined at four SNP loci in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene. From the obtained genotype data, we inferred the diplotype configuration for each individual, using PENHAPLO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This program was designed to infer haplotypes for each individual with using the maximum-likelihood method based on the expectation maximization algorithm, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This method infers not only the frequencies of haplotypes in the population but also the distribution of diplotype configurations in each individual.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate differences in the frequencies of the diplotype configurations corresponding to the slow acetylators (those without <italic>NAT2*4</italic>) between the two groups. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05. Relative risks were determined in the cohort study and odds ratios were calculated in the case-control study, with 95% confidence intervals. SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to compare the differences in ALT levels between two groups using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Haplotypes and diplotype configurations at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene</title><p>Genotyping of the four SNP sites at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene was sufficient for inferrence of haplotypes or diplotype configurations, using the PENHAPLO program, and the diplotype configuration was concentrated on a single haplotype combination for each individual using this program. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows numbers and frequencies of diplotype configurations at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene in 166 patients with SLE, 39 patients with PM/DM, and 195 healthy individuals.

Ohno and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] first reported an association between genetic polymorphisms at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene and the occurrence of adverse events with sulphonamides. Since then severe adverse events with sulfasalazine, another compound that is catabolized by NAT2, were also reported to be associated with absence of the wild-type allele (<italic>NAT2*4</italic>) in the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. There have been conflicting reports regarding the association between adverse events with co-trimoxazole and <italic>NAT2 </italic>genotype, with findings apparently correlating with the underlying disease process. For instance, in the setting of HIV infection many investigators were unable to demonstrate such an association, but some reports have shown a positive association in patients without HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, differences in background illness may account for the fact that a positive association was observed in the present study (in patients with SLE) and negative associations were observed in other reports in which the disease was HIV related. An alternative explanation is that there are differences in composition of <italic>NAT2 </italic>haplotypes between ethnic groups (as discussed below).</p><p>In the present study we found that slow acetylators at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene, among the patients with SLE, were more likely to develop adverse events with co-trimoxazole than were fast acetylators in the cohort study (relative risk = 2.58). In the case-control study, we found that the proportion of slow acetylators was higher among patients with severe adverse events than in those without (60% versus 11.5%; odds ratio = 11.5), although we could not find statistically significant differences between the patients with severe adverse events and 16 patients with mild adverse events (60% versus 25%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.28). We emphasize that severe adverse events, including life-threatening ones, were associated with <italic>NAT2 </italic>polymorphisms.</p><p>The most frequent adverse event with co-trimoxazole in the cohort study group was liver dysfunction (70%), followed by thrombocytopenia (25%) and rash (5%). The types of adverse events are slightly different from those previously reported for co-trimoxazole. Karpman and Kurzrock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reviewed the adverse events associated with co-trimoxazole use in children on full-dose therapy, and indicated that cutaneous lesions were the most common hypersensitivity reactions to co-trimoxazole, accounting for 70% of all adverse events. Other hypersensitivity effects, including fever and haematological toxicity, were also frequent. Liver dysfunction was less common. With sulphonamides, however, liver dysfunction is a well documented common adverse event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We speculate that the incidence of liver dysfunction in patients receiving co-trimoxazole might have been underestimated in the study by Karpman and Kurzrock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All patients in the present study were hospitalized and monitored for asymptomatic liver dysfunction using routine biochemical tests. Among the 54 patients with SLE who were enrolled in the cohort study, slow acetylators exhibited significantly higher levels of serum ALT after administration of co-trimoxazole than did fast acetylators. This suggests that <italic>NAT2 </italic>genotype affected levels of serum ALT. On the other hand, the low incidence of cutaneous lesions in the present cohort study might have been the result of preceding immunosuppressive therapies, latently preventing development of cutaneous lesions.</p><p>Sulphonamides are the compounds most associated with development of TEN, and the mechanism of skin necrolysis is reported to be through cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated pathways and clonally expanded CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although TEN and SJS induced by co-trimoxazole is rare, it is a major problem because severe skin disease such as TEN and SJS can occur even with prophylactic doses of co-trimoxazole in SLE. Indeed, some patients in the case-control study exhibited hypersensitivity reactions, including TEN and SJS, which are typical and severe allergic reactions to the drug. Interestingly, a large proportion of these patients were slow acetylators. Thus, polymorphisms at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene may account even for allergic reactions to co-trimoxazole. These findings are consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] demonstrating that allergic reactions such as rashes and fever were more frequent in slow acetylators (as inferred by the maximum-likelihood method) among Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with sulphasalazine. The greater frequency of adverse events with co-trimoxazole in slow acetylators might be accounted for by delayed drug clearance, resulting in sustained high levels of serum sulphamethoxazole, which is likely to lead to increased formation of hydroxylamine or nitroso-sulphamethoxazole. These toxic metabolites and sulphamethoxazole might act as cytotoxic, genotoxic, or immunogenic agents, and hence induce adverse reactions.</p><p>Haplotype frequencies at the <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene vary between ethnic groups. The percentage of slow acetylators was reported to be 56% to 74% among Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but it was only 8.2% in our study. The percentage of slow acetylators in our study is similar to proportions reported previously in the Japanese population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the compositions of mutant haplotypes are quite different between Caucasian and Japanese individuals. In the former, the most frequent mutant haplotype is the <italic>NAT2*5 </italic>cluster (45%), followed by the <italic>NAT2*6 </italic>cluster (28%) and the <italic>NAT2*7 </italic>cluster (2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the Japanese population, however, <italic>NAT2*6A </italic>is the most frequent (20%), followed by <italic>NAT2*7B </italic>(13%), and the <italic>NAT2*5 </italic>cluster is very rare (0.01%). Thus, major components of the <italic>NAT2 </italic>mutant haplotype in Caucasian individuals are <italic>NAT2*5B </italic>and <italic>NAT2*6A</italic>; in the Japanese population, <italic>NAT2*6A </italic>and <italic>NAT2*7B </italic>are the major components. Each haplotype contains specific nucleotide substitutions: T341C and A803G for <italic>NAT2*5B</italic>, G590A for <italic>NAT2*6A</italic>, and G857A for <italic>NAT2*7B</italic>. All of these substitutions cause amino acid changes. It is curious, however, that the severe adverse events caused by sulfasalazine, associated with <italic>NAT2 </italic>variations, have been reported exclusively from Japan, although the frequency of slow acetylators is much higher among Caucasian than Japanese populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The quiet different composition of mutant haplotypes between Caucasian and Japanese populations may account for the difference in adverse events relative to <italic>NAT2 </italic>gene haplotype.</p><p>During metabolic detoxification of sulphamethoxazole, phase II enzymes other than NAT2 also play a role. GST can detoxify nitroso-sulphamethoxazole by reduction back to hydroxylamine. It catalyzes conjugation of electrophiles with glutathione, thereby inactivating those often cytotoxic or genotoxic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Of several GST isozymes, the &#x003bc;-class enzyme (GSTM), the &#x003b8;-class enzyme (GSTT) and the &#x003c0;-class enzyme (GSTP) are polymorphic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The genetic polymorphisms at the <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and <italic>GSTT1 </italic>genes were reported to be deletion of nucleotides (referred to as null <italic>GSTM1 </italic>and null <italic>GSTT1 </italic>alleles), which have been associated with susceptibility to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We also investigated the involvement of genetic polymorphisms of the <italic>GSTT1 </italic>and <italic>GSTM1 </italic>genes in the occurrence of adverse events with co-trimoxazole (data not shown). Nevertheless, none of the <italic>GST </italic>gene polymorphisms were associated with adverse events, a finding that is consistent with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that Japanese patients with SLE who do not harbour the <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>haplotype develop adverse events with co-trimoxazole more frequently than patients with at least one <italic>NAT2*4 </italic>haplotype.
