While Dicer and Ago2 are RNases, TRBP is the double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP) that loads small interfering RNA into the RISC. TRBP binds directly to Dicer through its C-terminal domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that the TRBP binding site in Dicer is a 165 amino acid (aa) region located between the ATPase and the helicase domains. The binding site in TRBP is a 69 aa domain, called C4, located at the C-terminal end of TRBP. The TRBP1 and TRBP2 isoforms, but not TRBPs lacking the C4 site (TRBPs&#x00394;C4), co-immunoprecipitated with Dicer. The C4 domain is therefore necessary to bind Dicer, irrespective of the presence of RNA. Immunofluorescence shows that while full-length TRBPs colocalize with Dicer, TRBPs&#x00394;C4 do not. <italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells, which do not express TRBP, do not support RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by short hairpin or micro RNAs against EGFP. Both TRBPs, but not TRBPs&#x00394;C4, were able to rescue RNAi function. In human cells with low RNAi activity, addition of TRBP1 or 2, but not TRBPs&#x00394;C4, rescued RNAi function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mapping of the interaction sites between TRBP and Dicer show unique domains that are required for their binding. Since TRBPs&#x00394;C4 do not interact or colocalize with Dicer, we suggest that TRBP and Dicer, both dsRBPs, do not interact through bound dsRNA. TRBPs, but not TRBPs&#x00394;C4, rescue RNAi activity in RNAi-compromised cells, indicating that the binding of Dicer to TRBP is critical for RNAi function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism used by eukaryotes for gene silencing. This mechanism uses small double-stranded (ds)RNA, named micro (mi) or small interfering (si) RNAs, which are complementary to a target gene to degrade the corresponding mRNA or block its translation. The dsRNA triggers the assembly of a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The mechanism and complex composition has been best studied in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This is an enzymatic process that involves RNAse III-like proteins (Dicer and Drosha) and a dsRNA binding protein (dsRBP; R2D2 and Loquacious) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The second step, which leads to the cleavage of the target mRNA, includes an Argonaute (Ago) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Mammalian cells have a single Dicer protein, with a molecular weight of ~200 kDa. Dicer contains an ATPase/RNA helicase domain, a DUF domain, a PAZ domain, two RNase III domains and a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Dicer PAZ domain associates with the PIWI domain of Ago2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Dicer is responsible for cleaving the dsRNA trigger (miRNA or siRNA) so it can be loaded into the RISC. Ago2 is then recruited to the RISC where it cleaves the target mRNA or mediates translation inhibition after its association with the complementary strand from the mi/siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dicer knock-out (Dcr<sup>-/-</sup>) mice and cells are not viable indicating a major function for this protein during development and normal cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In human cells, the dsRBP that associates with Dicer is the TAR RNA binding protein, TRBP. This protein is required for RNAi function mediated by both siRNAs and miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], where it acts as a biosensor in the choice of dsRNA loaded into the RISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, Dicer, TRBP and Ago2 are necessary and sufficient for <italic>in vitro </italic>reconstitution of RNAi activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>TRBP1 and TRBP2 are isoforms of the cellular protein TRBP which was isolated by its ability to bind the human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 TAR RNA and characterized for its stimulation of the expression of the HIV long terminal repeat in human and murine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. TRBPs have two dsRBDs, a KR-helix motif within dsRBD2 and a Medipal domain that mediates protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. TRBPs also bind to PKR and PACT through their dsRBDs and to Merlin, Dicer and PACT through their Medipal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. TRBPs are encoded by the <italic>tarbp2 </italic>gene. Two adjacent promoters initiate transcription of alternative first exons for TRBP1 and TRBP2 mRNAs and as a consequence, in comparison to TRBP1, TRBP2 has 21 additional amino acids (aa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. TRBPs have functional activities in spermatogenesis, cell growth, oncogenesis and viral replication linked to their RNA- and protein-binding abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Among these, the TRBP-Dicer interaction and its function as part of the RISC has been identified as an important component of the RNAi pathway. In this paper, we further characterize the specific domains in TRBP and Dicer that are required for their interaction and we analyze the consequences of this interaction in RNAi function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TRBP Medipal domain interacts with Dicer through a unique domain in Dicer located between the ATPase and the helicase motifs</title><p>The TRBP-Dicer interaction was found by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a Dicer antibody followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We independently identified Dicer in a two-hybrid screen using TRBP as bait. This screen resulted in the identification of six clones that interacted with TRBP. Among these, the only clones which corresponded to an RBP mapped to Dicer aa 173&#x02013;431 or aa 267&#x02013;541 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Because both TRBP and Dicer are dsRBPs, and these corresponding domains often dimerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we also verified if the Dicer dsRBD (aa 1850&#x02013;1922) could interact with TRBP, but no interaction was found. We next expressed the common sequence between the isolated two-hybrid clones, aa 267&#x02013;431 called D1, on pGBT9 and showed its interaction with TRBP2 or TRBP C (Medipal domain) expressed in pGADGH. This domain was further divided in two halves expressing aa 267&#x02013;350 and 350&#x02013;431. Neither domain interacted with TRBP, indicating that the 165 aa D1 domain is the smallest TRBP-interacting domain defined in this assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of Dicer-TRBP interaction domains and colocalization</bold>. <bold>A) Dicer interacting domain is located in a unique region between the ATPase and the helicase domains</bold>.

TRBP interaction with PACT in this domain has been mapped to aa 287&#x02013;366 in TRBP2. To determine if TRBP-Dicer interaction can be limited to a shorter domain, we first expressed the subdomains as C1 and C2 expressing aa 228&#x02013;339 and 340&#x02013;366 respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). C1 did not show an interaction and the expression of C2 repeatedly induced yeast growth arrest indicating a cytotoxicity of this domain. The domain was next divided into C3 and C4 expressing aa 228&#x02013;297 and 298&#x02013;366 respectively. Only C4 showed a specific interaction with D1, indicating that this subdomain of the Medipal is the active component for Dicer binding.</p><p>The cellular distribution of Dicer and TRBP has not yet been fully elucidated. We next examined their localization in the cell using immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against endogenous TRBP and Dicer. Interestingly, TRBP localized mainly to the cytoplasm, while Dicer was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We found significant colocalization between Dicer and TRBP in HeLa cells predominantly in the perinuclear space (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These data and previous results confirm that TRBP and Dicer can interact in a physiological environment.</p></sec><sec><title>The C4 sequence within the Medipal domain of TRBP is necessary and sufficient to bind Dicer in mammalian cells</title><p>To determine the role of the C4 domain in the protein context, we used a complete TRBP knock-down environment. Using murine tail embryonic fibroblasts (TEFs) <italic>tarbp2 </italic>knock-out cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we evaluated the importance of the C4 domain in TRBP on the interaction between TRBP and Dicer. We expressed TRBP1 and TRBP2 as Myc-tagged proteins as previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4 and Myc-TRBP2&#x00394;C4 lacking this domain. TRBPs&#x00394;C4 were tested for their binding to Dicer by IP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In conditions where Myc-TRBP1 interacts with endogenous Dicer, Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4 did not interact with Dicer, whether the IP was performed with an anti-Myc or an anti-Dicer antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Results with Myc-TRBP2 and Myc-TRBP2&#x00394;C4 were similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We have previously excluded a binding of TRBP-Dicer through the dsRBDs in TRBP or through RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The loss of TRBP-Dicer interaction in the absence of the C4 domain, but in the presence of RNA, further argues against the involvement of RNA in the interaction. These combined results (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) indicate that the C4 domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with Dicer and that no other cellular protein or RNA can rescue the lack of interaction between the mutant TRBP and Dicer in mammalian cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The C4 domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate TRBP-Dicer interaction</bold>. <bold>A) TRBP1 or TRBP1&#x00394;C4-Dicer interactions by immunoprecipitation</bold>. <italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells were transfected with none (lanes 1, 4, 7) or 15 &#x003bc;g of pCMV-Myc-TRBP1 (lanes 2, 5, 8), pCMV-Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4 (lanes 3, 6, 9).

Within this complex, Dicer and Ago2 have RNase activities, whereas TRBP is important in loading the appropriate dsRNA into the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other proteins have been shown to associate with the RISC, however their roles remain to be fully determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We further defined the requirement for TRBP in RNAi using murine cells that are completely deficient for TRBP (<italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>). Using an shRNA and an miRNA targeting EGFP, these cells displayed low or no RNAi activity as compared to murine cells expressing TRBP (<italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and MEF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), confirming that TRBP is an essential protein for RNAi activity in these cells. The different approaches used to assess RNAi activity yielded slightly different intensities of EGFP knock-down, which can be attributed to the different sensitivities of each technique. Because no human cell has been shown to have a complete TRBP deficit, we evaluated the RNAi function in astrocytes, which have a weak expression of TRBP. This correlated with a low and moderate activity for the sh- and miRNAs, respectively, compared to HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In this case, the difference in RNAi activity between U251MG and HeLa cells follows the same trend in fluorescence, FACS and western blotting. The ability of U251MG cells to knock-down GFP expression using miRNA-based silencing is likely explained by the residual TRBP2 expression in this cell type. Our results demonstrate that in both murine and human cells, TRBP is required for efficient RNAi activity.</p><p>The interaction between Dicer and TRBP has been shown to be direct <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>with no requirement for ssRNA, dsRNA or another protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although the site of interaction in TRBP was determined to be in the C-terminal end, no distinct functional domain had been defined for Dicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two-hybrid assays further defined these domains as aa 267&#x02013;431 (called D1) in Dicer and aa 298&#x02013;366 in TRBP2 (called C4) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). D1 is located between the ATPase and the helicase domains in Dicer. It was shown previously that ATP is not required for Dicer function in RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggesting that either this domain is not functional in the human protein or that it plays a role in other processes. Interestingly, although a complete knock-down of Dicer is lethal, cells defective for only the ATPase/helicase domain are viable with only a defect in miRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here we show that the functional importance of the ATPase/helicase domain is in supporting the interaction with TRBP. These combined results suggest that the ATPase/helicase domain is not functional in the human protein, and that the sole function of this region may be to recruit TRBP through the D1 domain. Interestingly, when searched in BLASTP, D1 has no homology with any other protein in the databases, showing its unique properties.</p><p>Further demonstration that the C4 domain is solely responsible for TRBP binding to Dicer is shown by the IP assays in the presence of complete cell extracts from <italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In this assay, neither TRBP1&#x00394;C4, nor TRBP2&#x00394;C4, immunoprecipitated with Dicer. Together with previous results that showed a direct interaction between TRBP and Dicer in the absence of RNA or other proteins, these results confirm that no bridge between Dicer and TRBP occurs <italic>via </italic>dsRNA or another protein. TRBPs&#x00394;C4 and Dicer both have functional dsRBDs that are able to bind dsRNA. The absence of interaction between the TRBP mutants and Dicer suggests that they do not bind the same RNA at the same time.</p><p>Dicer and TRBP are cytoplasmic proteins but their colocalization has not been studied. Here, we show that endogenous Dicer can be observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while TRBP is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Colocalization of the two proteins was found to occur predominantly in the perinuclear space. Overexpression of TRBPs did not affect their cellular distribution as immunofluorescence of Myc-tagged constructs revealed similar staining to that of the endogenous protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As neither Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4, nor Myc-TRBP2&#x00394;C4 colocalized with Dicer in the perinuclear space, we conclude that binding of TRBP to Dicer is a major determinant of TRBP cellular distribution and our results suggest that RNAi takes place in the perinuclear space. In contrast to Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4, Myc-TRBP2&#x00394;C4 was partially associated to the cell membrane. Because TRBP2 has only 21 more aa in its N-terminus than TRBP1, these aa might be responsible for the membrane association, which is only revealed when its interaction with Dicer is abolished. A closer analysis of the 21 aa sequence and the protein's posttranslational modifications will be necessary to elucidate this function.</p><p>This slight difference between TRBP1 and TRBP2 also correlates with the rescue of the RNAi function mediated by shRNAs against EGFP (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In these assays, TRBP1 completely rescued the shRNA activity while TRBP2 rescued it partially. In contrast, we could not rescue shRNA activity using the &#x00394;C4 mutants (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This demonstrates that the C4 domain, which mediates TRBP interaction with Dicer, is also required for RNAi activity to occur. These results are compatible with a role of Dicer in the recognition and cleavage of precursor miRNA and for TRBP in loading small siRNAs into the RISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This study provides new insights into the interaction between TRBP and Dicer in the RISC. These results open the way for further studies into differences between the specific roles of TRBP1 and TRBP2 in the RNAi pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study that maps Dicer and TRBP interaction domains precisely to 165 aa and 69 aa regions, respectively. In Dicer, the motif is located in a unique region between the ATPase and the helicase domains. In murine <italic>tarbp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells and in U251MG astrocytoma cells that do not support and partially support RNAi, respectively, the TRBP1 and TRBP2 isoforms can rescue this pathway, whereas mutant forms lacking the interacting domain cannot. TRBP1 and TRBP2 colocalize and immunoprecipitate with Dicer whereas the mutants cannot, suggesting that TRBP and Dicer do not bind to the same RNA at the same time during the RNAi process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>pGADGH-Dicer, pGADGH and pGBT9 TRBP and TRBP C have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. pGADGH-Cyclin T1 has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

The cells were transfected at 50% confluency with Myc-TRBP1, Myc-TRBP2, Myc-TRBP1&#x00394;C4, Myc-TRBP2&#x00394;C4 or EGFP-TRBP2 using TransIT (Mirus) reagent. 24 hr post-transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed at room temperature for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose. Cells were then washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, (Sigma-Aldrich), 3% BSA-PBS. The cells were then incubated with mouse anti-Myc9E10 (ATCC), at a 1/500 dilution and rabbit anti-Dicer 349 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] at a 1/250 dilution in 3% BSA-PBS at room temperature for 1 hr. The cells were washed 3 times with 3% BSA-PBS and incubated 1 hr with corresponding secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes&#x02122;) at a 1/1000 dilution in 3% BSA-PBS. Cells were washed 5 times with PBS, rinsed with 95% ethanol, dried and mounted in Immu-Mount (Thermo-electron corporation). Cells were analyzed for fluorescence with a 65&#x000d7; objective on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM Pascal 5).
