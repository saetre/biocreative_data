It has also been well established that bile acid levels are tightly controlled to prevent potential toxicity, ensure appropriate cholesterol catabolism, and promote optimal solubilization and absorption of fat and other essential nutrients. In the liver, bile acid production is a major mechanism for elimination of cholesterol, and the rate limiting enzyme in this process, cholesterol-7&#x003b1; hydroxylase (Cyp7A1), shows distinct circadian expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Gielen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Kai1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Mitropoulos1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional bile acid synthetic genes, including Cyp8B1 and Cyp27 are regulated by the FXR - SHP pathway, along with the key transporter NTCP, responsible for uptake of bile acids from the portal circulation. FXR also directly activates expression of BSEP, which mediates export of bile acids into bile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Kalaany1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

The daily synchronization of central and peripheral clocks is thought to be essential in maintaining normal physiological homeostasis. However, recent studies have revealed that feeding time can act as a dominant Zeitgeber for peripheral tissues. Thus, an experimental strategy of restricted feeding (RF) in which food is provided only during a limited time in the lights-on period in a normal light-dark cycle, when rodents normally do not eat, can dissociate the peripheral clocks from the central clock.

However, the molecular signal or signals that entrain the peripheral clock in response to RF remain unclear.</p><p>Here we address two complementary hypotheses regarding the intersection of circadian rhythm with bile acid homeostasis. In the first, we predicted that since bile acid levels are key downstream targets of circadian control, disruption of such control would result in loss of bile acid homeostasis. Thus, we analyzed the effects of both the dissociation of the central and peripheral clocks by restricted feeding, as outlined above, and also genetic loss of clock function. The genetic approach was based on the period genes (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic>), which are integral components of the core molecular circuit that generates the 24 hour rhythm in all the cells of the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Gachon1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to their role as downstream targets, we hypothesized that bile acids could also be upstream regulators of peripheral clock in the liver. Specifically, since bile acid levels in the enterohepatic circulation fluctuate in response to food intake, which is the zeitgeber in RF, we tested the possibility that FXR dependent bile acid signaling could be an essential component of the food synchronization of peripheral tissues.</p><p>We observed that bile acid homeostasis is indeed strongly disrupted by both RF and in the PERDKO model. In contrast, neither loss of FXR nor interruption of enterohepatic circulation of bile acids affected food entrainment. Our results show that intact and synchronized circadian regulation of multiple steps of the entire bile acid metabolic pathway is essential to maintain its homeostasis, and that disruption of such regulation can result in liver stress responses and injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bile acid homeostasis is under circadian control</title><p>We first examined the impact of restricted feeding (RF) on bile acid homeostasis.

The diurnal pattern of hepatic bile acid levels in the mice fed the 2&#x00025; CHT diet was similar to that of the control RF mice, including the ZT2 spike.

Cyp7A1 and Cyp27, two important biosynthetic genes, showed highest expression around 9 PM, at ZT14, under normal conditions.

Both loss of FXR and CHT treatment increased the overall level of Cyp7A1 expression, as expected.

The circadian expression of the glucocorticoid target gene, tyrosine aminotransferase, shows a very similar pattern in the control fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006843-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). RF induced a significantly higher corticosterone level that, like Cyp7A1 mRNA and protein expression, showed 2 peaks. This biphasic pattern, which is similar to that previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-LeMinh1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, is thought to be due to maintenance of the SCN control of adrenal output in the normal light-dark cycle combined with the additional reverse phase peak due to RF. The first corticosterone peak at ZT2 precedes the initial peak of Cyp7A1 mRNA expression by approximately 4 hours, while the second ZT10/14 peak more closely mirrors the normal fed peak than the peak of Cyp7A1 mRNA expression at 22 hours. Circadian expression of tyrosine aminotransferase was also reversed by RF, with a particularly evident ZT2 tyrosine aminotransferase peak corresponding closely to the early corticosterone peak, but no the later ZT10/14 peak as seen in the normal control. These results suggest that the high corticosterone level of ZT2 in the RF mice contributes to the corresponding peak expression of tyrosine aminotransferase, and likely also the initial peak of Cyp7A1 expression. However, variations in corticosterone levels alone cannot account for the overall circadian expression patterns of either tyrosine aminotransferase or Cyp7A1.</p><p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that RF dramatically alters circadian regulation of both bile acid metabolic gene expression and bile acid levels, and that this response is not prevented by CHT treatment or loss of FXR function. RF produces a particularly dramatic spike in hepatic bile acid levels that is preceded by an elevation of Cyp7A1 expression, and is concomitant with increased expression of Cyp27 and the uptake transporter NTCP, as well as decreased expression of the export transporter BSEP.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Modulating bile acid signaling does not affect hepatic circadian gene expression</title><p>We examined the response of known components of the circadian clock and its output target genes to RF.

In contrast, Cyp8B1, the enzyme responsible for determining the ratio between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic bile acids composition, exhibited a different pattern in PERDKO.

On the other hand, Cyp27A1 and SHP showed a different pattern of expression than the wild-type controls with apparent phase shift and altered expression level.</p><p>A major determinant of circulating bile acid concentration lies in the partitioning between portal circulation and hepatic uptake. Since 95&#x00025; of bile acids secreted into the intestine recycle back to the liver via the portal vein, even small difference in the uptake process could result in significant changes in hepatic and systemic bile acid levels. NTCP is the major transporter in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes that controls this hepatic uptake process. In the PERDKO livers, NTCP expression was markedly blunted overall, with the loss of its robust circadian peak at ZT10/14. On the apical side of hepatocytes, BSEP is the major transporter responsible for the secretion of bile acids into bile canaliculi. In the double mutant, BSEP circadian pattern is markedly altered, but its expression level on average is not different from that of the wild-type. Other transporters involved in bile acid transport in the liver, such as MRP3 for uptake and MRP2 for excretion were up-regulated, with a loss of circadian cycling, whereas the transporter MRP4 was not altered in the double mutant.</p><p>Taken together, our findings of genes involved in bile acid metabolism in the PERDKO mice suggest that overall basolateral extraction of bile acids from portal vein into hepatocytes would be blunted with other transport processes not significantly altered. In addition, bile acid synthesis is also inhibited, while secretion is likely unaffected or decreased. Therefore, the markedly elevated serum with only moderately higher hepatic bile acid levels in the double mutant is primarily due to the decreased hepatic uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>NTCP is a novel DBP target gene</title><p>Like Cyp7A1, NTCP expression is synchronous with DBP in normal mice, and is decreased in the PERDKO, suggesting that NTCP may also be a direct DBP transcriptional target.

Our results show that a more dramatic, but transient bile acid accumulation as a result of dys-synchronization of the peripheral and central clocks not only activates CAR and PXR target genes, but also increases serum liver enzyme levels, demonstrating a moderate level of liver damage. Initial results indicate that this response declines as the liver adapts to the RF regimen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006843.s003">Figure S3</xref>). After 2 weeks of continuous RF, the elevation of serum and liver BA levels at ZT2 and ZT10 is approximately half of that observed at 1 week, and AST levels are only modestly increased. At 4 weeks, a modest increase in hepatic bile acid levels is still present at both ZT2 and ZT10, but serum bile acid and AST levels are trended down to within normal range.</p><p>The ZT2 peak in hepatic bile acid induced by RF is due to the convergence of several factors. Cyp7A1 protein levels are elevated overall, and the ZT2 peak is preceded by an increase in Cyp7A1 gene expression and protein levels. It also coincides with both a decrease in the expression of the efflux transporter BSEP, and an increase in the uptake transporter NTCP. Collectively, all three of these effects could contribute to increased bile acid levels within the hepatocyte. The molecular mechanisms that account for these responses are less clear, due to the complexity of the regulatory inputs, the feedback cycles involved, and the dynamic nature of the response. Cyp7A1 is a known DBP target gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Lavery1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas our current results identify NTCP as a novel DBP target.

This was particularly evident for both DBP and Rev-erb&#x003b1;, which showed markedly blunted overall expression in addition to loss of rhythmicity.

Specific inputs from glucocorticoids and DBP coordinate an increase in liver bile acids by activating expression of both Cyp7A1 and NTCP in the RF model. While the circadian response of Cyp7A1 is known, we are not aware of any descriptions of similar regulation for NTCP, which we have identified as a novel direct DBP target. Partitioning of bile acids in portal circulation and systemic circulation is dependent on the percentage of hepatic uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Angelin1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> mediated by NTCP. Thus, its dysregulation can substantially affect hepatic and systemic bile acid levels, as observed in the PERDKO mice. The observation that bile flow shows a distinct circadian pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Nakano1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> is also consistent with our result demonstrating a substantial circadian pattern of BSEP expression. It is apparent that the complex pathways of bile acid homeostasis are dependent on proper circadian control, and that loss of such control can lead to deleterious effects, including liver injury.</p><p>Our results did not support a dominant role for bile acids as upstream regulators of the peripheral clock. Specifically, the efficient entrainment of the hepatic clock by RF was not affected by loss of FXR function, interruption of enterohepatic circulation, or increasing the bile acid pool. The failure of streptozotocin induced diabetes to prevent RF entrainment indicates that food induced insulin responses are also not essential for this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006843-Oishi1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, multiple reinforcing signals, rather than a single dominant factor, may drive entrainment in response to RF.</p><p>We conclude that coordinated circadian regulation of individual steps of bile acid metabolism is essential to achieve the tight physiological homeostasis required to prevent the development of cholestatic liver disease, which adds yet another layer of control over the intricacy of regulation of bile acid metabolism. As demonstrated by our RF regimen in mice, the dysynchronization of the central and peripheral clock created by timing of the meals has deleterious effects in the liver.</p><p>There are interesting parallels between the rodent RF regimen and the circadian disruption experienced by shift workers, who have variable eating and activity schedules in the context of a constant 24 hour light-dark cycle.
