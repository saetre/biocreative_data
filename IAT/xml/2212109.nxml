In osteopetrotic patients, the osteoclasts are either absent or non-functional, yet bone formation is unaltered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Felix1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The osteopenic transgenic mice, in which osteoblast ablation leads to a complete arrest of bone formation accompanied by bone loss, illustrate that the bone-resorption function is also independent of bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Corral1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several tissues constitute the skeletons, including bone, bone marrow, periosteum, perichondrium and cartilage.

The differentiation of MSCs into either osteoblasts or adipocytes is exclusively and transcriptionally regulated by two key transcription factors, Runx2 (also called Cbfa1) and PPAR&#x003b3;, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Ducy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Rosen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

PKA is a heterotetrameric holoenzyme containing a regulatory (R) subunit dimer and two catalytic (C) subunits. PKA is activated when four molecules of cAMP bind to the R subunit dimer, two to each R subunit, releasing two free active C subunits responsible for phosphorylation of key substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Kvissel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway critical in phenotypic specification and transition in the adult and developing central nervous systems (CNS) has also been demonstrated to induce neuronal differentiation in a number of primary or cloned neural precursor cells derived from the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Kim1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-VogtWeisenhorn1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and induce neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Chu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

In an attempt to investigate this issue in the current study, we indeed found that the addition of stimulators of cAMP/PKA signaling in a defined adipocyte induction medium (AIM) enhanced MSC adipogenesis and also found that cAMP/PKA signaling inhibited MSC osteogenesis. Thus, the current study provides a possible molecular mechanism for the reciprocal relationship between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, a well known differentiation phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells</title><p>Primary MSCs were isolated from iliac crest of donors with informed consents and grown in DMEM-LG (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 Ag/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 &#x000b5;g/ml amphotericin B at 37&#x000b0;C under 5&#x00025; CO2 atmosphere.

PPAR&#x003b3;2 and LPL were not detected from cells in complete growth medium at 7 and 14 days or in AIM at day 7, but they could be detected in AIM at day 14, further confirming the initiation of adipogenesis in AIM but not in the complete growth medium. When adding IBMX or other PKA stimulators such as forskolin and Sp-cAMP in AIM, the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2 and LPL mRNA was up-regulated either at 7 or 14 days. Adding PKI in AIM did not result in any significant change in mRNA expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2 and LPL, whereas, PKI decreased the stimulator effect of Sp-cAMP on mRNA expression of these two genes. Levels of mRNA expression analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in primary MSCs also revealed the same results.

The level of Runx2 expression was low in cells treated in complete growth medium, and increased after the extension of the culture period for 14 days. This data support the previous finding that MSCs underwent spontaneous differentiation into osteoblasts when the cells reached confluence. The level of Runx2 expression did not significantly increase in cells treated in AIM with or without any PKA stimulators. However, a substantial increase in Runx2 expression was observed in cells treated with PKI, suggesting the stimulatory effect of PKA inhibitor on MSC osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, cells treated in AIM without or with the PKA modulators for 14 days, which all expressed PPAR&#x003b3;2, did not express any gene expression of Runx2, indicating the inverse relationship between adipogenesis and osteogenesis by MSCs. Cells in growth medium expressed OP and alkaline phosphatase (data not shown) gene expression, suggesting these genes are not exclusively expressed by osteoblasts. However, the gene expression of OP was down-regulated in cells treated in AIM with the addition of a PKA stimulator, including IBMX, forskolin and Sp-cAMP at 7 or 14 days as compared with the expression in AIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

PKA stimulators such as IBMX, forskolin and Sp-cAMP, which stimulated the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2, inhibited the expression of RANKL (day 7 versus 14), stimulated the expression of OPG (day 7 versus 14), and thus decreased the RANKL/OPG ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). On the other hand, inhibitors of PKA activity, which stimulated the expression of Runx2, inhibited the expression of OPG (Sp-cAMP&#x0002b;PKI versus PKI in day 7 and day 14), and thereby increased the RANKL/OPG ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

We, therefore, investigated the role of leptin in PKA stimulators-mediated stimulation of adipogenesis-dependent gene expression, inhibition of osteogenesis-dependent gene expression, and decrease in the ratio of RANKL/OPG gene expression in MSCs. First, we measured leptin levels in cells treated in AIM with or without PKA modulators. The baseline for leptin concentration in a conditioned medium (CM) from cells treated in AIM was around 600 pg/10<sup>4</sup> cells both at 1 and 2 weeks. Treatment with PKA stimulators such as IBMX, forskolin and Sp-cAMP significantly inhibited leptin secretion, although there is less inhibition with Sp-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, PKA inhibitors caused a significant increase in leptin secretion only at 2 weeks, when comparing the treatments with Sp-cAMP and with Sp-cAMP&#x0002b;PKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We, then, studied the expression of mRNA encoding for leptin as a possible explanation for the decrease in leptin secretion. At first, we found that MSCs expressed mRNA for leptin receptor (OB-R), and neither incubation in AIM nor treatment with PKA stimulators or inhibitors caused any significant change. The baseline for leptin mRNA (OB) in AIM was detectable, and the treatment with PKA stimulators greatly decreased leptin gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Coincident with the effect in inhibiting leptin secretion, Sp-cAMP inhibits leptin gene expression to a lesser degree. Interestingly, there was a great increase in leptin gene expression at 2 weeks of cells treated in AIM with IBMX, even though the leptin secretion in these cells was still far below baseline. However, the removal of IBMX from the medium in these cells induced leptin secretion (data not shown). These results are compatible with previous reports that leptin was secreted by adipocytes and suggest IBMX has a direct effect in inhibiting leptin expression and secretion.</p><fig id="pone-0001540-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001540.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>PKA stimulators regulate gene expression for adipogenesis, osteogenesis and osteoclast-inducing factors by suppressing leptin.</title><p>(A,B) Suppression of leptin secretion and transcription by IBMX, forskolin and Sp-cAMP.

A unique feature in the Raman spectrum of IBMX-treated embryos was a lack of the large peak at 961 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1095 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> corresponding to the &#x003bd;<sub>1</sub> symmetric stretching mode of the phosphate group of hydroxyapatite and the C-C stretching mode of protein/phosphate stretching mode of DNA and RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).

The value of peak intensity ratio of 961 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>/1007 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, as a biomarker to investigate the extent of bone formation, was 0.82, 0.15 and 0.91 for DMSO, IBMX and IBMX with leptin, respectively. The similar value of 1095 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>/1007 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for DMSO and IBMX with leptin suggests that both samples had the same phosphate group in the backbone conformations of RNA and DNA after embryo development, as compared with the smaller value of 1095 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>/1007 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for IBMX.

However the direct effects of cAMP/PKA on the differentiation of MSCs are not well studied. In the current report, we explored the direct involvement of cAMP/PKA signaling in regulating MSC differentiation and its ability to control osteoclastogenesis. The addition of PKA stimulators in AIM enhanced Oil Red-O staining and the expression of markers for adipocytes (PPAR&#x003b3;2 and LPL), inhibited the expression of markers for osteoblasts (Runx2 and Op), and increased the RANKL/OPG ratio at the mRNA level. We further demonstrated that PKA stimulators repressed leptin synthesis and secretion in MSCs and that the effects of PKA stimulators on MSCs were blocked by the administration of exogenous leptin. These data suggest that PKA stimulators exerted their effects on MSCs via the repression of endogenous leptin. Furthermore, the direct participation of CREB in the effects of PKA stimulators was demonstrated through the use of a DN CREB plasmid, which blocked the effects of the PKA stimulator when transfected into cells before differentiation. These results suggest that cAMP-dependent PKA activity is sufficient to increase CREB activity and to regulate three distinct lineage differentiations (adipogenesis, osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis) that are involved in bone homeostasis.</p><p>However, the effects of IBMX, forskolin and Sp-cAMP on levels of gene expression were inconsistent in some situations, such as the mRNA level of Runx2 after stimulation with Sp-cAMP for 7 days. To understand the underlying mechanism, the abilities of these three reagents to activate PKA have been compared with those of IBMX and forskolin stronger than that of Sp-cAMP (data not shown), which may be used to explain how cells treated with Sp-cAMP still expressed Runx2.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies established that leptin enhanced the osteogenesis of human stromal cells, increased mineralization of the extracellular matrix, but inhibited adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Thomas1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Chang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the current study, we found that the induction of adipogenesis in MSCs was associated with a decrease in leptin secretion and gene expression. The suppression of leptin expression is believed to play a role in the initiation of adipogenesis because the administration of exogenous leptin inhibited adipogenesis. The addition of exogenous leptin from 0.6 to 3 &#x000b5;g/mL not only inhibited the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2, but also stimulated the expression of Runx2 and the ratio of RANKL/OPG gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that leptin functions as a molecule rheostat that modulates bone homeostasis. Similar in <italic>in vitro</italic> MSC cultures, the role of leptin on bone homeostasis was also demonstrated in bone development of the <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish model. Although plasma leptin levels were reported with diurnal variation and variant among individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Schoeller1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, a significant relationship was observed between plasma leptin concentration, and the bone mineral mass and density in healthy elderly men and women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Zoico1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and the presence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Yamauchi1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. These results further support our finding that cAMP/PKA signaling inhibited bone formation by suppressing leptin.</p><p>Bone formation has been studied over the past 20 years by investigating the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast function based on the concept that bone homeostasis is controlled by these two cells. In the current paper, we propose a new bone metabolic unit which highlights the role of MSCs, and upon which we identified cAMP/PKA signaling, one of the many signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis, which might determine the constitution of the cellular components via directing adipogenesis, osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis by controlling the release of leptin from MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001540-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This new concept has been supported by a study on MSC differentiation, which has shown that a 14-3-3-binding protein, TAZ, co-activates Runx2-dependent gene transcription while repressing PPAR&#x003b3;2-dependent gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Hong1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The concept is further supported by a most recent study by Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001540-Zhao1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. They wisely identified 53 endogenous candidate suppressors of osteogenic specification by screening a synthetic SiRNA library targeting 5,000 human genes, which when silenced could initiate differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. 11 of those selected SiRNAs inhibited adipogenic differentiation of MSCs under conditions that induce adipogenic differentiation. Furthermore, cAMP was also identified to play opposing roles in osteogenesis vs. adipogenesis. The results from this and other studies show that the MSCs may be used to elucidate molecular signaling on the regulation of adult bone homeostasis by investigating the potential to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts and to regulate osteoclastogenesis by changing the ratio of RANKL/OPG gene expression.</p><fig id="pone-0001540-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001540.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed model of bone metabolic unit with the mesenchymal stem cell in the center.</title><p>cAMP/PKA, one of the signaling pathways of bone homeostasis, regulating cyto-differentiation and osteoclast-inducing potential of MSCs by suppressing leptin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001540.g006"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001540.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The adipogenic differentiation of primary MSCs as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining.
