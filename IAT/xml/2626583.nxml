The poor prognosis of the patients with advanced stage ovarian cancerovarian cancer is largely attributed to the advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Despite the therapeutic advance, the 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer still remains at 15&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These poor outcomes are due mainly to the progression and metastasis of the disease after the standard surgical treatment. Clearly, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of ovarian carcinomas is needed to control the disease.</p><p>IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein and binds to a diverse array of signaling and structural molecules, such as F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], CLIP-170 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and small GTPases (Cdc42 and Rac1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that IQGAP1 expression is up-regulated in human colorectal carcinoma, especially in invasion front [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, IQGAP1 has been suggested to regulate Salmonella invasion through interactions with actin, Rac1, and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We have also reported that IQGAP1 was overexpressed in ovarian adenocarcinomas compared with adenomas and borderline tumors and its expression significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These lines of evidence have suggested the functional linkage between IQGAP1 and ovarian cancer invasion. However, the exact mechanisms by which IQGAP1 regulates invasion and metastasis of ovarian carcinomas have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) was a recently discovered antiviral mechanism in plants and invertebrates induced by small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which will lead to sequence-specific gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) driven by polymerase III promoters have been investigated as an alternative strategy to suppress gene expression more stably, and such constructs with well-defined initiation and termination sites have been used to produce various small dsRNA species that inhibit the expression of genes with diverse functions in mammalian cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of IQGAP1 silencing on cell invasion and migration, and explored it as a therapeutic target for metastasis of human ovarian carcinoma cells. We showed that a significant reduction in IQGAP1 expression can markedly inhibit the invasion and migration potentials of ovarian cancer HO-8910PM cells. Thus, our results provide new evidence of the potential use of IQGAP1-targeted RNAi as a novel way to reduce tumor progression of patients with ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, HO-8910 (a human ovarian cancer cell line established from a patient with poorly-differentiated serous carcinoma) and HO-8910PM (a highly metastatic cell line derived from HO-8910) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD).

Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that IQGAP1 may be critical for conferring invasive potential in various human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have reported that of IQGAP1 was a novel marker of poor outcome in patients with ovarian carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present study, we have shown that ovarian cancer cell line HO-8910PM, which expresses high levels of endogenous IQGAP1, showed extremely high invasive abilities through the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel. Furthermore, gene silencing for IQGAP1 in HO-8910PM cells resulted in reduced cell migration. This was consistent with previous findings that down-regulation of IQGAP1 by IQGAP1-specific siRNAs effectively blocks HA-CD44-stimulated SK-OV-3 ovarian tumor cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. More importantly, we first demonstrated that knockdown of IQGAP1 also led to attenuated Matrigel invasiveness, suggesting that therapies targeting IQGAP1 activity may prove efficacious for treating ovarian cancer metastasis. Moreover, accumulating evidences have shownthat non-viral vectors will be an attractive alternative to viral vectors due to their safety, versatility and ease of preparation and scale-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Intravenous delivery of liposome-mediated nonviral DNA has also been proved to be less toxic than intraperitoneal delivery in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we will further investigate the effects of IQGAP1-shRNA plasmids by intravenous administration on ovarian cancer metastasis in animal models.</p><p>In addition, recent study demonstrated that IQGAP1 stimulated proliferation of human breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, our result indicated that IQGAP1-specific shRNA did not influence cell proliferation in HO-8910PM cells, suggesting that IQGAP1 may induce cell proliferation rate in a cell type-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that IQGAP1 plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>The acquisition of invasive potential by tumor cells is undoubtedly a complex process. Degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membrane, promotion of cell motility and enhanced tumor cell proliferation are thought to be essential steps. It has been shown that IQGAP1 captures and stabilizes microtubules through the microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 near the cell cortex, leading to establishment of polarized cell morphology and directional cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, IQGAP1 regulates Salmonella invasion through interactions with actin, Rac1, and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To gain full understanding of molecular mechanisms by which IQGAP1 regulates cell invasion, DNA microarray analysis was further needed to identify key genes involved in IQGAP1-dependent ovarian cancer cell invasiveness.</p><p>Inhibiting the expression of pathogenic genes by shRNA-induced RNA interference has proved to be a successful approach to reducing the malignance of different tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, we selectively silenced IQGAP1 expression in human ovarian cancer cells by exploiting RNAi technology. Furthermore, selective inhibition of IQGAP1 significantly reduced metastatic potential of IQGAP1-expressing human ovarian cancer cell in vitro by affecting multiple aspects of tumor invasion, raising the possibility that RNA interference against IQGAP1 is an effective strategy for anti-metastasis of IQGAP1 expressing ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer, and it is the leading cause of death from all types of gynecologic cancer. It is urgent to develop new therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancers. In this report, the knockdown of IQGAP1 expression by RNAi can successfully reverse the malignant behaviors of ovarian cancer cells, implicating that IQGAP1 may be a new candidate of drug target for treatment of ovarian cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PXD designed research; PXD, NJ, ZJX and YTL carried out the molecular genetic studies; PXD, DJL and YJF analyzed data; PXD wrote the paper.
