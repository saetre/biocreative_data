In the longitudinal muscle layer Hic-5 was readily detectable by d15 and thereafter and primarily associated at myometrial cell membranes. Co-immunofluorescence analysis of potential Hic-5 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) association in situ demonstrated a limited level of co-localization on d19, d23 and PP in the circular muscle layer while in the longitudinal muscle layer Hic-5 and FAK were readily co-localized at myometrial cell membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hic-5 is highly expressed in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy and labour and co-localizes with FAK in situ.

During late pregnancy, the uterus undergoes a modification under the influence of mechanical signals (uterine stretch) and endocrine or paracrine signals of maternal and fetal origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The end result is a collective alteration in the uterine smooth muscle or myometrium, termed myometrial activation that is marked at the molecular level by the increased expression of a group of genes encoding contraction-associated proteins (CAPs) such as gap junctions and oxytocin receptors [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]]. As a result of myometrial activation, at term the uterine musculature is responsive to uterotonins, spontaneously active, and excitable.</p><p>It is now appreciated that myometrial growth and remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts or focal adhesions during late pregnancy may be a critical aspect of myometrial activation and thus labour. During mid to late pregnancy in the rat, circulating levels of progesterone and uterine distension induced by growing fetuses leads to hypertrophic growth of the myometrium and significant myometrial tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Specifically in the rat, expression of type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin are markedly increased and the proteins deposited around myometrial cells during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Such tissue remodeling necessitates the reorganization of focal adhesions during late pregnancy to properly anchor growing myometrial cells to their ECM. Focal adhesions develop as a result of ligand-induced clustering of cell surface ECM receptors named integrins. They can mediate tension transmission between the contractile apparatus of the cell and ECM and also associate with various adapter proteins, kinases or growth factor receptors to connect them to the actin cytoskeleton and/or trigger biochemical signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A regulator of focal adhesion reorganization named <underline>f</underline>ocal <underline>a</underline>dhesion <underline>k</underline>inase (FAK) was reported to be highly expressed and activated in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy and a FAK-binding adapter protein termed paxillin, which is involved in focal adhesion formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], was also highly tyrosine phosphorylated during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have also recently demonstrated that &#x003b1;5 integrin expression is elevated in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy and labour and may facilitate myometrial cell cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, Shynlova and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have shown that &#x003b3;-actin expression in the rat is markedly upregulated during mid and late pregnancy. Specifically, detection of &#x003b3;-actin by immunohistochemistry demonstrated that during late pregnancy &#x003b3;-actin became concentrated close to the cell membrane as a continuous ring. The authors have suggested that upregulation of &#x003b3;-actin expression may contribute to myometrial hypertrophy and is likely a marker of the differentiated state of the tissue at this time.</p><p>Recently, Kuo and Seow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] demonstrated that appropriate cytoskeletal filament organization, focal adhesion formation, and cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions were necessary in airway smooth muscle cells within a tissue bundle to function as a <italic>mechanical syncytium </italic>during contraction. We have since suggested that such a syncytium model of contraction may be relevant in the myometrium, as a component of the activation process, to facilitate efficient force transduction of the sustained, coordinated and powerful contractions of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A stumbling block to determining whether a mechanical syncytium indeed develops in the myometrium during late pregnancy is the paucity of information concerning the components of focal adhesions and the molecular mechanisms of integrin-mediated signaling in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy and labour.</p><p>A focal adhesion protein that appears important for integrin-mediated signaling is <underline>h</underline>ydrogen peroxide <underline>i</underline>nducible <underline>c</underline>lone-5 (Hic-5). Hic-5 is a paxillin homologue that was originally discovered as a transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF &#x003b2;1) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inducible gene by differential hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Analogous to paxillin, Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions via its C &#x02013; terminal LIM (derived from the founders <underline>L</underline>IN-11, <underline>I</underline>sl1, <underline>M</underline>EC-3) 2 and LIM 3 domains and also binds FAK likely via a leucine rich domain (LD) 3 in the N &#x02013; terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, Hic-5 has been shown to compete with paxillin for FAK binding and control cell spreading thus providing a novel mechanism for regulation of integrin-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that Hic-5 expression, unlike paxillin, was primarily found in mononuclear smooth muscle including the non-pregnant mouse and human myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and transient over-expression of Hic-5 in SVS30 smooth muscle cells, embedded in 3D collagen gels, suppressed their contractile capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Based on such reports, the goal of this study was to characterize Hic-5 mRNA and protein expression in the rat myometrium during pregnancy in order to begin assessing its potential role in integrin-mediated signaling and the development of a mechanical syncytium in this smooth muscle tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the Mount Scio Vivarium (Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada).

Virgin female rats (~220 g each) were mated with stud males and observation of vaginal plugs the following morning was designated day 1 post coitum.

Labour samples were taken during active labour and only after the rat had delivered two to three pups.</p></sec><sec><title>Progesterone-delayed labour</title><p>The onset of labour in the rat on d23 of gestation is coupled with a withdrawal of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on the myometrium following a fall in plasma levels of this steroid. To determine whether maintenance of elevated circulating levels of progesterone during late pregnancy could positively modulate Hic-5 expression, pregnant rats were given either a daily injection of progesterone (4 mg, sc, in 0.2 mL corn oil), to maintain elevated plasma levels of this steroid, or vehicle alone (corn oil, 0.2 mL sc) beginning on d20 of gestation. This regime of progesterone administration resulted in delayed labour on d23.

This timeframe of gestation is characterized by hypertrophic growth of the myometrium, induced by progesterone and uterine distension caused by growing fetuses, and follows a period of myometrial hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. With the switch to hypertrophic myometrial growth, and associated ECM reorganization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], focal adhesion remodeling must occur to support these processes and this remodeling can occur in a tension-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, it is possible the increase in Hic-5 mRNA expression we observed may be induced by increased uterine stretch; however, at present there have been no reports of Hic-5 mRNA expression being regulated by mechanical forces. In relation to the observed increases in Hic-5 mRNA expression, in both smooth muscle layers of the myometrium Hic-5 protein became more readily detectable by immunofluorescence at ~d15 &#x02013; d17 of gestation. This could be the result of translation of the increased levels of Hic-5 mRNA that were detected at approximately this time.</p><p>Of note, our immunoblot analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant increases in Hic-5 detection in the rat myometrium throughout the time course examined, in contrast to Hic-5 mRNA expression. Since we found muscle layer-specific differences in Hic-5 expression by immunofluorescence analysis, we believe that a lack of significant detection differences in Hic-5 protein over gestation by immunoblot analysis may be due to "averaging" of Hic-5 protein levels within total protein lysates prepared from myometrial tissue samples containing both muscle layers.</p><p>Immunofluorescence experiments not only demonstrated that Hic-5 was more detectable in the longitudinal muscle layer than the circular layer of the myometrium, but that the spatial pattern of expression of Hic-5 differed at times between the two muscle layers. In the circular muscle layer, Hic-5 was detectable both in the cytoplasm and associated with membranes of myometrial cells while in the longitudinal muscle layer, particularly after d12, Hic-5 was detectable primarily at myometrial cell membranes. The functional consequences of these patterns of expression are unclear, but the two muscle layers do possess different embryological origins, contractile and physiological characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>From mid-pregnancy onwards, circumferential uterine growth occurs in association with fetal growth and uterine tension is likely predominant in the circular muscle layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, Hic-5 protein detection in the cytoplasm of myometrial cells of the circular layer may be a response, at least in part, to uterine stretch. Recently, Guignandon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and Kim-Kaneyama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] have shown that Hic-5 protein expression can be responsive to mechanical stretching relocalizing from focal adhesions to the cytoskeleton in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, COS7 cells, Ros 17/2.8 osteoblast-like cells, and SVS30 smooth muscle cells. Our future work with a unilaterally pregnant rat model will more specifically determine the role of uterine stretch as a regulatory mechanism for both Hic-5 mRNA and protein expression in the myometrium. Interestingly, the transient over-expression of Hic-5 in SVS30 smooth muscle cells, embedded in 3D collagen gels, suppressed their contractile capability and this was dependent on Hic-5 association with the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, based on this work it may be possible that Hic-5 has a role in suppressing myometrial cell contraction, particularly in the circular muscle layer, from mid to late pregnancy.</p><p>During late pregnancy, labour, and PP, Hic-5 became more continuously associated at myometrial cell membranes; in the circular muscle on d22 and d23 and in the longitudinal muscle layer between d17 and PP. The over-expression of Hic-5 in fibroblasts is known to significantly reduce cell spreading on fibronectin and stimulate motility of murine mammary gland cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Both events are associated with prevention of stable focal adhesion formation, suggesting that in the myometrium during late pregnancy Hic-5 may be involved in focal adhesion remodeling which would correlate with the marked reorganization of the ECM in the rat uterus at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A primary mechanism of Hic-5 regulation of cell spreading appears to involve competing for FAK binding with paxillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and this may also occur in myometrial cells since both FAK and paxillin are expressed in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of progesterone on Hic-5 expression</title><p>Throughout the majority of rat pregnancy circulating levels of progesterone are high, with levels of 25.7 ng/mL by d19 declining to 1.14 &#x000b1; 0.52 ng/mL by d23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Since Hic-5 mRNA expression increased significantly at d19 and d21, periods associated with the high circulating levels of progesterone, we investigated whether maintenance of elevated circulating levels of progesterone in the rat from d21-23 might modulate Hic-5 mRNA expression. Indeed, administration of progesterone to pregnant rats significantly increased levels of Hic-5 mRNA on d23 (delayed labour) compared to d23 vehicle controls (active labour) suggesting progesterone may have a role in regulating Hic-5 mRNA expression. This role might be indirect, perhaps resulting from the prevention of labour contractions per se, or may be direct via transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Since it was possible that an averaging of Hic-5 protein levels could be occurring in our immunoblot analysis, we directly examined Hic-5 protein detection and spatial localization in rat myometrial tissue in situ following administration of progesterone or vehicle alone. The lack of any marked changes in immunofluorescent detection of Hic-5 protein in myometrial tissue sections from progesterone-treated rats, compared to vehicle controls, suggests that the potential effects of progesterone on Hic-5 gene expression may only be manifested at the transcriptional level. We cannot rule out, however, that the discrepancy between Hic-5 mRNA and protein expression in our progesterone study could be due to a relatively longer half-life of Hic-5 protein relative to Hic-5 mRNA. In future experiments, we will administer the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486 (or vehicle) to pregnant rats to induce pre-term labour and more definitively determine if progesterone has a role in the regulation of Hic-5 gene expression in the myometrium.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunofluorescent detection of FAK and Hic-5</title><p>FAK has previously been shown to be highly expressed and activated in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy, at a time when there is substantial remodeling of the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hic-5 is reported to associate with FAK in epithelial cells and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], but whether this association occurs in the myometrium is unknown. Thus, we examined the likelihood of Hic-5/FAK association by co-immunofluorescence analysis. Our experiments revealed that in the circular muscle layer there was a potentially limited level of Hic-5/FAK association both in the cytoplasm and at membranes of myometrial cells during late pregnancy, labour and post-partum. In contrast, there appears to be a potentially high level of association of Hic-5/FAK primarily at myometrial cell membranes of the longitudinal muscle layer. Thus, at least during these gestational timepoints in the rat myometrium there is a good probability of focal adhesion signaling involving a FAK-Hic-5 protein complex.</p></sec><sec><title>The role(s) of Hic-5 during pregnancy</title><p>Scaffolding proteins, like Hic-5, contain modular protein-binding domains that allow them to mediate many protein-protein interactions simultaneously, thus acting as hubs for the integration of a variety of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We did not detect Hic-5 in cell nuclei in either smooth muscle layer under our experimental conditions. Hic-5 can shuttle between focal adhesions and the nucleus and several reports indicate that Hic-5 can participate in the transcriptional regulation of the c-fos gene, as a scaffold in transcriptional complexes, and can also act as a steroid receptor coactivator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We cannot completely rule out such roles for Hic-5 in the myometrium during pregnancy, but our results at this time suggest that its primary role in the myometrium during late pregnancy may lie close to or at the myometrial cell membrane as a focal adhesion scaffolding protein. The LIM and LD domains in the Hic-5 molecule which can mediate protein-protein interactions would support this task and Hic-5 is reported to bind several focal adhesion proteins such as Hsp27, vinculin, paxillin, and FAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. All four of these latter proteins have also been readily detected in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and our co-localization experiments have indicated that there is a good probability of focal adhesion signaling involving a FAK-Hic-5 protein complex during late pregnancy. Since focal adhesions function as cytoskeletal attachment sites and likely assist in the transduction of force across the muscle to create a mechanical syncytium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], modulation of FAK/paxillin complexing by Hic-5 may be an important signaling mechanism for development of such a mechanical syncytium during late pregnancy prior to the onset of labour. Thus, this study serves as the foundation for more specific analyses of the role of Hic-5 in FAK/Paxillin complexing, focal adhesion remodeling, and myometrial cell contraction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hic-5 is highly expressed in the rat myometrium during late pregnancy and labour and co-localizes with FAK in situ.
