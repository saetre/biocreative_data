Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that plectin deficiency results in progressive degenerative alterations in striated muscle, including aggregation and partial loss of intermediate filament (IF) networks, detachment of the contractile apparatus from the sarcolemma, profound changes in myofiber costameric cytoarchitecture, and decreased mitochondrial number and function. Analysis of newly generated plectin isoform&#x02013;specific knockout mouse models revealed that IF aggregates accumulate in distinct cytoplasmic compartments, depending on which isoform is missing. Our data show that two major plectin isoforms expressed in muscle, plectin 1d and 1f, integrate fibers by specifically targeting and linking desmin IFs to Z-disks and costameres, whereas plectin 1b establishes a linkage to mitochondria. Furthermore, disruption of Z-disk and costamere linkages leads to the pathological condition of epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy. Our findings establish plectin as the major organizer of desmin IFs in myofibers and provide new insights into plectin- and desmin-related muscular dystrophies.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: &#x003b2;-DG, &#x003b2;-dystroglycan; CNF, centrally nucleated fiber; COX, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase; CSA, cross-sectional area; DGC, dystrophin&#x02013;glycoprotein complex; DRM, desmin-related myopathy; EBD, Evans blue dye; EB-MD, epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; H &#x00026; E, hematoxylin and eosin; IF, intermediate filament; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermediate filament (IF)-based cytoskeletal linker proteins (cytolinkers) comprise a growing number of proteins that play a major role in maintaining cell integrity, especially in tissues that are exposed to constant mechanical stress such as skin and skeletal muscle. Because of its versatility, abundance, and widespread distribution, plectin, a 500-kD protein with multiple binding activities, plays a key role among cytolinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiche, 1998</xref>). It cross-links cytoskeletal filament systems and connects them to plasma membrane junctional complexes and organelles in a wide variety of cell types. Moreover, plectin creates scaffolding platforms for signaling molecules, exceeding its cytolinker function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A unique feature of plectin is its transcript diversity, which is largely based on different N-terminal sequences encoded by alternatively spliced first exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 1999</xref>). Of the dozen isoforms identified to date, the ones most prominently expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle are plectin 1, 1b, 1d, and 1f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, we found that plectin isoforms 1 and 1f are localized at costameres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rezniczek et al., 2007</xref>), which are protein assemblies surrounding the contractile apparatus and linking it via the sarcolemma to the extracellular lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ervasti, 2003</xref>). In contrast, plectin 1d specifically associated with Z-disks of cultured myotubes, whereas plectin 1b colocalized with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rezniczek et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the plectin gene cause epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy (EB-MD), EB simplex Ogna, and EB with pyloric atresia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pfendner et al., 2005</xref>). EB-MD is characterized by skin blistering and late-onset, progressive muscular dystrophy. Moreover, plectin deficiency in mice leads to early death in postnatal development as a consequence of internal blistering of the oral cavity that disallows food uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andr&#x000e4; et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackerl et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to skin blistering, mutant mice show abnormalities in skeletal and cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andr&#x000e4; et al., 1997</xref>); however, the cause of these pathological changes remains elusive.</p><p>Desmin filaments form the most prominent IF network in striated muscle. They surround myofibrils at the level of Z-disks and extend to the sarcolemma, intercalated disks, and various organelles, including nuclei and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capetanaki et al., 2007</xref>). Mice lacking desmin develop muscular dystrophy characterized by a loss of muscle integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milner et al., 1996</xref>), disorganized mitochondrial networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milner et al., 2000</xref>), and compromised endurance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haubold et al., 2003</xref>). Because plectin has been shown to bind to desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reipert et al., 1999</xref>) and has been implicated in linking desmin IFs to Z-disks and the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hijikata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rezniczek et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that pathological alterations observed in striated muscle of plectin-null mice could be caused by the disruption of desmin IF network organization. Plectin-null mice were unsuitable for assessing this hypothesis because of their early death. Therefore, we took a conditional knockout approach and ablated plectin expression only in striated muscle. In addition, to distinguish between isoform-specific functions, we used two newly generated mouse lines as well as one previously generated mouse line that were deficient in either plectin isoform 1d, 1b, or 1. The full repertoire of mouse models comparatively investigated in this study also comprised a desmin-null and a newly generated desmin/plectin isoform 1d double knockout line.</p><p>We show that plectin deficiency causes detachment of desmin IFs from Z-disks, costameres, mitochondria, and nuclei, leading to the formation of desmin aggregates of distinct morphology and in distinct cytoplasmic compartments, depending on which plectin isoforms are missing. Furthermore, we show that synemin and syncoilin, proteins that have been proposed to anchor desmin IFs to Z-disks and costameres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newey et al., 2001</xref>), in the absence of plectin, are insufficient for desmin IF docking. As a consequence, the sarcolemma becomes detached from the contractile apparatus, Z-disks show misalignments, fibers enlarge, and aggregation and loss of mitochondria occur, with mitochondria-rich soleus being the most severely affected type of muscle. Additionally, profound changes in the costameric lattice of plectin-deficient muscle fibers were detected, including altered levels and locations of proteins with key roles in muscle signaling, such as &#x003b2;-dystroglycan (&#x003b2;-DG), caveolin 3, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Our data suggest that the pathological conditions of EB-MD patients have their etiology in structural changes as well as signaling alterations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Plectin deficiency in striated muscles leads to reduced endurance performance and increased mortality</title><p>To ablate plectin expression specifically in striated muscle, homozygous and heterozygous plectin floxed mice (ple<sup>f/f</sup>, ple<sup>f/&#x0002b;</sup>, and ple<sup>f/&#x02212;</sup>; collectively referred to as f-ple) were bred to muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-Cre mice expressing the Cre transgene under the control of the MCK promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruning et al., 1998</xref>). Conditional knockout mice that were obtained (ple<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup> and ple<sup>&#x00394;/&#x02212;</sup>; referred to as cKO-ple) were born at Mendelian ratios and did not show any overt phenotype within the first months of life. Plectin expression was efficiently ablated in mature skeletal muscle fibers and cardiomyocytes (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711058/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711058/DC1</ext-link>); however, plectin-positive signals were observed in connective tissue cells (Fig. S1 C, arrowheads) and regenerating fibers (Fig. S1 C, arrows), presumably because of the late onset of MCK expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Washabaugh et al., 1999</xref>). Starting from 6 mo of life, cKO-ple mice exhibited decreasing survival rates (Fig. S2 A), and when subjected to voluntary wheel-running, showed a progressive decrease in endurance performance (Fig. S2, C and D). Furthermore, at 16 mo of age, some cKO-ple mice displayed muscle mass loss and kyphosis (Fig. S2 B). Neither in sedentary nor in voluntarily wheel-running mice were dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies observed (unpublished data). Similarly, no obvious phenotype was observed in the morphology of extensor digitorum longus (EDL), which is mostly glycolytic (unpublished data). In contrast, 6-mo-old cKO-ple mice exhibited pathological alterations of mitochondria-rich soleus, manifesting as a pale appearance clearly visible from the eighth week of age and increased weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Onset and progressivity of pathological alterations in cKO-ple mice is muscle type dependent.</bold> (A) Statistical weight analyses of soleus dissected from 6-mo-old f-ple and cKO-ple mice (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14).

In the soleus of 8-wk-old animals, numerous necrotic and centrally nucleated fibers (CNFs), representing regenerating and immature fibers, were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, the inner structure of fibers appeared disorganized, and vast eosinophylic inclusions were observed underneath the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, inset). In older mice, this phenotype was accompanied by hypertrophic and split fibers and a marked increase of connective tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, Sirius red staining). Furthermore, focal subsarcolemmal damage and the detachment of the sarcolemma from the contractile apparatus were visualized by electron microscopy of soleus and diaphragm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The quantification of toluidine blue&#x02013;stained, epoxy resin&#x02013;embedded soleus sections from 8-wk-old cKO-ple mice revealed that &#x0223c;61% of the fibers showed focal detachments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Indicative of a more severe phenotype under stress conditions, in 3-mo-old exercised (voluntarily wheel-running) cKO-ple mice, the amount of CNFs in soleus was markedly higher (&#x0223c;35%) than in sedentary (&#x0223c;22%) cKO-ple littermates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In 12-mo-old exercised cKO-ple mice, the number of soleus CNFs reached &#x0223c;45% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Necrotic, regenerating, split, and hypertrophic fibers could also be observed in EDL and diaphragm (unpublished data). The phenotype, however, was much less severe in these cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). No signs of pathology were observed in the hearts of 12-mo-old cKO-ple mice. In contrast, the hearts of 16-mo-old mice showed markedly increased amounts of connective tissue, which indicates the degeneration of cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>, arrows).</p><p>We next investigated whether the barrier function of cKO-ple myofibers is preserved by measuring the creatine kinase level in serum and by assessing penetration of Evans blue dye (EBD) into muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Straub et al., 1997</xref>). However, creatine kinase levels showed no significant differences between either sedentary or exercised f-ple and cKO-ple mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), nor was an accumulation of EBD found in the interior of cKO-ple soleus or EDL fibers (unpublished data). This indicated that the sarcolemmal integrity of cKO-ple myofibers was unaffected.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of plectin causes aggregation and loss of IFs, Z-disk misalignments, and profound changes in the costameric lattice</title><p>In skeletal muscle of f-ple mice, desmin IFs typically were located at the level of Z-disks and underneath the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, a and c</xref>), overlapping to a high extent with plectin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, a</xref>). In plectin-deficient fibers, this typical pattern was lost and desmin aggregates became apparent in the sarcoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, d</xref>, arrow) and in the subsarcolemmal region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, d</xref>, arrowhead). Furthermore, desmin appeared to be reduced in the interior of fibers, whereas it was increased at the sarcolemma. In plectin-deficient cardiomyocytes as well, the cross-striated desmin pattern was lost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B, b</xref>) and focal disorganization of the contractile apparatus was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B, f</xref>, inset). In contrast, the intercalated disk structures of cardiomyocytes appeared to be intact, with both desmin and desmoplakin showing normal patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B, b and d</xref>, respectively). Thus, the mild cardiac phenotype of cKO-ple mice, as compared with that of des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thornell et al., 1997</xref>), most likely reflects a functional intercalated disk anchorage of desmin IFs through desmoplakin. This notion is consistent with the observation that overexpression of a desmoplakin mutant protein with an incapacitated IF-binding site leads to the detachment of desmin IFs from desmosomes, ultrastructural changes of intercalated disks, and severe cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lack of plectin causes aggregation of IFs and disorganization of the contractile apparatus.</bold> (A) Soleus f-ple (a and c) and cKO-ple (b and d) sections double immunolabeled for plectin and desmin (a and b) or stained for desmin alone (c and d).

In skeletal muscles of f-ple mice, both proteins colocalized with desmin IFs at Z-disks and underneath the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C, a and c</xref>). Intriguingly, in the absence of plectin, synemin and syncoilin lost their typical distribution and coaggregated with desmin IFs, predominantly in the subsarcolemmal region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C, b and d</xref>).</p><p>To optimally visualize protein structures in subsarcolemmal (costameres) and perinuclear regions, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of teased EDL fibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3 A</xref>). In such specimens, colocalization of plectin and desmin was revealed in both costameres and longitudinal perinuclear structures; the latter occasionally formed a continuous band with a row of nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Remarkably, in the absence of plectin, desmin lost its costameric and perinuclear distribution and was found to form vast, longitudinal aggregates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D, b</xref>). Additionally, in all fibers of 4-mo-old cKO-ple mice, &#x003b1;-actinin staining clearly showed misalignment of sarcomeric units (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D, d</xref>). In f-ple teased fibers, the desmin signal overlapped with those of syncoilin and synemin at costameric structures overlying Z-disks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, arrowheads) and/or perpendicular longitudinal lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, arrows). Moreover, it colocalized with cytokeratin IFs and the components of the dystrophin&#x02013;glycoprotein complex (DGC), such as &#x003b2;-DG, dystrophin, nNOS, and syntrophin. In contrast, the distribution of caveolin 3 was mostly complementary to that of desmin. In cKO-ple fibers, the localization of all these proteins was profoundly altered, with synemin and syncoilin coaggregating with desmin, and the other proteins spreading throughout the subsarcolemmal region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). A partially retained cytokeratin network pattern (Z-disk overlying as well as longitudinal structures) observed in fibers revealing desmin aggregates suggested that plectin was dispensable for cytokeratin network anchorage at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ursitti et al., 2004</xref>). Regarding the proposed role of syncoilin and synemin in linking desmin IFs to the sarcolemma and to Z-disks, these results implied that in the absence of plectin, the linkages formed by these proteins were too weak to sustain the desmin-anchoring function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of IFs and profound changes in the costameric lattice of plectin-deficient muscles.</bold> (A) Representative regions of teased EDL fibers from 4-mo-old f-ple and cKO-ple mice stained for proteins as indicated.

The highest difference in protein levels between cKO-ple and f-ple muscles was observed for caveolin 3, which in mutant samples reached &#x0003e;200% of control levels. Among the proteins tested, &#x003b1;-actinin was an exception, as it was decreased in the membrane fraction of cKO-ple mice to a level of &#x0223c;61% compared with f-ple mice, whereas it was unchanged in total lysates, which suggests inefficient anchoring of the &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;based cytoskeleton to the sarcolemma.

In agreement with this notion, light microscopy of ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> soleus revealed frequent detachments of the sarcolemma from &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;positive Z-disks (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, arrows) and an accumulation of mitochondria underneath the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, arrows) and in between myofibrils (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, arrowheads).

Given these data, we reasoned that Z-disk&#x02013;associated plectin 1d not only anchors desmin IFs linking Z-disks but also those connecting the contractile apparatus to the plectin 1f/desmin network&#x02013;based costameric lattice (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we show that plectin deficiency in striated muscle leads to altered levels and localization of costameric and IF proteins, dysfunction and loss of mitochondria, and plectin isoform&#x02013;dependent aggregation of desmin IFs at distinct locations. Our data demonstrate that plectin controls desmin IF and mitochondria network organization in muscle fibers with severe consequences for mitochondrial function and proper energy supply. Additionally, we show that plectin and desmin networks may play a profound role in fiber regeneration. Based on these results, we suggest that the progressive muscle wasting observed in EB-MD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pfendner et al., 2005</xref>) is caused by fiber death combined with inefficient regeneration.</p><sec><title>Different etiology of desmin aggregates in EB-MD and desmin-related myopathies (DRMs)</title><p>Disrupted desmin patterns have previously been described in patients with DRMs, which are mainly caused by mutations in desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldfarb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munoz-Marmol et al., 1998</xref>) and &#x003b1;B-crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vicart et al., 1998</xref>) genes, and in a few cases of EB-MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gache et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schr&#x000f6;der et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMillan et al., 2007</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that DRM and EB-MD have different etiology. DRM is caused by either aberrant filament assembly or a lack of the chaperon-like functions provided by &#x003b1;B-crystallin that normally prevent desmin aggregation under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of plectin, desmin aggregation is apparently a consequence of missing connections between desmin IFs and other structures, loose (unanchored) filament ends, or both. Consistent with this notion, we observed that plectin was properly localized at Z-disks and costameres of des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Importantly, because cKO-ple mice were used in our study, we could rule out the possibility that desmin coaggregated with self-aggregating plectin mutant forms, as it might be the case in EB-MD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2001</xref>). On this basis, our data suggest that plectin plays a dominant role in desmin IF network organization in muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec><title>Do desmin aggregates poison muscle?</title><p>As we observed different patterns of aggregate formation in cKO-ple and ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, differences in the progressivity of the observed phenotypes could be explained by the toxicity of IF aggregates. The involvement of IF aggregates in cell death was implicated not only in DRM and Alexander's disease but also in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Moreover, in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, IFs were found to be a component of the inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairns et al., 2004</xref>). Although the toxicity of aggregates remains elusive, it could be that abnormal proteins interact and recruit other cellular components and thus affect homeostasis. Another possibility is that aggregates cause aberrant protein turnover by inhibiting the proteasome or altering autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rubinsztein, 2006</xref>). The cumulative processes of either of these events could account for the observed differences in phenotypes of cKO-ple and ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Plectin 1d integrates the contractile apparatus, whereas plectin 1f organizes the costameric lattice</title><p>Our studies on plectin isoform&#x02013;specific knockout mice revealed that plectin 1d maintains the integrity of muscle fibers at the level of Z-disks by anchoring desmin IFs to adjacent myofibrils and connecting the contractile apparatus as a whole to costamere-associated desmin IFs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This model is supported by our previous study showing that GFP&#x02013;plectin 1d fusion proteins expressed in myotubes were exclusively localized at Z-disks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rezniczek et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, in ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> samples, the localization of costameric marker proteins appeared unaffected, and desmin aggregates were observed only in the fiber interior, whereas changes in the organization of the costameric lattice were observed in cKO-ple mice and also in des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Neill et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that in the absence of plectin 1d, the remaining unaffected costameric isoform 1f was able to anchor desmin IFs to the DGC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) and thus provided a scaffold for other costameric proteins. The observed hypertrophy in cKO-ple, ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> muscles presumably was a consequence of reduced compactness of the fiber interior due to the absence of integrating plectin and desmin IF arrays. However, it cannot be excluded that this phenotype was caused by the activation of NFAT or MEF2 family members, which are known to cause muscle hypertrophy in response to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olson and Williams, 2000</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme depicting the different anchoring functions proposed for the four major plectin isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle.</bold> Plectin 1d, 1f, 1b, and 1 link desmin IFs with Z-disks, costameres (DGC), mitochondria, and the outer nuclear/ER membrane system, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810667f08"></graphic></fig><p>Measurements of creatine kinase activity in serum of either sedentary or exercised mice revealed no significant differences between f-ple and cKO-ple mice.

Based on our immunoblotting data in gastrocnemius lysates and microsomes showing increased amounts of costameric marker proteins, we hypothesize that the apparently unaffected integrity of the sarcolemma in both cKO-ple and des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is caused by the increased recruitment of DGC and integrin complex constituents. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that increased sarcolemmal permeability in mdx muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Straub et al., 1997</xref>) is accompanied by a reduction of DGC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohlendieck and Campbell, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for plectin 1b linking mitochondria with desmin IFs</title><p>In ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we found residual plectin associated with mitochondria and colocalization of aggregated desmin and mitochondrial aggregates in-between myofibrils. Such colocalization was rarely observed in the case of cKO-ple fibers. This difference could be explained if one assumes that the localization of plectin 1b in ple1d<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was unaffected and that the protein was still bound to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This would be in agreement with a previous study that revealed the association of plectin with two different populations of IFs in the interior of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reipert et al., 1999</xref>), namely the prominent IF belt structure along Z-disks and IFs spanning from myofibrils to adjacent mitochondria. Moreover, forced expression of plectin 1b in cultured cells showed colocalization of this isoform with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rezniczek et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>), and an abnormal morphology of mitochondria was observed in plectin 1b&#x02013;deficient fibroblasts (unpublished data).</p><p>Mitochondrial aggregates have previously been revealed in des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milner et al., 2000</xref>) and in one case of EB-MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schr&#x000f6;der et al., 2002</xref>). However, the involvement of plectin and desmin in mitochondrial network organization is still controversial, as other EB-MD patients revealed no or only marginal disruption of mitochondria distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMillan et al., 2007</xref>). The present study showed a severe disorganization of mitochondrial networks in muscles from plectin-deficient mice. Furthermore, markedly reduced mitochondria levels, a decrease in mitochondrial complex I activity, and a loss of creatine kinase coupling with adenine nucleotide translocator (Table S1) were observed. Because our data indicate that mitochondria are anchored into desmin network arrays via plectin, it is possible that the absence of either plectin or desmin results in insufficient spatial separation of mitochondria leading to their aggregation. Alternatively, plectin isoform 1b may interact directly or indirectly with mitochondrial effectors and thereby regulate their functions.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies uncovered a crucial role of plectin in preserving the functional integrity of the skeletal muscle fiber. The results indicate that plectin deficiency causes dysfunction and loss of mitochondria leading to energy deprivation and fiber death. Using a conditional knockout mouse model in combination with isoform-specific knockouts, we demonstrated that the integrity of the desmin IF network depends on plectin isoform&#x02013;mediated specific targeting of filaments to distinct docking sites. These multiple new knockout mouse models may also be useful for developing therapies for plectin- and desmin-related myopathies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments involving animals were performed in agreement with Austrian Federal Government laws and regulations. cKO-ple mice (ple<sup>&#x00394;/&#x02212;</sup>, ple<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup>) were obtained through multiple crossing steps.
