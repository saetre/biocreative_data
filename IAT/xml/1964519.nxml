Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1, also known as PC-1) has been recently reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and related diseases. However, its role on adipose tissue physiology as a mechanism of systemic insulin resistance is not understood.

Adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia are physiologic responses to energy excess that, if protracted, determine onset of obesity. This process often associates with abnormal adipose tissue function so that further triglyceride storage becomes inefficient. Consequent changes in plasma adipokine concentrations have the effect of modifying glucose and lipid metabolism in various tissues and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Matsuzawa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This contributes to the clustering of metabolic abnormalities typically found in patients with the metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Reaven1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. One important aspect of adipose tissue dysfunction is increased fatty acid spillover in the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Miles1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, a condition that negatively impacts insulin-mediated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Koutsari1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This results in susceptibility to insulin resistance and its associated complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-McGarry1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has become increasingly recognized that the ability of adipose tissue to expand in response to energy excess, i.e. adipocyte maturation, is important in determining systemic abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. For example, patients with lipodystrophy are unable to store even small amount of triglycerides due to either total or partial absence of adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Garg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Excessive caloric intake in these patients translates into high plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), increased triglyceride storage in lean tissues, severe insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This condition has been observed to a lesser degree also in the so called &#x0201c;metabolically obese lean persons&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Ruderman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Ruderman2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that metabolically obese lean persons are unable to respond to caloric excess by increasing adipocyte maturation. Defective adipocyte maturation would then lead to excessive plasma NEFA and insulin resistance at lower body mass index (BMI). On the other hand, adipocyte maturation induced by thiazolindiones often resolves abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism. Therefore, understanding the role played by mediators of adipocyte maturation could provide important insight into the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the absence of overt obesity.</p><p>It has been previously reported that the transmembrane glycoprotein ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1; also known as plasma cell membrane glycoprotein PC-1) could be mechanistically linked to insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>ENPP1</italic> interacts with the insulin receptor and inhibits subsequent signaling by decreasing its &#x0005b;beta&#x0005d; -subunit autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Experiments were repeated 3 times.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000882.g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding of this study is that <italic>ENPP1</italic> expression is involved in regulation of adipocyte maturation, a mechanism that may contribute to systemic fatty acid and glucose metabolism maintenance during weight gain. We first found that <italic>ENPP1</italic> is highly regulated during adipogenesis. We also found that its increased interaction with the insulin receptor not only associates with defective cellular insulin signaling, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, but also with defective adipocyte maturation.</p><p>Previous investigations have suggested that <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression specifically induces defective insulin signaling in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Belfiore1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect has also been observed with the common <italic>ENPP1 K121Q</italic> genetic variant, and attributed to a stronger interaction between the non-catalytic domains of the mutated ENPP1 with the insulin receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequent reduction in insulin signaling transduction from the &#x003b1;- to the &#x003b2;-subunit of the insulin receptor would reduce the ability of insulin to stimulate downstream signaling cascade. According to this view, <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression in liver and muscle, two main tissues involved in insulin-mediated regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, determines insulin resistance and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Recent animal models over-expressing <italic>ENPP1</italic> in liver and in other tissues, including muscle, have shown insulin resistant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Dong1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these animal models have not included <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression in adipose tissue. The possibility that <italic>ENPP1</italic>, would impact glucose and lipid metabolism through an effect on adipocyte function had not been previously evaluated. This seems to be of importance in light of the high expression of <italic>ENPP1</italic> in human adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Meyre1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and in light of the role that adipose tissue function plays in the pathogenesis of systemic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have recently shown an interaction between <italic>ENPP1 121Q</italic> variant and BMI in humans in predicting insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Abate1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Abate2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In those studies we have suggested that lack of inclusion of this variable may contribute to the apparent discrepancy among published genetic association studies on <italic>ENPP1 K121Q</italic> and type 2 diabetes. Although previous studies in 3T3-L1 have failed to detect effects of <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression on cellular insulin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Sakoda1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, our results show that <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression can impair insulin receptor activation in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000882-g004">figure 4</xref>). This apparent discrepancy could be related to the different approach used to obtain <italic>ENPP1</italic> over-expression in 3T3-L1. We used a pQCXIP-ENPP1 vector to obtain stable transfected cell lines, as opposed to the adenovirus system used in the study by Sakoda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Sakoda1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A novel finding of our study is that <italic>ENPP1</italic> is highly regulated during adipogenesis. Although we did not address the mechanistic details of <italic>ENPP1</italic> regulation, we determined that <italic>ENPP1</italic> expression is coordinated with changes in expression of genes that are known to be involved in the adipocyte maturation progress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000882-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Linhart1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Fu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We also show that over-expression of <italic>ENPP1</italic> in transfected 3T3-L1 cells will affect maturation process in association with decreased insulin-mediated activation of insulin receptor and with insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin increases the percentage of cells that differentiate, and also increases the amount of lipid accumulation in each fat cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Girard1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Although other mechanisms mediating <italic>ENPP1</italic> effect on adipogenesis cannot be excluded, the possibility exists that interference with insulin receptor function plays a role in modulation of adipocyte maturation. Therefore, the results of our study support the new hypothesis that inheritance of the common genetic variant <italic>ENPP1 K121Q</italic>, a gain of function on the <italic>ENPP1</italic>-induced insulin receptor inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Maddux2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, would predispose individuals to decreased ability in forming mature adipocyte when storage of excessive energy intake is needed. As a consequence, decreased fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and/or excessive lipolysis could cause high plasma NEFA concentrations, hyperinsulinemia and defective insulin-mediated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle. <italic>ENPP1 K121Q</italic> has been previously associated with human obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Meyre1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, whether this association was related to coexisting confounding factors, such as diabetes, is not clear. In fact, other studies have suggested an association with decreased body mass index (BMI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Prudente1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, mechanisms for adipogenesis and onset of obesity are complex, and alternative pathways can compensate for the inhibitory effects of <italic>ENPP1</italic> on adipogenesis. Regardless, the effects of increased <italic>ENPP1</italic> expression on adipocyte maturation could have a negative influence on the overall adipose tissue ability to compensate for excessive caloric intake and maintain normal systemic glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>The results of our study and the high frequency of <italic>ENPP1 K121Q</italic> in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Chandalia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> support the view that among the various described mechanisms of insulin resistance mediated by defective adipogenesis, such as in lipodystrophy models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Chen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Laustsen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, in defective <italic>PPAR-&#x003b3;</italic> function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Zhang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and in Pref-1 overproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Lee1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>ENPP1</italic> expression and its K121Q variant are likely to explain a large portion of the &#x0201c;garden variety&#x0201d; insulin resistance we find in people at relatively low body mass index (BMI). ENPP1 K121Q could be an important determinant of genetic susceptibility to insulin resistance and may provide a useful clinical marker and a therapeutic target for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In summary, the results of our studies support a role of increased <italic>ENPP1</italic> expression in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in humans. In addition to previously proposed mechanisms of systemic insulin resistance mediated by effects of <italic>ENPP1</italic> on cellular insulin function in hepatocyte and myocyte, we suggest that its effect on glucose metabolism is, at least in part, mechanistically linked to <italic>ENPP1</italic>-induced inhibition of adipocyte maturation. Defective adipocyte maturation related to increased <italic>ENPP1</italic> function does not exclude the possibility of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Meyre1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it may contribute to earlier onset of insulin resistance and related morbidities even with modest body fat increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Abate1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000882-Abate2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Terkeltaub, VA Medical Center/UC San Diego School of Medicine, for providing ENPP1 knockout mice; Dr. Trischitta, Universita' La Sapienza-Rome (Italy), for providing human ENPP1 K121K and K121Q cDNA.
