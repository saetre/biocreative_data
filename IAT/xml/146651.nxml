The human GPAT and AIRC genes are divergently transcribed from a 558 bp intergenic promoter region. Cis-acting sites and transcription factors important for bidirectional expression were identified. A cluster of sites between nt 215 and 260 are essential, although not sufficient, for expression of both genes. Two proteins from HepG2 cell nuclear extract, identified as NRF-1 and Sp1, bound to the promoter at sites within the 215-260 region. NRF-1 was required for stable binding of Sp1. Deletion of a 5'promoter region including nt 215-260 resulted in decreased expression of GPAT and AIRC in transfected HepG2 cells. The decreased expression was accounted for by point mutations in an NRF-1 site and either of two flanking sites for Sp1. These transcription factors account in part for the coordinated expression of human GPAT and AIRC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
