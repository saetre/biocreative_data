A strong link between increased intramuscular TAG (IMTG) stores and skeletal muscle insulin resistance has been shown in lean and obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Recent studies have, however, indicated that intramuscular accumulation of lipid intermediates rather than TAG per se may be the direct cause of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, through interference with insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Impaired uptake and a reduced oxidation of fatty acids has been reported in skeletal muscle under postabsorptive conditions, during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation and moderate-intensity exercise in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Besides impaired fatty acid handling, disturbances in the regulation of skeletal muscle lipolysis may contribute to the increased storage of IMTG and lipid metabolites. So far, little is known on the in vivo regulation of skeletal muscle lipolysis in obesity. Data from our laboratory indicate that the catecholamine-induced increase in interstitial glycerol concentration and local blood flow are blunted in obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), a factor that may contribute to an increase in content of muscle TAG and diacylglycerol.</p><p>Although the molecular mechanisms that underlie muscle lipolysis are not known in detail, it has been shown that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is expressed in skeletal muscle of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). HSL activity appears to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation on several serine residues. It has been demonstrated that skeletal muscle HSL can be phosphorylated on at least five serine residues (Ser<sup>563</sup>, Ser<sup>565</sup>, Ser<sup>600</sup>, Ser<sup>659</sup>, and Ser<sup>660</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Catecholamines increase intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, resulting in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). HSL Ser<sup>563</sup>, Ser<sup>659</sup>, and Ser<sup>660</sup> are major PKA phosphorylation sites, although Ser<sup>563</sup> may not affect HSL activity directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). It is still unclear which of the PKA phosphorylation sites on HSL are important in mediating the effect of catecholamines on in vivo muscle HSL activity. Ser<sup>659</sup> appears to be a likely candidate because HSL Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation and HSL activity show a similar response to exercise with concomitant increase in circulating epinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). In vitro studies on purified bovine adipocyte HSL have shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates HSL on Ser<sup>565</sup>, thereby abolishing PKA-induced HSL activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). In human skeletal muscle, changes in AMPK activity during exercise were also associated with an increased HSL Ser<sup>565</sup> phosphorylation, but this was not accompanied by an increased HSL activity, suggesting that AMPK can phosphorylate HSL on Ser<sup>565</sup> but that AMPK is of minor importance as a regulator of HSL activity in human skeletal muscle during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p><p>So far, limited data are available on the differences in in vivo regulation of skeletal muscle lipolysis between lean and obese subjects. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether in vivo baseline and/or catecholamine-induced lipolysis is impaired in skeletal muscle of obese compared with lean subjects. For this reason, &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol tracer methodology was used to investigate in vivo whole-body and regional forearm skeletal muscle lipolysis in lean and obese subjects after an overnight fast and during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation, using the nonselective &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (ISO). To obtain more information on the underlying mechanism at the molecular level, we measured skeletal muscle HSL protein expression and serine phosphorylation on Ser<sup>563</sup>, Ser<sup>565</sup>, and Ser<sup>659</sup>.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Three healthy lean (two women and one man; age 20 &#x000b1; 1 years; BMI 22.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) subjects participated in a pilot experiment during which &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol enrichment was investigated during 6-h infusion to determine the time required to achieve an isotopic steady state. Thirteen lean and 10 obese nonsmoking men participated in the actual muscle lipolysis experiment during which &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol was infused for 3 h. Clinical characteristics of the subjects included in the experiment are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Body weight and body density (by hydrostatic weighing), used for calculations of percent body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass (FFM), were determined after an overnight fast, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). All subjects were in good health as assessed by medical history, were free of any medication, and spent &#x02264;3 h/week in organized sports activities. The Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University approved the study protocol, and all subjects gave their written informed consent before participating in the study.</p><sec><title>Experimental protocol.</title><p>In a pilot study in three subjects, the time course of &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol enrichment was determined to investigate when steady-state concentrations were achieved. Glycerol enrichment was measured in arterialized blood and venous blood draining the forearm during primed (3 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) constant infusion of &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol (0.20 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for 6 h. Blood samples were taken simultaneously from the two sites at baseline for background enrichment (t0) and at 10 time points during &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol infusion (t60, t90, t120, t150, t180, t210, t240, t330, t345, and t360).</p><p>During the actual muscle lipolysis experiment, glycerol enrichment and exchange across the forearm were investigated during primed (3 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) constant infusion of &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol (0.20 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for 3 h. After a 120-min baseline period, ISO was infused at a rate of 20 ng &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FFM &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 60 min. At this infusion rate, plasma ISO concentrations are comparable in lean and obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). At the beginning of the experiment, an arterialized blood sample was taken for measurement of background enrichment. Furthermore, arterialized and deep venous blood samples were taken simultaneously at three baseline time points (t90, t105, and t120) and at three time points during the last 30 min of ISO infusion (t150, t165, and t180). In both the pilot and muscle lipolysis experiment, forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured just before blood sampling to calculate substrate fluxes across the forearm (see <sc>fbf</sc>). Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anesthesia of skin and fascia (Xylocaine; AstraZeneca, Zoetermeer, the Netherlands) immediately before the baseline period (t0) and just before the end of ISO infusion (t180). Muscle biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis. During the experiment, heart rate was recorded continuously by means of a three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). When heart rate increased &#x0003e;30 beats/min or in case of ECG irregularities, ISO infusion was stopped (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2, 1 lean/1 obese).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical methods.</title><p>All subjects were asked to refrain from drinking alcohol and to perform no strenuous exercise for a period of 24 h before the experiment. Subjects came to the laboratory by car or bus at 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> after an overnight fast. Before initiating the experiment, a catheter was inserted retrogradely into a superficial dorsal hand vein to obtain arterialized venous blood. The hand was warmed in a hotbox, which was maintained at 60&#x000b0;C to achieve adequate arterialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). In the same arm, a second catheter was inserted in a forearm antecubital vein for the infusion of &#x0005b;<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>&#x0005d;glycerol tracer and ISO. In the contralateral arm, a third catheter was introduced retrogradely in an antecubital vein of the forearm for sampling of deep venous blood draining forearm skeletal muscle. The subjects rested in a supine position for the entire duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>FBF.</title><p>FBF was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography (EC5R plethysmograph; Hokanson, Bellevue, WA) using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges applied to the widest part of the forearm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). During measurement periods, the hand circulation was occluded by rapid inflation of a sphygmomanometer cuff (E20 rapid cuff inflator; Hokanson) placed around the wrist to a pressure of 200 mmHg. In this way, FBF can be assessed without interference of the hand circulation. A second cuff, placed just above the anticubital fossa, was inflated to 45 mmHg (which was lower than the diastolic blood pressure, which was &#x0003e;70 mmHg in all subjects) to achieve venous occlusion and obtain plethysmographic recordings. During venous occlusion, the plethysmographic recordings reflect the rate of arterial inflow, indicating FBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle lysates.</title><p>Muscle tissue was freeze-dried; dissected free of all visible adipose tissue, connective tissue, and blood under a microscope; and subsequently homogenized (1:80 &#x0005b;wt/vol&#x0005d;) in a buffer containing 50 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/l NaCl, 20 mmol/l sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmol/l <sc>l</sc>-glycerophosphate, 10 mmol/l NaF, 2 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/l EDTA, 1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 2 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mmol/l CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, and 3 mmol/l benzamidine.

Plasma glucose concentration (ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier, France) and lactate (ABX Diagnostics) were measured enzymatically on a COBAS MIRA automated spectrophotometer (Roche Diagnostica). Plasma insulin was measured with a double antibody radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA<sub>IR</sub>), calculated from baseline glucose and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).

The &#x003b2;-adrenergic&#x02013;mediated muscle lipolytic response was not significantly different between lean and obese subjects. In contrast to lean subjects, an increased HSL Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation was observed in skeletal muscle of obese subjects during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation compared with baseline.</p><sec><title>Whole-body lipolysis.</title><p>There seemed to be a directionally opposite effect of &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation on circulating TAG. Circulating TAG concentrations during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation increased in obese subjects, whereas lean subjects showed slightly decreased circulating TAG concentration during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation. This could indicate a greater TAG clearance in lean than in obese subjects after &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation. In the present study, skeletal muscle TAG clearance was not significantly different between groups. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated TAG hydrolysis might be the cause of an increased net TAG extraction during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation. An increased rate of action of LPL has been shown during epinephrine infusion in lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that obese subjects have a diminished adipose tissue LPL activity during postprandial conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). However, it remains to be elucidated whether an impaired adipose tissue LPL activity during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation in obese compared with lean subjects can explain the difference in circulating TAG concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline muscle glycerol uptake.</title><p>The present observation of significant uptake of glycerol across the forearm (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) is in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). The first indications for significant metabolism of glycerol in muscle came from Elia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) showing 50&#x00025; loss of enriched glycerol across the forearm. More recently, studies confirmed the finding of significant uptake of glycerol by forearm muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>) and vastus lateralis muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). The enzymatic machinery for utilization of glycerol seems to be present in skeletal muscle. Glycerol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that could initiate glycerol oxidation by skeletal muscle, has been demonstrated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), and oxidation of glycerol by skeletal muscle has been shown to occur in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Furthermore, glycerol kinase expression has been demonstrated in human muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Thus, in humans, glycerol taken up from the circulation might be oxidized or incorporated into IMTG, as shown in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline muscle glycerol release.</title><p>Our data show a blunted baseline total glycerol release per unit muscle mass in obese subjects (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This blunted baseline total glycerol release was accompanied by a lower total HSL protein expression in skeletal muscle of obese subjects (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting a blunted baseline muscle lipolysis. However, it can be argued that glycerol tracer release does not only reflect lipolysis. Thus, a blunted glycerol release might reflect an increased intramuscular glycerol use (i.e., oxidation or TAG synthesis). To our knowledge, our data provide the first indication of a reduced muscle HSL protein expression in obese compared with lean subjects. It is well known that expression of HSL is markedly decreased in subcutaneous adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes from obese subjects. This suggests that, at least in adipose tissue, a decreased HSL expression is a primary defect in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that the blunted muscle lipolysis in obese subjects was a secondary phenomenon caused by a higher degree of hyperinsulinemia. Still, it has been suggested that muscle lipolysis is primarily regulated by substrate supply and to a lesser degree is under hormonal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). This seems to be supported by studies showing no apparent suppression of in vivo skeletal muscle lipolysis by insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggest that phosphorylation of HSL on the PKA target sites Ser<sup>563</sup> and Ser<sup>659</sup>, and on the AMPK target site Ser<sup>565</sup>, was lower in obese than in lean subjects. It should be recognized, however, that when corrected for total HSL protein, HSL Ser<sup>563</sup>, Ser<sup>565</sup>, and Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation was comparable between lean and obese subjects, suggesting that a similar percentage of HSL molecules was phosphorylated on these three serine sites in lean and obese subjects. Nevertheless, the reduced absolute number of HSL molecules phosphorylated on Ser<sup>659</sup> may at least partly explain the blunted baseline glycerol release in obese compared with lean subjects. On the other hand, HSL Ser<sup>563</sup> and Ser<sup>565</sup> phosphorylation have been suggested not to be major regulators of HSL activity in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Thus, the reduced phosphorylation of HSL on these two sites may not have been important in determining the blunted baseline lipolysis in obese subjects. For practical reasons, the arteriovenous differences were measured across the forearm muscle, and biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle. Because there may be heterogeneity in lipolysis between different muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>), the combination of forearm substrate fluxes with lipolytic enzymes in muscle biopsies from the thigh has to be interpreted with caution. Finally, it should be mentioned that other lipases might also contribute to the blunted baseline muscle glycerol release observed in obese subjects. Recently, we identified adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) expression in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). More research is needed to elucidate the potential role of ATGL in human skeletal muscle lipolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline net muscle fatty acid uptake.</title><p>An increased basal net fatty acid uptake was observed across the forearm of obese subjects. An impaired fatty acid uptake and oxidation by both the leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>) and the arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>) have been observed previously in obese type 2 diabetic subjects compared with healthy individuals. Disturbances in fatty acid handling and an impaired muscle lipolysis may contribute to the increased IMTG storage in obese subjects. However, because this also depends on lipid turnover, both TAG synthesis and breakdown have to be known to draw final conclusions with respect to the mechanisms underlying increased IMTG content in obesity. For practical reasons and because our primary objective was to study glycerol metabolism, in the present study, no carbon-labeled long-chain fatty acid tracer was used to measure fluxes and oxidation rates across the forearm.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle glycerol release during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation.</title><p>The present results showed equal forearm glycerol release during systemic infusion of the nonselective &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist ISO in lean and obese subjects, suggesting a comparable lipolytic response. Previously, in situ microdialysis using a &#x003b2;-2 agonist, salbutamol, showed a blunted lipolysis in the gastrocnemius muscle of obese insulin-resistant subjects compared with lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Differences in systemic versus local infusion of &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists might partly explain this discrepancy. Also, in microdialysis studies, interstitial glycerol is used as a measure of lipolysis. As mentioned previously, glycerol is taken up by skeletal muscle, suggesting that interstitial glycerol may not reflect the overall rate of lipolysis but may instead be the net result of TAG and glycerol metabolism in muscle, thus reflecting net glycerol turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Finally, there may be marked heterogeneity in lipolysis between different muscle groups, possibly correlated to composition of fiber types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Accordingly, in rats, it was shown that muscles with a majority of type 1 fibers had greater HSL activity compared with muscles with a majority of type 2 fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). The higher content of type 1 fibers in the gastrocnemius muscle compared with forearm muscle may not only cause a generally higher lipolytic sensitivity to &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation but may also influence the difference in &#x003b2;-adrenergically stimulated lipolysis between lean and obese subjects.</p><p>It is known from studies with purified bovine adipocyte HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) and in different cell lines transfected with wild-type and mutant forms of HSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>) that &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation increases HSL activity through phosphorylation on several serine residues. In the present study, HSL Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation significantly increased during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation in skeletal muscle of obese subjects, whereas no effect was seen in lean subjects. A previous study in men and women during exercise has shown that muscle Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation and muscle HSL activity show a very similar pattern with respect to exercise response and dependency on sex, indicating that Ser<sup>659</sup> serves an important role in the regulation of HSL activity in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), as has been demonstrated in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). It can be speculated that obese subjects increase HSL Ser<sup>659</sup> phosphorylation during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation to deal with a reduced total HSL protein expression, increasing muscle HSL activity to a level comparable with lean subjects. In addition, HSL Ser<sup>660</sup> appears to be a major PKA target site and HSL activity&#x02013;controlling site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). In the present study, HSL Ser<sup>660</sup> phosphorylation was not measured. Finally, phosphorylation of the PKA target site Ser<sup>563</sup> on HSL did not increase significantly during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation. This is in accordance with previous studies, in which HSL Ser<sup>563</sup> phosphorylation was not increased during exercise despite an increase in circulating epinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Maybe HSL Ser<sup>563</sup> is already maximally phosphorylated in the basal, resting state. Moreover, it has been argued that HSL Ser<sup>563</sup> may not be an important regulator of HSL activity in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle lactate release during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation.</title><p>Net lactate release across the forearm increased during &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation.

Arterialization was achieved by heating the hand in a warm air box at 60&#x000b0;C for at least 30 min, which has been previously validated as the appropriate procedure for obtaining arterialized blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). In the present study, mean oxygen saturation was 94.5&#x00025; in both lean and obese subjects, indicating comparable and successful arterialization in both groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the obese insulin-resistant state is characterized by a reduced muscle glycerol release during baseline fasting conditions, which was accompanied by a lower HSL protein expression and phosphorylation on the PKA target sites Ser<sup>563</sup> and Ser<sup>659</sup> and on the AMPK target site Ser<sup>565</sup>. This suggests a blunted fasting skeletal muscle lipolysis in obesity, which may be an important factor contributing to the increased lipid storage in skeletal muscle of obese insulin-resistant subjects. Further studies are necessary to address in more detail whether these disturbances are primary factors or adaptation responses to the obese insulin-resistant state.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>C.R. has received support from the Commission of the European Communities (contract no.
