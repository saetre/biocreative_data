However, its expression in hematologic malignancies including CML has not been described yet. Here, we report the expression of AQP5 in CML cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. While normal bone marrow biopsy samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) showed no expression of AQP5, 32&#x00025; of CML patient samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;41) demonstrated AQP5 expression. In addition, AQP5 expression level increased with the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance in paired samples (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.047). We have found that the overexpression of AQP5 in K562 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AQP5 reduced the cell proliferation rate in both K562 and LAMA84 CML cells. Moreover, by immunoblotting and flow cytometry, we show that phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1 is increased in AQP5-overexpressing CML cells and decreased in AQP5 siRNA-treated CML cells. Interestingly, caspase9 activity increased in AQP5 siRNA-treated cells. Finally, FISH showed no evidence of AQP5 gene amplification in CML from bone marrow. In summary, we report for the first time that AQP5 is overexpressed in CML cells and plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings may provide the basis for a novel CML therapy targeting AQP5.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channel proteins that facilitate transcellular water movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-King1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Verkman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Each of the ten known human AQPs has a unique expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-King1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, AQP type 5 (AQP5) is found in various epitheliums including lacrimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Gresz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, salivary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Krane1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and airway submucosal glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kreda1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, pancreatic epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Burghardt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and type I pneumocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Dobbs1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the role of AQPs in human pathology has been explored extensively, only recently has its role in cancer become an area of interest. The ectopic expression of human AQPs has been reported to be frequently associated with various cancers. For instance, AQP1 is expressed in brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Saadoun1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Moon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and pancreatic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Burghardt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the microvessels in multiple myeloma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Vacca1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, AQP3 in renal cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kageyama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and AQP5 in colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Moon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, pancreatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Burghardt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and ovarian cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also previously reported that AQP5 expression is associated with an early stage of colorectal cancer development<sup>9</sup>. Interestingly, the expression of human AQP1, AQP3, and AQP5 was detected in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes surrounding bronchogenic cancer of lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Moon2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

AQP1 is shown to play a role both in angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Saadoun2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and cell cycle control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Moon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Hoque1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, assisting cancer development. Our group has reported that the expression of wild-type AQP5 (AQP5) in a NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line induced many phenotypic changes characteristic of transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by triggering signaling pathways activated through Ras, which is induced by phosphorylation of the PKA consensus site of AQP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, athymic mice injected with NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with AQP5 exhibited a robust tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Most recently, we have demonstrated that AQP5 promotes cell proliferation and that its overexpression is related with liver metastasis; we have also found molecular pathways based on the Ras/ERK/Rb signaling pathway as a mechanism to promote cell proliferation in colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This finding was confirmed with mRNA quantification in primary CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Standardized mRNA levels of AQP5 (AQP5 mRNA/GAPDH mRNA) in lung and breast cancer tissue (positive control) and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (negative control) were compared to that of CML cells for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The expression level of AQP5 in CML cells was lower than that of lung and breast cancer tissues. However, AQP5 expression was rarely detected in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Then, the protein expression level of AQP5 was examined with bone marrow biopsy samples by immunohistochemisty (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002594.s002">Table S1</xref>).

In positive cases of CML, megakaryocytes and myeloblasts showed weak cytoplasmic staining, whereas granulcytes exhibited markedly strong staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, the staining intensity of AQP5 in CML cells was weaker than that of lung tumor cells (positive control), consistent with the mRNA findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and our recent observations in NSCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. For bone marrow cells, mRNA level of AQP5 could not be examined owing to the insufficient amount of the samples. However, a direct association between expression level detected from RT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry was found in our preliminary analysis. Therefore, it is probable that RT-PCR analysis would demonstrate similar results.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002594-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002594.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>AQP5 expression and demographic and clinopathologic characteristics of the CML patients.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0002594-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0002594.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0002594-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient characteristics</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">AQP5 expression</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p value<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">&#x02021;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex, Female</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.6&#x00025;

Thus, we gathered demographic and clinopathologic information of the CML patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002594.s002">Table S1</xref>) and analyzed their association with AQP5 expression level. The expression level of AQP5 was associated with CML phase at the time of diagnosis and of resistance (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.04, respectively). Interestingly, AQP5 expression level was relatively higher among CML patients diagnosed at accelerated, or blast crisis, phase than those diagnosed at chronic phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t001">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, AQP5 expression level was relatively higher among CML patients who gained imatinib mesylate resistance at chronic phase than those who gained resistance at accelerated, or blast crisis, phase. These findings may allude to the notion that AQP5 expression is linked with more aggressive behavior in CML progression.</p><p>No statistically significant relationship was found between the expression level of AQP5 and patient's age, sex, the time interval from diagnosis to resistance, and the time interval from resistance to sampling. In general, there was no statistically significant relationship between AQP5 expression level and the existence of imatinib mesylate resistance in the bone marrow samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;41, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.524). However, when AQP5 expression levels were compared between the paired bone marrow samples drawn before and after the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance in the same CML patients (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9), a statistically significant difference was found (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.047) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t002">Table 2</xref>). Intriguingly, AQP5 expression increased with the appearance of imatinib mesylate resistance. This finding suggests that AQP5 may play a role in the process of developing imatinib mesylate resistance in CML. Accordingly, we have further examined whether AQP5 expression in CML cells is linked with bcr-abl amplification, or mutation, or secondary chromosomal changes other than t(9,22) in imatinib mesylate resistant CML cases. In our 41 CML bone marrow samples, although a gain of bcr-abl amplification, mutation, and secondary chromosomal changes were found to be associated with the development of imatinib mesylate resistance (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002, p&#x0003c;0.001, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001, respectively), none of them showed a statistically significant correlation with AQP5 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002594.s002">Table S1</xref>). In paired bone marrow samples drawn before and after the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance, like AQP5 expression, a gain of bcr-abl mutation revealed an independent association with the development of drug resistance (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.025) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t002">Table 2</xref>).

We used LAMA-84 cell line in addition to K562 cell line, since it showed the highest siRNA transfection efficiency among CML cell lines in our preliminary analysis.

However, cells treated with imatinib mesylate showed a stronger inhibition of BCR-ABL1 than cells treated with AQP5 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>).

Furthermore, light microscopy and Trypsin Blue staining confirmed the differences in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis; caspase 8 activity showed no difference between two cell lines (data not shown). These findings indicate that AQP5 expression may play a role in inhibiting apoptosis in CML cells, possibly through the caspase 9 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>AQP5 expression in CML cells is not associated with genomic amplification of AQP5</title><p>Finally, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying AQP5 expression in CML cells, we investigated the presence of genomic amplification through fluorescence in situ (FISH) analysis using an AQP5 gene probe. Out of 41 cases of bone marrow aspirate samples of CML patient, no clear pattern of genomic amplification was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002594.s004">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that the expression of AQP5 could be a secondary molecular event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous expression studies of AQP5 in human tissues, both normal and malignant, have been only in epithelial tissues and carcinomas. For instance, lung epithelium is a well known site of AQP5 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kreda1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and the expression level of AQP5 seems to be higher in non small cell lung cancer than in normal lung tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Steelman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Of interest, it has been reported that aspirates of bone marrow cells, fresh or cultured, can express AQP5, typically expressed in the type I pneumocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kotton1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and that bone morrow derived cells can be precursors of differentiated parenchymal cells of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kotton1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kotton2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, our group has previously shown that human lymphocytes, when activated, can express AQP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Moon2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these interesting observations and our findings from human leukemic cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), we have decided to study the expression profile of AQP5 in human bone marrow, both normal and malignant. Among 41 bone marrow biopsy samples from CML patients, 32&#x00025; exhibited AQP5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, normal bone marrow samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) showed no expression of AQP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This expression profile in CML is comparable to that in solid tumors; AQP5 is expressed in 35&#x00025; (144/408) of non-small-cell lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and similar observations were also found in breast cancer (manuscript in preparation). However, the relative mRNA expression level of AQP5 in CML cells is found to be lower than that of lung and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, unlike carcinoma cells where AQP5 shows membranous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), in the bone marrows of CML patients, megakaryocytes, myeloblasts, and granulocytes demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of AQP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002594-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, our findings, for the first time, describe the unique expression pattern of AQP5 in the human bone marrow of CML cases.</p><p>More interestingly, we found evidence that AQP5 may be associated with the progression of CML. This finding is also comparable to our previous findings that AQP5 expression correlates with clinical outcomes in solid tumors, such as lung metastasis in colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, earlier disease progression in lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and worse survival in breast cancer (manuscript in preparation). CML patients diagnosed at accelerated or blast crisis phase showed significantly higher level of AQP5 expression than those diagnosed at chronic phase, while CML patients who gained imatinib mesylate resistance at chronic phase exhibited significantly higher level of AQP5 expression than those who gained resistance at accelerated or blast crisis phase (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.04, respectively). Furthermore, with paired sample analysis in the same patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t002">Table 2</xref>), AQP5 expression increased with the appearance of imatinib mesylate resistance (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.047). Based on these observations, we suspect that AQP5 may be conferring a growth advantage in the process of CML progression. Furthermore, from our association study with the cytogenetic response analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002594-t002">Table 2</xref>), we surmise that AQP5 may play a role in developing imatinib mesylate resistance, irrespective of other known major resistance mechanisms such as bcr-abl mutation or amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Litzow1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Further experiments are planned to examine whether AQP5 ablation in combination with imatinib mesylate treatment increases the susceptibility of the latter in imatinib mesylate resistant CML cells.</p><p>Of late, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed association between AQPs and human cancers has become the focus of our research. We have previously demonstrated the oncogenic property of AQP1 in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line<sup>23</sup> and that of AQP5 in the same cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we have found that AQP5 expression in NIH3T3 cell line induces cell proliferation through the activation of Ras, suggesting an association between AQP5 and the Ras signal transduction pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Woo2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have reported that AQP5 triggers Ras/ERK/Rb pathway in HCT116 colon cancer cell line, thereby promoting cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Kang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we have observed that AQP5 activates c-Src, and, thus, triggers cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these finding were all based on solid tumors and the role of AQPs in the development of hematological malignancies are largely unknown. Thus, in this study, we have pursued the role of AQP5 in CML as a first model to study the role of AQPs in blood cancer.</p><p>We report, for the first time, that AQP5 promotes cell proliferation in CML cell lines possibly through the activation of BCR-ABL1 and Akt. We have also found that AQP5 may prolong cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis via caspase 9 pathway. We believe that these findings may shed light in discovering novel molecular targets for CML treatment, where drug resistance has become a huge obstacle for oncologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Litzow1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there needs to be further investigation into several other candidate cell signaling pathways important in CML progression that may be affected by AQP5. Our next plan is to examine changes in the signal transduction molecules related with the BCR-ABL1 pathway such as CrkL, Ras, Jak2, Stat5, and c-Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Sattler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> as well as molecules that are not linked with BCR-ABL1 pathway including Lyn &#x0005b;30&#x0005d; in both AQP5-overexpressing and AQP5-silenced CML cell lines. Also, we plan to delve into the details of the apoptosis pathways including Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, and Fas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Ravandi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Ultimately, our findings including proliferation assay and molecular expression assays await further validation with primary CML cells.</p><p>One question that may arise is the identification of the adaptor molecule that directly interacts with AQP5 to exert its alleged effects in CML. One possibility is for AQP5 to interact with and, thus, activate Lyn in CML cells. With protein microarray and GST pull-down assay, we have reported that AQP5 binds to Lyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the activation of which has been found to be one of the mechanisms of imatinib mesylate resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Dai1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to our findings, Lyn ablation led to enhanced apoptosis of CML cells, even in primary cells resistant to imatinib mesylate therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Ptasznik1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the pathway of Lyn activation seems to be independent of BCR-ABL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Dai1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, it would be worthwhile to explore the possible interaction between Lyn and AQP5 in CML cells and see how AQP5 ablation affects the growth of imatinib mesylate-resistant primary CML cells. In addition, our recent studies suggest that Grb2 (manuscript submitted) and c-Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, both of which showed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> binding with AQP5, could be some of the candidate adaptor molecules which interact with AQP5 in CML cells. Thus, we plan on performing binding assays with the above candidate molecules in CML cell lines and primary CML cells. Lastly, the possibility that AQP5 can function as a kinase itself should not be ignored.</p><p>Another question that remains is why AQP5 is overexpressed in certain CML cells. In our FISH analysis (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;41), we found no genomic amplification of AQP5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002594.s004">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that AQP5 expression may be a secondary phenomenon. This is similar to our finding with AQP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Hoque2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and AQP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002594-Chae1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> in lung, where no evidence for genomic amplification was detected. Currently, we are investigating the presence of AQP5 mutation with the CML samples, especially with the paired samples drawn before and after the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance in the same CML patients. Our previous efforts to identify a promoter element responsible for the induced expression of AQP5 in several tumor cell lines suggested the existence of several potential cis-acting elements responsible for promoter activity. Moreover, methylation analysis of the AQP5 promoter region suggested that promoter demethylation may play a role in the expression of AQP5 in head and neck and lung cancer cell lines (manuscript in preparation). These results, however, are still preliminary and warrant further validation.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that human AQP5 is expressed in CML cells with a potential role in cancer progression and plays a role not only in proliferation, but also in survival of CML cells. Moreover, they also provide a potential basis for designing a novel CML therapy targeting AQP5. Further expression profile studies in other hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia and lymphoma are planned. Comprehensive functional studies to verify the novel oncogenic and anti-apoptotic properties of AQP5 in blood cancer are also warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002594.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002594.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002594.s002"><label>Table S1.</label><caption><p>Table S1.
