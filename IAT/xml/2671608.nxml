PolyP forms complexes and modulates activities of many proteins including ion channels. Here we investigated the role of polyP in the function of the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel. Using whole-cell patch-clamp and fluorescent calcium measurements we demonstrate that enzymatic breakdown of polyP by exopolyphosphatase (scPPX1) inhibits channel activity in human embryonic kidney and F-11 neuronal cells expressing TRPM8. We demonstrate that the TRPM8 channel protein is associated with polyP. Furthermore, addition of scPPX1 altered the voltage-dependence and blocked the activity of the purified TRPM8 channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, where the activity of the channel was initiated by cold and menthol in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). The biochemical analysis of the TRPM8 protein also uncovered the presence of poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is frequently associated with polyP. We conclude that the TRPM8 protein forms a stable complex with polyP and its presence is essential for normal channel activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>TRPM8 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family of the melastatin subgroup, which is thought to be a major sensor for a wide range of cold temperatures in the peripheral nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Bautista1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Dhaka1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Colburn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first analyzed the changes in the open probability of the channel upon the cleavage of polyP. We found that TRPM8 channel openings in inward direction were eliminated very rapidly (within 1&#x02013;2 min) after the addition of scPPX1. In contrast, the open probability of the channel in outward direction exhibited much slower changes (up to 30 min). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g008">Figure 8A</xref> demonstrates current traces recordings obtained at &#x02212;150 &#x0002b;150 mV voltage ramps before and after the treatment with scPPX1 in a time course at the beginning of 3<sup>rd</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup>, 28<sup>th</sup> and 33<sup>rd</sup> minutes.

In our study, we found that inorganic polyphosphate plays an essential role in determining the activity of TRPM8 channels. Furthermore, our data reveal that polyP is associated with TRPM8 in a supra-molecular complex.</p><p>Inorganic polyphosphate is present in all eukaryotic cells, however its function is not well defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kornberg2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kumble1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kumble2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the abundance of polyP in all mammalian tissues, its evolutionary role and participation in many general physiological processes in the cell, polyphosphate is still a mysterious molecule, since little is known about the mammalian enzymes that control the levels of the polymer. A novel mammalian exopolyphosphatase has recently been identified: the DHH superfamily human protein h-prune, which shows high sequence homology to the known PPXs, was shown to be an efficient exopolyphosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Tammenkoski1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, unlike other PPXs, h-prune hydrolyses only short-chain polyP, but the long-chain polymers rather inhibit the activity of the enzyme. This leaves an open niche for the existence of another enzyme that would cleave long-chain polyP. On the other hand, endopolyphosphatase (PPN) activity was earlier found in several mammalian tissues by A. Kornberg's group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kumble1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The PPN activity was present in rat tissues, particularly in brain, heart, lung and kidney, but the attempts to identify the protein responsible for this activity have not been successful. Even less is known about mammalian polyP synthases. No mammalian homologs to the known polyP kinases (PPK) have been found in protein databases, and no enzymes comparable to PPK have been identified. Also, it was reported that in mammalian cells and tissues the synthesis of polyP from P<sub>i</sub> bypasses the intracellular pools of Pi and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kumble2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the synthesis of polyP in animals proceeds through a completely distinct enzymatic pathway, compared to one in bacteria and lower eukaryotes.</p><p>PolyP &#x02013; a molecule of many functions &#x02013; has frequently been shown as an active compound of several ion transporting systems, including some bacterial ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Zakharian1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Reusch3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Xian1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it has been reported by Kim and Cavanaugh that the presence of the polyanion is required for the regulation of the channel activity of one member of the mammalian TRP superfamily, TRPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Kim1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors demonstrated using inside-out patches of HEK-293 cells expressing TRPA1 that short polyphosphates (2&#x02013;65 residues) are required for sensitizing this channel to pungent chemicals and for preserving the protein in the functional conformation. The activity of TRPA1 channels was recovered in excised patches only in the presence of polyP and was diminished upon washing of polyP from the bath solution, which suggests weak interactions between polyP and TRPA1. Our own data show that polyP is also an important factor controlling channel activity of TRPM8, however the nature of these interactions is quite different from those observed by Kim and Cavanaugh. We found that polyP is co-purified with the TRPM8 protein in ensemble and removal of polyP from the protein can be achieved by its enzymatic digestion with scPPX1, indicating strong interaction between TRPM8 and polyP.</p><p>We first found the requirement of polyP for TRPM8 channel activity in whole-cell patch clamping of HEK-293 cells expressing TRPM8, where menthol-induced currents were inhibited upon hydrolysis of polyP by scPPX1. Polyphosphatase dialyzed via the patch pipette inhibited menthol-induced TRPM8 currents at &#x02212;60 mV by 60&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>), while 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; inhibition was observed when scPPX1 was co-expressed with TRPM8 in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g001">Fig. 1D&#x02013;F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g002">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). Enhanced inhibition of TRPM8 currents by scPPX1 in these experiments suggests that a longer exposure of the TRPM8 protein by expression of the enzyme ensures better access to polyP than in those experiments performed with acute scPPX1 treatment of TRPM8 via the patch pipette. The current/voltage relationship obtained in whole-cell patch clamp experiments revealed that inward TRPM8 currents exhibit a profound inhibition in the cells with co-expressed scPPX1 (&#x0223c;83&#x00025;), while outward currents are inhibited to a lesser extend (&#x0223c;65&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g001">Fig. 1G&#x02013;I</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, we monitored calcium signals in F-11 neuronal cells expressing TRPM8 with/out scPPX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g002">Fig. 2D&#x02013;F</xref>). Similarly to HEK cells expression system, we found that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-entry was significantly inhibited in F-11 cells when TRPM8 was co-expressed together with polyphosphatase, which indicates that polyP plays an analogously important role on the TRPM8 activity in these cells as well. These results demonstrate a novel and significant contribution of polyP to TRPM8 channel activity.</p><p>The question of how polyP contributes to the regulation of TRPM8 channel activity motivated us to look at the biochemical and biophysical properties of TRPM8 in a reconstituted system. In experiments on TRPM8 purified from HEK-293 cells, we detected that polyP is associated with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The assembly of polyphosphate with bacterial membrane proteins has been previously reported for a number of ion channels, where it is usually derived in a complex with the solvating polyester PHB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Zakharian1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Reusch3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Xian1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. PHB, possessing electron-donating oxygens closely spaced along a flexible backbone, is capable of solvating salts of hard cations; its amphiphilic nature allows it to penetrate hydrophobic regions inaccessible to water. Considering possible interactions of TRPM8 with the polymer, we further analyzed the protein for its association with PHB and indeed found that TRPM8 is associated with the polyester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p>Addressing the question of the nature of interaction of the two polymers with the protein, we suggest that polyP possibly interacts with TRPM8 oligomers by ionic bonds as it is found in the association with TRPM8 tetramers. However, highly water soluble polyP might easily dissociate from the protein when it is converted to the monomeric form. PHB, in contrast to polyP, is insoluble in water and it is probably located in a hydrophobic region of TRPM8. Due to the strong interactions with the protein, which might include hydrophobic or even covalent bonds, PHB, unlike polyP, does not dissociate from the monomers of TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 2). Complexes of polyP/PHB have been shown to form cation-selective channels in bacterial and mitochondrial membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Reusch1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Das1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Pavlov1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, these complexes have been identified in association with some ion channels including porins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Zakharian1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Reusch4">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An exciting model within these protein/polyP/PHB complexes has been represented by a potassium channel of <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> KcsA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Reusch3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Hegermann1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alteration of the polymers associated with the protein could be a useful approach to demonstrate their function in the complex. However, due to the amphiphilic nature of PHB it is difficult to eliminate it from the native protein. For this reason, we concentrated our attention on the soluble component of the complex &#x02013; polyP &#x02013; and its enzymatic degradation by scPPX1.</p><p>In order to study the details of polyP participation in regulation of TRPM8 activity, we examined how scPPX1 modifies single channel activity of the purified TRPM8 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer. Although, one distant homolog of TRPs, the polycystin-2 protein, that belongs to TRPP subfamily, has been shown to form functional channels in lipid bilayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Li1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, no TRP channels from the major subfamilies (TRPC, TRPV, TRPM) have previously been studied with this technique, to our knowledge. We first aimed to identify the conditions necessary to preserve the protein's stability and function during extraction, purification and subsequent incorporation into the artificial lipids. We found that it was critical to deliver TRPM8 to the final step of purification in its tetrameric form, since altering different conditions, such as ionic strength, osmotic pressure or detergents led to disintegration of tetramers into the lower assemblies, and ultimately to monomers. The stability of TRPM8 in tetrameric form was also important to prevent polyP dissociation. If such dissociation took place during purification, these TRPM8 proteins failed to form functional channels. After finding the optimal conditions for the purification, we attempted to detect TRPM8 channels after reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers. By testing many experimental conditions, we found that the TRPM8 channels in planar lipid bilayers can be activated by both menthol and cold only in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g007">7</xref>). This result was in agreement with previously reported data showing the requirement of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for the channel activity of TRPM8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Rohacs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, our data provide the first demonstration of the dependence of mammalian ion channel activity on PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in a reconstituted system. This is strong evidence that PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulates these channels through direct association, and not through an intermediary PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding protein.</p><p>When the appropriate conditions were established, we tested the effect of scPPX1 on the channel activity of TRPM8 and found that addition of the enzyme to the internal side of the channel was followed by drastic inhibition of the channel activity. This was based on a reduction in open probability and single-channel conductance to the point of complete loss of conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g009">9</xref>). We detected that while the inward currents were eliminated very rapidly, the outward currents exhibited changes within 30 min of treatment with scPPX1. The kinetics of polyP cleavage by scPPX1 is dependent on the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration, where Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is a cofactor for the enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Tammenkoski2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In our studies, during exposure to the enzyme and polyP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>), inhibition followed a sigmoid time course, which may have resulted from both the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and accessibility of polyP from the protein.</p><p>Apparent voltage-dependence of the accessibility of polyP was also observed. PolyP was more vulnerable to scPPX1 when inside-positive voltages were first applied to provide an electrical driving force to favor an extension of polyP out from the protein on the cytoplasmic side. This important observation suggested a possible location of polyP in the inner cavity of channel conducting path and led us to look closely whether alternation of polyP from the channel has an effect on voltage-dependence of TRPM8. The voltage-dependence of TRPM8 has previously been reported by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Voets3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Matta1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experiments we found that at certain conditions TRPM8 exhibits a slight voltage-dependence, which, however, undergoes significant changes upon the hydrolysis of polyP by scPPX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). These results demonstrate that polyP not only co-purifies with TRPM8 protein, but also modifies its function, and is thus directly involved in the regulation of TRPM8 channel activity.</p><p>The inhibition pattern, caused by scPPX1, suggests two distinct mechanisms: one resulted in a rapid decrease in channel openings observed in, physiologically relevant to TRPM8, inward currents, while the other is seen as a slow decline in conductance and channel openings detected in outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005404-g009">9</xref>). The molecular mechanism of this regulation is elusive at this time and more studies are required for better understanding of the role of polyP in this channel/polymer complex. One possible role for polyP in the activity of TRPM8 might be to determine permeation and selectivity of the channel. Such a role of polyP has been shown for a potassium ion channel KcsA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Negoda1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Zakharian2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005404-Negoda2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also not clear how scPPX1 treatment causes the reduction of single-channel conductance that we observe for TRPM8. It could be due to structural changes that may take place within the intracellular domains of TRPM8 upon removal of polyP. On the other hand, the reduced apparent single channel conductance could also be due to filtering of rapid, incompletely resolved gating transitions, or a &#x0201c;fast block&#x0201d; process, due to the uncovering of low affinity blocking sites of solutes by the removal of polyP.</p><p>In the context of the allosteric stimulatory and regulatory mechanisms that affect TRPM8, our study demonstrates that the TRPM8 protein coexists in a supramolecular complex with polyP and PHB, which alter its channel properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005404.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>TRPM8 in HEK-293 cells with co-expressed scPPX1 Panel A: Images illustrate localization of myc-TRPM8 protein in control (left panel) and scPPX1 co-expressed (right panel) conditions.
