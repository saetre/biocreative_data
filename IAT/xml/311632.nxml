The hemC locus has been subcloned from the Clarke and Carbon plasmid pLC41-4. The sequence of the hemC structural gene and flanking DNA was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger. The structural gene for hemC is located within a 942bp sequence encoding the monomeric PBG deaminase, molecular weight 33,857. The extent of the coding region was confirmed by sequencing the N-terminus of the purified enzyme and by determination of the molecular weight. The hemC locus is closely linked to the cyaA locus, the genes being transcribed in a divergent manner. Upstream of the hemC coding region, a possible promoter and three repeated GGATG sequences were identified. This is the first report of a complete DNA sequence for a structural gene specifying an enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in prokaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6215"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6216"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6217"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6218"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6219"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6220"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6221"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6222"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6223"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6224"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6225"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00284-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6226"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
