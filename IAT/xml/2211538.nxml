This role depends on its ability to synthesize telomere repeats in a manner dependent on the reverse transcriptase (RT) function of its protein component telomerase RT (TERT), as well as on a novel pathway whose mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we use a TERT mutant lacking RT function (TERT<sup>ci</sup>) to study the mechanism of TERT action in mammalian skin, an ideal tissue for studying progenitor cell biology. We show that TERT<sup>ci</sup> retains the full activities of wild-type TERT in enhancing keratinocyte proliferation in skin and in activating resting hair follicle stem cells, which triggers initiation of a new hair follicle growth phase and promotes hair synthesis. To understand the nature of this RT-independent function for TERT, we studied the genome-wide transcriptional response to acute changes in TERT levels in mouse skin. We find that TERT facilitates activation of progenitor cells in the skin and hair follicle by triggering a rapid change in gene expression that significantly overlaps the program controlling natural hair follicle cycling in wild-type mice. Statistical comparisons to other microarray gene sets using pattern-matching algorithms revealed that the TERT transcriptional response strongly resembles those mediated by Myc and Wnt, two proteins intimately associated with stem cell function and cancer. These data show that TERT controls tissue progenitor cells via transcriptional regulation of a developmental program converging on the Myc and Wnt pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Stem cells and progenitor cells within a tissue are required to maintain tissue homeostasis and to repair tissues after injury by giving rise to differentiated daughter cells. Many progenitor cells express telomerase, a reverse transcriptase enzyme that adds DNA repeats to telomeres, the protective structures that cap chromosome ends. Telomere addition by telomerase is important for normal progenitor cell function and is crucial for enabling cancer cells to divide an unlimited number of times. In addition to its telomere-lengthening function, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) can directly activate quiescent epidermal stem cells. However, the mechanism underlying this novel function for TERT is still not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of TERT is dispensable for its ability to activate tissue progenitor cells in vivo. Furthermore, using gene microarrays, we show that TERT controls a developmental program that overlaps the natural transcriptional program of hair follicle cycling in mouse skin. Using pattern-matching algorithms, we find that the TERT-controlled genetic program significantly resembles programs regulated by Myc and Wnt, two pathways critical for stem cell function and tumorigenesis. This paper reveals critical new insights into novel mechanisms of non-telomerase functions of TERT, identifying TERT as a developmental regulator linked to control of transcriptional responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Choi J, Southworth LK, Sarin KY, Venteicher AS, Ma W, et al.

Through its action in synthesizing telomere repeats, telomerase is required to maintain progenitor cell viability and self-renewal. In settings of insufficient telomerase, telomere shortening blunts stem cell self-renewal, dramatically impairing tissue function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to this telomere maintenance function, TERT, the telomerase protein catalytic subunit, can directly enhance cell cycle entry of quiescent epidermal stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the mechanisms through which TERT activates tissue stem cells via this second, non-canonical pathway are not understood.</p><p>Telomerase, which comprises both TERT and the telomerase RNA (TERC), adds telomere repeats to chromosome ends to offset the loss of telomere sequences that occurs due to the end-replication problem, the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate fully the lagging DNA strand. In the absence of sufficient levels of telomerase, telomeres shorten progressively with cell division, ultimately leading to loss of telomere protection and a DNA damage response that induces senescence or cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Loss of telomerase in mouse impairs the function of self-renewing tissues as these DNA damage responses at uncapped chromosome ends induce apoptosis and block proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The defects in tissue maintenance in telomerase knockout mice with short telomeres is likely due to impaired progenitor cell function, because telomere shortening significantly reduces stem cell self-renewal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to synthesizing telomeres, telomerase may serve a more direct function in supporting the active proliferation of progenitor cells. This second function has been demonstrated most clearly in epidermis, an excellent tissue for studying progenitor cell biology and cellular differentiation. Within the epidermis, each hair is maintained by a dedicated organ, the hair follicle, which cycles among three states: a resting phase (telogen), an active phase (anagen), and a short regression phase (catagen) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The initiation of a new anagen cycle requires the activation of a small number of multipotent stem cells that reside in a niche termed the bulge region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. These activated stem cells give rise to the newly generated portion of the anagen follicle, including cycling progenitor cells (matrix cells) that produce the cells comprising the growing hair shaft. Conditional expression of TERT in adult skin induces a rapid developmental transition in hair follicles from telogen to anagen by causing otherwise quiescent hair follicle stem cells to proliferate. Notably, this activity of TERT in facilitating anagen does not require the telomerase RNA component (TERC) and therefore is independent of TERT's role in synthesizing telomere repeats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, an independent study found that the effects of TERT on keratinocytes colony formation and skin cancer required TERC, rendering the relationship between TERT's stem cell activation and telomere elongation functions less clear &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>TERT's effects on hair follicle dynamics and stem cell biology closely resemble those of developmental pathways regulating hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, by stabilizing the transcriptional activator beta-catenin, secreted Wnt glycoproteins transduce signals that are required for hair follicle development and differentiation, stem cell activation and stem cell maintenance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

To gain critical new insights into the mechanisms by which TERT activates tissue stem cells, we engineered a system in which we can conditionally express a TERT point mutant (TERT<sup>ci</sup>) devoid of reverse transcriptase activity in mouse skin. This approach allows analysis of TERT functions in isolation from its catalytic action on telomeres and from any unknown polymerase activities that could occur in combination with other templates. We couple this mouse genetic approach with analysis of genome-wide transcriptional responses in vivo and rigorous statistical comparisons of the TERT-response signature with a large number of microarray gene sets. We find that TERT activates epidermal progenitor cells not through its reverse transcriptase function, but by controlling a Myc- and Wnt-related transcriptional program.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TERT<sup>ci</sup> Is a Catalytically Inactive Mutant of TERT</title><p>To determine if TERT's RT activity is required to promote stem cell proliferation, we inactivated TERT RT function by introducing a point mutation in its active site.

In designing these experiments, we leveraged several strengths of our system: (1) the ability to study the effects of TERT on the whole organ in vivo (2) temporal control of TERT with doxycycline enabling a study of dynamic gene expression changes over time and (3) a tetracycline-off configuration shown to result in rapid silencing in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Consistent with our findings that TERT enhances proliferation of epidermal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040010-g003">Figure 3</xref>C-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040010-g003">3</xref>F), GSEA also identified significant similarity between TERT-regulated genes and cell cycle-related gene sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040010-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040010-t002">2</xref>; for detailed methods, see Text S1).</p><table-wrap id="pgen-0040010-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gene Sets with Strong Correlations to TERT-Activated Genes by GSEA</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0040010.t001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pgen-0040010-t002" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Gene Sets with Strong Correlations to TERT-Repressed Genes by GSEA</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0040010.t002"/></table-wrap><p>One particular strength of GSEA is its ability to allow comparisons across microarray platforms, species and cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. This advantage is well illustrated here because our TERT gene set derived from mouse skin matched Wnt pathway patterns seen with conditional deletion of the beta-catenin regulator Apc in mouse gastrointestinal tract and with overexpression of Apc in human colon cancer cells. Similarly, our data set matched Myc gene sets derived from B-cells and endothelial cells. Thus, GSEA allows the identification of fundamental patterns intrinsic to a pathway being studied. Together, these data show that TERT controls a transcriptional program that overlaps those regulated by Myc and Wnt, pathways crucial for development, stem cell regulation and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>TERT Activates Genes Harboring TCF/LEF Binding Sites</title><p>Coordinately regulated genes frequently share common <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter elements, which serve as binding sites for sequence specific transcription factors in a signaling pathway. To identify promoter binding sites in common among TERT-regulated genes, we employed a GSEA algorithm that enables one to search for evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in particular sets of genes. We compared our rank ordered list of TERT-regulated genes with 783 sequence motif gene sets obtained from MSigDB, a database detailing which genes harbor conserved elements for each specific regulatory motif &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach identified several transcription factor binding sites as being significantly enriched in TERT-regulated genes. Remarkably, this evolutionarily conserved promoter binding site approach independently implicated the Myc and Wnt pathways. Myc binding sites and TCF/LEF binding sites, the elements through which Wnt signaling is mediated, were over-represented among TERT-repressed and TERT-activated genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040010-st008">Table S8</xref>).</p><p>To independently validate these findings, we prospectively scanned the promoter regions of TERT-regulated genes using TRANSFAC consensus binding sequences for both Myc and TCF/LEF. We scanned the promoter regions surrounding the TSS of each gene for each transcription factor binding site motif and also incorporated information regarding the extent to which a specific promoter element is evolutionarily conserved (details in Text S1). Using this approach, we confirmed that TCF/LEF sites were highly enriched in TERT-activated genes, consistent with our preceding results (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Applying this methodology to the hair growth genes described above revealed that Myc and E2F sites were well represented in hair growth genes, while Myc and CRE-BP sites were enriched in the anti&#x02013;hair growth gene data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040010-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040010-g007">7</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040010-st009">Table S9</xref>). Although the Wnt pathway serves a critical role in regulating the anagen phase of the hair follicle cycle, TCF/LEF sites were not statistically over-represented in the promoter regions of all hair growth genes as a group. Strikingly, TCF/LEF sites were highly enriched among the subgroup of hair growth genes regulated by TERT. Thus, TERT specifically regulates the subset of hair growth genes that contain TCF/LEF sites, providing mechanistic insight into how TERT induces anagen and facilitates epithelial proliferation. Together, these data show that the developmental program controlled by TERT strongly resembles the Myc and Wnt programs and suggest that TERT action is mediated through TCF/LEF promoter binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Telomerase is expressed in tissue progenitor cells and is upregulated in human cancers, where it supports cell viability and self-renewal by adding telomere repeats to chromosome ends. Our data show that TERT is a dual-function protein that acts in a telomere-independent manner to activate epidermal progenitor cells in the bulge region and in the IFE, and to promote a developmental transition from telogen to anagen resulting in hair growth. Its role in activating tissue progenitor cells does not require its catalytic function at telomeres, because TERT<sup>ci</sup>, a mutant lacking detectable RT function, exerts the same effects on tissue progenitor cells as does wild-type TERT. Instead, TERT acts to facilitate a rapid change in gene expression that overlaps the gene expression program of naturally cycling hair follicles. Strikingly, TERT-regulated genes share strong statistical similarity to genes regulated by Myc and Wnt. Together, our data strongly suggest that TERT acts as a developmental regulator via the Myc and Wnt signaling networks.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>TERT As a Developmental Regulator Controlling Gene Expression</title><p>Our results showing that TERT's catalytic function is not required for its ability to regulate epidermal progenitor cells indicate that TERT acts through novel mechanisms that do not require enzymatic action at telomere ends. The fact that TERT acutely causes profound changes in gene expression in mouse skin supports this idea and indicates that TERT is directly or indirectly associated with gene regulation. Interestingly, stable overexpression of TERT in cell culture, including human mammary epithelial cells, mouse ES cells, and MEFs also led to a specific transcriptional response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Several aspects of our analyses indicate that the TERT signature defined here represents a coherent, coordinated genetic program. First, many of the genes controlled by TERT encode proteins with known regulatory functions in hair follicle development. These include components of the Wnt, Shh and BMP pathways as well as transcription factors such as the homeobox proteins Dlx3 and Msx2, among many others. Second, TERT-regulated genes show an elevated frequency of chromosomal clustering, most commonly as gene pairs, but sometimes as three genes or more with transcription start sites in close proximity. This non-random organization of genes along the chromosome is seen in worms, mice and humans, likely reflecting the fact that coordinate regulation of genes is facilitated by their physical location. Actively transcribed, clustered genes may loop into nuclear domains containing localized transcription machinery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, expression of TERT constitutes a signal that impinges on these gene clusters based on the <italic>cis</italic>-sequences in their promoter regions and/or their physical location in the nucleus. Third, the TERT gene signature shows remarkable overlap with the genes controlling the natural cycles of telogen and anagen. TERT-activated genes were specifically associated with growth genes, while TERT-repressed genes were invariably in the anti-growth category. Importantly, using rigorous ROC statistics, we found that this clear linkage between the TERT signature and the natural genetic program in cycling follicles is independent of the variables used to define the composition of the TERT signature. Thus, TERT controls a highly specific and organized program that coincides with many genes regulating normal hair follicle cycling.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Convergence of TERT, Myc, and Wnt Pathways</title><p>Using GSEA, we found that the TERT signature is highly related to genetic programs controlled by Myc and by Wnt. This is particularly striking since Myc and Wnt represent two fundamental pathways regulating proliferation, differentiation and tissue progenitor cell function. Wnt is a secreted morphogen that initiates a signaling cascade leading to stabilization of beta-catenin, a protein that transactivates promoters bound by the transcription factors TCF or LEF1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The Wnt pathway is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis, for activation of hair follicle stem cells and for stem cell maintenance in the hair follicle bulge region. Interestingly, the effects of conditional beta-catenin activation in skin closely mimic those of TERT. Activation of a beta-catenin-estrogen receptor fusion protein in skin initiated a new anagen cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

In normal cycling hairs, the beta-catenin pathway is activated as quiescent hair follicle stem cells enter cycle to become active progenitors, whereas suppression of Wnt signaling is thought to take place in the quiescent multipotent stem cells. The striking similarities between their gene expression programs and the fact that TERT expression phenocopies beta-catenin in skin suggest the possibility that TERT impinges upon the Wnt pathway (see Text S1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040010-st010">Table S10</xref> for additional details).</p><p>Myc is a potent oncogene that regulates gene expression by binding cognate DNA sequences as a heterodimer with a related protein Max &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.

E-boxes, the DNA motifs recognized by Myc/Max heterodimers, and TCF/LEF motifs, the sites through which beta-catenin acts, were enriched as conserved motifs in TERT-repressed genes and TERT-activated genes, respectively. In prospectively searching the promoter regions for these consensus sequences, we confirmed that TCF/LEF sites were significantly over-represented among TERT-regulated genes. E-boxes did not show an increased frequency in TERT promoter elements, which may represent an issue with the degeneracy of the short E-box sequence and limitations in locating relevant sites through this scanning approach. As further evidence that TERT activates genes containing TCF/LEF promoter sites, we found that in the hair growth gene data set as a whole, TCF/LEF sites were not significantly over-represented. In marked contrast, TCF/LEF sites were specifically enriched in the subset of hair growth genes controlled by TERT, providing independent evidence that TERT selectively activates genes with TCF/LEF sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Telomerase Knockout Mice and Developmental Compensation</title><p>Our data suggest that TERT is an important developmental regulator in mouse skin, linking TERT to the Wnt and Myc networks, critical signaling pathways for epidermal development.

How then can our clear gain-of-function results be reconciled with the absence of a phenotype in first generation TERT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice? The simplest answer is that loss of TERT during embryonic development leads to adaptation or compensation, minimizing the deleterious effects of TERT deletion. Developmental compensation is well documented for germline knockouts of critical regulatory genes involved in cell cycle and gene regulation.

Thus, the Wnt and Myc signaling networks may adapt to minimize the loss of TERT during embryonic development, even though TERT is an active component of these networks in wild-type mice.

Our results showing that RT activity is not required in this new pathway implicate a novel aspect of TERT protein function whereby TERT is a component of a signaling pathway that impinges on the Wnt or Myc networks. TERT may act at any point along the Wnt signaling axis: by altering Wnt expression, by facilitating transduction of Wnt signals through Dishevelled, Gsk3, Axin or Apc; or by enhancing transcription initiation by beta-catenin at TCF/LEF promoter elements. The similarity between the genetic programs controlled by TERT and Myc may be explained if TERT regulated Myc levels, or if it affected the delicate balance of chromatin modification controlled by Myc and Max family members at E boxes. These data provide important justification for investigating the biochemistry and cell biology of TERT, areas that have remained largely refractory to analysis due to the very low abundance of TERT in cells and tissues. Continued investigation in these areas will likely provide new insights into how TERT functions at telomeres and in a non-canonical fashion as a developmental regulator in epithelial tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of transgenic mice.</title><p>Tetracycline-regulated i-TERT transgenic mice were generated as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040010-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

These results are consistent with acute withdrawal of TERT driving the changes in gene expression.</p><p>(194 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0040010.sg004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0040010-sg005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><title>Expression of TERT or TERT<sup>ci</sup> Does Not Alter the Size of Sebaceous Glands</title><p>Sebaceous gland (red) size is not changed in dorsal skin of male iK5-TERT or iK5-TERT<sup>ci</sup> mice versus male non-transgenic mice.
