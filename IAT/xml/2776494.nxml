As cerebellar Purkinje cells express the major regulatory elements of calcium control and represent the sole integrative output of the cerebellar cortex, changes in neural activity- and calcium-mediated membrane properties of these cells are expected to provide important insights into both intrinsic and network physiology of the cerebellum. We studied the electrophysiological behavior of Purkinje cells in genetically engineered alert mice that do not express BK calcium-activated potassium channels and in wild-type mice with pharmacological BK inactivation. We confirmed BK expression in Purkinje cells and also demonstrated it in Golgi cells. We demonstrated that either genetic or pharmacological BK inactivation leads to ataxia and to the emergence of a beta oscillatory field potential in the cerebellar cortex. This oscillation is correlated with enhanced rhythmicity and synchronicity of both Purkinje and Golgi cells. We hypothesize that the temporal coding modification of the spike firing of both Purkinje and Golgi cells leads to the pharmacologically or genetically induced ataxia.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since Purkinje cells (PCs) are solely responsible for the output of the cerebellar cortex, regulation of their firing is central for motor coordination.

This intrinsic excitability is driven by resurgent Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007991-Raman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007991-Edgerton1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007991-Womack1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In slice preparations, PCs of BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have a dramatic decrease in spontaneous firing relative to PCs from wild-type (WT) mice, partially explained by an increase in time in silent mode. In addition, the paired-pulse depression at the PC deep cerebellar neurons is increased. These findings led to the hypothesis that the major motor coordination impairment observed in BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice results from a decreased net inhibition of deep cerebellar nuclei by the PCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007991-Sausbier1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we recorded the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activities of PCs in alert BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and WT controls. We found that PC activity was only mildly decreased in BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice relative to WT, but that their cerebellum presented a beta rhythm local field potential oscillation phase-locked with ultra-rhythmic Purkinje and Golgi cells. We demonstrated the existence of BK channels in Golgi cells, which could partly explain the phase-locking of these cells to the abnormal beta rhythm in BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Two small bolts were cemented to the skull to immobilize the head during the recording sessions and a silver reference electrode was placed on the surface of the parietal cortex. An acrylic recording chamber was constructed around a posterior craniostomy, covered by a thin layer of bone wax (Ethicon&#x000ae;, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) before the recording sessions. Twenty-four hours after anesthesia, alert mice were immobilized for the recording session. The dura mater was removed locally above the vermis. Recordings were performed in lobules IV&#x02013;VIII and the location of the electrodes (depth and lobule) was noted.

Data was stored on 4-mm digital audio tapes (Sony PCM-R500) and transferred to a Pentium III personal computer with analog-to-digital converter boards (Power 1401, CED, Cambridge, UK). The recorded data were digitized continuously at 10 KHz. Off-line analysis and illustrations were performed using the Spike 2 CED software. The discrimination between PC simple and complex spikes was performed by the same software (waveform recognition) and controlled visually before analysis. Waveform averaging was performed with the corresponding function of this software on a 120 second-minimum recording.</p><p>The rhythmic frequency was defined as the reciprocal of the latency of the first peak in the autocorrelogram of simple spike firing (width&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 s, bin size&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.2 ms). Consequently, rhythmic frequency could not be determined on flat autocorrelograms. The strength of the rhythmicity was quantified with a rhythm index measured on the simple spike autocorrelogram (120 s-lasting recording, width&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 s, bin size&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 ms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007991-Sugihara1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, the height and depth of all peaks and valleys that were significantly different from the baseline and occurred at specific latencies with regard to the initial peak were summed. The sum was divided by the total number of spikes in the recording. In the autocorrelograms with no significant peaks and valleys, a value of zero was given to the rhythm index and the activity was considered as non-rhythmic. In these cases, or when the rhythm index was less than an empirically determined value of 0.01, the rhythmic frequency was not determined. Thus, we quantified the rhythmicity according to its frequency (by the rhythmic frequency) and its strength by the rhythm index (the higher the rhythmicity, the higher the rhythm index). The regularity of the cell was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV), defined as the quotient between the standard deviation and the mean of the interspike intervals. Local field potential was analyzed using a 4096-point Fast-Fourier-Transform computed from a 15-second recording sample. Oscillation index was obtained by dividing the maximum amplitude of the peak by the area below the curve. In order to test the spatial coherence of local field potential oscillation (LFPO) recordings, cross-correlation functions between each set of two LFPO (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>) were calculated. The span of time lags or leads was analyzed for a time window (T) corresponding to a recording period of 0.6 s. The cross-correlation function between two functions (e.g., &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>) was defined as:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007991.e001"/></disp-formula>where &#x003bc;<sub>i</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>i</sub> are the mean value and the variance of &#x003b1;<sub>i</sub>, and &#x003c4; is the lag between the two functions. When the signals &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>(t) and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>(t) are statistically correlated, their cross-correlation function displays a peak (a significant cross-correlation function maximum) or a trough (a significant cross-correlation function minimum) at the abscissa &#x003c4;<sup>&#x0002a;</sup>. Positive values of &#x003c4;<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> denote a time lead of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> (t) relative to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> (t), whereas negative values denote a time lag.</p><p>We used the Student's t test for unpaired samples to compare WT and mutant mice values.

Given the role of P/Q Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels in the generation and control of burst firing in PCs, the emergence of spontaneous bursting sustained by beta LFPO in BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> PCs and after BK blockade in WT mice suggests that these channels might be involved in maintaining the non-bursting mode. In BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, 27&#x00025; of PC present a normal mode of firing during the recording, which demonstrates that BK channel inactivation does not lock the cells in a bursting or in a rhythmic mode of firing, but rather facilitates the cells to maintain or switch to these modes. The difference between PC in BK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells and PC in WT mice following paxilline injection in terms of simple spike firing rate, pause duration or percentage of cells in bursting mode may be due to the different mechanisms of BK channel inactivation.

This could be due to entrainment of simple spike firing into the stereotyped bursting. However, although complex spike firing was also trapped in the beta oscillation, it remained normally responsive to peripheral stimulation. Another explanation could be that BK channels are directly involved in the simple-spike delayed inhibition.
