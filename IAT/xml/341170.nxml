Many GAPDH gene-related sequences have been found in both genomes based on genomic blot hybridization analysis. Only one functional gene product is known. Results from genomic library screenings suggest that there are 300-400 copies of these sequences in the rat genome and approximately 100 in the human genome. Some of these related sequences have been shown to be processed pseudogenes. We have isolated several rat cDNA clones corresponding to these pseudogenes indicating that some pseudogenes are transcribed. Rat and human cDNAs are 89% homologous in the coding region, and 76% homologous in the first 100 base pairs of the 3'-noncoding region. Comparison of these two cDNA sequences with those of the chicken, Drosophila and yeast genes allows the analysis of the evolution of the GAPDH genes in detail.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0309-a" xlink:role="2491"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2485"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2486"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0308.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0309.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0310.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2492"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0311.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0312.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2494"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0313.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2495"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0314.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2496"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0315.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2497"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0316.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2498"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0317.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2499"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0318.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2500"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0319.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2501"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00301-0320.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2502"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
