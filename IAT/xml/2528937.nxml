Adult myogenic precursor cells, the so called satellite cells, express both HGF and Met.

It has a reduced affinity for Met and, in contrast to HGF, it elicits activation of the AKT but not the ERK signaling pathway. As a result of its partial ability to activate Met signaling, Magic-F1 is not mitogenic but conserves the ability to protect cells against apoptosis. We have analyzed the effects of Magic-F1 on muscular cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice. We show that Magic-F1 protects myogenic precursors against apoptosis and thus enhances the differentiation process, which is naturally accompanied by cell death. This pro-differentiative effect is observed both in cultured myogenic cell systems and in two different <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Remarkably, constitutive or transient expression of Magic-F1 in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy partially rescues the dystrophic phenotype and allows animals to perform better in a classic tread mill functional test. These features make Magic-F1 a novel, potential molecular tool to counteract muscle wasting in major muscular diseases including cachexia and muscular dystrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Engineering of Magic-F1, a bivalent Met ligand</title><p>Mature HGF is a dimeric molecule consisting of a &#x003b1;- and a &#x003b2;-chain joint by a disulphide bridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x003b1;-chain contains a leader peptide for secretion, an N-domain similar to the activation domain of plasminogen, and four kringle domains (K 1&#x02013;4) typical of the blood clotting cascade proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Hartmann1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In functional terms, HGF is a bivalent molecule containing two distinct Met binding sites, one in the &#x003b1;-chain high affinity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Lokker1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and one at in the &#x003b2;-chain low affinity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistent with this idea, some monovalent scatter factor subdomains (HGF NK1, HGF NK2) display a partial agonistic activity when they are stabilized in a dimeric form by extracellular matrix proteoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Schwall1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. To generate new recombinant proteins capable of inducing specific patterns of biological responses, we engineered several artificial molecules containing different HGF domain in various combination. Magic-F1, the prototype of this series, contains the signal peptide plus the N-domain and the first two kringles repeated in tandem and joint by a linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A poly-histidine tag was engineered at the C-terminal end to facilitate protein purification. Since the high affinity Met binding site lies within the N and K1 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Lokker1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, Magic-F1 is a bivalent ligand. Magic-F1 recombinant protein was produced using both transiently and stably transfected CHO cells, and was purified by affinity chromatography as described in the Experimental Protocol section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The affinity of Magic-F1 for Met was measured in a ELISA binding assay using a recombinant chimera between Met and the Fc portion of a human immunoglobulin Fc-Met; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Mark1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Fc-Met was absorbed in solid phase and exposed to increasing concentrations of Magic-F1 or HGF in liquid phase. Binding was revealed using biotinylated anti-HGF antibodies. This analysis revealed that Magic-F1 has an affinity for Met that is approximately 7&#x02013;8 times lower than that of HGF (<italic>i.e.</italic> 0.8 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

We first subjected the myogenic cell line C2C12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Blau1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> to different biological and biochemical assays in the presence of recombinant Magic-F1. Myoblast proliferation was evaluated by culturing C2C12 cells with Magic-F1, HGF or no factor as control. While HGF induced myoblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, Magic-F1 did not affect proliferation even at high concentrations as well as NK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). As phosphorylation of Met is necessary for the activation of the HGF signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Trusolino1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, we tested whether Magic-F1 could induce Met receptor phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation analysis of Met followed by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that both HGF and Magic-F1 induce phosphorylation of Met in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that the inability of Magic-F1 to affect myoblasts proliferation is not due to defective receptor activation. Since HGF is able to promote cell proliferation through the ERK pathway and to prevent apoptosis through AKT signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Xiao1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, we next tested the ability of Magic-F1 to activate these two distinct pathways. While HGF induced phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT. Magic-F1, differently form NK2, induced phosphorylation of AKT. Moreover, consistent with the idea that HGF and Magic-F1 compete for the same binding site on Met, Magic-F1 inhibited HGF-mediated MAPK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Magic-F1 promotes myoblast differentiation and survival</title><p>Next, we generated several stable clones of C2C12 myoblasts expressing Magic-F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, C2C12 cells expressing Magic-F1 differentiated at a faster rate compared to controls. In fact, they started to express myosin heavy chain, a marker of terminal differentiation, only one day following switch to differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistent with accelerated differentiation, the myogenic markers MyoD and Myf5 were up-regulated while the Pax3 protein was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Moreover, Magic-F1 increased the expression of 30 out of 36 genes known to be upregulated during C2C12 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Tomczak1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003223.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Magic-F1-expressing C2C12 cells fused into myotubes containing on average more nuclei than controls, while HGF did not affect myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, in stable clones expressing Magic-F1, myostatin expression but not follistatin or IGF1 expression was down-regulated earlier compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). This is in agreement with previous data showing promotion of myoblast differentiation and muscle hypertropy following myostatin ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-McPherron1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-McPherron2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, cells expressing Magic-F1 displayed a marked reduction in the expression of several pro-apoptotic genes, including Bad, Bax and p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) suggesting that the anti-apoptotic properties documented for HGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Xiao1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> are conserved in Magic-F1. Thus, Magic-F1 is an engineered, HGF-derived protein that elicits a selective pattern of biological responses on myoblasts. Firstly, it is a partial agonist of Met that activates the AKT pathway but not the ERK pathway. Secondly, it conserves the anti-apoptotic activity of HGF but not its mitogenic properties. Thirdly, it significantly enhances the differentiation potential of myoblasts without affecting their proliferation. The latter property is likely to be due to its inability to activate the ERK pathway.</p><fig id="pone-0003223-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003223.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Morphological analysis of C2C12 cells expressing Magic-F1.</title><p>(A) Magic-F1 detection in the culture media of stably transfected clones by Western blot analysis.

Hypertrophic factors represent a potential therapeutic approach against muscle wasting. We therefore analyzed the effect of Magic-F1 on muscle regeneration. Muscle damage was induced in the <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> muscles of adult MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic or wild-type mice by a single intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin. MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic animals responded to muscle crush by rapidly activating the regenerative program. Three days after cardiotoxin injection, an enhanced number of centrally-nucleated regenerating myofibers and an increased expression of the regeneration hallmark protein, embryonic myosin heavy chain (MyHC), was observed in damaged muscles of transgenic mice compared to those of age-matched wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, one week post-injury, muscle fibers of MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic mice were characterized by enhanced peripherycal localization of nuclei and by the down-regulation of embryonic MyHC, indicating successful completion of the regeneration program. In contrast, in wild-type animals, regeneration persisted for a few more days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Consistent with these observations, satellite cells collected from MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic showed enhanced differentiation potential <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to satellite cells from wild-type mice. Furthermore, satellite cells from MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic mice were more differentiation-prone as revealed by smaller clone size and accelerated appearance of differentiated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003223-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This is particularly useful for pleiotropic factors eliciting several different biological responses like HGF. Magic-F1, an engineered protein derived from HGF, maintains the ability to protect cells against apoptosis and to promote myoblast differentiation, but is devoid of any mitogenic activity typical of its parental factor. This results in remarkable enhancement of skeletal muscle regeneration without induction of cell proliferation, a crucial feature for its potential therapeutic application. Notably, muscle hypertrophy was induced in normal and regenerating muscle both when Magic-F1 was present as a transgene and when it was delivered to post-natal muscles, as it would occur in a cell or gene therapy context.</p><p>The potential relevance of inducing muscle hypertrophy to the treatment of muscle disorders in humans has been suggested by studies involving <italic>mdx</italic> mice, which carry a mutation in the dystrophin gene and therefore serve as a genetic model of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Bulfield1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, injection of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against myostatin into either wild-type or <italic>mdx</italic> mice increases muscle mass and specific force, suggesting that myostatin plays an important role in regulating muscle growth in adult animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Bogdanovich1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Magic-F1 is a molecule with a potential clinical application as it can induce muscle hypertrophy by both down-regulating myostatin and directly activating MyoD, Myf5 and several anti-apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, no side effects have been observed in skeletal muscles following electro-enhanced Magic-F1 DNA transfer or in transgenic mice expressing the Magic-F1 under the control of a muscle-specific promoter.</p><p>Our data showing the inability of Magic-F1 to induce the ERK pathway together with an inhibitory interference with HGF-induced ERK activation are particular relevant to a potential therapeutic use of this engineered factor. In fact, several tissues other than myocytes and satellite cells express the Met receptor, including epithelial cells of kidney, liver, lung, skin, breast and the whole gastrointestinal tract, as well as neurons, endothelial cells and hematopoietic precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Trusolino1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Birchmeier1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this regard, the lack of any mitogenic activity makes Magic-F1 a potentially safe cytokine for cell therapy.</p><p>Because of its potent and selective effect on myoblast survival and differentiation, Magic-F1 promoted muscular hypertrophy in all mouse models analyzed. This biological activity, revealed by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, was extensively confirmed by the analysis of muscles treated by electro-enhanced DNA transfer or derived from transgenic mice expressing Magic-F1 under the control of a muscle-specific promoter. Interestingly, a statistically significant increase of myofiber cross-sectional areas was observed in the <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> muscles but not in slow-twitch <italic>soleus</italic> muscles. This can be attributed to the specificity of the promoter, active in fast twitch fibers, and to the fact that the amount of circulating Magic-F1 (escaping from fast-twitch muscles) is not enough to induce muscle hypertrophy. Moreover, following cardiotoxin treatment, regenerating centrally-nucleated fibers in the MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic mice appeared to have a greater cross-sectional area compared to wild-type animals. This can be explained by the enhanced differentiation potential of satellite cells, which indeed displayed an earlier differentiation program <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to cells isolated from wild-type mice. We previously reported the presence of myogenic precursors, named mesoangioblasts, in the skeletal muscles of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Sampaolesi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Sampaolesi2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Dellavalle1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells could also be positively affected by Magic-F1 and we cannot exclude their participation in the regeneration of skeletal muscle tissues. On the other hand, the rapid apoptotic response in cardiotoxin-treated muscles is strongly reduced in MLC1F/Magic-F1 transgenic mice. This results in a more evident muscular hypertrophy of transgenic muscles.</p><p>Several authors have reported that HGF inhibits muscle differentiation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-GalLevi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Leshem1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

All injected mice showed a physiological benefit and performed much better compared to mock-treated dystrophic animals in treadmill tests. As discussed, the less efficient rescue of the dystrophic phenotype by adenovirus-mediated Magic-F1 delivery compared to the crossing with Magic-F1 transgenic mice is conceivably due to incomplete muscle transduction. Importantly, in those mice in which all dystrophic fibers were transduced, the treadmill test performance was similar to that covered by control, non-dystrophic animals (not shown).</p><p>In conclusion, Magic-F1 is a soluble, engineered factor that displays marked anti-apoptotic and pro-differentiative clues on muscle precursors. Its ability to promote and enhance muscle regeneration makes it a potential candidate molecule for regenerative medicine, particularly for muscular dystrophy syndromes and other muscle degenerative disorders. Given the small size of its cDNA (approximately 1 kb), Magic-F1 may be used alone in a gene therapy setting or inserted as a second adjuvant gene in a vector already encoding a therapeutic gene, for example encoding a deacetylase inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003223-Minetti1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

Contamination by non-myogenic cell was reduced by pre-plating the cell suspension onto plastic dishes where fibroblasts tend to adhere more rapidly. Differentiation was induced shifting the medium to DMEM supplemented with 2&#x00025; horse serum. Cell morphology was examined daily with a phase-contrast microscope connected to an image analyzer. Cells were trypsinized daily and counted on a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell cytotoxicity was performed using an XTT-based <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicology assay kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. Incubation medium was collected after 3 hours and read spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. Background signals, obtained from plates without cells, were subtracted from sample readings. Apoptosis was quantified using an ApopTag Fluorescein In situ Apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, California) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell differentiation was carried out for 8 days. Cells were grown on 6 cm Petri dishes until sub-confluent, washed with PBS, fixed with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 minutes and then permeabilized with 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes. After incubation with PBS containing 10&#x00025; normal serum, samples were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with anti-GFP at 1&#x02236;200 dilution, anti myosin heavy chain (MF20) antibody at 1&#x02236;2 dilution. After incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with the appropriate FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing in PBS, cells were analyzed under a fluorescent microscope and photographed. As a control for the immunofluorescence method, we omitted the primary antibody and no staining was detected under these conditions. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Plasmids and DNA preparation</title><p>Magic-F1 was cloned into pIRESneo (Clontech, Italy) for C2C12 transfection experiments whereas it was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for electrotransfer experiments (pCMV-Magic-F1); a pCMV-bgal plasmid coding for beta-galactosidase and a pCMV-hHGF plasmid coding for human hepatocyte growth factor were also used.
