In the mu-delta intron, two repeating units were contained. One 442-base-long fragment located JH-mu intron (defined as "sigma mu(sigma mu)") occupied the position in the mu-delta intron. The other 1166-base-long fragment located somewhere in front of S (class switch) region of C gamma gene was also found in the mu-delta intron. We defined the repeats in the mu-delta intron as "SIGMA (sigma)". The polarities of the longer repeats in the genome were opposite between the mu-delta intron and the upstreams of C gamma genes. These inverted copies (defined as sigma gamma 3 and sigma gamma 4), located 6 kb upstream of their respective C gamma's, were apparently transcribed in vitro, via RNA polymerase III and transcripts should have contained tRNA-like structures. Small DNA fragments capable of encoding tRNA-like structures were also found in corresponding regions of mouse Ig C gamma cluster.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0141-a" xlink:role="9508"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9497"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9498"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9499"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9500"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9501"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9502"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9503"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9504"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9505"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9506"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9507"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9508"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9509"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9510"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9511"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
