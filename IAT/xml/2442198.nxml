Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) induce the clustering of sodium channels into nodal complexes flanked by paranodal axoglial junctions. However, the molecular mechanisms for nodal complex assembly in the CNS are unknown. Two isoforms of Neurofascin, neuronal Nfasc186 and glial Nfasc155, are components of the nodal and paranodal complexes, respectively. Neurofascin-null mice have disrupted nodal and paranodal complexes. We show that transgenic Nfasc186 can rescue the nodal complex when expressed in <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in the absence of the Nfasc155&#x02013;Caspr&#x02013;Contactin adhesion complex. Reconstitution of the axoglial adhesion complex by expressing transgenic Nfasc155 in oligodendrocytes also rescues the nodal complex independently of Nfasc186. Furthermore, the Nfasc155 adhesion complex has an additional function in promoting the migration of myelinating processes along CNS axons. We propose that glial and neuronal Neurofascins have distinct functions in the assembly of the CNS node of Ranvier.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CNS, central nervous system; MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; MBP, myelin basic protein; NF-L, neurofilament light chain; P, postnatal day; PNS, peripheral nervous system.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Nodes of Ranvier are the sites of action potential propagation in myelinated fibers, and their formation is essential for the switch to rapid nerve impulse transmission in the developing vertebrate nervous system. Axonal protein complexes containing voltage-gated sodium channels are assembled at nodes of Ranvier in response to myelination. In addition to sodium channels, components of the nodal complex include &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin, AnkyrinG, Contactin (in the central nervous system [CNS]), NrCAM (in the peripheral nervous system [PNS]), and a neuronal isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berghs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tait et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Bennett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). The paranodal axoglial junctions that flank the node are formed by an adhesion complex between the glial isoform of Neurofascin, Nfasc155, and the axonal proteins Caspr (also known as Paranodin) and Contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menegoz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tait et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazarinova-Noyes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sherman and Brophy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). Axoglial junctions restrict the diffusion of nodal complexes but cannot cluster them in the PNS in the absence of Nfasc186 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rios et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Studies on myelinating cocultures have indicated a key role for nodal Nfasc186 in the clustering and stabilization of macromolecular assemblies at the PNS node of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lambert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Lambert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lustig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koticha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>), and studies in vivo have supported this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). Gliomedin, a protein expressed in the region of Schwann cell microvilli, may anchor Nfasc186 at the PNS node by virtue of its ability to interact with both Neurofascin and NrCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eshed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maertens et al., 2007</xref>). However, there are indications that the mechanisms of node assembly may be different in the CNS. Soluble factors secreted by oligodendrocytes have been shown to promote sodium channel clustering in CNS axons in culture in the absence of axoglial contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>). More recent work has refined this picture by showing that Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 &#x003b1; subunits cluster under the influence of a secreted factor; however, clustering of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 &#x003b1; subunits, which are more characteristic of mature nodes, requires ensheathment by oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>). These studies have further suggested that vesicular traffic is required to deliver sodium channels to nascent nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of mice with mutations that affect the integrity of paranodal axoglial junctions has suggested that these structures, though not essential for the initial clustering of sodium channels, may be important for the long-term maintenance of the nodal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishibashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rasband et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rios et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupree et al., 2005</xref>). Derangement of the node after loss of axon&#x02013;glial contact in tissue from multiple sclerosis patients caused by inflammatory damage to CNS axons is consistent with a role for the junction in stabilizing the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howell et al., 2006</xref>). However, thus far it has not been possible to discriminate between the relative contributions of nodal and paranodal Neurofascins in the initial assembly of the nodal complex in the CNS.</p><p>In this paper, we have studied how axonal and glial Neurofascins contribute to the clustering of sodium channels at CNS nodes of Ranvier in vivo by using <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice with disrupted nodal and paranodal protein complexes. By selectively expressing either Nfasc186 or a truncated version of Nfasc155 by transgenesis in Neurofascin-null mice, we have been able to show that, in marked contrast to the PNS, each of the Neurofascin isoforms can independently rescue the CNS node of Ranvier. Furthermore, we have revealed an important function for the paranodal axoglial junction in promoting the migration and convergence of myelinating processes along axons. We propose that these two Neurofascin isoforms cooperate to assemble and maintain functional nodes of Ranvier in the vertebrate CNS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CNS phenotype of <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Neurofascin-null animals die suddenly at 7 d after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, analysis of their phenotype was performed at postnatal-day (P) 6. For most of this work, we used either teased fiber preparations or longitudinal sections from the ventral funiculus of the cervical spinal cord because we found that CNS myelination was most advanced there at this early stage of postnatal development in the mouse. Furthermore, this region of the spinal cord has relatively large axons, thus facilitating the preparation of teased fibers for microscopy and quantitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arroyo et al., 2002</xref>). Immunofluorescence showed that in Neurofascin-null nerves, there was extensive disruption to both the nodal complex (sodium channels, &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin, and AnkyrinG) and the paranodal axoglial junction (Caspr; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The paranodal myelin marker Claudin 11 was used to identify paranodes (and by inference nodes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gow et al., 1999</xref>). Contactin was present at both the nodes and paranodes of wild-type nerves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, figure and inset), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazarinova-Noyes et al., 2001</xref>) but was no longer detectable at either site in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similarly, AnkyrinG is not only a major component of the node of Ranvier, but it is also detectable at wild-type paranodes at this stage of CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Bennett, 2002</xref>); however, it is lost in the mutant in both locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Disruption of CNS paranodes and nodes in <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</bold> (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of teased fibers from the ventral funiculus of the cervical spinal cord from <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals showed that nodes and paranodes were disrupted when Nfasc155 and Nfasc186 were lost. Immunostaining of teased fibers for Claudin 11 (Oligodendrocyte-specific protein) was used to localize the paranodes of CNS myelin. Immunostaining with an antibody that recognized both Nfasc186 and Nfasc155 (Nfasc) confirmed that they were no longer at the node and paranode, respectively. The axoglial junctional components Caspr and Contactin were also no longer concentrated at the paranodes. In the CNS, Contactin is present at both the node and paranodes (inset). The nodal components voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), Contactin, &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin (&#x003b2;IV-Spec), and AnkyrinG were mislocalized in mutant animals.

However, although it was mislocalized, there were normal amounts of Caspr in mutant spinal cord tissue, suggesting that disruption of the axoglial adhesion complex did not impair the biosynthesis and/or stability of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy revealed myelinating and unmyelinated profiles in both wild-type and mutant nerves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

This suggested that myelination might be either retarded or halted in the mutant. The reduction in myelin protein in the mutant was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of myelinated axons observed at P6 in the ventral funiculus of the mutant cervical spinal cord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The reduction in the amount of myelin was not a consequence of a general decrease in the number of axons in the CNS of Neurofascin-null animals because the total number of axons in the optic nerves of mutants was normal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Neither was the reduced extent of myelination a consequence of an inadequate pool of myelin-forming glia because the numbers of oligodendrocytes in wild-type and mutant cervical spinal cord sections were not significantly different (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced myelination in the mutant at P6.</bold> (A) Electron microscopy of transverse sections from the cervical cord of 6-d-old <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals showed that, at this very early stage of CNS myelination, both myelinating (arrowheads) and nonmyelinated (asterisks) profiles were visible in wild-type and mutant cord.

First, it was important to demonstrate that this epitope-tagged protein was targeted appropriately to the node of Ranvier and that it colocalized with the nodal complex (sodium channels, &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin, Contactin, and AnkyrinG) in <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Then, we showed that expression of transgenic Nfasc186 on a Neurofascin-null background was fully able to rescue the nodal complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Intriguingly, and in contrast to Contactin, AnkyrinG in the rescued fibers resumed its normal localization at both the node and paranode (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This suggests that the transient expression of AnkyrinG at the paranodes during the postnatal development of myelinated CNS fibers does not depend on either Nfasc155 or its axonal partners Caspr and Contactin because in the absence of Nfasc155, there was no amelioration of the mislocalization of Caspr (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The transient nature of paranodal AnkyrinG is shown by its loss in both wild-type and Nfasc186-rescued nerves by P16 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Nfasc186 rescues the CNS nodal complex in <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</bold> (A) Immunostaining of teased ventral funiculus fibers in the CNS at P6 shows that FLAG-tagged Nfasc186 is targeted to the nodes of myelinated axons and that it can rescue the nodal components, voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin, Contactin, and AnkyrinG when expressed on a Neurofascin-null background. Immunostaining of teased fibers for the paranodal myelin marker Claudin 11 was used to confirm the localization of the node of Ranvier. Note that nodal rescue of AnkyrinG also retrieved the protein to the paranodes. (B) Immunostaining for Caspr at P16 showed that reconstitution of the nodal complex by expressing FLAG-tagged Nfasc186 on a Neurofascin-null background was not accompanied by rescue of the axoglial junction and that, as a consequence, juxtaparanodal Kv1.1 channels were mislocalized. (C) By P16, CNS nodes contain Nav1.6 channels, indicating that the absence of the axoglial junction does not prevent developmental changes in the expression of sodium channel subtypes.

Further, we showed that it can reconstitute the axoglial junctional complex in the peripheral nerves of Neurofascin-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>), presumably by virtue of the ability of the extracellular domain to interact with components of the axonal Caspr&#x02013;Contactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gollan et al., 2003</xref>).

This was so not only when the myelinating processes had converged to form a nascent paranodal complex at P6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) but also when they were still migrating and the interheminodal gap was &#x0003e;14 &#x003bc;m apart, as was observed frequently at P4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

However, there was no significant difference in the width of the gap in wild-type nerves compared with Neurofascin-null nerves rescued with C-terminally truncated Nfasc155, indicating that this protein effectively rescued process migration.

The fact that there was no statistical difference between the interheminodal gap in wild-type CNS axons compared with Neurofascin-null nerves rescued with the <italic>Nfasc155&#x00394;IC</italic> transgene underlined the ability of Nfasc155 to promote normal process migration through restoration of the axoglial junction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, E and F</xref>).</p><p>Neurofascin-null mice rescued with the <italic>Nfasc186</italic> transgene had an extended lifespan, and this allowed us to ask whether oligodendrocyte process migration was either delayed or was completely stalled in the absence of Nfasc155 at P6.

Hence, the absence of an axoglial adhesion complex delayed, rather than prevented, the extension and convergence of oligodendrocyte processes altogether, and electron microscopy showed that this delay did not cause dysmyelination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The mechanisms of assembly of the node of Ranvier and the clustering of sodium channels are likely to occur by different mechanisms in the CNS when compared with the PNS, not least because of the different structure and protein composition of their nodal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak and Peles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sherman and Brophy, 2005</xref>). For example, Contactin is a characteristic component of CNS nodes but is absent from PNS nodes, whereas we find that the reverse is true for NrCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazarinova-Noyes et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has provided strong circumstantial evidence that the axoglial junction might have a role in the formation of the CNS node. Analysis of the developing optic nerve showed that Caspr staining, which is indicative of the formation of axoglial complexes, preceded the detection of sodium channel clusters, which were initially typically broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>). The same authors showed that <italic>Shiverer</italic> mutant mice lacking normal axoglial junctions had reduced and ectopic sodium channel clusters. This indicated, probably for the first time, that there was a relationship between the integrity of the axoglial junctional complex and the ability of myelinated CNS axons to cluster sodium channels. Subsequent analysis of another mutant, UDP-galactose/ceramide galactosyltransferase&#x02013;deficient mice, which also lacks intact paranodal axoglial junctions, showed that it was able to form Nav1.6 channel clusters at nodes but that these became more diffuse and less concentrated with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rasband et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, Contactin and Caspr were still detectable in paranodal complexes in these mice, whereas Nfasc155 was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schafer et al., 2004</xref>). These observations may be reconciled by our demonstration here that either Nfasc186 or Nfasc155 (through the formation of the axoglial complex) can promote the assembly of the nodal complex. Thus, in the case of the ceramide galactosyltransferase mutant mice, Nfasc186 delivered to the axolemma, possibly guided by local concentrations of Caspr and Contactin, might drive the assembly of the node in the absence of the paranodal junction.</p><p>The tips of oligodendrocyte processes visualized in the teased fiber preparations used in the present work are enriched in Nfasc155 and Caspr. The early formation of axoglial junctions has been observed previously in the optic nerve, and it is known that axoglial septate junctions can be detected in the same nerve as early as after one turn of the myelinating process around an axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiggins et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>). The fact that process migration is retarded in the absence of these proteins suggests that the axoglial adhesion complex has a role in promoting their extension. Nevertheless, the ability of the processes to ultimately converge shows that the axoglial complex is not solely responsible for allowing oligodendrocyte processes to extend. Recent evidence for the involvement of the WAVE proteins and their associated links with the actin cytoskeleton in oligodendrocyte process extension provides a possible additional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Signaling via the axoglial adhesion complex might stimulate oligodendrocytes to extend their myelinating processes. However, Nfasc155 lacking most of its C terminus can not only reconstitute the adhesion complex but can also cluster nodal proteins, which shows that intracellular signaling mediated via the carboxy terminus of Nfasc155 is not necessary to promote the assembly of the node of Ranvier in the CNS. This raises the intriguing idea that intracellular signaling in the axon in response to axoglial interaction, possibly mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of Caspr, may stimulate the extension of oligodendrocyte processes during myelination, in addition to the role of the oligodendrocyte actin cytoskeleton and the WAVE proteins. Certainly, and unlike Nfasc155, Caspr cannot contribute to stable axoglial junctions without its intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gollan et al., 2002</xref>). Further, a short sequence in this domain mediates binding to the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1B, which is itself part of a cytoskeletal complex that includes AnkyrinB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gollan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, most mice lacking AnkyrinB die at P8, although some survive until P21 and have a particularly severe phenotype in the CNS where optic nerves degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>). This may reflect defects in axon-glia signaling.</p><p>The role of the axoglial adhesion complex in the extension of oligodendrocyte processes most probably accounts for the reduced extent of myelination in the CNS of Neurofascin-null mice at P6. This is in contrast to the PNS, where myelination is unaffected at P6 in the absence of the Neurofascins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). The cell biology of myelination by oligodendrocytes when compared with that of Schwann cells may underlie these differences. Oligodendrocyte processes must first extend from their cell bodies, make contact with axons, and then extend along them to completely ensheath internodes. In contrast, Schwann cells in vivo cover the axons that they are destined to ensheath before myelination ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>). Hence, the sites of nascent nodes of Ranvier are already defined by where each Schwann cell abuts its neighbors. The mechanisms by which Schwann cells subsequently grow and elongate are not fully understood but appear to involve the cytoplasm-filled Cajal bands, which are uniquely Schwann cell structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Court et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The internodes of CNS axons are up to three times shorter than those in the PNS at a given axon diameter. Nevertheless, the CNS node of Ranvier still accounts for &#x0003c;1% of the length of the adjacent internode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramon y Cajal, 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fraher, 1978</xref>). In spite of the fact that nodes constitute such short segments of the axon, clustered sodium channels are still detectable at &#x0223c;16% of nascent nodes in <italic>Nfasc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> nerves. This indicates that sodium channels are not randomly delivered to the axolemma but are targeted to the nascent node independently of either Nfasc186 or Nfasc155, although one or both of these proteins is clearly required to stabilize the nascent node. Interestingly, a previous study found that &#x0223c;12% of sodium channel clusters in the developing optic nerve was not associated with Caspr-positive axoglial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>). However, these clusters would be expected to contain Nfasc186, which, as the present work shows, would be sufficient to promote the assembly of the nodal complex.</p><p>Sodium channels are probably delivered to the nascent node via an exocytotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>). It has been proposed that AnkyrinG might regulate such targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Bennett, 2002</xref>); however, this still leaves the question open as to how AnkyrinG is itself delivered to the nascent node. Once the sodium channels with their associated &#x003b2; subunits reach the nodal membrane, they would be expected to interact with Nfasc186 and &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin to form a macromolecular complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ratcliffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McEwen and Isom, 2004</xref>). In the absence of Nfasc186, the complex would diffuse in the lateral plane of the membrane, and without an intact axoglial junction to function as a sieve or barrier to their further dispersal, the nodal proteins may be endocytosed or proteolyzed in the internodal region, as occurs in the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pedraza et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>). Reintroduction of Nfasc186 would reduce the dissipation of the complex by anchoring it at the node. Because sodium channels, their &#x003b2; subunits, and AnkyrinG can interact with Nfasc186 directly, their presence at the node could also drive the targeted delivery of Nfasc186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ratcliffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Bennett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McEwen and Isom, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The clustering of sodium channels can occur independently of the presence of an intact axoglial junction. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for nodal sodium channels to disperse over time when the paranodal junctional complex is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rios et al., 2003</xref>). The importance of an intact axoglial junction for the long-term stability of the nodal complex has also been demonstrated in mouse mutants and after chemical disruption of the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishibashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupree et al., 2005</xref>). The limited extension of viability in Neurofascin-null mice expressing transgenic Nfasc186 may reflect their lack of intact axoglial junctions because Caspr-null mice lacking paranodal junctions in the CNS and PNS generally die between P21 and P33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the tendency for the nodal complex to become more diffuse is more pronounced in the CNS compared with the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rios et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests that the junctional complex plays a more important role in containing the nodal complex in the CNS than in the PNS, which is consistent with a more prominent role for the axoglial junction in assembling the CNS nodal complex.</p><p>An intriguing question is why CNS nodes exploit two distinct mechanisms to concentrate the macromolecular complex required for saltatory conduction at the node of Ranvier, whereas in the PNS, Nfasc186 has a uniquely important role. The role of Nfasc186 in the PNS had been inferred from previous experiments both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>), and here we have demonstrated its absolute requirement in PNS node assembly in vivo. Once anchored at the PNS node via extracellular interactions, possibly mediated by gliomedin and intracellular association with the actin cytoskeleton by means of AnkyrinG and &#x003b2;IV-Spectrin, Nfasc186 participates in an exceptionally stable complex, as indicated by the relative insensitivity of sodium channels to dispersion after disruption of the paranodal axoglial junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rios et al., 2003</xref>). The uniquely PNS nodal component, NrCAM, may also play a part here because it is known to interact with Nfasc186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Volkmer et al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of NrCAM, CNS nodes may depend on the axoglial junction to provide an independent mechanism for focusing and concentrating sodium channels to complement their cis interactions with Nfasc186. Future application of the transgenic rescue strategy described in this work should allow us to functionally dissect the protein&#x02013;protein interactions by which Nfasc186 and Nfasc155 cooperate in the assembly of the CNS node of Ranvier.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal work conformed to UK legislation (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and to the University of Edinburgh Ethical Review Committee policy.
