The demonstration that miRNA profiles are altered during hypoxia and repress a genotoxic response indicates that changes in microenvironment in eukaryotes mimic those of lower species and plants, where, for example, abiotic stresses regulate the expression of thousands of genes in plants at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels through a number of miRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>High mobility group A2 (HMGA2) protein is a non-histone architectural transcription factor, which is a member of the HMGA family. This family is constituted by HMGA1a, HMGA1b, HMGA1c, and HMGA2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HMGAs are chromosomal proteins that bind through their AT binding motifs or AT hooks to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA strands[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The two types of HMGA protein, HMGA1 (HMG-I/Y) and HMGA2 (HMGI-C), have similar functions and are coded for by two different genes at chromosomal loci 6p21.3 and 12q15, respectively. HMGA proteins are expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, their expression being absent or greatly reduced in adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, HMGA proteins have been implicated in the regulation of transcription, differentiation, neoplastic transformation, and integration and expression of viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HMGA2 has been implicated mainly in benign and malignant mesenchymal tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] Nevertheless, increased expression of HMGA2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma has been linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereby epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, HMGA2 expression in patients with breast cancer has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the precise role of and the molecular events elicited by HMGA2 in tumorigenesis still need to be defined. Furthermore, HMGA2 expression has been shown to be associated with enhanced selective chemosensitivity towards the topoisomerase (topo) II inhibitor, doxorubicin, in breast cancer HS578T and salivary Pa-4/HMGA2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These studies have suggested that HMGA2 induces a persistent basal H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation and perturbs doxorubicin-elicited DNA damage checkpoint promoting enhanced chemosensitivity towards doxorubicin treatment in HMGA2-expressing cells.</p><p>Although proteins have been established as regulatory factors in growth, development and accommodation to alterations in environment, our knowledge of the contribution of regulatory small RNA molecules to such is rapidly evolving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20&#x02013;24 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally control gene expression. They are spawned by RNA polymerase II as large primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some miRNAs are structured in clusters and transcribed as polycistrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while others exist in introns of protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and are co-transcribed with host genes. Pri-miRNA transcripts form typical fold-back structures that are identified and processed into ~70nt imperfect stem-loop miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) by a microprocessor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. After processing by the microprocessor complex, pre-miRNAs are exported by Ran-GTP dependent transporter exportin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] from the nucleus into cytoplasm, where they are processed by the RNAse III enzyme, Dicer, into imperfect dsRNA duplexes that contain both mature and complementary miRNA strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One of the mature miRNA strands forms an effector ribonucleoprotein complex termed RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) which guides the miRNAs to specific mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. RISC either cleaves or blocks translation of the target mRNA, depending on the degree of sequence complementarity.</p><p>Here we report that HMGA2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells is regulated in part by the expression of miRNA-98 (miR-98). Albeit HMGA2 is associated with enhanced selective chemosensitivity towards topoisomerase (topo) II inhibitor, doxorubicin in HNSCC, the expression of HMGA2 is thwarted by hypoxia. This is accompanied by enhanced expression of miRNA-98 and other miRNAs, which predictably target HMGA2.

Cell lines were subcultured using a disaggregration assay with Trypsin (0.1%) and EDTA (0.01%) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.5. For some experiments cell lines were made hypoxic by placing them in a Heto-Holten Cell house incubator at 1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 94% nitrogen for periods up to 1 hr or 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 90% nitrogen for periods up to 8 hr. All agents were administered by syringe in a closed system for hypoxia experiments to avoid reoxygenation effects.

The levels and quality of RNA was achieved by the Agilent Bioanalyzer&#x02122; and with a spectrophotometer using 230 nm/260 nm ratios. The dendrimer Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were then employed to label RNA sequences. First, poly-A tails were added to the RNA sequences at 3' ends using poly(A) polymerase. A nucleotide tag was then added to the poly-A tail in a ligation reaction. In the case of dual-sample experiments, the two sets of RNA sequences were added with tags of two different sequences. The tagged RNA sequences were hybridized to the array with labeling carried out during the second hybridization reaction using dendrimer dyes. The labeled samples were then hybridized over night to a Human_V7.1C_051017 miRNA array chip (LC Sciences) using a micro circulation pump. After the hybridization, the chips were subjected to a stringent wash and fluorescence data were collected by using an Axon laser scanner model 4000B (Axon Instruments) and the chips were scanned at a pixel size of 10 &#x003bc;M with Cy3 Gain at 460 and the Cy5 Gain at 470 scanning.

In essence, cell lines were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides for HGMA2 as described above. The oligonucleotides encoding HMGA2 siRNA was compared with an oligonucleotide scramble siRNA as control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These studies revealed that HMGA2 siRNA induced down-regulation of HMGA2 protein expression as assessed by Western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref> lower panel), and diminished doxorubicin sensitivity by MTT assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>). Recognizing that SCC cell lines became resistant to doxorubicin during periods of hypoxia and following diminished HMGA2 expression after siRNA transfection in normoxic cells we sought to verify that HMGA2 was a feasible target for miRNA-98 in SCC cell lines. To further appraise HMGA2 as a miRNA-98 target, SCC cell lines were transfected with the pre-miR-98&#x02122; (Ambion) using siPORT&#x02122; NeoFX&#x02122; Transfection Agent, for 72 hours. The increased levels of miRNA-98 were validated by miRVana qRT-PCR&#x02122; as before. These treatments resulted in diminishment in protein levels and mRNA expression of HMGA2 in control the normoxic SCC-4 cell line as well as cell lines exposed to hypoxia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a,b</xref>); similar results were obtained for SCC-10B and SCC-9 cell lines (not shown). The demonstration that pre-miRNA-98&#x02122; diminished mRNA expression of HMGA2 was surprising, since the tenet of early studies, using reporter constructs had indicated that complete complementarities between miRNAs and target mRNAs was necessary for cleavage, whereas mismatches result in translational repression. However, the findings reported here are supported by more recent research, which revealed that miRNAs with partial complementarities can induce attenuation in cognate transcript levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In fact, most recently it has been shown that the ability of miRNAs to expedite poly(A) removal does not result from decreased translation; nor does translational repression by miRNAs require a poly(A) tail, with a 3' histone stem-loop being an effective substitute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>a.

The mRNA expression of the control levels of each condition was set as 1. The error bars represents S.E.M. for 3 experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-6-5-9"/></fig><p>Conversely, the use of the anti-miR-98&#x02122; provided little information in the present studies. Cell lines grown under normoxia express little miRNA-98 so that the effects of anti-mir-98&#x02122; on HMGA2 levels were limited (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a,b</xref>). Transfection with anti-miR-98&#x02122; had only minor effects on the HMGA2 levels in SCC cell lines grown in hypoxia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a,b</xref>). This is probably owing to the increased expression during hypoxia of other targeting miRNAs such as <italic>hsa &#x02013; let-7g</italic>, <italic>hsa-let-7e </italic>and <italic>hsa-let-7i </italic>all of which possess 7 complementary target sites for HMGA2. Inherent in these findings is the recognition that derepression of a mRNA targeted by a miRNAs in an altered microenvironment probably can not be achieved through down-regulation of a single miRNA in that most mRNAs possess multiple complementary target sites with a number of miRNAs.</p><p>Until lately, there was only speculation that inhibition by a miRNA to a specific mRNA could be effectively reversed. However, recent studies have shown that CAT-1 mRNA and reporters bearing its 3'UTR can be relieved from miR-122-mediated repression in human Huh7 hepatoma cells when they are subjected to different types of stress. Moreover, that the derepression is accompanied by the release of CAT-1 mRNA from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its entry into polysomes and that the process involves binding of HuR, <italic>trans</italic>-acting AU rich element (ARE) binding protein, to the 3'UTR of CAT-1 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There is also additional evidence indicating that some miRNA-controlled mRNAs can be relieved from repression by synaptic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] indicating that miRNA regulation is more pronounced than previously anticipated and that it is able to respond quickly to specific cellular needs. What is yet to be determined is whether changes in oxygen tension provide a like mechanism for derepression of miRNAs against HMGA2. There is clear evidence that HuR, a major ARE-binding protein is expressed in many different cells and regulates the stability, subcellular shuttling, and/or translation of ARE-mRNAs (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). Moreover, the level of cytoplasmic HuR increases during cell proliferation, differentiation, and in response to stress stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] decreasing with senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Also, the high level of cytoplasmic HuR in cancer cells is in keeping with the ability of HuR to increase the stability and translation of ARE-mRNAs that regulate cell proliferation and neovascularization by stabilizing VEGF following hypoxia. HuR has also been shown to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm during hypoxia and to stabilize HIF-1&#x003b1; and EGFR mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consequently, we searched the AERD database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] but were not able to demonstrate any of the five clusters containing adenylate uridiylate (AU)-rich elements in their 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) that would afford HMGA2 stabilization or derepression by HuR. Furthermore, since HuR shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during hypoxia it would appear that HMGA2 would be overwhelmed by HuR, making it unlikely that HMGA mRNA is stabilized like other ARE-mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies validate the observation that HMGA2 plays a prominent role in governing genotoxic responses. However, this may only represent cells growing under normal oxygen tensions. The demonstration that miRNA profiles are altered during hypoxia and repress a genotoxic response indicates that changes in microenvironment in eukaryotes mimic lower species and plants, where, for example, abiotic stresses regulate the expression of thousands of genes in plants at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels through a number of miRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Yet to be established is to what extent miRNA expression is regulated by defined signaling cascades and transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>C H performed
