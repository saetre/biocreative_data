Dendrites were proposed to receive information, and axons to transmit it to other sites. Some general morphological features distinguish axons and dendrites. Dendrites are typically shorter than axons, taper as they leave the cell body, and decrease in size as they branch. The diameter of axons is relatively constant, and does not decrease with branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the last several decades, molecular differences, including the presence of different membrane and cytoskeletal proteins in neuron subregions, have been added to these original morphological observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>One type of molecular difference that is likely to be fundamental to neuronal polarity is the distinction between the axonal and dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton. Specific sets of microtubule-binding proteins are found in axons and dendrites. For example, the microtubule-binding protein MAP2 is enriched in dendrites, while dephospho-tau is enriched in axons. The microtubules themselves are also organized differently in axons and dendrites. In axons, microtubules are oriented with their plus-ends distal to the cell body, while in proximal dendrites microtubule polarity is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is thought that differences in the microtubule cytoskeleton contribute to polarized trafficking to axons and dendrites.</p><p>Membrane proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and adhesion proteins, can also be selectively targeted to axons or dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To help maintain distinct axonal and somatodendritic plasma membranes, a diffusion barrier is present in the initial segment of the axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The implications of selective membrane protein targeting to axons and dendrites for neuronal function are profound. For example, the presence of different receptors and adhesion molecules on axons and dendrites means they can be guided by different external signals as they grow.</p><p>Another major type of neuronal compartmentalization is localization of protein synthesis machinery. The bulk of ribosomes, RNA, and other proteins required for protein synthesis are localized to the cell body and proximal dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This type of specialization is easy to see by electron microscopy, but its significance is not well-understood. Major advances in recent years have centered on transport of specific RNAs, usually with associated ribosomes and other translation proteins, into dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In general, ribosomes and RNAs are rare in axons, although in specific circumstances, for example during axon pathfinding, axonal RNAs do have an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nothing is known about the mechanism that keeps most RNAs and other protein synthesis machinery out of axons and dendrites.</p><p>In addition to the major division of a neuron into axons, dendrites and soma, further regional specialization can exist. For example, concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels in the beginning of the axon permits this region to function as a decision point in action potential generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The types of neuronal compartmentalization described above were identified primarily by analysis of mammalian neurons. In particular, much of the work on regional molecular differences in neurons has been carried out in primary cultures of rodent neurons. While these culture systems are extremely useful for studying neuronal polarity, it would be beneficial to have an alternative system with different strengths, for example, the ability to use genetics and observe neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Genetic analysis of neural development in both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>has already made profound contributions to studying axon pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and could prove similarly useful for neuronal polarity. However, invertebrate neuronal organization has been viewed as fundamentally different from that of vertebrate neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. One of the most widely cited reviews on neuronal polarity suggested of invertebrate neurons that "the organization of their axonal and dendritic domains is sufficiently different from that in vertebrate neurons to suggest that the details of molecular sorting may also differ" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this study we assemble a set of new and previously characterized markers to analyze the molecular compartmentalization of two types of <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons. Although some of the markers have been analyzed in isolation before, we believe that analyzing their localization together provides a much more complete view of neuronal organization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We also use live imaging to directly analyze axonal and dendritic microtubule orientation for the first time in an invertebrate.</p><p>For analysis of neuronal compartmentalization, we studied two types of larval interneurons: Kenyon cells of the mushroom body, and projection neurons of the antennal lobe. The development and morphology of both of these types of neurons has been previously characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and both can be specifically labeled with the Gal4-UAS binary expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a, b</xref>). The mushroom body is required for olfactory learning during both larval and adult stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and projection neurons transmit signals from the antennal lobe glomeruli to the mushroom body calyx (dendrites) and lateral horn, where the information is further processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Visualization of both types of neurons in the larval brain shows that they have axons and dendrites that occupy specific regions in the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a, b</xref>). We obtained similar results in both types of neurons, indicating that they are likely to be broadly applicable to <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons. For live imaging, we used the larval peripheral nervous system, as it lies close to the surface and can be easily visualized in whole animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of three types of <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons. <bold>(a) </bold>Larval mushroom body interneurons.

The two exogenous proteins we examined were: tau-green fluorescent protein (tau-GFP) and nod-yellow fluorescent protein (nod-YFP). Some reports have suggested that tagged versions of the microtubule binding domain of bovine tau preferentially label axons in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although others have also reported dendrite localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We examined the distribution of one of these tagged bovine tau proteins, tau-myc-GFP (which we call tau-GFP for simplicity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in mushroom body and projection neurons (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In both mushroom body and projection neurons, tau-GFP was abundant in the main axon tracts. It was less abundant in distal axons and dendrites. For comparison, mCD8-GFP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is present in all neuronal compartments. Thus, tau-GFP preferentially labels proximal axons. Fusion proteins that consist of the nod motor domain, kinesin coiled-coil, and a tag have previously been localized to dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To confirm that nod fusions label dendrites specifically, we expressed nod-YFP in mushroom body and projection neurons. In both cases nod-YFP localized clearly to dendrites but not axons (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, two exogenous microtubule-binding proteins, tau-GFP and nod-YFP, localized to different neuronal compartments, indicating that axonal and dendritic microtubules have distinct features in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mushroom body neurons are divided into molecularly distinct compartments. Mushroom body neurons expressing tagged markers were generated by crossing flies containing mushroom body Gal4 drivers with flies carrying UAS-controlled markers. The 201Y Gal4 was used in all panels except L10-YFP and homer-GFP, for which the OK107 Gal4 was used. 201Y drives expression in a large subset of mushroom body neurons [54, 55], and OK107 drives expression in all mushroom body neurons [11] as well as the optic lobe.

All panels represent confocal projections through the entire mushroom body, except homer-GFP, which shows the cell bodies, dendrites and proximal axons, with distal axons in the inset.

Confocal projections through the region occupied by projection neurons are shown.

We performed a protein trap screen as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] to identify proteins targeted to specific regions of neurons. Fly lines isolated from this screen contain transposons with the GFP coding sequence inserted into the genome. Insertions within genes result in the GFP coding sequence being spliced into the mRNA, and generate tagged proteins from the genomic locus. GFP-Map205 was identified as a line with strong axonal GFP. Another microtubule binding protein, GFP-Jupiter, was previously isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Both protein trap lines exhibited strong GFP fluorescence in a subset of neurons. Like tau-GFP, both <italic>Drosophila </italic>microtubule binding proteins were highly concentrated in axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), although the relative amounts of tagged protein in axons and dendrites were harder to compare when expression was scattered throughout the brain. This preliminary localization data suggest that both are good candidates for endogenous axon-specific microtubule binding proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Tagged endogenous proteins localize to distinct neuronal compartments.

The dendritic localization of nod fusion proteins, which are believed to act as minus-end directed motors, has been used to argue that <italic>Drosophila </italic>dendrites are likely to have minus-ends distal to the cell body like vertebrate dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, direct analysis of the orientation of individual microtubules has not been performed in any invertebrate neuron.</p><p>Analysis of a microtubule plus-end tracking protein was previously used in mammalian neurons to confirm that axon and dendrite microtubules have different orientations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As these proteins generally bind only to the growing plus ends of microtubules, microtubule orientation can be inferred from the direction of movement of a tagged plus-end binding protein. The peripheral nervous system of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>larva is well-suited to live imaging and has been previously used to study actin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We therefore expressed the plus-end binding protein EB1-GFP throughout the nervous system using an elav-Gal4 driver, and performed time lapse imaging of the dorsal cluster of the peripheral nervous system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) in live, whole, early L2 larvae. We primarily analyzed EB1-GFP dynamics in axons and dendrites of dendritic arborization neurons, which have highly branched dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>EB1-GFP dots were clearly seen moving in the cell body, axons, and dendrites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Movements of EB1-GFP dots were consistent with the tagged protein only binding to growing microtubule plus ends: an individual dot that could be followed through multiple frames never changed direction, and after a dot tracked through a particular region of an axon or dendrite and disappeared, often a dot with a similar track appeared several frames later. All EB1-GFP dots in axons moved away from the cell body (24 out of 24; only dots that could be followed in three consecutive frames were counted; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). An example of an axon with two different EB1-GFP dots is shown in the upper panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In dendrites the movements were very different. The vast majority of dots moved toward the cell body (53 out of 55; dots present in 3+ frames). Occasionally, dendrites were observed that had dots moving in opposite directions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lower panels, and Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Determination of microtubule polarity in axons and dendrites using EB1-GFP dynamics.

We generated a tagged ribosomal protein, L10-YFP to determine where protein synthesis takes place in <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons. When expressed in both mushroom body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and projection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) neurons, L10-YFP was concentrated in the cell body, with only very faint signal present in neuropil. Within the cell body it was seen in the cytoplasm, and in some cells it was also present in the nucleus, where ribosomes are assembled. Faint signal in dendrites may represent ribosomes or free L10-YFP.</p><p>To confirm that the L10-YFP marker represents the localization of endogenous protein synthesis machinery, we compared its localization to two proteins identified in our protein trap screen. One of our GFP insertions was in the <italic>bel </italic>gene. Bel is a DEAD-box protein that is likely to function as an RNA-binding protein with a role in translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The GFP transposon insertion we isolated was homozygous viable. As <italic>bel </italic>is an essential gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], this means that the GFP-tagged protein that is generated from the insertion is likely to be functional, and thus the localization of the protein trap very likely represents that of the endogenous protein. Bel was broadly expressed, and in neurons it localized to the cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A protein trap line in which GFP localized to the cytoplasm in all neuronal compartments is shown for comparison in the upper right panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The other insertion we analyzed was in the <italic>pdi </italic>gene. Pdi is a chaperone that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and is involved in processing newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins. GFP-Pdi was also seen throughout the brain and was highly concentrated in the neuron cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Within the cell body, GFP-Pdi was brightest in the perinuclear region, which is consistent with localization to the ER. Thus, an exogenous protein synthesis protein, L10-YFP, and two endogenous ones, GFP-Bel and GFP-Pdi, were all concentrated in the neuronal cell body, suggesting that the bulk of protein synthesis takes place there.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre- and post-synaptic sites are localized to different regions of mushroom body neurons</title><p>One of the longest recognized forms of neuronal compartmentalization is concentration of postsynaptic sites to dendrites and presynaptic sites to axons. To determine whether excitatory synaptic inputs are received in dendrites, we analyzed the distribution of the postsynaptic marker homer-GFP in mushroom body neurons. Mammalian homer proteins bind metabotropic glutamate receptors and Shank, which forms a complex with NMDA glutamate receptors. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>homer protein also binds Shank and localizes to postsynaptic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Homer-GFP localizes similarly to endogenous homer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In brains that expressed homer-GFP at low levels in the mushroom body (see Materials and methods), fluorescence was confined to dendrites and dots in the cell body (likely to be the Golgi based on previous analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), and was not present in axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The pattern of homer-GFP fluorescence in the mushroom body dendrite region (calyx) was similar to the strongest regions of staining with anti-Dlg and anti-Scrib immunofluorescence (not shown); both of these proteins are concentrated at postsynaptic sites. Thus, a marker of excitatory postsynaptic sites was polarized to dendrites.</p><p>We generated low expression level n-synaptobrevin-YFP (n-syb-YFP) transgenic flies to specifically label synaptic vesicles in the mushroom body. These transgenes had either one or two UAS sites upstream of the transcriptional start site, rather than the usual five. Spots of fluorescence were seen in the axons and dendrites; very little was present in the cell body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). To confirm that the dots of fluorescence represented synaptic vesicles, we stained brains expressing n-syb-YFP in the mushroom body with cysteine string protein (CSP) and Scrib antibodies. CSP is a synaptic vesicle protein that is abundant in all presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and Scrib is a synaptic protein that is concentrated in the postsynaptic terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Many of the n-syb-YFP dots in the calyx region of the brain, which contains mushroom body dendrites, overlapped with the CSP, but not the Scrib, pattern (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), indicating that n-syb-YFP is present in synaptic vesicles. Note that some regions of the calyx that are positive for CSP do not contain n-syb-YFP (asterisk in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Extrinsic neurons, such as olfactory projection neurons, synapse onto mushroom body dendrites in the calyx, and so it is expected that not all synaptic vesicles would be accounted for by n-syb-YFP expressed in mushroom body neurons. Having verified that our low expression n-syb-YFP marker colocalized with synaptic vesicles, we concluded that synaptic vesicles are present in axons and dendrites of mushroom body neurons. We were unable to generate appropriate levels of expression of pre- or post-synaptic markers for analysis in projection neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>The n-syb-YFP marker is localized to synaptic vesicles in mushroom body dendrites.

One of the most important further regional specializations is the axon initial segment, which contains specific arrangements of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. In our survey of marker localization in <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons, we identified two proteins that showed very distinctive localization to the proximal neurite and axon.</p><p>NgCAM-YFP expressed at low levels (see Materials and methods) was concentrated at the beginning of the neurite in mushroom body neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In projection neurons, NgCAM-YFP was clearly seen in the primary neurite before the dendrites branched off, and in the proximal axon beyond the dendrite branch point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; arrowhead indicates start of axon, beyond dendrite branch point). Much fainter fluorescence was present in distal axons and dendrites. NgCAM is a chick neural cell adhesion molecule that is selectively localized to axons when expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and can be tethered by ankyrins in the initial segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Another tagged protein, Apc2-GFP, was targeted to the proximal region of <italic>Drosophila </italic>axons. In both mushroom body and projection neurons, Apc2-GFP was present in the cell body and dendrites (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In mushroom body neurons it localized to just one region of the axons, near the beginning of the peduncle (arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In projection neurons, Apc2-GFP also localized to the proximal axon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), but the pattern was not quite as striking as in the mushroom body, probably because Apc2-GFP expression levels were lower in the projection neurons. The region of the proximal axon to which Apc2-GFP was localized in mushroom body neurons was just distal to the stretch of proximal neurites in which NgCAM-YFP was concentrated. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins regulate wingless signaling, and they also bind a number of cytoskeletal proteins, including microtubules and the plus-end microtubule binding protein EB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The localization of two cytoskeleton-interacting proteins to the proximal axon in flies indicates that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>axon is divided into domains with specialized cytoskeletal properties. It will be interesting to determine whether this region is functionally similar to the vertebrate axon initial segment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many aspects of invertebrate neuronal organization have not been previously examined, and so some have considered it to be different than that of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while others have concluded it is similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To determine how <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons are organized, we have used several approaches, including analysis of a set of tagged markers expressed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>central neurons.</p><p>We chose analysis of tagged markers as our primary assay because we could express them in single types of neurons and analyze their distribution unambiguously. Interpretation of antibody staining in complex central synaptic regions can be very difficult. For example, in the mushroom body calyx resolving pre- and postsynaptic localization often requires immuno-electron microscopy. We also used analysis of tagged endogenous proteins and live imaging to obtain additional information about localization of protein synthesis and microtubule organization. We found fly neurons exhibit the major kinds of compartmentalization present in mammalian neurons. <italic>Drosophila </italic>should, therefore, be an extremely powerful system in which to study neuronal subcellular organization.</p><sec><title>Microtubule cytoskeleton</title><p>A fundamental aspect of mammalian neuronal polarity is distinct axonal and dendritic microtubule organization. Axon and dendrite microtubules differ in two major ways: microtubule binding proteins and filament orientation. We found evidence for both types of difference in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We confirmed that two exogenous microtubule binding proteins, nod-YFP and tau-GFP, have different preferences for axons and dendrites. In addition, we found two endogenous <italic>Drosophila </italic>microtubule binding proteins, Jupiter and Map205, that are good candidates for axon-specific microtubule binding proteins. We also examined microtubule orientation in living <italic>Drosophila </italic>axons and dendrites using plus-end microtubule binding protein dynamics.</p><p>In mammalian cultured neurons and frog mitral cells, electron microscope analysis of hook labeled microtubules was initially used to analyze microtubule orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Subsequently, analysis of a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, EB3-GFP, was used to determine microtubule orientation in cultured Purkinje and hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both methods yielded similar results: in axons most plus ends were oriented away from the cell body; while in proximal dendrites microtubules had mixed orientation with slightly more plus ends distal to the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The concurrence of EB3-GFP dynamics and hook labeling may mean that most microtubules in axons and dendrites are dynamic, as EB3-GFP labels only growing plus ends, while all microtubules should be accessible to hook formation. It also means that we have every reason to believe that EB1-GFP dynamics in <italic>Drosophila </italic>axons and dendrites is a valid representation of microtubule orientation.</p><p>We found that microtubules in axons were arranged with their plus ends distal to the cell body, as in vertebrates. In the long, branched dendrites of dendritic arborization sensory neurons, most microtubules were arranged with their minus ends distal to the cell body. In occasional dendrites, mixed orientation microtubules were observed. This difference in microtubule orientation between axons and dendrites is consistent with the selective localization of nod motor domain fusion proteins to dendrites. The predominance of minus-end out microtubules in dendrites is surprising. Current models of traffic into dendrites rely on plus-end directed motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but we predict that minus-end directed motors will be important for anterograde traffic in, at least, <italic>Drosophila </italic>dendritic arborization dendrites. It will be interesting to determine whether all <italic>Drosophila </italic>dendrites share this microtubule organization, or if it is specific to the peripheral nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein synthesis</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons we found protein synthesis machinery, including ribosomes, was highly concentrated in the neuron cell body. Others have reported the presence of RNA granules in <italic>Drosophila </italic>dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], so it is likely that some specific RNAs are transported into dendrites as in mammals. Concentration of the bulk of ribosomes to the neuron cell body has also been observed in <italic>C. elegans </italic>neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In mammalian neurons, protein synthesis machinery is also concentrated in the cell body, but can extend into the proximal dendrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, in all mature neurons so far examined, very little protein synthesis machinery is present in axons or distal dendrites. The fluorescence images of L10-YFP in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> show that, although this form of neuronal compartmentalization has been studied very little, it is extremely striking. The strong concentration difference of ribosomes between the cell body and neuropil indicates that there may be an active mechanism that restricts the bulk of protein synthesis machinery to the cell body.</p><p>One of the endogenous proteins that we found highly concentrated in the cell body was Pdi. Pdi is localized to the lumen of the ER. In all neurons previously examined, including Purkinje cells and <italic>C. elegans </italic>neurons, the ER extends from the cell body throughout axons and dendrites, and is believed to be continuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We therefore also predict that a mechanism exists to concentrate proteins inside the ER to the neuron cell body.</p></sec><sec><title>Synaptic components</title><p>In mammalian motor and hippocampal neurons, presynaptic components are restricted to axons and postsynaptic components to dendrites, but in some mammalian interneurons, dendrites can contain synaptic vesicles and be presynaptic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic motor neurons are similar to mammalian motor neurons: a neurotransmitter receptor is exclusively localized to dendrites, and a synaptic vesicle marker is restricted to axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found that a postsynaptic marker was exclusively targeted to dendrites in mushroom body neurons, while a synaptic vesicle marker was present in dendrites and axons. Both mammals and flies, therefore, have different classes of neurons with distinct synaptic arrangements. Little is known about how non-classic synapses, including dendro-dendritic, are assembled. <italic>Drosophila </italic>has already proven useful for studying 'traditional' synapses, like the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and could be useful for understanding other synaptic arrangements. One interesting question is: how are synaptic vesicles targeted to dendrites in mushroom bodies, but excluded from dendrites of motor neurons?</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma membrane proteins</title><p>In mammalian neurons, different non-synaptic plasma membrane proteins are localized to axons and dendrites. Examples include cell adhesion proteins and ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, non-synaptic plasma membrane proteins completely specific to axons or dendrites have not yet been identified. In part, this is because these experiments are easier to interpret using cultured neurons in which the plasma membranes are not contacting other cells, and in flies a fully polarized neuronal culture system has not been described. We localized one exogenous transmembrane adhesion protein, NgCAM-YFP, to the primary neurite and proximal axon, but did not identify more broadly localized axonal or dendritic proteins. These are, however, likely to exist in flies. One good candidate is the sodium channel pickpocket, which is present in a subset of dendritic arborization neuron dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Do <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons have an initial segment?</title><p>The mammalian axon initial segment is a distinctive region of the axon that is important in generation of action potentials and protein sorting within the neuron. At the ultrastructural level, it can be recognized by an electron-dense coating under the plasma membrane and bundled microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. At the molecular level, the initial segment contains a specialized spectrin and ankyrin G submembrane skeleton that is important for localizing channels and other plasma membrane proteins. This same network forms the basis of a diffusion barrier that isolates the plasma membrane in the axon from that in the soma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The microtubule cytoskeleton in the initial segment has also been suggested to be important for selective sorting to axons and dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>While concentration of cytoskeletal (see tau-GFP in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] to unbranched or fasciculated subregions of axons has been observed in flies, it has not been clear whether flies have an initial segment similar to that in mammals. Many <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons also generate action potentials, but the precise region in which they are initiated has not been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>do possess a neuronal ankyrin that has axonal and somatic isoforms, but the axonal isoform has not been noted to be restricted to a particular domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Nor have specific membrane proteins been previously identified in the proximal axon, and the motif in ion channels that binds to ankyrin in the vertebrate axon initial segment is absent in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons may have a domain similar to the mammalian axon initial segment. NgCAM-YFP localized to the proximal neurite and axon in mushroom body and projection neurons. In mammalian neurons, NgCAM seems to have two mechanisms of localization: an ankyrin-independent one that localizes it along the length of the axon, and an ankyrin-dependent one that anchors it at the initial segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One possible explanation for the localization we see in flies is that the ankyrin-independent targeting signal is not recognized, but NgCAM can be concentrated in the proximal axon by binding to a special submembrane skeleton analogous to the ankyrin G domain in the initial segment. We also observed localization of Apc2-GFP to the proximal axon. APC family members bind cytoskeletal proteins, including EB1. Overexpressed EB1-YFP localizes to the initial segment in hippocampal neurons, and may recognize a local microtubule specialization important for directional transport within neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The localization of overexpressed Apc2-GFP we observe may reflect a similar microtubule organization in fly proximal axons. We therefore suggest that flies may have actin and microtubule cytoskeletal specializations in the proximal neurite and axon that are similar to those in the mammalian axon initial segment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found evidence for many types of regional neuronal specialization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and conclude that <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammalian neurons are compartmentalized in the same ways. We have also generated a number of useful tools for following protein targeting in fly neurons, which, in conjunction with the sophisticated genetic techniques that can be used to manipulate <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mean that this should be a powerful system for studying neuronal polarity. Questions that could be addressed include: how is protein synthesis machinery concentrated in the cell body? How are axon domains established? What regulates the polarity of microtubules in axons and dendrites?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Bloomington Stock Center provided the following stocks: OK107-Gal4, 201Y-Gal4, elav-Gal4, and UAS:Apc2-GFP.
