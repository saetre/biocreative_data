Interestingly, a mitochondrial Omp85 homolog, called Omp85, Tob55, or Sam50, has been identified and shown to be essential for the assembly of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins into the OM of these organelles, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of OMP assembly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Also the bacterial outer membrane contains additional, distantly related Omp85 homologs, generically designated TpsB, which have a different function, i.e., they are the key components in the Two-Partner Secretion (TPS) pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Homologous genes, closely related to <italic>ytfM,</italic> are widely disseminated among Gram-negatives, but their function has not yet been experimentally addressed.</p><p>After the identification of its components, the structure and functional mechanism of the OMP assembly machinery await further analysis. We have presented a topology model for Omp85, consisting of a periplasmic N-terminal domain and a C-terminal OM-embedded &#x003b2;-barrel domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

Another key question is how the machinery selects its substrates. Evidence for a direct interaction between the neisserial Omp85 complex and its substrates was obtained in Far-Western blot analysis, which demonstrated binding of non-native PorA, one of the major porins of <italic>N. meningitidis,</italic> to the oligomeric Omp85 complex immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We hypothesized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; that the N-terminal periplasmic domain of Omp85 might recognize the signature sequence that was previously detected at the C-termini of the vast majority of bacterial OMPs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. This signature sequence consists of a Phe (or Trp) at the C-terminal position, and hydrophobic residues at positions 3 (preferentially Tyr), 5, 7, and 9 from the C-terminus. Deletion or substitution of the C-terminal Phe drastically affected the assembly efficiency of the OM porin PhoE in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the present work, we have purified Omp85 from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> to test the various hypotheses outlined above. We demonstrate that Omp85 forms oligomers and exhibits pore activity upon reconstitution in lipid bilayers. We also present evidence that the C-terminal OMP signature sequence is the sorting signal recognized by Omp85 and that the previously observed conditional lethality of the expression of neisserial OMPs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; is due to divergence of this signature sequence between the two organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 Can Be Refolded from Inclusion Bodies</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 was overproduced without its signal sequence resulting in the formation of cytoplasmic Omp85 aggregates (inclusion bodies). After solubilization of the inclusion bodies in 8 M urea, the protein was refolded in vitro by dilution in a buffer containing the detergent 3-dimethyldodecylammoniopropane-sulfonate (SB12). Folding was monitored by semi-native SDS-PAGE making use of the heat-modifiable character of bacterial OMPs, i.e., folded monomers generically migrate faster in SDS-PAGE gels than the heat-denatured proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, SDS-PAGE analysis of cell envelopes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> overexpressing wild-type Omp85 from a low copy number vector showed that the protein migrated at approximately its predicted molecular weight (90 KDa) after denaturation of the sample, but considerably faster when the sample was not boiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, left panel). Of note, no oligomeric forms with a lower electrophoretic mobility were detected under these conditions, neither on the gel nor on Western blots (unpublished data). Since the in vitro folded Omp85 displayed similar heat modifiability as Omp85 in cell envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), we concluded that the refolded protein had acquired its native conformation. Moreover, the circular dichroism spectrum of the purified refolded protein revealed a high content of &#x003b2;-strand, representative of OMP secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We have proposed a topology model for Omp85, consisting of a periplasmic N-terminal domain and a C-terminal OM-embedded &#x003b2;-barrel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. To probe this two-domain model and to further assess the correct folding of the protein, cell envelopes and in vitro folded Omp85 were treated with trypsin. Both preparations yielded a tryptic fragment of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), substantiating the correct conformation of the refolded protein. Generically, the &#x003b2;-barrel domains of OMPs are highly resistant to proteases. Indeed, the major tryptic fragment from the refolded protein represents an intact &#x003b2;-barrel as indicated by its N-terminal sequence, which was found to be NTGSF, a sequence located just upstream of the proposed &#x003b2;-barrel domain, and by its &#x003b2;-strand composition, as confirmed by circular dichroism measurements (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Omp85 Forms Oligomeric Structures</title><p>Some members of the Omp85 superfamily were reported to form oligomers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The capacity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 to form oligomers was assessed by size-exclusion chromatography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, Omp85 eluted with a retention time consistent with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 473 KDa, indicating that Omp85 indeed forms oligomers, probably tetramers. However, the exact oligomeric configuration is difficult to assess in this assay, since the contribution of the detergent micelle to the apparent molecular mass of the complex is not exactly known. Blue Native PAGE confirmed the formation of Omp85 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The four distinct bands detected likely represent mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramers, but the uncertainty of the contribution of the Coomassie blue dye to the electrophoretic mobility precludes a definitive determination. The detection of multiple bands in the Blue Native PAGE, in contrast to the symmetrical peak in the gel filtration assay, can be explained by assuming that the oligomer is in equilibrium with smaller oligomers and monomers, in which case binding of Coomassie to the subunit interface is expected to shift the equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Omp85 Forms Channels</title><p>We have suggested that Omp85 may form pores, used for the insertion of OMPs. Pore formation by Omp85 was determined in liposome-swelling assays and planar lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In liposome-swelling assays, pore-forming activity of Omp85 was clearly detected by the swelling of the proteoliposomes suspended in an iso-osmotic arabinose solution. The permeability of liposomes toward arabinose was linearly proportional to the amount of Omp85 added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). No swelling was noticed in liposomes without proteins (unpublished data). The specific activity of Omp85-containing proteoliposomes toward arabinose was approximately 0.019 &#x00394;OD<sub>500</sub> (decrease in optical density) per min/&#x003bc;g protein, which is much less than reported for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> porins OmpF or OmpC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, but equivalent to that of HMW1B protein, an Omp85-like protein belonging to TpsB family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The size of the Omp85 channel was estimated by plotting the diffusion rates of solutes of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The molecular weight of a solute that results in 10&#x00025; of the swelling activity of arabinose can be used to calculate the diameter of the channels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The calculated channel size of the Omp85 pores was again rather similar to that of HMW1B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, i.e., approximately 2.5 nm in diameter. This large channel size on the one hand, but the low specific activity of the proteoliposomes on the other hand suggest that only a fraction of the Omp85 protein population might be in an open conformation.</p><p>To study the pore characteristics of Omp85 in further detail, planar lipid bilayer experiments were performed. Conductance measurements revealed the opening and closing of pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The majority of the conductance steps was of approximately 0.5 nS in 1 M KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">3</xref>E), but subconductance states of 0.12 nS were seen when the majority of the channels was in a non-active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). This observation suggests that the different amplitude levels correspond to a tetramer of Omp85, in which every subunit forms a pore that can open and close independently. Because of the low conductivity observed, the size of the channel was not estimated by this technique.</p><p>Voltage-ramp recordings of multiple channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>G) revealed a linear current/voltage relationship, showing that the conductance of the pores was constant over the entire voltage range tested and identical at positive and negative potentials.</p><p>The probability of the Omp85 channels to be open at different membrane potentials was determined after allowing the channels to adapt to various membrane potentials during 2 min. The currents subsequently measured showed an exponential relation to the magnitude of the applied membrane potential, indicating that these channels are voltage activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g003">Figure 3</xref>F).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>OMPs Can Modulate Omp85 Channel Properties</title><p>We have previously shown in Far-Western blotting experiments that Omp85 from <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> interacts with the non-native <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> porin PorA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We investigated whether interaction with substrates affects the channel activity of Omp85 reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Denatured <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> PhoE porin was added to both the <italic>cis</italic> and the <italic>trans</italic> compartment, since Omp85 probably assembles in the bilayers in random orientation. The addition of pM concentrations of PhoE induced a dose-dependent opening of the Omp85 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) indicating that PhoE protein bound to the reconstituted Omp85 and affected its channel characteristics. Similarly, the addition of another OMP from <italic>E. coli,</italic> the maltoporin LamB, caused the Omp85 channels to open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), whereas two periplasmic proteins, the chaperone Skp and the maltose-binding protein (MBP), did not affect the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">4</xref>D). The addition of 80 pM of denatured PhoE or denatured LamB increased the conductivity per 0.12-nS Omp85 channel by approximately 0.067 and approximately 0.069 nS, respectively, corresponding to an increase of approximately 56&#x00025;&#x02013;58&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>G).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Identification of the Recognition Signal for Omp85 in Its Substrate Proteins</title><p>The vast majority of bacterial OMPs contain a C-terminal signature sequence, of which a Phe (or Trp) at the ultimate C-terminal position is the most prominent feature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We reasoned that this signature sequence might represent a sorting signal that is recognized by Omp85. To test this possibility, we investigated whether a mutant PhoE protein that lacks the C-terminal Phe residue (PhoE&#x00394;F330) affects the Omp85-channel properties. Remarkably, in contrast to wild-type PhoE, the addition of denatured PhoE&#x00394;F330 to the bilayers did not open the channels, but, at higher concentrations, even completely blocked the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Apparently, the mutant protein affects the Omp85 channels differently. Blockage of the Omp85 channels by the mutant PhoE appeared irreversible, since the subsequent addition of wild-type PhoE did not activate the channels (unpublished data).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the C-terminal OMP signature is sufficient for recognition by Omp85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE was added to planar lipid bilayers containing Omp85 channels. At &#x003bc;M concentrations, the peptide induced a dose-dependent opening of the Omp85 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Essentially, the addition of 96 &#x003bc;M of the peptide increased the conductivity per 0.12-nS Omp85 channel by on average approximately 0.6 nS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). A similar 11-residues peptide lacking the C-terminal Phe (CterPhoE&#x00394;F) did not affect the Omp85 channel properties at the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>E) and even higher concentrations (tested up to 136 &#x003bc;M) (unpublished data), showing that, in the peptide also, the C-terminal Phe is important for the proper interaction with Omp85. As further controls, we used a peptide corresponding to ten amino acid residues from the first extracellular loop of PhoE and a peptide containing the last 12 amino acids of PhoE, but in a randomized order. Neither peptide affected the conductivity of the Omp85 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">5</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The Omp85&#x02013;Substrate Interactions Are Species Specific</title><p>It has been reported repeatedly that the expression of neisserial OMPs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> causes lethality problems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. We hypothesized that these problems may be due to no or inadequate recognition of the neisserial OMPs by <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85. To test this possibility, we investigated whether the porin PorA from <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> affected the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 channels in the planar lipid bilayers. Indeed, neither PorA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) nor its C-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) was able to activate the Omp85 channels, whereas a mutant form of PorA lacking the C-terminal Phe (PorA&#x00394;F) did not block them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g004">Figure 4</xref>G).</p><p>The failure of PorA or its C-terminal peptide to affect <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 channels in the planar lipid bilayer assay was surprising, since PorA does contain Phe at the ultimate position. Also in other respects, the C-terminal end of PorA (AASVGLRHKF) does comply to the consensus of the C-terminal OMP signature sequence, with hydrophobic residues being present at positions 5 (Leu), 7 (Val), and 9 (Ala) from the C-terminus. Only at position 3 from the C-terminus, PorA contains His, rather than Tyr or a hydrophobic residue as present in the consensus sequence. To determine whether this is a general feature of neisserial OMPs, the C-terminal sequences of representative OMPs were compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040377-t001">Table 1</xref>). No particular characteristics of the amino acid at position 3 from the C-termini were evident. However, it was remarkable that the vast majority of neisserial OMPs contain a positively charged residue (Arg or Lys) at the penultimate position. With a few exceptions (e.g., the siderophore receptor FhuA), this is not the case in enterobacterial OMPs. Therefore, the residue in the penultimate position could be involved in the species specificity of Omp85 recognition.</p><p>To determine whether the species specificity of Omp85 recognition is indeed related to the nature of the amino acid residue at the penultimate position, a synthetic peptide (CterPhoEKF) corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE but with Lys instead of Gln at the penultimate position was added to planar lipid bilayers containing Omp85 channels. In contrast to the corresponding wild-type peptide, this peptide did not activate the Omp85 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Additionally, we tested the role of the penultimate amino acid in vivo. The Lys present in this position in PorA was substituted by Gln, which is found in this position in PhoE and many other <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OMPs. The wild-type and the mutant <italic>porA</italic> allele, designated <italic>porA-Q,</italic> were cloned behind an IPTG-inducible promoter and introduced into <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. In contrast to the wild-type PorA, the PorA-Q mutant protein was detected in the cell envelope protein patterns after IPTG induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). After overloading of the gels, however, also the wild-type PorA could be detected on Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 6). When the samples were left unboiled before electrophoresis, a considerable proportion of PorA-Q produced in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> migrated in the gel as trimers, indicating that the protein was correctly assembled in the heterologous host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 7). These trimers had a higher electrophoretic mobility than the PorA trimers produced in the authentic host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 1), since in <italic>Neisseria</italic> they are firmly associated to the RmpM protein, which stabilizes them &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. When membranes from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> expressing the wild-type PorA were analyzed, no PorA trimers were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 5; note that the faint band in lane 5, migrating slightly slower than the PorA-Q trimers in lane 7, is unspecific since it is also visible in lane 3 containing control cells not expressing any PorA). The only PorA-specific signal in the unboiled sample was found at the position of the stacking gel, indicative of PorA aggregates. The total signal in the native sample was lower than in the denatured sample (lane 6), presumably because the aggregates do not blot very efficiently.</p><p>Correct assembly of PorA into the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OM was also assessed by investigating its cell surface exposure in immunofluorescence microscopy with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the cell surface&#x02013;exposed loop 4 of PorA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040377-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Whereas the cells expressing wild-type PorA were barely labeled, the majority of the cells expressing the mutant protein PorA-Q were densely labeled over the entire cell surface. Collectively, these data demonstrate that wild-type PorA expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> is poorly assembled and prone to aggregation and, presumably, degradation, and that the amount and assembly of PorA in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> can be vastly increased by adjusting the penultimate amino acid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Omp85 is an essential component required for the assembly of OMPs. It is present in all Gram-negative bacteria and even in eukaryotic cell organelles of endosymbiont origin, where it performs a similar function. So far, knowledge of the structure and functional mechanism of the protein is extremely scarce. We have shown previously that Omp85 of <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> is part of a high molecular weight complex that binds non-native porins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Since <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 is part of a complex containing several additional components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, it was not clear which subunit interacts with the substrate OMPs. To facilitate structural and mechanistic studies, we have produced Omp85 from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> in inclusion bodies and refolded it in vitro into its native conformation. This procedure yields large quantities of protein, which may be suitable for structural studies by X-ray crystallography, as was successfully demonstrated previously for several other OMPs (e.g., see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;). The refolded Omp85 formed oligomers, possibly tetramers, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography and Blue Native PAGE.</p><p>Omp85 showed a clear channel activity when incorporated in liposomes or planar lipid bilayers. The liposome swelling assay suggested the presence of fairly large channels with a diameter of approximately 2.5 nm, comparable to the channels formed by the TpsB protein HMW1B of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae,</italic> a distantly related member of the Omp85 superfamily &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. This diameter seems large enough to tolerate insertion of denatured or intermediate folded OMPs. The specific activity of the Omp85 channels for solute diffusion, however, appeared very low, suggesting that only a fraction of the protein population might be in an open conformation. Consistently, planar lipid bilayers experiments revealed an increased frequency of channel openings upon application of a transmembrane potential. Similar voltage activation has been reported for several other OM channel proteins, including, for example, the secretin PulD, which is involved in type II protein secretion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The physiological significance is unclear; it probably does not reflect the energy status of the cell, since the OM is not energized by the presence of a respiratory chain generating a proton-motive force. Additionally, the Donnan potentials across the OM are generally rather low &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, the voltage gating observed in vitro might be unrelated to the in vivo functioning of the protein.</p><p>The majority of the channel openings and closings observed in the planar lipid bilayers corresponded to channels with a conductance of approximately 0.5 nS. These pores are similar in size to the 410-pS pores formed by SynToc75, a cyanobacterial homolog of the chloroplast protein-import component Toc75 and a distant member of the Omp85 superfamily &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. It is conceivable that SynToc75 is the functional cyanobacterial homolog of Omp85. In the case of the Omp85 channels, subconductance states of approximately 0.12 nS were observed, suggesting that the 0.5 nS channels correspond to tetrameric Omp85 complexes, with each subunit forming an independent channel. Similarly, subconductance states of SynToc75 were reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; and HMW1B was reported to form tetramers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although the pore properties of Omp85 in vivo might be different from those measured in the planar lipid bilayers, e.g., because of the different lipid composition of the OM, the in vitro system provided a convenient assay to study the interaction of Omp85 with its substrate proteins. We established that Omp85 directly and specifically interacts with denatured OMPs causing opening of the channels, whereas periplasmic proteins had no effect on Omp85 pore activity. We considered the possibility that Omp85 recognizes its substrates by virtue of their C-terminal OMP signature sequence, which is found in the vast majority of bacterial OMPs. In vivo, it has been shown that the deletion or substitution of the C-terminal Phe, which is the most prominent feature of this signature sequence, in porin PhoE drastically affected the assembly of the protein into the membrane and was, at high expression levels, lethal to the cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, we found that the C-terminal Phe residue plays an important role in the recognition by Omp85, since a mutant PhoE lacking this residue, PhoE&#x00394;F330, did not open, but, at high concentrations, even completely blocked the Omp85 channel. Moreover, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE also caused Omp85-channel opening, like the complete PhoE protein did. Hence, we conclude that the signature sequence is important for the appropriate interaction of nascent OMPs with the assembly machinery. Interestingly, the same OMP signature is recognized by the IM-bound protease DegS, thereby initiating a proteolytic cascade, eventually resulting in a periplasmic stress response when unfolded OMPs accumulate in the periplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also interesting to note that another protease that participates in this signaling cascade, RseP (formerly designated YaeL), is encoded by a gene, which is located in most Gram-negative bacterial genomes directly upstream of the <italic>omp85</italic> gene.</p><p>Interestingly, the porin PorA from <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> did not stimulate the channel activity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Omp85 even though the protein has the C-terminal signature sequence. Similarly, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of PorA did not affect the Omp85 channels, suggesting divergence of the OMP signatures between the two species. Consistently, the expression of neisserial OMPs, like that of the mutant PhoE lacking the C-terminal Phe, has repeatedly been reported to be lethal in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparison of the C-terminal sequences of neisserial and <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OMPs revealed a strong preference for a positively charged residue (Arg or Lys) at position 2 from the C-terminus in the neisserial OMPs, which could be responsible for the species specificity observed. Indeed, a synthetic C-terminal PhoE peptide with a Gln to Lys substitution at this position failed to activate the Omp85 channels in vitro, whereas a Lys to Gln substitution at this position in the meningococcal PorA drastically improved the assembly of the protein into the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OM in vivo. Thus, even though the process of OMP assembly by an Omp85-related machinery is evolutionary conserved, species-specific adaptations appear to have occurred.</p><p>It should be noticed that the C-terminal Phe is not absolutely essential for recognition by Omp85. Whereas wild-type PhoE activated Omp85 channel activity, the PhoE mutant lacking the C-terminal Phe blocked the Omp85 pores, showing that it interacts with Omp85, albeit differently and less efficiently, since much higher concentrations of the mutant protein were required to affect Omp85 pore activity. Furthermore, whereas high-level expression of this mutant protein in vivo is lethal and leads to its periplasmic aggregation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, low-level expression is tolerated and leads to the efficient assembly of the mutant protein into the OM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, studies reporting the successful assembly of neisserial OMPs in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; may be explained by lower expression levels. These observations indicate that there are alternative, less-efficient recognition sites in the mutant PhoE protein and the neisserial OMPs that mediate binding to Omp85. An alternative explanation is that the C-terminal recognition site is not completely inactivated by the deletion of the phenylalanine or the presence of a positive charge at the penultimate position. However, the latter explanation seems less likely, since, in contrast to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 amino acid residues of PhoE, similar peptides lacking the C-terminal Phe or containing a positively charged residue at the penultimate position did not affect Omp85 channel properties at all. Kinetic partitioning between OM incorporation and aggregation of periplasmic OMP intermediates may explain the observation that OMPs with a defective C-terminal recognition sequence are assembled into the OM at low expression levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of an appropriate recognition sequence at the C-terminus will assure efficient assembly into the OM even at high expression levels. In the absence of such a recognition sequence, secondary recognition sites may still mediate binding to Omp85, but the kinetics of incorporation into the OM will be reduced and the aggregation pathway will dominate. However, at lower expression levels, the kinetics of aggregation will be reduced, allowing the less-efficient OM incorporation pathway to become dominant again.</p><p>Which sequences in OMPs may function as secondary recognition sites for Omp85 interaction? The last ten amino acid residues of PhoE form an amphipathic &#x003b2;-strand. In the absence of the C-terminal Phe, Omp85 may recognize, though less efficiently, internal &#x003b2;-strands, many of which also end with an aromatic residue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. In some classes of OMPs, the C-terminal OMP signature could not be discerned &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Possibly, in these cases also, Omp85 recognizes an internal &#x003b2;-strand. Actually, one of the major OMPs of <italic>E. coli,</italic> OmpA, consists of two domains, an N-terminal &#x003b2;-barrel domain embedded in the OM and a C-terminal periplasmic domain. The OMP signature sequence was found in this case at the end of the &#x003b2;-barrel domain, i.e., internal in the primary structure of the protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and deletion analysis showed that this sequence is required for binding of OmpA to the OM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. These data indicate that Omp85 may indeed recognize internal binding sites in its substrate proteins. Similarly, Omp85 may recognize internal sites in other OMPs lacking the C-terminal signature sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, such as secretins, which are involved in type II and type III protein secretion and type IV pilus biogenesis and filamentous phage assembly; ushers, which are involved in type I pilus biogenesis; TolC and its homologs, which are involved in type I protein secretion and drugs extrusion; and Imp, which is required for the transport of lipopolysaccharide to the bacterial cell surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, binding of such OMPs to Omp85 may be indirect and require accessory factors, such as the lipoproteins recently identified in the Omp85 complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, or specific chaperones, such as the pilotins in the case of the secretins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The structure of Omp85 was predicted to consist of a 12-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel embedded in the OM with a long N-terminal periplasmic extension &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose that the periplasmic domain of Omp85 acts as a gatekeeper and recognizes nascent OMPs in the periplasm primarily via their C-terminal signature sequence. This periplasmic Omp85 domain contains several so-called POTRA (polypeptide-transport-associated) domains, which have been proposed to possess chaperone-like properties &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Binding of an OMP triggers a conformational change in the C-terminal domain, which is reflected in the activation of channel activity in vitro. This conformational change allows for the insertion of the OMP via the transmembrane part of Omp85, presumably in between the subunits of the Omp85 complex, which will dissociate to release the inserted OMP into the membrane, where trimerization, in the case of porins, may take place. Whereas no chaperone is required for targeting of nascent OMPs to Omp85, it seems that the insertion or folding step requires (an) additional factor(s), since no insertion of PhoE or LamB pores was monitored in planar lipid bilayers experiments. The recently identified lipoproteins that are part of the Omp85 multi-subunit complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; may play a role in these steps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> K-12 strains BL21(DE3) and BL21 Star (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, United States), AM1095 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040377-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, Top10F&#x02032; (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States), and DH5&#x003b1; were grown at 37 &#x000b0;C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.

A 200-&#x003bc;l sample of the resulting Omp85 solution was passed through a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) at a fixed flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The void volume of the column was calculated from the elution of Blue dextran 2000 (Amersham Bioscience, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Elution of the standard proteins and Omp85 through the column was monitored by UV light absorption at 280 nm (Uvicord; Amersham Bioscience). Fractions of 1 ml were collected (RediFrac collector; Amersham Bioscience), and Omp85 was detected by Western blotting with an antiserum directed to Omp85.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Cell envelope isolation.</title><p>After 3 h of growth in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM IPTG, <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing the protease-inhibitor cocktail &#x0201c;Complete&#x0201d; (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
