Since human speech and learned vocalizations in songbirds bear behavioral and neural parallels, songbirds provide a genuine model for investigating the basic principles of speech and its pathologies. In zebra finch Area X, a basal ganglia structure necessary for song learning, <italic>FoxP2</italic> expression increases during the time when song learning occurs. Here, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce FoxP2 levels in Area X during song development.

Inaccurate vocal imitation was already evident early during song ontogeny and persisted into adulthood.

Here, we reduced FoxP2 levels in Area X before zebra finches started to learn their song, using virus-mediated RNA interference for the first time in songbird brains. Birds with experimentally lowered levels of FoxP2 imitated their tutor's song imprecisely and sang more variably than controls. FoxP2 thus appears to be critical for proper song development.

In the sensory phase that commences around 25 d after hatching (post-hatch day &#x0005b;PHD&#x0005d;), young males memorize the song of an adult male tutor. Concomitantly, they start vocalizing the so called &#x0201c;subsong,&#x0201d; consisting of quietly uttered, poorly articulated, and nonstereotypically sequenced syllables &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Following intensive vocal practice and improvement toward matching the tutor song during the period of &#x0201c;plastic song,&#x0201d; they eventually imitate the song of their tutor with remarkable fidelity around PHD90. The structural and temporal characteristics of adult &#x0201c;crystallized&#x0201d; song remain essentially stable throughout adult life.

Of note, RNAi-mediated knockdown approximates FOXP2 levels in DVD patients, since haploinsufficiency, a 50&#x00025; reduction of functional FOXP2 protein, is apparently the common feature of all reported human <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To demonstrate that RNAi-mediated gene knockdown can persist in vivo throughout the entire song-learning phase, we used a virus expressing shRNA against the viral reporter <italic>GFP</italic> (shGFP) in conjunction with the virus expressing a shRNA lacking a target gene (shControl).

More than 3 mo later, on PHD130, the GFP signal in the shGFP-injected hemisphere was still 70.5&#x00025; &#x000b1; 5.8&#x00025; less intense than in the shControl-injected hemisphere (mean &#x000b1; SEM; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g001">Figure 1</xref>J).</p><p>To rule out potential side effects of <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown on cellular survival in Area X, we investigated apoptosis in Area X 6 d after surgery with terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The TUNEL method detects genomic DNA double-strand breaks characteristic of apoptotic cells. Of 1,149 GFP-positive cells counted in six hemispheres from three animals, only five were TUNEL-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). ShControl-injected and uninjected animals had similar low levels of apoptotic cells (unpublished data). Thus, <italic>FoxP2</italic> is not a gene essential for short-term survival of postmitotic neurons. Since the TUNEL method does not capture any long-term changes in neuronal viability that might follow after reduction of FoxP2, we used the neuronal marker Hu to determine neuronal densities in Area X 30 d after injecting either shFoxP2-f/-h or shControl virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Neuronal densities in the infected region in Area X did not differ in knockdown and shControl-injected birds (two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.39; shControl, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4 hemispheres; shFoxP2-f/-h, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 hemispheres). Density of neurons were also comparable inside and outside of the virus-infected region of Area X for all viruses (two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.6 for both shFoxP2-f/-h and shControl). In sum, these data demonstrate that virus-mediated RNAi can induce specific, long-lasting knockdown of gene expression in zebra finch Area X without causing cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Song Imitation of <italic>FoxP2</italic> Knockdown Zebra Finches</title><p>Adult zebra finch song consists of different sound elements, here called syllables, that are separated by silent intervals. Syllables are rendered in a stereotyped sequential order, constituting a motif. During a song bout, a variable number of motifs are sung in short succession.

The distinction between imitated and non-imitated sounds in SAP is based on <italic>p</italic>-value estimates derived from the comparison of 250,000 sound interval pairs, obtained from 25 random pairs of zebra finch songs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; for further details).

In addition, we also manually counted the number of user-defined syllables copied from the tutors, confirming that knockdown animals imitated fewer syllables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>Even though knockdown animals copied tutor syllables, their imitation appeared to be less precise than in control animals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g003">Figure 3</xref>A illustrates the inaccurate syllable imitation (syllables A and B) in a knockdown pupil that learned from the same tutor as the shControl-injected pupil shown. To quantify how well the syllables of a motif were imitated on average, we obtained motif accuracy scores in SAP from pairwise motif comparisons between pupil and tutor. The motif accuracy score measures the extent to which the pupil's sounds are closer to the tutor than expected by chance. The average accuracy per motif was significantly lower in knockdown pupils than in shControl-injected pupils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Of note, both shFoxP2 hairpins (shFoxP2-f and shFoxP2-h) affected motif similarity and motif accuracy scores to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), which is consistent with their comparable efficiency in reducing <italic>FoxP2</italic> mRNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Neither the similarity score nor the accuracy score correlated with the volume of Area X targeted in the pupil.

The frequency distribution of identity scores of all syllables from <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils was shifted towards lower scores compared to control pupils. This suggests that imprecise imitation was not skewed towards particular syllables or syllable types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), pointing to a generalized lack of copying precision.

Together, these data rule out that unspecific effects of RNAi induction, viral infection, or damage to Area X influenced our results. We further eliminated the possibility that specific song features of the tutor birds contributed to the behavioral differences. The outcome of song learning was affected by virus infection in approximately 20&#x00025; of the volume of Area X. This result is consistent with a previous study on virally injected rats, in which blocking neural plasticity in 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of lateral amygdala neurons was sufficient to impair memory formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that insufficient levels of FoxP2 in Area X spiny neurons lead to incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation, implicating <italic>FoxP2</italic> in postnatal brain function.</p><p>The incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation of tutor song in <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils raises the question whether knockdown pupils were unable to generate particular sounds. Given that syllables with similar spectral features could be learned or omitted by the same pupil (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, tutor syllables E and G are similar; pupil imitated E, but not G), this does not seem likely. Also, omitted syllables did not differ in their spectral feature composition from those that were learned by knockdown animals (unpublished data). Consistent with this, the distributions of mean syllable feature values and mean duration across the syllable repertoire were indistinguishable between knockdown and control pupils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). However, it is still possible that <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown affected the motor control of singing. The fact that <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils produced syllables more variably than controls at PHD90 would be consistent with this. Importantly though, this increased variability of syllable rendition in <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils was not yet evident at PHD65, when tutor imitation was already less proficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Thus, the increased syllable variability is apparently not causally related to the observed tutor imitation deficit. Unfortunately, song analysis alone cannot ultimately distinguish between impairments in motor production and motor learning. Any motor production deficit likely affects the auditory feedback signal, which in turn is bound to reduce the quality of tutor imitation. Knockdown of FoxP2 in adult zebra finches might help to clarify the contribution of FoxP2 to motor control.</p><p>Although knockdown animals were apparently not unable to produce particular syllable types, given the involvement of the basal ganglia in the acquisition and performance of motor sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, knockdown pupils might have been impaired in producing particular sequences of syllables, i.e., in moving from one syllable to the next. We found that knockdown pupils could in principle imitate adjacent tutor syllables in the same order (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, syllables A and B, and H and I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, syllables C and D). There was also no preferred position (i.e., beginning or end of song) for imitated and non-imitated syllables. Moreover, potential sequencing problems might occur at different syllable transitions within the motif or intermittently in different renditions of the motif. Both scenarios would result in low sequence stereotypy, which we did not find (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050321-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). The limited imitation success of <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils could also result from an imprecise neural representation of the tutor model. There is evidence for an involvement of Area X in sensory learning at PHD35 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, but the up-regulation of FoxP2 in Area X at PHD50 and PHD75 rather speaks for an involvement of FoxP2 in sensory-motor learning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Under the assumption of a model of reinforcement-based motor learning mediated through the basal ganglia, the animal initially generates variable motor output. Progressively, particular motor actions are reinforced &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In view of this model, <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils might have either experienced a limitation in generating enough sound variability or difficulties with reinforcing the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; motor patterns, a possibility that includes both difficulties in detecting similarity to the target or adjusting song appropriately. Since knockdown pupils sing as variable as control pupils early during song development and even more variable as adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050321-g005">5</xref>B), we favor the hypothesis that knockdown pupils were impaired in adjusting their motor output according to the memorized tutor model in the course of song learning. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotypic overlap of song deficits observed in <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown pupils and birds that were prevented from matching vocal output with memorized tutor song. For instance, perturbed auditory feedback provokes syllable repetitions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and deafening in juveniles brings about syllables with large acoustic variability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we cannot ultimately rule out the possibility that the impairment observed after <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown in juvenile birds was primary motor in nature, an interpretation involving a deficit with auditory-guided motor learning seems more consistent with the knockdown song phenotype.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which FoxP2 contributes to song development? In Area X, spiny neurons receive pallial glutamatergic input from Area X&#x02013;projecting neurons in HVC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. These neurons process auditory information and are active during singing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. FoxP2 expressing spiny neurons also receive nigral dopaminergic input &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. As has been suggested for motor learning in mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, midbrain dopaminergic activity could act as reinforcement signal during song learning. Therefore, the integration of pallial and dopaminergic signals provides a candidate mechanism for tuning the motor output to the tutor model during learning. The increase of FoxP2 expression in Area X of zebra finches during times of vocal plasticity could be functionally related to this process. FoxP2 might mediate adaptive structural and functional changes of the spiny neurons while the song is learned. During the seasonal phase of vocal plasticity in canaries, increased <italic>FoxP2</italic> expression in the fall months might similarly be involved in seasonal song modifications. Since FoxP2 is a transcription factor, it could act by positively or negatively regulating plasticity-related genes. If FoxP2 functions as a plasticity-promoting factor, knockdown pupils should have been less plastic during learning, resulting in impoverished imitation and abnormally invariant song. Syllable omissions of <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdowns are consistent with this notion, but more variable syllable production is clearly not. Alternatively, if FoxP2 restricts neuronal plasticity, knockdown pupils should sing more variable song. In fact, this is the case, but syllable omissions are not easily explained then. The identification of the downstream target genes of FoxP2 and the electrophysiological characterization of spiny neurons with reduced FoxP2 levels will shed light on the mechanisms by which FoxP2 affects the outcome of vocal learning.</p><p>The vocal behavior of <italic>FoxP2</italic> knockdown zebra finches offers a new interpretation of the speech abnormality in individuals with genetic aberrations of <italic>FOXP2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, possibly extending to apraxia of speech in general &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Perhaps the speech impairment results from a problem with motor learning rather than motor performance during speech learning, a hypothesis that is in line with recent theories on basal ganglia dysfunction in various developmental disorders &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050321-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results extend the similarities between learned birdsong and human speech to the molecular level, emphasizing the suitability of songbirds for investigating the basic principals of speech and its pathologies. It will be interesting to test, whether &#x0201c;dyspraxic song&#x0201d; is also perceived as different by other finches and interferes with communication, as DVD does in humans.

By PHD20, fathers and older male siblings were removed from family cages to prevent experimental zebra finches from instructive auditory experience prior to the onset of tutoring. At PHD23, animals were anaesthetized with xylazine/ketamine and stereotaxically injected with recombinant lentivirus. The stereotaxic coordinates for Area X injections were anterior/posterior 3.6 and 4.0, medial/lateral 1.4 and 1.6, and dorsal/ventral 3.8 and 4.0.

In asymmetric comparisons, the most similar sound elements of two motifs are compared, independent of their position within a motif. The smallest unit of comparison are 9.26-ms&#x02013;long sound intervals (FFT windows). Each interval is characterized by measures for five acoustic features: pitch, FM, amplitude modulation (AM), Wiener entropy, and PG. SAP calculates the Euclidean distance between all interval pairs from two songs, over the course of the motif, and determines a <italic>p</italic>-value for each interval pair. This <italic>p</italic>-value is based on <italic>p</italic>-value estimates derived from the cumulative distribution of Euclidean distances across 250,000 sound-interval pairs, obtained from 25 random pairs of zebra finch songs. Neighboring intervals that pass the <italic>p</italic>-threshold value (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.1 in this study) form larger similarity segments (70 ms).

Thus, similarity reflects how many sound intervals were above <italic>p</italic>-value, and accuracy indicates the average (1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic>-value). To comprehensively capture the acoustic similarity between syllables in a single measure we used the product of similarity and accuracy to obtain the syllable identity score.

Here, the pupils' vocalization is separated from nonvocalization background using two thresholds (Wiener entropy and amplitude). The thresholds were adjusted for each pupil individually to obtain an optimal segmentation. We validated the segmentation for each pupil by visual inspection of the segments and confirmed that segments correspond to syllables. Next, all segments from a given day (between 1,000 and 3,000 segments) were automatically compared to the tutor motif. That is, in each comparison, SAP identifies the best possible match to the tutor motif for each segment. Of all segments analyzed from PHD65, PHD80, and PHD90, 11.0&#x00025; &#x000b1; 0.9&#x00025; were less similar to the tutor model than two random zebra finch sounds are to each other, and thus did not receive any accuracy value in SAP. These sounds were found to represent cage noise, mostly. There were no differences between the amount of sounds excluded between knockdown and control pupils for any of the ages (two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.9 for PHD65; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.8 for PHD80; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.7 for PHD90).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su001"><label>Audio S1</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Tutor &#x00023;414</title><p>(199 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa001.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su002"><label>Audio S2</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Pupil of Tutor &#x00023;414</title><p>(123 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa002.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su003"><label>Audio S3</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Tutor &#x00023;38</title><p>(166 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa003.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su004"><label>Audio S4</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Pupil of Tutor &#x00023;38</title><p>(223 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa004.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su005"><label>Audio S5</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Tutor &#x00023;396</title><p>(245 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa005.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-su006"><label>Audio S6</label><caption><title>Example of Song Motif from Pupil of Tutor &#x00023;396</title><p>(370 KB WMA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050321.sa006.wav" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="wav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050321-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Timeline of Experiments</title><p>By PHD20, fathers and older male siblings were removed from family cages to prevent experimental zebra finches from instructive auditory experience prior to the onset of tutoring.
