Dependent on cell context and the involvement of specific downstream effectors, both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of HGF have been reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human medulloblastoma cells were treated with HGF for 24&#x02013;72 hours followed by death receptor ligand TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) for 24 hours. Cell death was measured by MTT and Annexin-V/PI flow cytometric analysis. Changes in expression levels of targets of interest were measured by Northern blot analysis, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot analysis as well as immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we show that HGF promotes medulloblastoma cell death induced by TRAIL. TRAIL alone triggered apoptosis in DAOY cells and death was enhanced by pre-treating the cells with HGF for 24&#x02013;72 h prior to the addition of TRAIL. HGF (100 ng/ml) enhanced TRAIL (10 ng/ml) induced cell death by 36% (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). No cell death was associated with HGF alone. Treating cells with PHA-665752, a specific c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly abrogated the enhancement of TRAIL-induced cell death by HGF, indicating that its death promoting effect requires activation of its canonical receptor tyrosine kinase. Cell death induced by TRAIL+HGF was predominately apoptotic involving both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways as evidenced by the increased activation of caspase-3, 8, 9. Promotion of apoptosis by HGF occurred via the increased expression of the death receptor DR5 and enhanced formation of death-inducing signal complexes (DISC).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these and previous findings indicate that HGF:c-Met pathway either promotes or inhibits medulloblastoma cell death via pathway and context specific mechanisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional cytokine that was originally described as a mesenchymal-derived factor that regulates cell growth, cell motility, morphogenesis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] through activation of its receptor, the transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the <italic>c-Met </italic>proto-oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HGF and c-Met are often co-expressed or over-expressed in a variety of human malignancies including glioblastoma and medullablastoma; and their expression level correlates with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The multifunctional effects of HGF:c-Met signaling in tumor cells are mediated by a network of signal transduction pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Paradoxically and dependent on cell context and the involvement of specific downstream effectors, both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of HGF have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is well documented that c-Met kinase-dependent signaling is able to counteract apoptosis induced by DNA-damage through the initiation of survival signals such as the PI3K-Akt, MAPK and NF&#x003ba;B pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, c-Met can bind to and sequester Fas via a kinase-independent mechanism in several types of cells, including epithelial and glioblastoma cells, and thereby prevent cell death induced by death receptor ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, the mechanisms by which HGF:c-Met exerts pro-apototic effects are not fully understood. It has been reported that HGF:c-Met signaling induces or sensitizes apoptotic cell death in a number of cell lines including ovarian carcinoma cell, breast carcinoma cell, mouse sarcoma cell and mouse hepatocarcinoma cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although the anti-apoptotic functions of the HGF:c-Met pathway appear to predominate in most biological systems, pro-apoptotic responses have been observed and could contribute to the balance between cell death and survival during the initiation and progression of certain malignancies.</p><p>Embryonic neuroectodermal malignancies such as medulloblastoma are among the most common and aggressive childhood brain tumors, and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Significant improvements in survival have been achieved by treating patients early with combinations of radiation and chemotherapy (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). However, aggressive therapy during critical periods of CNS development results in considerable neurocognitive toxicity and durable responses in patients with recurrent medulloblastoma remain disappointing. Improving our understanding of medulloblastoma cell death and survival mechanisms and developing new strategies to overcome the inherent resistance of medulloblastoma cells to death signals could have significant impacts on survival and neurocognitive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Induction of selective cancer cell death is the goal of many cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Apoptotic cell death can be initiated by either the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway or the extrinsic death receptor pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) has the potential to initiate death receptor pathways in malignant tissues while sparing normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. DR4 and DR5 are members of the TRAIL receptor superfamily sharing conserved cytoplasmic death domains essential for inducing apoptosis. Upon binding to TRAIL, DR4 and DR5 recruit the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which through its death domain interacts with pro-caspases-8 and -10 to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC then stimulates the proteolytic activation of the caspases-8 and -10, initiating a cascade of downstream caspase activation which leads to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, TRAIL does not yet offer a viable solution to brain cancer therapy since many brain tumors display complete or partial-resistance to death receptor agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Earlier work by our laboratory and others has shown that human medulloblastomas frequently express HGF, c-Met and molecular constituents of the extrinsic (death receptor) apoptosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This study examines the interactions between HGF:c-Met signaling and medulloblastoma cell death/apoptosis in response to TRAIL. We found that in a representative medulloblastoma cell line, HGF promotes TRAIL-induced medulloblastoma cell death. We further examined the mechanism by which HGF exert pro-apoptotic effect. We demonstrate that the enhanced cell death response to TRAIL results from HGF-mediated DR5 over-expression and increased death-inducing signaling complex formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.

Incubating cells with TRAIL alone (10 ng/ml) for 24 h induced death in 50% of cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). HGF (100 ng/ml) together with TRAIL (10 ng/ml) induced 68% cell death. Thus, HGF increased the cell death response to TRAIL by 36% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, TRAIL+HGF <italic>vs </italic>TRAIL alone). No cell death was observed in response to HGF alone. In fact, incubating DAOY cells with HGF alone (100 ng/ml) for 8 days increased cell numbers by ~40% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This is consistent with our previous observations that HGF induces cell cycle progression in medulloblastoma cells including the DAOY cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The enhancement of cell death required that cells be treated with HGF for at least 24 h prior to the addition of TRAIL. Shorter HGF pre-treatment time ranging from 1&#x02013;6 h failed to significantly enhance TRAIL induced cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

RT-PCR was used to measure the levels of c-Met and DR5 mRNA in 18 snap-frozen human embryonal tumor specimens (14 medulloblastoma and 4 peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)). Of the 18 tumor samples tested, all contained detectable levels of c-Met and DR5 mRNA. The expression level of c-Met is from 0.5 to 68.4 (c-Met/actin, normalized to DAOY). The expression level of DR5 in the 18 tumor samples ranges from 1.0&#x02013;98.5 (DR5/actin, normalized to DAOY). In normal brain tissue the expression level of c-Met and DR5 is 0.45 and 2.4, respectively. DR5 and c-Met do show a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.4, <italic>P </italic>= 0.06, Log Pearson analysis) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This relationship is best depicted after the 18 tumor specimens were independently divided into three groups each containing 6 tumors based on c-Met expression levels (highest, middle, and lowest thirds) and similarly into three groups based on DR5 expression levels. Of the 6 tumors with highest c-Met expression, 50% were among the highest and 17% were among the lowest DR5 expressers, respectively. In contrast, of the 6 tumors with lowest c-Met expression, 17% were among the highest and 50% were among the lowest DR5 expressers, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

We implicate a mechanism by which activating the c-Met tyrosine kinase enhances DR5 death receptor expression, resulting in enhanced DISC formation and downstream effector caspase-dependent apoptosis in response to TRAIL. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study demonstrating up-regulation of DR5 by the HGF:c-Met signaling pathway. We also identify a relationship between c-Met and DR5 expression level in clinical brain tumor specimens, suggesting that our in vitro findings may be translatable to a subset of human embryonal CNS tumors.</p><p>HGF is well known for its ability to protect tumor cell death triggered by various DNA-damaging stimuli including gamma-radiation and chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We reported previously that HGF protects DAOY medulloblastoma cells against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MacDonald and colleagues have compared the gene expression patterns of medulloblastoma cell lines to medulloblastoma clinical specimens and concluded that DAOY cells most closely mimic metastatic medulloblastoma, supporting the potential relevance of our in vitro results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The potential that our apoptosis-promoting results might be more broadly applicable to human medulloblastoma is further supported by the correlation between c-Met and DR5 expression level in human embryonal CNS tumors. The cell specific molecular determinants of pro- and anti-apoptosis responses to HGF:c-Met pathway activation are of interest and will require further investigation.</p><p>The second messenger pathways downstream of c-Met activation are multifunctional and can include cytoprotection, proliferation or death promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The PI3K-AKT pathway, which is potently activated by HGF, mediates cell protection in a large number of in vitro models. In DAOY cells, the overall effect of c-Met activation was to enhance TRAIL-induced death. We used the PI3K specific inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin to specifically examine the role of PI3K-AKT pathway activity in the sensitivity of HGF-treated DAOY cells to TRAIL. While not statistically significant, we found that both inhibitors increased TRAIL-induced cell death in HGF-treated cells. Thus, it is possible that PI3K-AKT pathway activation by HGF:c-Met signaling does have cytoprotective actions against in TRAIL-induced DAOY cell apoptosis even though the predominant effect of c-Met activation is death promoting under our experimental conditions. Things become more complicated when the cells were pre-treated with the MAPK specific inhibitor PD98059. Similar as PI3K-AKT, MAPK play an important role in cytoprotection (6, 7). Our Northern blot analysis data showed that MAPK may also mediate the DR5 up-regulation induced by HGF. The two aspects of MAPK may counteract and this may explain that the net effect of PD98059 is neutral. The JNK (c-jun NH2-terminal kinase), a well known cell death promoting signaling pathway, was found to be activated by HGF and to mediate HGF-induced cell death in other tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We found that in DAOY cells, JNK was transiently activated by HGF, peaking within 1 hour, and then quickly returned to base line. It has been postulated that sustained JNK activation is required to activate death-promoting downstream targets such as Bim and Bak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The fact that JNK was only transiently activated by HGF is consistent with at most a minor role of JNK in sensitizing DAOY cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis. The fact that the JNK pathway specific inhibitor CEP-11004 failed to reverse the death promoting effect of HGF further supports the notion that sustained JNK activation is required to promote apoptosis.</p><p>C-Met activation by HGF can inhibit Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by preventing the degradation of FLIP<sub><italic>L </italic></sub>in response to activated Fas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast to this, we found that c-Met activation does not modulate FLIP<sub><italic>L </italic></sub>levels in DAOY cells treated with TRAIL. Whether or not HGF affects FLIP function via other mechanisms will require further investigation. Complex formation between c-Met and the death receptor Fas has been found in other cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In these reports, the interaction between c-Met and Fas was found to inhibit DISC formation and thereby protected cells from apoptosis. Based on these reports, it is possible that HGF might dissociate c-Met from TRAIL receptors and thereby promote TRAIL-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not detect complexes with c-Met and DR5, the predominant TRAIL receptor expressed by DAOY cells. Instead, HGF was found to upregulate DR5 expression and increase the formation of death-inducing signaling complexes containing DR5 and caspase-8. Overall, our findings suggest that DR5 enhancement is the predominant mechanism by which HGF potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death in DAOY cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that c-Met kinase activity can up-regulate death receptor expression and thereby sensitize tumor cells to the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Our analysis of clinical specimens suggests a correlation between c-Met and DR5 expression level in a subset of human embryonal CNS malignancies. These findings extend the notion that the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase can have dual anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic actions in a common pediatric brain malignancy. Our findings suggest that death receptor activation may provide a route to overcome chemo/radio-resistant cells in subsets of embryonal CNS malignancies that express an activated c-Met pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YL conducted most of the experiments in this study.
