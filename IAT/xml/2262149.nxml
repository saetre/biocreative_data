Following <italic>in silico</italic> normalization, we constructed a gonad-derived microarray comprising 6370 unique, full-length cDNAs from differentiating and adult gonads. Labeled targets from adult gonad, brain, kidney and &#x02018;rest-of-body&#x02019; from both sexes were hybridized onto the microarray. Our analyses revealed 1366, 881 and 656 differentially expressed transcripts (34.7&#x00025; novel) that showed highest expression in ovary, testis and both gonads respectively. Hierarchical clustering showed correlation of the two gonadal transcriptomes and their similarities to those of the brains. In addition, we have identified 276 genes showing sexually dimorphic expression both between the brains and between the gonads. By <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we showed that the gonadal transcripts with the strongest array signal intensities were germline-expressed. We found that five members of the GTP-binding <italic>septin</italic> gene family, from which only one member (<italic>septin 4</italic>) has previously been implicated in reproduction in mice, were all strongly expressed in the gonads.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We have generated a gonad-derived zebrafish cDNA microarray and demonstrated its usefulness in identifying genes with sexually dimorphic co-expression in both the gonads and the brains. We have also provided the first evidence of large-scale differential gene expression between female and male brains of a teleost. Our microarray would be useful for studying gonad development, differentiation and function not only in zebrafish but also in related teleosts via cross-species hybridizations. Since several genes have been shown to play similar roles in gonadogenesis in zebrafish and other vertebrates, our array may even provide information on genetic disorders affecting gonadal phenotypes and fertility in mammals.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has become a major vertebrate model for developmental biology and genetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Grunwald1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Wixon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Beier1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Amatruda1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Dooley1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> during the last three decades. Despite these advances, little is known about the molecular aspects of its reproduction. The molecular mechanisms underlying gonad development and function in zebrafish have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Gonad differentiation in zebrafish is a highly complex process involving a &#x02018;juvenile ovary-to-testis&#x02019; transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. At 15&#x02013;20 days post fertilization (dpf), every zebrafish individual develops an ovary-like gonad (&#x02018;juvenile ovary&#x02019;). The juvenile ovary continues to develop until maturation in the females while in the rest of the individuals it undergoes a transitional intersexual phase eventually leading to the formation of a differentiated testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Uchida1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The involvement of the brain in gonad development has been established by studies on quail which showed that males transplanted with female forebrains had abnormally developed testes, indicating that a genetically male brain is necessary for normal testis development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Gahr1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the current experiment, we extended the throughput of the study by adding 3634 clones (derived mostly from the differentiating gonad) to the array and switching to a slide-based platform. In order to analyze the transcriptomes of the adult gonads and to compare them with those of other organs, RNA from adult ovary and testis were used as targets for hybridization onto the microarray, while RNA from the brain, kidney and rest of the body from both male and female adult zebrafish were used as controls. Our analysis revealed that a large number of genes showed sexually dimorphic expression in the gonads and other organs of adult zebrafish. These included novel transcripts which have not been characterized in any other vertebrate species according to our knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Extension of the gonadal EST set and generation of the Gonad Uniclone Microarray</title><p>We generated 4613 new ESTs from the adult zebrafish testis and ovary and 11010 sequences from the differentiating gonad &#x0005b;3, 4 and 5 weeks post-fertilization (wpf)&#x0005d;, which has never been sampled before by others (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001791.s007">Table S1</xref> for details). In total, 15623 new zebrafish ESTs have been submitted to GenBank from the effort described in this study.</p><p>In order to minimize redundancy, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> normalization of the above clone set by clustering their sequences together with our clone set published earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Li1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, gonad-derived zebrafish ESTs from GenBank and gonadal zebrafish sequences from RefSeq (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> for details). Clustering of these sequences resulted in 11320 clusters and 21520 singletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001791-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Out of these, 542 clusters (representing 1893 ESTs) and 6325 singletons that were isolated by us have not been previously described from the zebrafish gonad by others. When we BLAST-searched our transcripts against GenBank at the nucleotide level (July 2007), 2018 transcripts did not hit any coding regions of the zebrafish genome. Out of these, 90 of them could be translated into peptides, 24 of which contained domains categorized by Gene Ontologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001791-Ashburner1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001791.s008">Table S2</xref>). Of the 2018 transcripts, 365 did not find any significant sequence identity to zebrafish ESTs, indicating that they are likely to be absent from commercial zebrafish microarrays. Of the 365 transcripts, 185 did not have hits to any characterized genes in GenBank. Therefore, these sequences represent entirely new zebrafish or vertebrate ESTs, justifying our extension of gene discovery efforts to developmental stages that have not been sampled previously.</p><fig id="pone-0001791-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001791.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Venn diagram depicting the clones used for <italic>in silico</italic> normalization for the generation of the Gonad Uniclone Microarray.</title><p>The number of adult and differentiating gonad-derived zebrafish sequences present in our Gonad Uniclone EST collection and their extent of overlap with gonad-derived public zebrafish ESTs listed in GenBank are shown.

The target organs consisted of adult ovary and testis; the brain, kidney and &#x02018;rest-of-body&#x02019; (ie. whole body except the three organs listed earlier) from both male and female zebrafish, were used as controls. For simplicity, &#x02018;rest of body&#x02019; was regarded as an organ in this publication. All targets were hybridized against a pooled common reference consisting of equal amounts of targets from all dissected organs from a single adult male and a single adult female.</p><p>In order to validate our data, duplicate clones of 24 candidate genes, most of which were known to be involved in gonad development and/or function in zebrafish and/or other organisms, were also included in the microarray. We observed a good similarity between expression profiles of the duplicate clones of each candidate gene. Following a 1-way ANOVA test and a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test, 18 of the 24 genes showed statistically significant differences between the eight organs. Of the 18 genes, 11 showed at least 1.5-fold higher expression in comparison to the common reference target in either of the gonads. These 11 included four and seven genes most highly expressed in the ovary and testis respectively. Although some of the remaining candidate genes showed enhanced expression in the gonads, they were excluded from analysis for the following reasons: they were expressed more strongly in other organs compared to the gonads, they had inconsistent replicate readings, they fell below the 1.5-fold cutoff or they did not show differential expression between the gonads. In addition, the inability of cDNA microarrays to distinguish between splice isoforms or similar transcripts produced from paralogous loci may also have resulted in lack of the expected differential expression for some of the candidate genes.
