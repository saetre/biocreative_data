It is a critically important enzyme for human survival because its congenital absence causes severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).

It is one of the most severe human immunodeficiencies and is associated with depletion of all three major categories of lymphocytes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, resulting in impaired cellular immunity and decreased production of immunoglobulins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Without intervention, the affected individuals die from opportunistic infections within the first few months of life.</p><p>ADA occurs as a soluble monomer in all human cells, but also exists as &#x0201c;ecto-ADA,&#x0201d; bound to the membrane glycoprotein CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and it has been suggested that this form of ADA regulates extracellular adenosine levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. ADA deficiency is accompanied by greatly elevated levels of the ADA substrates adenosine and deoxyadenosine, both of which are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology. Adenosine is not just a metabolite; it is also a signaling molecule that regulates numerous cellular functions by binding to G protein-coupled adenosine receptors (A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 in mammals) that can regulate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Deoxyadenosine is a cytotoxic metabolite released by various cell populations that undergo programmed cell death; it can kill cells through a mechanism that includes disturbances in deoxynucleotide metabolism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Extracellular adenosine is now considered an important stress hormone that is released in excessive amounts in the vicinity of immune cells during both systemic and cellular stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

Specific inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial products are also capable of triggering adenosine release from immune cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. These data are in line with evidence demonstrating a dramatic increase in extracellular adenosine levels under conditions associated with multiple organ failure, which is the cause of 50&#x00025;&#x02013;80&#x00025; of all deaths in surgical intensive care units &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>ADA is not the only adenosine deaminase in mammalian cells. Recently, the <italic>cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1 (CECR1)</italic> gene was identified and shown to encode a protein representing a subfamily of proteins related to but distinct from classical ADAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The duplication of a small region of chromosome 22 containing this gene is associated with &#x0201c;cat eye syndrome,&#x0201d; a disorder characterized by hypoplastic kidneys, congenital heart malformation, and anomalous pulmonary venous connections. The founding member of this subfamily is encoded by <italic>insect-derived growth factor</italic><italic>(IDGF)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and homologs have been described in various organisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have previously found six <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes with sequence similarity to the <italic>CECR1</italic> subfamily &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Their products are mitogenic on <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and at least two of them (ADGF-A and ADGF-D) exhibit strong ADA activity, which is necessary for their mitogenic function. We therefore named them adenosine deaminase-related growth factors (ADGFs). We also demonstrated that adenosine functions as a negative signal for cell proliferation and concluded that ADGFs stimulate cell growth in vitro by depletion of extracellular adenosine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Drosophila</italic> also contains a gene, termed <italic>Ada,</italic> with sequence similarity to human <italic>ADA,</italic> but as we have previously shown the product of this gene is most likely not an active ADA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this report we show that a null mutation in <italic>Drosophila ADGF-A</italic> gene leads to dramatically increased levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the larval hemolymph. This increase leads to larval death associated with the disintegration of fat body and the development of melanotic tumors. We present a detailed analysis of the hematopoietic defects associated with the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation, show a genetic interaction of this mutation with signaling through the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adenosine receptor (AdoR, encoded by the gene <italic>CG9753</italic>) and with regulation of premetamorphic changes by ecdysone, as well as a genetic interaction of ADGF-A with a major innate immunity regulator&#x02014;the Toll signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> Gene Causes Larval Death and Melanotic Tumors</title><p>We produced mutations in five of the six <italic>ADGF</italic> genes by homologous recombination mutagenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d; and showed that loss of the most abundantly expressed gene, <italic>ADGF-A,</italic> leads to death in the larval or pupal stage. Under optimal conditions (20&#x02013;30 isolated homozygous larvae per vial), about 60&#x00025; of larvae homozygous for the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation reach the third instar. Development during the third larval instar is significantly delayed, and wandering homozygous larvae usually appear 2 d after their heterozygous siblings, which start wandering at about 5 d of development. Some homozygous third-instar larvae can be found alive in the vial even after 10 d of development. Mutant third-instar larvae show fat body disintegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">1</xref>B) and multiple melanotic tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), predominantly in the caudal part of the body and accompanied by disintegration of the fat body. Melanization of the lymph glands was never observed in these larvae, and the imaginal discs and brain appear normal. Less than 30&#x00025; of homozygotes eventually pupate. Homozygous pupae usually die soon after pupariation; in some cases they develop normal head and thorax imaginal structures; however, abdominal parts usually do not develop. There is also an abnormal curvature (to the right) of the pupal abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Less than 2&#x00025; of mutant pupae develop normally and eventually emerge as adults without any obvious abnormalities besides the abdominal curvature; some of them are sterile.</p><p>To confirm that the mutant phenotype is caused solely by a mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene, we created transgenic flies carrying the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene under a heat-shock promoter <italic>(HS-ADGF-A)</italic>. The <italic>adgf-a</italic> homozygous flies carrying the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct showed survival rates significantly higher than <italic>adgf-a</italic> even without heat shock, probably due to leaky expression of the <italic>HS-ADGF-A</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, while non-heat shocked animals still produced many melanotic tumors, only 22&#x00025; of animals that were heat shocked as late embryos/early first instar developed these tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This result confirms that the mutant phenotype is caused by the mutation in the <italic>ADGF-A</italic> gene. This conclusion is further supported by the even more efficient rescue achieved by expression of transgenically provided ADGF-A in the lymph glands using the Gal4/UAS system (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant Phenotype Is Associated with Elevated Levels of Adenosine and/or Deoxyadenosine</title><p>Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of deproteinated hemolymph samples, we measured adenosine concentrations in hemolymph of mutant and wild-type third-instar larvae.

Two different lines carrying the wild-type <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> expression construct together with an <italic>Actin-Gal4</italic> driver (providing ubiquitous expression) both completely rescued the mutant phenotype, whereas larvae with <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> but without the driver showed the typical mutant phenotype. However, neither of the two lines carrying the mutated version of the <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> (producing full-length protein detected by anti-myc antibody; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) showed any rescue of the mutant phenotype. This result therefore demonstrates that the catalytic activity of ADGF-A is required for its function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Hemocyte Development Is Affected in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant</title><p>We investigated the number and morphology of hemocytes (blood cells) in the hemolymph of the <italic>adgf-a</italic> late third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>). These larvae contain an average of seven-fold more hemocytes in circulation than wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to normal larval plasmatocytes, which remain rounded after settling down on the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), most of the cells in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant (more than 75&#x00025;) are strongly adhesive and, after they are deposited in a drop of hemolymph on a microscope slide, develop filamentous and membranous extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>D). An average of 7&#x00025; of hemocytes in the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant are lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>E), large flat cells that are not present in circulation of wild-type larvae under normal conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Crystal cells were also detected in excess, with mutant larvae carrying several hundred while there are fewer than a hundred of these cells in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The lymph glands normally do not release hemocytes into the hemolymph before metamorphosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;; instead, they are released during metamorphosis when the lymph glands disperse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the lymph glands of <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutant larvae are already dispersed in the late third instar. This process is similar to normal metamorphic changes, in which the hemocytes are first released from the front lobes, and the posterior lobes disperse later.</p><p>To analyze hemocytes in living larvae, we used the <italic>Hemolectin</italic> marker <italic>(Hml)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We compared the number and distribution of hemocytes stained by GFP in flies carrying <italic>hml-Gal4 UAS-GFP</italic> in wild-type and mutant backgrounds. While there are relatively few hemocytes, mostly free-floating in the hemolymph, in early third-instar wild-type larvae (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>I), a much higher number of hemocytes, which are mostly attached to the tissues under the integument (described as sessile hemocytes in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;), was observed in mutant larvae (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>J). A similar behavior was detected later in wild-type larvae, toward the end of the third instar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>H). At this stage, the <italic>Hml</italic> marker disappeared from the most of the hemocytes in mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g004">4</xref>G).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The <italic>adgf-a</italic> Mutant Phenotype Is Rescued by Expression of ADGF-A in the Lymph Glands</title><p>To distinguish which tissues require ADGF-A expression for proper development, we tested for rescue of <italic>adgf-a</italic> lethality by expressing ADGF-A in specific subsets of larval tissues. A transgenic line carrying the <italic>UAS-ADGF-A</italic> construct on Chromosome II was crossed to lines expressing the Gal4 driver &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; in different tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since ADGF-A is normally expressed in the larval lymph glands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and the mutant phenotype is characterized by abnormal hemocyte development, special consideration was given to lines expressing the Gal4 driver in the lymph glands and/or circulating hemocytes. No line expressing the Gal4 driver exclusively in the lymph glands has been reported, so we used a combination of lines sharing in common the feature of Gal4 driver expression in the lymph glands. The results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>) clearly demonstrate that expression of ADGF-A in the lymph glands (driven by <italic>Cg-Gal4,</italic><italic>e33C-Gal4,</italic> or <italic>c564-Gal4</italic>), but not in any other tissue examined, is necessary and sufficient to fully rescue the <italic>adgf-a</italic> lethality. In <italic>e33C-Gal4/UAS-ADGF-A,</italic> strong expression of ADGF-A in all lobes of developing lymph glands (but not in circulating hemocytes) reduces the number of hemocytes in the hemolymph to almost normal levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The number of hemocytes is also reduced, but to a lesser extent in larvae rescued by <italic>Cg-Gal4/UAS-ADGF-A</italic>. However, when assayed by survival rate and melanotic tumor formation, the rescue by <italic>Cg-Gal4</italic> is full and similar to that of <italic>e33C-Gal4</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The difference in effectiveness may be explained by the different expression patterns of the drivers. <italic>Cg-Gal4</italic> is expressed only in certain compartments of lymph gland lobes containing relatively mature hemocytes, and strongly in most circulating hemocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>C564-Gal4</italic> driver is not expressed as strongly as <italic>e33C-Gal4,</italic> but is still uniformly expressed in the lymph glands; it also fully rescued the mutant phenotype. We have tried two different insertions of the <italic>Dot-Gal4</italic> construct. The <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>11C</sup></italic> on Chromosome II, which shows weak expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;, did not rescue the phenotype, but a <italic>Dot-Gal4<sup>43A</sup></italic> insertion on Chromosome X, which shows stronger expression, rescued approximately half of the mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030201-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Nearly all rescued individuals were males, suggesting that expression of the Gal4 driver was influenced by X-chromosome dosage compensation, and expression in females heterozygous for <italic>Dot-Gal4</italic> was not strong enough for rescue.</p><p>Expression of ADGF-A in salivary glands and fat body (as well as in other tissues) is not required for full rescue, as demonstrated by use of the <italic>Cg-Gal4,</italic><italic>Dot-Gal4,</italic> but especially by <italic>e33C-Gal4</italic> driver, and is also not sufficient to rescue the phenotype at all, as demonstrated by <italic>T110-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Lsp2-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030201-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Since ADGF-A is strongly expressed in embryonic mesoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we have tried to rescue the phenotype by the expression of ADGF-A in embryonic and larval muscle cells using the <italic>Dmef2-Gal4</italic> driver &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the <italic>adgf-a</italic> mutation leads to larval or pupal death, we have shown that this is not due to the adenosine or deoxyadenosine simply blocking cellular proliferation or survival, as the experiments in vitro would suggest. Rather, this mutation leads to an increase in number of hemocytes at the end of larval development due to the differentiation and release of hemocytes from the lymph glands. Hemocytes also differentiate and are released from the lymph glands during systemic infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-03-07-02-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Together with our result suggesting an interaction between Toll signaling and ADGF-A, this leads to the hypothesis that adenosine controls hemocyte differentiation in response to infection, and that it signals through the adenosine receptor to postpone the next developmental step, metamorphosis.

The <italic>ADGF-A</italic> promoter contains consensus binding sites for effectors of both Toll and ecdysone signaling.
