AB-bodies also contain other proteins involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation including NRPD1b (a subunit of the RNA Polymerase IV complex, RNA PolIV), NRPD2 (a second subunit of this complex), and the DNA methyltransferase DRM2.

Proteins which formed such discrete nuclear bodies include RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, and NRPD1b. More recently, Dicing bodies (D-bodies), which contain microRNA processing factors DCL1 and HYL1, were also discovered in plant nuclei &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. These D-bodies are present in the nucleoplasm but are not associated exclusively with the nucleolus, unlike RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, and NRPD1b which have strong associations with the nucleolus.</p><p>In the case of AGO4, multiple AGO4 foci were often observed in a single nucleus, and these foci could be colocalized with either NRPD1b or the Cajal body &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Because NRPD1b was always found to be colocalized with AGO4, and because AGO4 was found to be localized to Cajal bodies in the vast majority of cells (95&#x00025;), our previous interpretation was that AGO4, NRPD1b, and possibly other factors involved in RdDM were all localized to Cajal bodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in the present study we demonstrate the existence of two distinct classes of AGO4 bodies: a large population that colocalizes with Cajal bodies, and a second smaller population that colocalizes with NRPD1b (which we call &#x0201c;AB-bodies&#x0201d;). AB-bodies also contained two other RdDM components, namely NRPD2 and the DNA methyltransferase DRM2, and this body was found to be adjacent to the 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, suggesting that the AB-body might be a site of active RNA-directed DNA methylation. AB-bodies and Cajal bodies showed distinct genetic requirements because a <italic>coilin</italic> mutation that disrupts Cajal body formation eliminated AGO4 at Cajal bodies but not at AB-bodies, and mutation of <italic>NRPD1b</italic> eliminated AGO4 at AB-bodies but not at Cajal bodies. These results suggest that AGO4 localization is regulated in a complex fashion involving two structurally distinct nuclear compartments. Finally, we found that disruption of Cajal body formation decreased the overall protein level of AGO4 and enhanced the weak effect of a <italic>dcl3</italic> mutation on DNA methylation at two repetitive loci (<italic>MEA-ISR</italic> and 5S ribosomal DNA), suggesting that Cajal bodies are required for a fully functioning RdDM system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Two Distinct Classes of AGO4 Nuclear Bodies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Nuclei</title><p>Utilizing a plant line containing Myc-tagged genomic AGO4 that is under the control of its endogenous promoter, we previously found that AGO4 shows very good colocalization with Cajal body markers, with colocalization seen in roughly 95&#x00025; of the nuclei &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Also as previously observed, when analyzing those nuclei in which clear NRPD1b foci were present, those NRPD1b foci always colocalized with AGO4. However, we observed a small population of nuclei (2&#x00025; in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) in which, in addition to the NRPD1b and AGO4 containing bodies, a second focus of AGO4 staining was found that did not colocalize with NRPD1b.</p><p>These results suggest the possibility of multiple different AGO4 bodies, and suggest that NRPD1b might not localize to Cajal bodies as was previously assumed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. To test this hypothesis, we examined U2B&#x02032;&#x02032; localization relative to NRPD1b in nuclei and found that these two proteins were indeed localized to separate foci adjacent to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Utilizing three fluorescent colors to look at Myc-AGO4, GFP-U2B&#x02032;&#x02032;, and NRPD1b simultaneously, we confirmed that multiple AGO4 foci within the nucleus either colocalized with NRPD1b or U2B&#x02032;&#x02032;, but we never observed all three proteins colocalizing together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Further characterization of the two different AGO4 bodies by fluorescence measurements using confocal microscopy showed that AGO4 immunostaining at the NRPD1b body was generally more intense and punctate, while AGO4 immunostaining at the Cajal body was usually less intense and more diffuse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).

These results suggest there are two classes of AGO4 nuclear bodies: a first class that colocalizes with the Cajal body in a majority of nuclei, and a second class that is with NRPD1b in a smaller population of cells (called &#x0201c;AB-bodies&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;<underline>A</underline>GO4/NRPD1<underline>b</underline> bodies&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cajal Body Integrity Affects AGO4 Localization and Is Required for a Fully Functioning RdDM System</title><p>The presence of the two classes of AGO4 bodies led us to ask whether the Cajal body and AB-body might be dependent on one another for stability.

If this is the case, the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 might also colocalize with the AB-body. To test this, we utilized a stable plant line expressing Myc-tagged genomic <italic>DRM2</italic> which is under the control of its endogenous promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We examined the localization of DRM2 in nuclei which contained AB-bodies marked with NRPD1b or NRPD2. As previously observed, a majority of nuclei contained DRM-Myc localized diffusely throughout the nucleoplasm with less intense signal at chromocenters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-st009">Table S9</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In a small population of nuclei where NRPD1b or NRPD2 bodies were present, DRM2 was also observed as a nucleolus-adjacent body that colocalized with NRPD1b or NRPD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g007">7</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-st009">Table S9</xref>). In contrast, no DRM2 body was seen colocalized with U2B&#x02032;&#x02032;, indicating DRM2 is not enriched at the Cajal body (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-sg009">Figure S9</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the <italic>ago4</italic> mutation caused a drastic reduction in the number of nuclei containing DRM2 bodies, suggesting that AGO4 has a role in targeting DRM2 to the AB-body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g007">Figure 7</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-st009">Table S9</xref>). We also attempted to determine whether DRM2 localization is affected in <italic>nrpd1b</italic>. However, due to the speckle-like nucleoplasmic staining of DRM2 that is only slightly fainter than the DRM2 signal at the AB-body, and without a second marker (such as NRPD1b or NRPD2) to confirm localization, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether DRM2 is still able to form a nuclear body that colocalizes with the AB-body in <italic>nrpd1b</italic>. However it is unlikely that DRM2 would be targeted to the AB-body in the absence of NRPD1b, since AGO4 localization to the AB-body requires NRPD1b, and DRM2 localization to the AB-body requires AGO4. In sum, the presence of DRM2 at the AB-body and its dependence on AGO4 are consistent with the idea that the AB-bodies might represent active sites of gene silencing.</p><fig id="pgen-0040027-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Localization of DRM2 with AB-odies</title><p>(A) DRM2-Myc nuclear localization relative to NRPD1b in wild type or an <italic>ago4</italic> mutant.</p><p>(B) Immunofluorescence analysis of the NRPD2 nuclear body relative to the DRM2 body.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0040027.g007"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate the existence of two independent populations of AGO4 nuclear bodies that are structurally distinct. This is in contrast to the model that we proposed previously in which we assumed that all AGO4 bodies were Cajal bodies, including AGO4 bodies that colocalized with NRPD1b &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Examination of a large population of nuclei combined with direct testing of the localization of NRPD1b relative to the Cajal body demonstrated that our initiation interpretation was incorrect, and that the regulation of AGO4 distribution within the nucleus is more complex than first conceived. Our new data show that AGO4 localizes independently to the Cajal body or to the 45S rDNA-adjacent AB-body, and that AB-bodies are distinct from AGO4/Cajal bodies.</p><p>The majority of AGO4 foci within the nucleus represents the Cajal body, a nucleolus-adjacent compartment in which the maturation of snRNP complexes occurs. Our analysis with a <italic>coilin</italic> mutant showed that AGO4 levels were affected by the absence of Cajal bodies. This suggests that the Cajal body may play a role in stabilizing AGO4 protein, just as RdDM components RDR2, DCL3, and NRPD1a are also involved in AGO4 stability. Although no obvious DNA methylation defects were seen in the <italic>coilin</italic> mutants alone, the <italic>ncb-1</italic> mutation enhanced the DNA methylation phenotype of <italic>dcl3</italic> at <italic>MEA-ISR</italic> and the 5S rDNA loci. The <italic>ncb-1 dcl3</italic> double mutant had less DNA methylation than <italic>dcl3</italic> alone but did not decrease methylation to the levels seen in <italic>ago4</italic> or the triple DNA methyltransferase mutant <italic>drm1 drm2 cmt3</italic>. One explanation for the lack of a stronger enhancement by <italic>ncb-1</italic> is that the function of the Cajal body may still partially remain in the <italic>coilin</italic> mutant. It is possible that although visible Cajal body formation is disrupted, Cajal body function may still exist in smaller, less concentrated foci through the nucleus in <italic>coilin</italic> mutants. This is a likely possibility since Cajal body mutants display no obvious developmental or morphological defects, despite the fact that Cajal bodies are major centers for assembly of splicing complexes that are essential for cellular processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. A similar situation exists in mammals where mice unable to form wild type Cajal bodies as a result of a deletion in coilin are also largely aphenotypic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In turn, AGO4 function at the Cajal body also may be dispersed throughout the nucleus in the absence of a visible concentrated Cajal body. Despite the weak phenotype, our data showing the effects of <italic>coilin</italic> on AGO4 stability and on enhancing DNA methylation defects in the <italic>dcl3</italic> mutant suggest that the Cajal body plays some role in the efficiency of RdDM.</p><p>The smaller population of AGO4 foci, the AB-bodies, is present in nuclei at a frequency that varies from experiment to experiment, typically ranging from 4&#x00025; to 20&#x00025; of total nuclei. The AB-bodies are present in every major tissue examined, such as flowers, leaves, and whole seedlings (data not shown). This suggests that AB-bodies might be present in cell types that constitute a minority of cells within most major tissues of the plant.</p><p>In addition to AGO4 and NRPD1b, AB-bodies also contain RdDM factors NRPD2 and DRM2. The AB-body was always observed to be associated with the NORs by DNA FISH analysis, suggesting that AB-bodies might be sites of on-going 45S rDNA silencing, especially since DRM2 is also enriched at these particular nuclear bodies. Some of the active rDNA repeats may be specifically targeted for de novo silencing by the RdDM machinery as a mechanism to modulate or fine tune total cellular rDNA gene activity. This idea is consistent with earlier findings showing that a subset of the rDNA repeats in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is more highly DNA methylated and less occupied by RNA polymerase I, while another subset is less DNA methylated and more highly associated with RNA polymerase I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, FISH analysis showed that the AB-body was most often adjacent to the NORs instead of overlapping them. One explanation for the minimal overlap is that the AB-body might be present at less condensed or active 45S rDNA sequences that require gene silencing, and that these less condensed 45S rDNA sequences are difficult to visualize by DNA FISH. Euchromatic regions were previously shown to loop out of adjacent condensed DNA regions called chromocenters, which contain highly condensed 45S rDNA, 5S rDNA, and/or centromeric sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. It is thus possible that the AB-body is present at one of these loops, which would then situate the AB-body adjacent to the NORs.</p><p>The stability of the AB-body in upstream RdDM mutants sets AB-bodies apart from previously characterized nuclear bodies and indicates that AB-bodies are novel nucleolus-associated bodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, while AB-bodies were detectable in <italic>nrpd1a</italic>, <italic>rdr2</italic>, and <italic>dcl3 rdr2</italic> nuclei that contained very little overall AGO4 protein, we found that in <italic>dcl3</italic>, nuclei containing decreased overall AGO4 levels did not show any AB-bodies, but <italic>dcl3</italic> nuclei with normal AGO4 levels did contain AB-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040027-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040027-st004">Table S4</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that the specific cell types that normally form AB-bodies exist within the population of <italic>dcl3</italic> nuclei that still contain normal AGO4 levels, and not within the <italic>dcl3</italic> population containing reduced AGO4 levels. While the molecular basis for this correlation is unknown, it suggests a relationship between the particular cell population or cell type that contains AB-bodies and those able to express normal levels of AGO4 despite the <italic>dcl3</italic> mutation.</p><p>The fact that AB-bodies were still detected in <italic>nrpd1a</italic>, <italic>rdr2</italic>, and <italic>dcl3</italic> mutants suggests that an alternative pathway exists to target AGO4 and NRPD1b to 45S rDNA or adjacent regions. The finding that NRPD1a and RDR2 are not required for AB-body formation may indicate that the target sequence of the AB-body can produce double stranded RNA and siRNAs in a manner that does not require the activity of NRPD1a-containing RNA PolIV complexes or RDR2. In this way these loci would show the same genetic requirements as do a variety of inverted repeat loci in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome whose siRNA synthesis does not require NRPD1a or RDR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The finding that AGO4 did not localized to AB-bodies in the <italic>nrpd1b</italic> mutant, but that NRPD1b could still localize to nuclear bodies in an <italic>ago4</italic> mutant, suggests a function of NRPD1b in stabilizing AGO4 at the 45S rDNA loci, possibly by NRPD1b interacting with AGO4 directly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; and/or by generating a nascent RNA strand for AGO4 binding. Our data would further suggest that once stably localized at the target region by NRPD1b, AGO4 would then recruit DRM2 (directly or indirectly), since the localization of DRM2 to the AB-body depends on AGO4. In the future, it will be interesting to determine the precise nature of the sequences targeted by components of the AB-body, and the mechanisms and factors that recruit NRPD1b, NRPD2, AGO4 and DRM2 to 45S rDNA adjacent sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of epitope tagged lines.</title><p>Genomic <italic>AGO4</italic> was N-terminally tagged with four copies of c-Myc and expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>AGO4</italic> promoter as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040027-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.
