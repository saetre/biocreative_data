Cy3NTA, comprised of the fluorescent dye Cy3, coupled to two Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/nitrilotriacetic acid moieties, was synthesized and functionally tested for binding to His-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP fluorescence emission and Cy3NTA absorbance spectra overlapped significantly, indicating that FRET could occur (F&#x000f6;rster distance&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.3 nm). Cy3NTA bound to His<sub>10</sub>-tagged GFP, quenching its fluorescence by 88&#x00025;. GFP was then fused to the N-terminus of RyR1 and His<sub>10</sub> tags were placed either at the N-terminus of the fused GFP or between GFP and RyR1. Cy3NTA reduced fluorescence of these fusion proteins by 75&#x00025; and this quenching could be reversed by photobleaching Cy3, thus confirming GFP-RyR1 quenching via FRET. A His<sub>10</sub> tag was then placed at amino acid position 1861 and FRET was measured from GFP located at either the N-terminus or at position 618 to Cy3NTA bound to this His tag. While minimal FRET was detected between GFP at position 1 and Cy3NTA at position 1861, 53&#x00025; energy transfer was detected from GFP at position 618 to Cy3NTA at position 1861, thus indicating that these sites are in close proximity to each other.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These findings illustrate the potential of this site-specific labeling system for use in future FRET-based experiments to elucidate novel aspects of RyR1 structure.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) is an intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel that plays a central role in skeletal muscle excitation contraction coupling. This enormous homotetrameric protein embedded in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is part of a macromolecular complex that includes calmodulin, FK506 binding protein 12 kDa (FKBP12), the skeletal muscle voltage gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel isoform (Cav1.1), and cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Reiken1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. RyR1 point mutations can result in human skeletal muscle disorders such as malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and multiple minicore disease. Understanding the overall structure of this macromolecular complex and how perturbations of this structure by these mutations lead to skeletal muscle disease are central questions in skeletal muscle biology.</p><p>In cryo electron-microscopy (EM) reconstructions, the RyR is mushroom-shaped with four-fold symmetry reflective of the homotetrameric arrangement of the individual subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Wagenknecht1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Regions of the RyR implicated in muscle diseases have been localized to this cryo EM map via fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) into these elements and subsequent visualization of the corresponding increase in mass on the cryo EM map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Liu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, changes in RyR structure that accompany channel gating have been determined by comparing cryo EM maps of the RyR locked in closed and open conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Orlova1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Samso1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, cryo EM techniques cannot resolve fast conformational changes of the RyR that occur as the channel gates in real-time nor can they be used to study RyRs in solution. Thus, additional methods are needed to perform these types of structural measurements of RyR1.</p><p>F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements are well-suited to examine real-time changes in RyR conformation and thus represent a novel approach to structure-based studies of RyR1. FRET relies upon energy transfer from a fluorophore in the excited state (donor) to a nearby photosensitive molecule (acceptor). The degree of energy transfer is directly dependent on donor-acceptor distances in the range of &#x0223c;2.5&#x02013;10 nm and as such, this method is well-suited to make distance measurements on proteins in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Stryer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, FRET can reliably measure <underline>changes</underline> in donor-acceptor distances that reflect the conformational dynamics of proteins.</p><p>FRET measurements require site-specific placement of donor and acceptor fluorophores onto the protein(s) being studied, often by covalent attachment at unique cysteine or lysine residues. However, for RyR1, site-specific fluorophore labeling at these residues is extremely difficult since this protein contains 100 cysteines and 229 lysines per subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Takeshima1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the first challenge in developing FRET methods to study RyR1 structure is to <underline>site-specifically</underline> label the protein with fluorophores suitable for FRET measurements. One novel approach to this problem has been to reconstitute RyR1 with fluorescently tagged RyR binding proteins, FKBP12 and calmodulin, and then to measure FRET between these proteins bound to RyR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Cornea1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In this elegant study, distance measurements between these bound proteins were in close agreement with distances predicted from cryo EM localizations of their binding sites on RyR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Wagenknecht2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, more versatile labeling methods are required to make FRET measurements between locations inaccessible to RyR-associated proteins.</p><p>Recently, a site-specific labeling method has been developed that holds great promise for use in FRET studies of RyR1. This method utilizes the interaction between nitrilotriacetic acid/Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (NTA) complexes and poly-histidine &#x0201c;tags&#x0201d; inserted into proteins for affinity purification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Hochuli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> by coupling NTA to fluorescence acceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Kapanidis1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> in order to target these molecules to His tags introduced into proteins.

Cy3NTA can be targeted to virtually any desired region of a protein that contains a surface exposed His tag. For RyR1, this method is well suited for site-specific labeling experiments for the following reasons. 1) Nonspecific binding of Cy3NTA to endogenous histidines in RyR1 should be minimal since this protein contains only one segment with two consecutive histidines and no segment longer than 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Takeshima1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. 2) Neither wildtype RyR1 nor GFP-RyR1 lacking a His tag bound to the NTA-agarose column, thus indicating that these proteins lack Ni/NTA binding sites and thus should not be able to bind Cy3NTA. 3) All His-tagged GFP-RyR1 fusion proteins bound to the NTA-agarose column thus indicating that the introduced His<sub>10</sub> tags are available to bind Ni/NTA and, by extension, Cy3NTA. 4) When His<sub>10</sub> tags were placed in RyR1 positions predicted to be in close molecular proximity to the N-terminal GFP, a high degree of FRET was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007338-g005">Fig. 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007338-g006">6</xref>). This result indicates that Cy3NTA bound to these inserted His<sub>10</sub> tags in RyR1.</p><p>An additional advantage of this labeling system is reversibility. After making a FRET measurement, the bound NTA-fluorophore can be removed with either EDTA or imidazole and a new NTA-fluorophore can potentially be applied. This approach has been used with NTA conjugated to the fluorescent dye, Atto-647 to examine diffusion of His<sub>10</sub>-tagged serotonin receptors in the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007338-Guignet2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The FRET measurements in this study also follow this predicted trend in that a higher level of FRET is observed between donor and acceptor molecules placed at amino acid residues 618 to 1861 compared to these molecules placed at residues 1 and 1861. Conversion of these FRET levels to distances would probably be inaccurate due to the physical dimensions of the donor (GFP: 3&#x000d7;4.5 nm) and acceptor (Cy3NTA: 3&#x000d7;1.8 nm). However, the fact that the level of FRET increases as predicted when GFP is placed closer to the DR3 His<sub>10</sub> tag coupled with the observation that FRET is being measured across a distance of over 1000 amino acid residues in the RyR1 primary sequence demonstrates the utility of this technique in structural mapping of the RyR.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author would like to acknowledge the exceptional technical assistance of Shweta Raina in preparing some of the GFP-RyR1 cDNA constructs.
