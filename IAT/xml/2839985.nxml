Several transcriptional isoforms have been described but the functional significance and tissue distribution of each form is presently poorly understood. Also, differences in the number of isoforms and splice variants reported still exist between different mammalian species. In order to better understand the number and function of the different variants of the Dlc1 gene in the mouse, we have carried out a detailed analysis. Extensive 3' RACE experiments were carried out in order to identify all possible Dlc1 isoforms and splice variants in the mouse. In addition, we have generated a gene trapped mouse that targets one of these isoforms in order to study its biological function. The effect of this gene trap insertion on the splicing of other isoforms has also been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In addition to the known 6.1 and 6.2 Kb transcripts of Dlc1, our study revealed the existence of a novel 7.6 Kb transcriptional isoform in the mouse, which corresponds to the human 7.4 Kb (KIAA1723) cDNA transcript. A gene trapped embryonic cell line, with an insertion between Exon 1 and 2 of the 6.1 Kb transcriptional isoform, was used to generate a transgenic mouse. This line showed a significant reduction in the expression of the trapped isoform. However, reduced expression of the other isoforms was not seen. Mice heterozygous for the gene trapped allele were phenotypically normal, but homozygous mutant embryos did not survive beyond 10.5 days post coitum. Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>embryos showed defects in the brain, heart, and placental blood vessels. Cultured serum-free mouse embryo cells from Dlc1 deficient embryos had elevated RhoA activity and displayed alterations in the organization of actin filaments and focal adhesions. The Dlc1 deficient cells also exhibited increased wound closure in an <italic>in vitro </italic>scratch assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mouse has three major transcriptional isoforms of the Dlc1 gene that are differentially expressed in various tissues. A mouse with exon 1 of the 6.1 Kb transcript gt resulted in hypomorphic expression of Dlc1 protein and an embryonic lethal phenotype in the homozygous condition, which indicates that this isoform plays a major role in mouse development. The Dlc1 deficient cells showed altered cytoskeleton structure, increased RhoA activity and cellular migration.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Rho family of GTPases control several important cellular processes, such as cell shape, motility, division and survival through a series of biochemical networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. RhoGTPases have long been implicated in tumourigenesis, as Rho activity is found to be increased in transformed cells and is necessary for the transformation by the Ras oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The Rho proteins act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The RhoGTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs) down regulate Rho by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A significant number of RhoGAPs have been shown to have altered levels in a variety of human tumours and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The deleted in liver cancer 1 (Dlc1) gene encodes a RhoGTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) that has been found to be inactivated by deletion or promoter methylation in many tumours, resulting in alterations in cellular proliferation, cytoskeleton reorganization and gene expression in tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A recent study using representational oligonucleotide based microarray analysis showed that heterozygous deletion of Dlc1 occurred in ~50% of liver, breast and lung tumours and over 70% of colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The Dlc1 RhoGAP is a multi-domain protein that contains a sterile alpha motif 2 (SAM2) interaction domain and a StAR-related lipid-transfer (START) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The Dlc1 gene shows multiple transcription start sites and alternative splicing. In humans, three major transcriptional isoforms of the Dlc1 gene has been reported (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). The predominant 6.3 Kb transcript of Dlc1 encodes a protein of 123 KDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The existence of proteins for the human mRNA isoforms of 3.7 Kb (AK025544) and 7.4 Kb (KIAA1723) have recently been verified by Ko <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In mouse tissues, two principal transcripts of 6.5 and 5.5 Kb and a minor transcript of 7.6 Kb have been reported by Northern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but the complete characterization and tissue specific expression of all the isoforms and splice variants of Dlc1 gene in the mouse has not yet been carried out.</p><p>In order to better understand the biological function of various isoforms of Dlc1, we have generated a mouse with one of its isoform variants targeted. We have also characterized the different transcriptional isoforms and their tissue specific expression in the mouse. The effect of this gene trap insertion on the other variants has also been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification, characterization and tissue specific expression of mouse Dlc1 mRNAs and protein</title><p>Extensive 3' RACE experiments were carried out in order to determine all possible isoforms and splice variants of the Dlc1 gene in the mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Transcripts 1 and 2 correspond to the two previously described transcripts of 6.2 and 6.1 Kb, which agrees with the current major translated transcripts (isoform-1 and 2, respectively) found in the Vega database (Version 3, 02/06/2008; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These two transcripts are controlled by two alternative promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A previously described 2.8 Kb upstream transcript (<bold>AK053142</bold>) had not been linked to Dlc1 in the mouse; however, it shows partial homology to the human Dlc1 7.4 Kb transcript. We therefore included a primer for this transcript in our 3' RACE experiments. The regions of homology of transcripts 3 and 4 to the Dlc1 locus are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. These results show a linkage of this upstream 2.8 Kb transcript with exon 2 of Dlc1, including a novel exon not previously reported. Based on these complimentary DNAs (cDNAs) and others, found in the databases, we predict that there is a 7.6 Kb transcript, which arises from a promoter greater than 220 Kb upstream from exon 1 of the 6.2 Kb Dlc1 transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This 7.6 Kb transcript (GenBank accession No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GU1280500">GU1280500</ext-link>, isoform-3) contains sequences in common with the previously reported 2.835 Kb cDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AK048960">AK048960</ext-link>). A second 2.1 Kb transcript (GenBank accession No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GU1280389">GU1280389</ext-link>, transcript-4) starting from the same promoter retains 160 bp of intronic sequence downstream of exon 3 of the 6.1 Kb transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In addition, transcripts of 3.4, 2.8 and 1.7 Kb (Nos. 5, 6 and 7) from this same upstream promoter, that do not link to the Dlc1 gene, were also found (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, GenBank accession No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GU1280505">GU1280505</ext-link>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Splicing pattern of the transcriptional isoforms of Dlc1 gene</bold>.

This probe revealed the existence of transcripts (7.6, 6.1, 6.2 and 2.1 Kb) in all the tissues examined. However, the 7.6 Kb splice variant was most prominent in the liver and placenta and appeared to be a minor transcript in other tissues.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Northern blot of ribonucleic acid (RNA) from different mouse tissues</bold>.

These results reveal that the Dlc1 isoforms are expressed abundantly in all the mouse tissues that we examined, which agrees with the data observed by northern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, using real time RT-PCR analysis, the 6.1 Kb transcript seems to be expressed highest in the liver, followed by the placenta, lung, heart, spleen, testis, brain, kidney, thymus and the skin. The 6.2 and 7.6 splice variants were expressed at lower levels in the other organs compared with the 6.1 Kb isoform. Liver and placenta appears to predominantly express the 6.1 and 6.2 Kb transcripts whereas the 7.6 Kb transcript was predominantly expressed in lung, heart and placenta based on real-time RT-PCR, in agreement with the northern blot.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Absolute quantification of Dlc1 transcriptional isoforms in mouse tissues by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</bold>.

This antibody should pick up proteins translated from the 6.1, 6.2 and 7.6 Kb transcripts as Exon 5 is common to all three. The Dlc1 antibody detected a 123 KDa protein presumably derived from the 6.1 Kb transcript. The Western blot revealed a very high expression of 123 KDa Dlc1 protein in the liver, placenta and spleen. The molecular weight of the Dlc1 protein derived from the 6.2 Kb transcript is predicted to be 127 KDa. In the same western blot test we found a band of approximately 127 KDa, which showed a high expression in the thymus, lung, testis, spleen and liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Sometimes a doublet of the 127 KDa band was seen, which suggests a possible post-translational modification. Further experiments will be needed in order to confirm the identity of the 127 KDa band and the other cross reacting proteins. With this antibody, we were not able to detect any proteins in the region of 169.8 KDa - the predicted size of the protein from the 7.6 Kb transcript (data not shown). The expression profile of Dlc1 isoforms among different tissues were correlated, to some extent, with the quantitative PCR and the northern blot.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Dlc1 protein expression in different mouse tissues</bold>.

We used bisulphite treatment of DNA followed by PCR and pyrosequencing to study the promoter methylation status of the 6.1 and 6.2 Kb transcripts in various tissues. For our studies, we targeted five CpG islands located 502 bp upstream of the start codon for the 6.1 Kb transcript and four CpG islands located 851 bp upstream of the start codon of 6.2 Kb transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The pyrosequencing revealed much lower methylation of the 6.1 Kb promoter region (1-19% mean methylation) in the 5 CpG islands; the 6.2 Kb promoter region showed a higher percentage of mean methylation of 60-65% in all the tissues examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Methylation status of the Dlc1 alternative isoform promoters in different mouse tissues</bold>.

Recent evidence suggests that 30%-50% of the human and mouse genes have multiple alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In humans, at least three transcriptional isoforms (6.3, 3.7 and 7.4 Kb length) of Dlc1 gene have been identified that are expressed under the influence of three alternative promoters spanning approximately 400 Kb. The mouse Dlc1 gene on chromosome 8B1 and the human gene on 8P22 have an almost identical exon/intron structure, except for the presence of an extra codon in exon 5 of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In a previous study using 5' RACE and northern blotting analysis, Durkin <italic>et al</italic>. reported the presence of 3 Dlc1 transcripts in the mouse of 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 Kb in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, in our study using extensive 3' RACE and northern blot analysis, we have found four major transcriptional isoforms of Dlc1 (2.1, 6.1, 6.2 and 7.6 Kb). The complete characterization of the 7.6 Kb and 2.1 Kb transcripts lead to the identification of a novel exon of 34 bp in length, which connects the Dlc1 gene upstream of exon 2 to an additional 1.7 Kb of exon sequences, resulting in the 7.6 Kb fusion transcript. The upstream 1.7 Kb exon sequences were generated from a previously uncharacterized gene 5' of Dlc-1 (A730069N07Rik). It is interesting to note that comparison of the mouse 7.6 Kb mRNA with the human 7.5 Kb transcript revealed that the 5<sup>th </sup>exon is exactly 34 bp in length and only differs in its relative position within the intronic sequences. The conserved nature of this novel exon sequence supports a functional significance for the 7.6 Kb mRNA. The human 7.4 Kb, KIA1723, cDNA has the potential to encode for a 1528 amino acid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently Ko <italic>et al</italic>. have shown high expression of a greater than 150 KD protein in the human heart tissue using an antibody based on this cDNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The putative promoter region of both the human and mouse Dlc1 7.6 Kb mRNA is approximately 400 Kb upstream of the exon 2 of the Dlc1 6.2 Kb transcript. Shorter transcripts originating from this promoter are also found, which do not encode Dlc1 RhoGAP related sequences. The existence of this larger Dlc1 polypeptide has not yet been verified in the mouse and we have not yet seen a protein of this size on our western blots. The mouse 2.1 Kb transcript retains only exon 2 and 3 of the regular Dlc1 transcripts and would not encode a RhoGAP related protein. Understanding the function of these shorter transcripts will have to await specific knockout mouse models. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the three isoforms reveals that these isoforms have a conserved domain structure and that they may be functionally redundant. However, these isoforms were not sufficient to rescue the embryonic lethal phenotype of our homozygous gt mice.</p><p>The gene fusions observed in the 7.6/2.1 Kb transcripts may be due to the bypassing of 3' end formation sites that has been observed for other genes in the Fantom database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Exon 4 of the A730069N07Rik transcript contains two successive polyadenylation signals TGTTTT and AATAAA, which are considered weak in comparison to the presence of three successive polyadenylation signals (AATAAA, ATTAAA, and TGTTTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] present in the 14th exon of regular Dlc1 transcripts. The weak polyadenylation signal may be responsible for bypassing the 3' end formation and lead to the formation of a fusion transcript between the genes. However, the conserved nature of the exon 5 of the 7.6 transcript contradicts this finding and further study is necessary in order to validate these observations.</p><p>The 6.1 Kb Dlc1 transcript is predicted to encode a 123 KDa protein, which is highly expressed in the forebrain, anterior tip of the notochord, somites, liver, heart and placenta, suggesting an important role for this Dlc1 isoform in the development of theses organs. The 6.2 Kb alternative transcript contains a novel first exon located 133 Kb upstream of exon 2 and potentially codes for a 127 KDa protein. The first exon of the 6.2 Kb transcript substitutes 47 aa of the first 13 aa of the 6.1 Kb Dlc1 transcript. The existence of the 127 KDa Dlc1 protein has not yet been fully validated. However, in our western blots, using an antibody raised against a peptide to exon 5, we identified a band equivalent to 127 KDa. The expression level of 127 KDa Dlc1 protein showed tissue specific differences from the 123 KDa protein. For example, testes showed expression of the 127 KDa band and reduced levels of the 123 KDa band (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). There is possibility that the 127 KDa protein is a cross reacting non-specific protein. However, we argue that the 127 KDa band is the protein product of the 6.2 Kb isoform because of its molecular weight, which almost exactly matches the predicted protein product of 6.2 Kb isoform. Another reason for such an argument is that the 127 KDa protein band has increased intensity in the Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>cell line as opposed to the wild type or heterozygous cell lines. This may be explained as a cellular response to complement the reduced level of 6.1 Kb transcript in the gt cells or an effect of the relative abundance of 6.2 kb isoform. The 6.1 and 6.2 Kb Dlc1 isoforms may be functionally redundant because of their structural resemblance and, thus, could complement each other. Recently, such functional redundancy has been shown by Ko <italic>et al</italic>. in a study using Myc tagged Dlc1 isoforms expressed in hepatoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. They showed that human Dlc1 isoforms &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (equivalent to mouse isoforms 1 and 3) could suppress stress fibre formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, further experimentation is necessary in order to test such a claim.</p><p>The N terminus of Dlc1 protein contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM)2 interaction domain, amino acids 13-64 in the 6.1 Kb and 47-98 in the 6.2 Kb transcripts. The SAM domain is a motif that occurs in many transcription factors and signalling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The 123 and 127 KDa Dlc1 proteins differ in exon 1, which is a short stretch of amino acids upstream of the SAM2 domain. Deletion of the SAM domain increases the velocity of cell migration but reduces directionality by acting as a negative regulator of Dlc1RhoGAP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A truncated version of Dlc1 protein that contains the N terminal domain, but not the GAP domain, localizes to focal adhesions and can act as a dominant negative protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, in hamster kidney cells, co-localization of Dlc1 protein with Caveolin-1 in focal adhesions was found to be independent of the SAM domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the Dlc1 SAM2 domain has been shown to interact with the elongation factor EF1A1, targeting it to the membrane periphery and membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that exon 1 of the Dlc1 isoforms may interact with different proteins or allow different subcellular localization for the spatial regulation of cell movement. In that case, the 6.1 Kb and 6.2 Kb isoforms may not be able to rescue each other's RhoGAP activity due to different interacting partners or subcellular localization. Alternatively, the two isoforms may have different temporal or tissue specific expression during development, a theory which is supported by our results. Experiments that will test these possibilities are ongoing.</p><p>The mean frequency of the promoter methylation for the Dlc1 isoforms helps to explain the tissue expression pattern. The promoter of the 6.1 Kb transcript showed a significantly lower mean percentage of CpG methylation (1%-19%) compared with the promoter of 6.2 Kb transcript (62%-65%). Hypermethylation of the Dlc1 promoter is a common mechanism for transcriptional repression of the Dlc1 gene in several human malignancies and hypermethylation of the 6.1 Kb transcript promoter is usually found in human tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The gene trap insertion occurred within intron 1 of the Dlc1 6.1 Kb transcript and this allowed us to examine the functional significance of the specific loss of this transcript. The gene trap vector inserted in the Dlc1 locus should delete the majority of the downstream coding sequences if obligatory cleavage and polyadenylation at the SV40 polyadenylation signal of the gene trap construct occurs. By multiplex PCR, we showed the existence of fusion transcripts for all three of the Dlc isoforms spliced to the &#x003b2;geo coding region. However, only the 6.1 Kb transcript was significantly reduced, resulting in the hypomorphic expression of the 123 KDa protein and subsequent phenotypic abnormalities in the mouse. The hypomorphic expression was presumably due to low level splicing around the gene trap plasmid insert. There is a possibility that the phenotypic abnormalities in our study could be due to the disruption or deletion of a microRNA expressed from this intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, we have not found any evidence of any known microRNAs anywhere near or within this intron of Dlc1 in the miRBASE database, as well as any computationally identified candidate microRNA genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Also, our gene trapped mouse phenocopies the Dlc1 exon 5 knockout mouse of Durkin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These results suggest that the gt ES cell libraries maybe a useful resource for studying specific knockdown of transcriptional isoforms and splice variants of genes.</p><p>The Dlc1 gene plays a critical role in regulating cellular functions during early murine development. The abnormalities found in the Dlc1 gt embryos are a common occurrence in mouse gene knockouts that result in death at the early stages of embryogenesis, due to organ systems failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and are often associated with cardiac or placental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The abnormally enlarged heart, lack of yolk sac blood vessels and underdeveloped blood capillaries in the placental labyrinth of the homozygous Dlc1 gt embryos appeared at a developmental stage when the Dlc1 transcripts are normally expressed and, most probably, caused the embryonic lethality. Whether the heart and brain defects are a direct result of Dlc1 loss or a consequence of the lack of placental blood vessel formation will have to await the isolation of conditional Dlc1 knockout mice.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that targeted disruption of mouse Rho associated coiled coil kinase-2 (ROCK-II) gene resulted in intrauterine growth retardation and defective branching morphogenesis of the placental labyrinth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The ROCK-II mRNA has been found to be expressed abundantly in placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The active form of RhoA binds to ROCK kinase, which phosphorylates myosin phosphatase, resulting in increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation allowing contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The Rho/ROCK signalling pathway also contributes to the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sensitization of smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. RhoA is abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle and its activation increases vascular tone, resulting in increased permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Rho GTPases has long been implicated in the regulation of endothelial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that increased expression of constitutively active RhoA induced cell rounding and apoptosis of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that Dlc1 protein plays a significant role in placental and heart development due to its regulatory effect on Rho/ROCK signalling pathway.</p><p>The Dlc1 protein has been reported to be localized to the focal adhesions as shown by colocalization with the focal adhesion protein vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Focal adhesions are a structural link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and are regions of signal transduction that can regulate growth control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. We have shown that the formation of actin stress fibres and vinculin rich focal adhesions were significantly increased in the hypomorphic Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>SFME and fibroblast cell lines. Dlc1 has been implicated in the phosphoinositide and RhoGTPase signalling pathways, both of which can regulate stress fibre formation and focal adhesions assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Similar findings have been reported by Holeiter <italic>et al</italic>. in breast cancer cells using siRNA mediated knockdown of Dlc1 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and Xue <italic>et al</italic>. in embryonic liver progenitor cells using shRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast to our results, Durkin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that their knockout mice showed reduced actin stress fibre and vinculin rich focal adhesions in their Dlc1<sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A possible reason for this may be that the culturing of our SFME cells on fibronectin coated plates, may stimulate the Rho signalling allowing the formation of stress fibres. Using soluble GST-RBD in order to detect endogenous RhoGTP, we have been able to show that the Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>cells exhibit increased RhoA activity and subcellular localization of active RhoA at the focal adhesions. Similar findings have been previously reported by Berdeaux <italic>et al</italic>. in nontransformed fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Rho proteins are important regulators of cellular migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In addition to the cytoskeletal changes, the Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>MEF cells showed significantly increased cellular migration in wound closure assays compared with the heterozygous or wild type MEFs. Similarly, Holeiter <italic>et al</italic>. found rapid wound closure in scratch assays using RNAi to knockdown Dlc1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The cellular migration rate decreased as the cells approached to the midline of the wound from both sides, which might be because of changes in the direction of migration due to contact or the depletion of nutrients in the media. All of this evidence is consistent with the suggestion that Dlc1 deficiency may be a driving force for cellular migration by remodelling the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that in H-Ras oncogene transformed fibroblasts, RhoA may cooperate in transformation by suppressing the cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>that is induced by the sustained activation of the ERK-MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our study, we saw increased RhoA activity and a reduced level of constitutive p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>expression in the Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>SFME cells. The reduced expression of Dlc1 and p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>in the Dlc1 deficient cell lines was positively correlated. It is possible that activation of the Rho pathway through mutation of the Dlc RhoGAPs will complement the Ras oncogene in cell transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have found that the Dlc1 gene has four transcriptional isoforms expressed under the influence of three alternative promoters. The alternative promoters are differentially methylated in mouse tissues and this relates to the differential expression of the proteins in the tissues examined. We also identified a 127 KDa Dlc1 protein that may originate from the 6.2 Kb alternative transcript. We generated a Dlc1 gt mouse that resulted in hympomorphic expression of the 6.1 Kb transcript and the 123 KDa Dlc1 protein. The homozygous gt Dlc1<sup>gt/gt </sup>mouse embryos showed significant abnormalities in yolk sac and placental labyrinth vasculature suggesting an important developmental role for the 6.1 Kb isoform of Dlc1 during early embryonic development. A deficiency of this isoform resulted in increased GTP-Rho levels resulting in more stress fibre and vinculin associated focal adhesion formation.

The vector was linearized and the radiolabelled antisense RNA probe was generated using T7 polymerase.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of Dlc1 isoforms by real time and multiplex PCR</title><p>The relative expression of the different transcriptional variants was determined by quantitative real time and multiplex RT-PCR. Three forward primers were designed, one primer each from the exon 1 of 6.1 and 6.2 Kb transcripts and the third primer designed from the exon 4 of 7.6 Kb transcript, which is also common to 2.1 Kb transcript. The 6.1 and 6.2 Kb transcript specific forward primers were combined with a reverse primer designed from exon 2 and the 7.6 Kb transcript specific forward primer was combined with a reverse primer specific to exon 4 of 6.1 Kb transcript, respectively. PCR primers were designed using the Gene Fisher-version 2 software (Bielefeld University Bioinformatics Service, Bielefeld, Germany) for quantification of the various isoform variants (listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Absolute quantification of the transcripts was performed in an iCyclerIQ (Biorad, ON, Canada). Each reaction mix contained SYBR Green (Sigma S9430), Fluorescein calibration dye (Biorad, 170-8780) and 200 nM of each primer, 200 nM dNTP solutions, 1 &#x000d7; Reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.5 U Taq polymerase. The thermal cycling conditions were: 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 62&#x000b0;-65&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s. In order to determine the absolute copy number of target transcripts, Dlc1 isoforms (6.1, 6.2 and 7.6 Kb) and GAPDH cDNAs were amplified using specific primer sets as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The purified PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T easy vector system and the plasmid DNA was used to generate calibration curves, which also permitted evaluation of PCR efficiencies using the formula <italic>E </italic>= 10<sup>[-1/slope]</sup>. The efficiency of amplification was checked for all targets by performing a series of serial dilutions of template for each primer pair in triplicate. Real time PCR data quality control calculations were run on the SAS program as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The E value varied from -2.05 to -3.4 which represents an acceptable PCR efficiency between 90%-95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Quantitative RT- PCRs were then conducted for different mouse tissue samples, and the specificity of each amplified product was confirmed by the melting curve analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Results were expressed as copy number of specific isoforms per 1000 copies of GAPDH cDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>For multiplex PCR, we used two different strategies. First, the different isoforms were quantified relative to GAPDH internal standard and second, all the splice variants were quantified to the corresponding fusion transcript that was generated by fusion to the &#x003b2;geo gene, which is part of the gene trap insertion. Relative expression of cDNA equivalent of 400 ng total RNA was quantified using two sets of primers in the same PCR reaction; one set specific to the Dlc1 isoform and the other set specific to either the GAPDH gene or to the &#x003b2;geo fusion cDNA. The PCR products were run in a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>scratch assay</title><p>Cell migration rates of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous cell lines were compared by an <italic>in vitro </italic>scratch assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Prior to the migration experiments, 60 mm cell culture plates were incubated for 4 h with 10 mg/mL fibronectin in Alpha-MEM. Coated dishes were blocked with 3 mL of 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Then, excess fibronectin was removed by washing with PBS and dishes were refilled with 3-5 mL of media before plating the cells. The wild type, heterozygous and homozygous fibroblast batches were seeded onto the fibronectin coated plates and cultured until confluent. After reaching confluency, the cell monolayer was scratched with a p200 pipette tip in two diagonal lines. The cell debris was removed and the edge of the scratch was smoothened by washing the cells once with 1 mL of the growth medium and then replaced with 5 mL of medium and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 18 h. In order to obtain the same field during the image acquisition, reference points were created by marking the underneath of the dish with a fine pointed marker using a stereo-microscope. Subsequent photographs of the scratches were taken at 0, 6 and 18 h time intervals using a phase contrast microscope. We quantified the cell migration rate by determining the total area that the MEF cells moved from the edge of the scratch toward the center of the scratch during 0-6 h and 6-18 h of incubation following the creation of the wound in terms of pixels calculated manually using the Image J 1.38&#x000d7; public domain software (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation study of the Dlc1 promoter region</title><p>Chromosomal DNA was isolated from different mouse tissues by standard phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].
