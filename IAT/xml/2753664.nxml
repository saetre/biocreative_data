Two L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers&#x02014;verapamil and diltiazem&#x02014;have been reported to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding, trafficking, and activity of GCase in human Gaucher disease fibroblasts. Similarly, these LTCC blockers were tested with cultured skin fibroblasts from homozygous point-mutated GCase mice (V394L, D409H, D409V, and N370S) with the effect of enhancing of GCase activity. Correspondingly, diltiazem increased GCase protein and facilitated GCase trafficking to the lysosomes of these cells. The <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of diltiazem on GCase were evaluated in mice homozygous wild-type (WT), V394L and D409H. In D409H homozygotes diltiazem (10 mg/kg/d via drinking water or 50&#x02013;200 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) had minor effects on increasing GCase activity in brain and liver (1.2-fold). Diltiazem treatment (10 mg/kg/d) had essentially no effect on WT and V394L GCase protein or activity levels (&#x0003c;1.2-fold) in liver. These results show that LTCC blockers had the <italic>ex vivo</italic> effects of increasing GCase activity and protein in the mouse fibroblasts, but these effects did not translate into similar changes <italic>in vivo</italic> even at very high drug doses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deficiency of GCase leads to accumulation of its substrates, glucosylceramide (GC) and glucosylsphingosine (GS), and the resultant visceral and CNS phenotypes in Gaucher disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Beutler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Grabowski1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Curiously, the WT GCase activity in saposin C-deficient cells was increased by LTCC blockers. As one of its functions saposin C protects GCase from protease degradation in the lysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the inability of macromolecules, like enzymes, to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient amounts so to alter the CNS lysosomal storage has led to the search for alternative methods of treatment. Several small molecules have been the focus of interest, because they penetrate the BBB, modulate protein folding, and/or trafficking of endogenous mutant enzymes, e.g., GCase, to the lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Mu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Lieberman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

The therapeutic effects of these &#x0201c;chaperones&#x0201d; have not been tested in animal models with residual mutant GCase activity/protein to provide a physiological foundation for their potential clinical significance. Here, cells and tissues from our point-mutated GCase mouse models of GCase defective function were tested using LTCC blockers as potential therapeutic drugs. As shown in this study, diltiazem enhanced the activity and lysosomal trafficking of GCase in cultured fibroblasts from point mutated mice. <italic>In vivo</italic>, diltiazem had little if any effect on GCase activity or protein in WT and V394L mice. D409H fibroblasts had 1.8-fold enhancement of GCase activity by diltiazem. In D409H homozygous mice, the mutant GCase activity increase (&#x0223c;1.2-fold) was not dose-dependent. This may be due to diltiazem having reached maximal effect <italic>in vivo</italic> at the lowest dose.</p><p>Thus, there is a discrepancy between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> effects of diltiazem on GCase. The factors that contribute to these differential drug effects may include the effect of LTCC blockers on dividing (fibroblasts) versus non-dividing cells (neuron), the penetration efficiency of the drug into the ER (or lysosomes) in organs versus the cultured cells, and the distribution of LTCCs in different cell types and organs. The variation in expression of LTCCs on the membranes of microglial cells and macrophages is also impacted by various cellular states and microenvironments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007320-Eder1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the use of LTCC blockers up to toxic doses in mice with such GCase mutations appears ineffective in significantly altering the mutant GCase activity or protein, suggesting that the LTCC blockers tested here would have no place in the treatment of individuals with Gaucher disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The mice were maintained in microisolators in accordance with institutional guidelines under IACUC approval at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell culture and drug treatment</title><p>The mouse fibroblasts were derived from WT and point-mutated GCase mice including homozygotes for V394L, D409H, and N370S, the compound heterozygous D409V/N370S, homozygous selective saposin C deficiency (C&#x02212;/&#x02212;), and combined homozygotes for V394L and saposin C deficiency (4L;C&#x0002a;).
