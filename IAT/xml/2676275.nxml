Humans have about 235 functional homeobox genes that have been categorized into 11 major classes representing 102 families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The ANTP (Antennapedia) class contains the highly studied HOX-like (HOXL) subclass of genes that are best known for their roles in specifying body plan organization from flies to mammals. Also well studied is the PAX gene family within the PRD (Paired) class, which generally functions to link spatial determination with lineage specification and differentiation. Mutations in genes from these and other classes have been linked to various human congenital disorders, including synpolydactyly, optic nerve colobomata, renal anomalies, mental retardation, Waardenburg's syndrome, neurological disorders, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The H6 homeobox genes <italic>Hmx1</italic>, <italic>Hmx2</italic>, and <italic>Hmx3 </italic>(also known as <italic>Nkx5-3</italic>; <italic>Nkx5-2 </italic>and <italic>Nkx5-1</italic>, respectively), compose a family within the NKL subclass of the ANTP class of homeobox genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hmx gene family expression is primarily limited to sensory organs, branchial (pharyngeal) arches, and the rostral part of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Mouse <italic>Hmx2 </italic>and <italic>Hmx3 </italic>have identical expression patterns in the developing CNS and inner ear, except that in the latter, <italic>Hmx3 </italic>transcription in the otic epithelium initiates slightly earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Targeted mutation of either gene in mice disrupts the vestibular system. Mutation of <italic>Hmx3 </italic>causes complete loss of the horizontal semicircular canal cristae and fusion of the utricle and saccule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Ablation of <italic>Hmx2 </italic>is more severe, disrupting overall inner ear morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Absence of both <italic>Hmx2 </italic>and <italic>Hmx3 </italic>results in loss of the entire vestibular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overall, the data suggest that these 2 genes have functional redundancy in those compartments of the inner ear in which expression overlaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, epistasis analysis indicates that these genes have interchangeable function in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, demonstrating redundancy at the protein level. Their tandem organization on mouse Chr 7 and overlapping expression patterns raise the possibility that <italic>Hmx1 </italic>and <italic>Hmx2 </italic>share regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The third member of the Hmx family, <italic>Hmx1</italic>, is located on Chr 5. It may have separated from the ancestral paralog of <italic>Hmx2/3 </italic>by a translocation event early in the vertebrate lineage.</p><p>Paralleling its sequence divergence and long-term physical separation from its paralogs, <italic>Hmx1 </italic>has a distinct expression pattern in neural crest derivatives. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization studies found that at e10.5, <italic>Hmx1 </italic>is expressed in the eye, trigeminal cranial nerve, caudal-ventral region of the second branchial arch, sympathetic nerve ganglia, and dorsal root ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is high expression in the neural retina and ear pinna. The expression patterns led Yoshiura et al to hypothesize the <italic>Hmx1 </italic>deficiency would lead to craniofacial, eye, and external ear defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, a mutation in <italic>HMX1 </italic>(<italic>NKX5-3</italic>) was found to be responsible for Oculo-Auricular syndrome in three members of a consanguinous family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In previous work, a semilethal mutation called <italic>dumbo </italic>was isolated in phenotype-driven screen for ENU-induced mutations on proximal mouse Chr 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Affected animals exhibited laterally protruding ears that engendered the mutation's name. Here, we report that mutations in the homeobox-containing gene <italic>Hmx1 </italic>are responsible for the dumbo phenotype. Furthermore, we characterize effects of the mutation on postnatal growth, cranial development, the eye, and pre/perinatal lethality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of dumbo phenotype</title><p>As Wilson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] previously reported within their supplemental data, dumbo (<italic>dmbo</italic>) homozygotes display laterally-protruding ears (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;d</xref>). To further assess skeletal anatomy, alcian blue/alizarin red staining of newborn skulls was performed. Comparison of mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f, h</xref>) to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e, g</xref>) revealed only minor differences. All dumbo mice (N = 9 vs. 6 controls) exhibited hyperplasia of the gonial bone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref>), which in some cases extended rostrally to underlie the caudal border of the lamina obturans (middle portion of the future alisphenoid). The nearby proximal mandibular (Meckel's) cartilage, malleus, and tympanic ring (ectotympanum) were normal, as were the other middle ear ossicles. The size and position of the external acoustic meatus were normal in all animals examined.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dumbo ear and cranial malformations</bold>. Control (a, c) and dumbo (b, d) live mouse images. Note ventrolateral displacement of ear pinnae in the mutant. Image analysis of dissected control and dumbo pinnae revealed no difference in overall surface area, but the mutant ears were less concave, giving the impression of a larger area (data not shown). Most dumbo mice exhibit microphthalmia, as is evident in these images. Lateral (e, f) and dorsal (g, h) views of bone/cartilage skull preps. The calvaria was removed for the dorsal views. Compared to heterozygous controls (e), dumbo skulls (f) show malformations of the squamous temporal bone ("st"; the asterisk marks a region where dumbo mice exhibit an extra notch). Hyperplasia of the gonial bone ("gn") is evident in mutants (f, h) vs controls (e, g). rtp = retrotympanic process; MC = Meckel's cartilage; ma = malleus; tmp = ectotympanic.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-27-1"/></fig><p>The retrotympanic process of the squamous temporal bone was also enlarged. Immediately dorsal to this process in normal mice is a deep concave notch (asterisk, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). In 8/9 <italic>dmbo </italic>homozygotes, this caudal border of the squamous temporal bone had either two smaller notches (N = 3; asterisks, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>), or other deformations of this region such an abnormally small notch (not shown). No defects in branchial arch's two skeletal structures, including the stapes, were detected.</p><p>In addition to the displaced ear pinnae, dumbo homozygotes appear smaller than their heterozygous littermates. To quantify this difference and determine its onset, <italic>dmbo/Rw </italic>heterozygotes were intercrossed, and the weights of progeny were recorded daily for 7&#x02013;8 days beginning at postnatal day 3. <italic>Rw </italic>is a recessive lethal inversion with a dominant white spotting phenotype, allowing visual detection of genotypes from 3 days of age. It also serves as a balancer that prevents recombination between the <italic>Dmbo</italic>-containing chromosomes and the corresponding ~30 MB region spanned by <italic>Rw</italic>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, male homozygotes weighed about 50% less than heterozygotes at day 3, and continued to lag through day 9. Females were also smaller, but to a lesser degree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). To explore whether the weight differences were due to the mutants being outcompeted by their wild-type siblings for access to the mother, we also weighed animals produce by intercrosses of homozygotes (<italic>dmbo/dmbo</italic>). These animals had weights similar to the homozygotes produced from het &#x000d7; het intercrosses (data not shown), indicating that the reduced weight is an intrinsic characteristic. Whole animal necropsies of adults showed no recognizable differences between mutant and wild type mice, including the intestinal tract (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Decreased body mass of dumbo mice after birth</bold>. The error bars represent standard error of the mean.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-27-2"/></fig><p>Breeding data of congenic animals confirmed the qualitative findings of Wilson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that <italic>dmbo </italic>is semilethal. Litters produced in <italic>dmbo/Rw </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>crosses had 41% fewer <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>animals at three weeks of age (time of wean) than expected for Mendelian transmission (42 <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>of 142 total offspring from 33 litters; Chi<sup>2 </sup>= 23.7, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). To determine if the loss of homozygotes occurred pre- or postnatally, we mated <italic>dmbo/Rw </italic>to <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>animals and monitored 11 litters during the first three days post-partum. Twelve of the 65 pups in these litters were found dead and 3 additional pups went missing. These 3 were eliminated from statistical analyses since their genotypes were unknown. Eleven of the 12 mice that died were genotyped as being <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>(Chi<sup>2 </sup>= 8.33; P = 0.004). These data show that dumbo mice are much more likely to die prematurely than their unaffected littermates, and suggests that the shortfall of <italic>dmbo/dmbo </italic>at wean is probably due to peri- or postnatal lethality rather than embryonic lethality. To identify possible visible defects at birth, 3 litters produced from homozygous dumbo parents were observed either at the time of delivery or shortly thereafter. Seven of the 24 pups (29%) were born dead, of which 6 displayed exencephaly.</p></sec><sec><title>Positional cloning reveals that dumbo is an allele of <italic>Hmx1</italic></title><p>A combination of deletion and recombination mapping was used to map the dumbo mutation.

Sequence analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) of multiple dumbo mutants and heterozygotes revealed a C&#x02192;T mutation corresponding to amino acid 193, changing GLU65 to an amber stop codon (CAG&#x02192;UAG). Accordingly to mouse nomenclature, we now refer to this mutant allele as <italic>Hmx1</italic><sup><italic>dmbo</italic></sup>.</p><p>Confirmation that the <italic>Hmx1 </italic>mutation was causative for the dumbo phenotype came from complementation analyses with a spontaneous mutant called "misplaced ears" (<italic>mpe)</italic>, which arose in a C3H/HeJ colony of mice at The Jackson Laboratory.

Otherwise the eyes were clinically normal; specifically, no evidence of microcornea, anterior segment dysgenesis, cataract, colobomata, retinal dysplasia or retinal detachment was detected.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The skeletal analyses we performed suggest a possible basis for the external ear phenotype of dumbo mice. The major defects we noted were enlargement of the gonium (gonial bone) and malformations of the caudal border of the squamous temporal bone. Both are in proximity to the external ear, and thus may influence the situation of the pinna, although the position of the external acoustic meatus was unchanged. Alternatively, as predicted by Yoshiura et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the expression of <italic>Hmx1 </italic>in the pinna itself might be entirely responsible for the dysmorphology. If this is the case, then the consequences of the bone malformations remain uncertain. It is possible that the phenotype is a consequence of these combined factors.</p><p>The gonium forms by intramembranous ossification and helps anchor the malleus to tympanic ring, which later forms the outer wall of the middle ear. While many mutations cause dysmorphologies of the middle ear ossicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we are unaware of mouse mutations that specifically cause an absence of the gonium. A <italic>Bapx1 </italic>knockout causes loss of the gonium along with hypoplasia of the tympanic ring. It also causes perinatal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inactivation of only one copy of <italic>Bapx1 </italic>produces hypoplasia of the gonium but no detectable middle-ear phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Null mutations of <italic>Dlx5 </italic>and <italic>Dlx6 </italic>both cause the formation of an ectopic cartilaginous and intramembranous skeletal bridge that originates from the proximal mandibular (Meckel's) cartilage, at its junction with the malleus and extends medially to the pterygoid bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This bridge may partially or fully incorporate the gonial bone, which is often hypertrophic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Reflecting their expression in all branchial arches, these mutations also cause growth reductions and dysmorphologies in the upper and lower jaws.</p><p>There is at present no obvious connection between the two morphological lesions that excludes effects on other nearby skeletal structures. Both the gonial and squamosal temporal bones arise within the proximal (dorsal) neural crest-derived mesenchyme of the first branchial arch. The precise location of these primordia relative to other first arch-derived otic structures has not been mapped in mammalian embryos. However, based on their homologies with structures in avian/reptilian species, one would surmise that the progenitors of the malleus and incus are interposed between those of the squamous temporal and gonial bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies suggested that the range of sound frequencies detectible by various species is related to the gonium-mediated degree of fusion between the malleus and the tympanic bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since <italic>Hmx1</italic><sup><italic>dmbo </italic></sup>causes hyperplasia of the gonium, we considered it possible that the range of detectable frequencies may be altered in these animals. However, the ABR data revealed no anomalies in hearing acuity across the frequency spectrum tested (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Like dumbo mice, people with an <italic>Hmx1 </italic>mutation were found to have normal audiograms and vestibular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>At present, we do not understand the basis for the substantial perinatal lethality and reduced body mass of <italic>Hmx1 </italic>mutant mice, or if these two phenotypes are related. The RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization studies revealed that the absence of functional HMX1 in dumbo embryos did not noticeably alter the level of <italic>Hmx1 </italic>transcription or perturb the developing structures in which <italic>Hmx1 </italic>is expressed during embryogenesis up to e10.5, suggesting that developmental homeostasis of these structures was not markedly disrupted. The smaller size of mutant mice and the observation (in one experiment) that 6/7 dumbo animals found dead at birth were exencephalic, are suggestive of a possible defect in cell proliferation at particular developmental stages or compartments. Interesting, mutation of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>Hmx ortholog, Mls-2, causes decreased proliferation and aberrant cell fate specification in the postembryonic mesodermal ("M") lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As a homeodomain-containing protein that likely acts as a transcription factor, a key step in understanding the function of HMX1 will be to identify its gene targets in affected cell types.</p><p>Mutation of <italic>HMX1 </italic>(<italic>NKX-5</italic>) in humans causes an Oculo-Auricular syndrome. Dumbo mice substantially recapitulate the phenotypes of the three known human patients. As in mice, the human patients have external ear phenotype lobule deformations and aplasia. It is interesting to speculate whether polymorphisms in <italic>HMX1</italic>/<italic>NKX-5 </italic>might be related to variations in external ear phenotypes. Additionally, while none of the three human patients had other overt dysmorphologies, one had spina bifida occulta, which might be construed as a mild manifestation of the exencephalic dumbo pups we observed at birth.</p><p>Although <italic>Hmx1 </italic>is expressed in the eye lens and retina during development, and the HMX1-deficient humans have a variety of ocular defects (microcornea, microphthalmia, anterior-segment dysgenesis, cataract, colobomata, abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rod-cone dystrophy) the defects in mice appear restricted to microphthalmia. Interestingly, morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish ortholog was found to cause microphthalmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The basis for the species differences might yield insight into the etiology of the human disorder. It is also important to note that strain background may influence the microphthalmia, since this phenotype was not as prevalent during early maintenance of dumbo mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is possible that genetic heterogeneity also affects the severity of endophenotypes in HMX1-deficient humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In mice, mutation of <italic>Hmx1 </italic>yields the distinguishing feature of ventrolateral displacement of ears, giving the appearance of its Disney character namesake. While the expression pattern of <italic>Hmx1 </italic>correlates with the ontology of defects in the ear pinnae, gonium, and squamous temporal bones, the relationship to semilethality and reduced body mass warrants further investigation. Finally, these mice provide the first model for a particular human Oculo-Auricular syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mapping of dumbo to the <italic>Hmx1 </italic>locus</title><p>The <italic>Hmx1</italic><sup><italic>dmbo </italic></sup>allele was induced by ENU mutagenesis of C57BL/6 (B6) inbred mice.
