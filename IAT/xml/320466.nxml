The two SOD-1 mRNAs are transcribed from the same gene and the major 0.7 Kb. species is approximately four times more abundant than the minor 0.9 Kb. mRNA. These two mRNAs differ in the length of their 3'-untranslated region and both have multiple 5'-ends. The longer transcript contains 222 additional nucleotides beyond the 3'-polyadenylated terminus of the short mRNA. S1 nuclease mapping and sequence analysis showed that these extra 222 nucleotides are specified by sequences contiguous to those shared by the two SOD-1 mRNAs. The 5'-termini of the two SOD-1 mRNAs were identified and mapped by both primer extension and S1 mapping. The majority of SOD-1 mRNA molecules (90-95%) have a 5'-start site located 23 base pairs (b.p.) downstream of the hexanucleotide -TATAAA-. The rest of the SOD-1 mRNA molecules have 5'-termini 30, 50 and 65 b.p. upstream from the major start region.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0131-a" xlink:role="9352"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0133-a" xlink:role="9354"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0135-a" xlink:role="9356"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0137-a" xlink:role="9358"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0138-a" xlink:role="9359"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9349"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9350"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9351"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9352"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9353"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9354"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9355"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9356"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9357"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9358"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9360"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9361"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9362"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9363"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9364"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9365"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
