Although there is evidence that pancreatic progenitor cells exist around duct, whether non-&#x003b2; cells in the islet could also potentially contribute to &#x003b2; cell regeneration in vivo is still controversial. Here, we developed a novel transgenic mouse model to study the pancreatic &#x003b2; cell regeneration, which could specifically inhibit &#x003b2; cell proliferation by overexpressing <italic>p21</italic><sup>cip</sup> in &#x003b2; cells via regulation of the Tet-on system. We discovered that <italic>p21</italic> overexpression could inhibit &#x003b2;-cell duplication in the transgenic mice and these mice would gradually suffer from hyperglycemia. Importantly, the recovery efficiency of the <italic>p21</italic>-overexpressing mice from streptozotocin-induced diabetes was significantly higher than control mice, which is embodied by better physiological quality and earlier emergence of insulin expressing cells. Furthermore, in the islets of these streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice, we found a large population of proliferating cells which expressed pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) but not markers of terminally differentiated cells. Transcription factors characteristic of early pancreatic development, such as <italic>Nkx2.2</italic> and <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, and pancreatic progenitor markers, such as Ngn3 and c-Met, could also be detected in these islets. Thus, our work showed for the first time that when &#x003b2; cell self-duplication is repressed by <italic>p21</italic> overexpression, the markers for embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells could be detected in islets, which might contribute to the recovery of these transgenic mice from streptozotocin-induced diabetes. These discoveries could be important for exploring new diabetes therapies that directly promote the regeneration of pancreatic progenitors to differentiate into islet &#x003b2; cells in vivo.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, one of the most critical pathogeneses is that the number of functional &#x003b2; cells is inadequate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008344-Weir1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.
