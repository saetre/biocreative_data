They were termed MRP-L8 and MRP-L20, respectively, and their nucleotide sequences were determined using a DNA sequencer. The MRP-L8 gene was found to encode a 26.8-kDa protein whose deduced amino acid sequence has a high degree of similarity to ribosomal protein L17 of Escherichia coli. The gene MRP-L20 was found to encode a 22.3-kDa protein with a presequence consisting of 18 amino acid residues. By Southern blot hybridization to the yeast chromosomes separated by field-inversion gel electrophoresis, the MRP-L8 and MRP-L20 genes were located on chromosomes X and XI, respectively. Gene disruption experiments indicate that their products, YmL8 and YmL20 proteins, are essential for the mitochondrial function and the absence of these proteins causes instability of the mitochondrial DNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0190-a" xlink:role="1526"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0191-a" xlink:role="1527"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1521"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1522"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1525"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1526"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00190-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1529"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
