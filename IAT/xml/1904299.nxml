Loss of this checkpoint control results in chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. The transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle regulated human BUB1B gene, which encodes BubR1, was investigated in this report. A minimal BUB1B gene promoter containing 464&#x02009;bp upstream from the translation initiation codon was sufficient for cell cycle regulated promoter activity. A pivotal role for transcription factor hStaf/ZNF143 in the expression of the BUB1B gene was demonstrated through gel retardation assays, transient expression of mutant BUB1B promoter&#x02013;reporter gene constructs and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Two phylogenetically conserved hStaf/ZNF143-binding sites (SBS) were identified which are indispensable for BUB1B promoter activity. In addition, we found that the domain covering the transcription start sites contains conserved boxes homologous to initiator (Inr), cell cycle dependent (CDE) and cell cycle genes homology regions (CHR) elements. Mutations within the CDE and CHR elements led to diminished cell cycle regulation of BUB1B transcription. These results demonstrate that BUB1B gene transcription is positively regulated by hStaf/ZNF143, a ubiquitously expressed factor, and that the CDE-CHR tandem element was essential for G2/M-specific transcription of the BUB1B gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The spindle checkpoint functions to prevent premature anaphase entry until all chromosomes have completely aligned at the metaphase plate. BubR1 is a key protein mediating spindle-checkpoint activation during which it is phosphorylated. A loss of spindle-checkpoint function inevitably results in chromosomal instability and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Given that aneuploidy is prevalent in many types of cancers, it is believed that spindle-checkpoint failure may be at least partly responsible for the development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Mouse genetics study showed also that haplo-insufficiency of BubR1 resulted in enhanced genomic instability and development of lung and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In synchronized cells, expression of the BUB1B gene, which encodes BubR1, is undetectable in G1 but it peaks in G2/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This cell cycle dependent expression explains the tissue distribution and the abundance of BubR1 mRNA in cells with a high mitotic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this work, which represents the first report concerning the regulation of BUB1B gene expression, we localized the promoter of this gene to positions &#x02212;464/&#x02212;107 relative to the translation initiation codon. We found that the BUB1B promoter contains three positively <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs: one Inr-like motif and two elements recognized by the hStaf/ZNF143 transcription factor. This factor can up-regulate the BUB1B promoter activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the endogenous hStaf/ZNF143 is bound to the BUB1B promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ZNF143 protein is the human ortholog of Staf, the Xenopus selenocysteine tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The human Staf (hStaf/ZNF143) is a seven C2-H2 zinc finger protein capable of enhancing transcription of the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> but also of the snRNA and snRNA-type genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). hStaf/ZNF143 can also stimulate transcription from an mRNA-type pol II promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To date, only seven protein-coding genes have been described to be regulated by hStaf/ZNF143: the cytosolic chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); the interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>); the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>); the transaldolase (TALDO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); the aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S11 (MRPS11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and the synaptobrevin-like 1 (SYBL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, vertebrates contain the ZNF76 protein which constitutes a ZNF143 paralog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). ZNF76 and ZNF143 are basically considered to play the same role even though their relative expression levels differ in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, recent results suggested that ZNF76 functions as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with TBP and that sumoylation modulates its transcriptional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Very recently, genome-wide analysis led us to identify 1175 hStaf/ZNF143-binding sites distributed in 938 mammalian promoters in protein-coding genes. By extrapolating these values to the full sizes of the genomes, we can infer the existence of at least 2500 Staf-binding sites (SBS) distributed in 2000 promoters. This large number suggests that the SBS constitutes one of the most widespread transcription factor binding sites in mammalian promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>In G1/S, the transcriptional repression of many genes such as CDC25C, CDC2, CCNA2 (coding for cyclin A), PLK1 (polo-like kinase) and RB6K (rabkinesine 6) is regulated by two repressor elements known as CDE (cell cycle dependent element) and CHR (cell cycle genes homology region). In these genes, mutation of the CDE and CHR elements allowed elevated transcription during G1 and the consequent loss of cell cycle regulated expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that the cell cycle regulation of BUB1B gene transcription is also achieved through the presence of two elements homologous to the repressor elements CDE and CHR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reporter constructs and expression vectors</title><p>The human BUB1B promoter fragment &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;31 was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using direct and reverse primers incorporating SacI and BamHI sites, respectively.

In this report, promoter numbering starts from the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon. The TSS region is located between positions &#x02212;198 and &#x02212;124, with a major transcription start site at &#x02212;178 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). To identify the regions responsible for transcriptional regulation of BUB1B, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with several luciferase reporter constructs containing progressively deleted 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of the BUB1B gene and then measured the luciferase activity of the resulting cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). The parental construct &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;31 contains the region &#x02212;198/&#x02212;124 covering the transcription start sites. A deletion from &#x02212;1185 to &#x02212;586 resulted in &#x0223c;5-fold decrease of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare constructs &#x02212;864/&#x02212;31 and &#x02212;585/&#x02212;31 with &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;31). Further deletions from &#x02212;584 to &#x02212;306 did not significantly affect the transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare the activity of constructs &#x02212;464/&#x02212;31, &#x02212;314/&#x02212;31 and &#x02212;305/&#x02212;31 with construct &#x02212;585/&#x02212;31). An additional deletion to &#x02212;237 resulted in &#x0223c;10-fold decrease of activity. Strikingly, a further deletion to &#x02212;107 created a construct unable to drive transcription of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare &#x02212;236/&#x02212;31, &#x02212;107/&#x02212;31 and the empty vector Luc with &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;31). We concluded from the luciferase assays that transcription of the BUB1B gene was positively regulated by two regions, one located between &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;585 and the other between &#x02212;305/&#x02212;107. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Identification of the human BUB1B gene promoter and mutation analysis of promoter elements.

In addition, a long-terminal repeat sequence (LTR) is present upstream of the mouse and rat BUB1B genes. Computational analysis of the &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;585 region with the Matinspector software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) did not reveal the presence of interspecies conserved sequences for transcription factor binding sites. Upon computational analysis of the first 464&#x02009;bp of the BUB1B promoter, no TATA box could be found in the vicinity of the transcription start site. The main transcription start site at &#x02212;178 is likely to function as an initiator region (Inr) since the sequence TTAAATT located at positions &#x02212;180 to &#x02212;174 is very similar to the Inr consensus sequence YYAN(T/A)YY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). No downstream promoter element (DPE) was found at proximity of the main transcription start site. Interestingly, however, two consensus binding sites for the transcription factor hStaf/ZNF143 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) were found in the region &#x02212;305/&#x02212;107 which positively regulates BUB1B gene expression. They are called hereafter SBS for simplicity's sake. The first SBS1, located at positions &#x02212;305/&#x02212;288, and the second SBS2&#x02009;at positions &#x02212;256/&#x02212;239, were found to be interspecies conserved at 72 and 88%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, the 18-bp SBS1 and SBS2 were aligned with the sequence of the human tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> SBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and with the consensus sequences determined by binding site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Immediately, upstream of the two SBS is found an interspecies conserved 7&#x02009;bp ACTACAA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), which does not correspond to any binding site for known transcription factors. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows that the &#x02212;305/&#x02212;107 region contains blocks of high sequence identity to the CHR (positions &#x02212;174/&#x02212;170) and the CDE (positions &#x02212;165/&#x02212;161) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These elements are known to be involved in the cell cycle regulated transcriptional repression of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B36 B37 B38 B39">24&#x02013;26,36&#x02013;39</xref>). In the promoter of these genes, the CDE is generally adjacent to or 1&#x02013;5&#x02009;bp upstream of the CHR element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). This contrasts with the BUB1B promoter where the CDE homologous motif precedes the CHR by 4&#x02009;bp. Finally, the upstream 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the BUB1B gene contains one CpG island extending from &#x02212;415 to &#x02212;50. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Cross-species conservation of putative promoter elements in the promoter regions of BUB1B homologous genes.

To do this, the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA fragment (&#x02212;342/&#x02212;196) encompassing the two putative SBS (probe I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) was incubated with increasing amounts of the purified hStaf/ZNF143 DNA-binding domain (hStaf/ZNF143 DBD). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A shows that the hStaf/ZNF143 DBD bound with high yield to the BUB1B promoter. Increasing amounts of the protein generated two retarded complexes (C1 and C2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare lane 1 with lanes 2&#x02013;5). The C1 and C2 complexes were specific because they were competed out by an excess of unlabeled SBS of the Xenopus tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 6) but not of an unrelated oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 7). We next examined the binding capacities of the hStaf/ZNF143 DBD to a BUB1B promoter carrying alterations in the SBS. Three mutant versions of the BUB1B promoter were engineered. In mSBS1, the CCCA sequence at positions 3&#x02013;6 of SBS1 was replaced by AAAC; the same mutation was introduced in the SBS2 sequence to yield mSBS2. The mSBS1-2 construct combined both mutations simultaneously. It appeared that formation of the retarded complexes was strictly dependent on the SBS integrity. Indeed, whereas mSBS1 and mSBS2 enabled formation of one single retarded complex only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, compare lanes 5&#x02013;7), the simultaneous presence of both mutations in mSBS1-2 completely abrogated DBD binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 8). The binding to wild-type or mutant BUB1B promoter of the full-length hStaf/ZNF143, produced from programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate, was further evaluated. As observed with the DBD, increasing amounts of protein generated the characteristic C1 and C2 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3) which are specific since they disappear in the presence of an excess of the wt SBS but not with an unspecific competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). This binding pattern is strictly dependent on the SBS integrity because the combined presence of the mSBS1 and mSBS2 mutation totally abrogated hStaf/ZNF143 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 7). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>hStaf/ZNF143-binding assays on wild-type and mutant versions of the BUB1B promoter.

In such an experiment, we expect finding one single complex with each of the probe. This was effectively the case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D (lanes 2 and 10). The specificity of binding was attested by the competition obtained with an unlabeled hStaf/ZNF143 consensus oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 3, 4, 11) but not with an unrelated unlabeled oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 5, 6, 12). The presence of hStaf/ZNF143 in the complex was assessed by the displacement of the complexes observed with an anti-hStaf/ZNF143 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 7 and 13) but not with a pre-immune antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lanes 8 and 14). To further validate these findings, the association of hStaf/ZNF143 to the human BUB1B promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> was investigated with the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). Chromatin, formaldehyde cross-linked with sheared DNA 0.5&#x02013;1&#x02009;kbp in length, was prepared from HeLa cells and incubated with an antipeptide antibody directed against the C-terminal part of hStaf/ZNF143 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) or with a control pre-immune antibody. The recovered DNA was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR with primers spanning the SBS of the BUB1B promoter (test sequence) or a region located 2.5&#x02009;kbp upstream of it (control sequence). The analysis was performed with two dilutions of the DNA obtained from anti-hStaf/ZNF143 and pre-immune ChIP. We also tested a serial dilution of the input material to demonstrate that the PCR was quantitative within a linear range of concentration. A specific signal, absent with the pre-immune antibody, was obtained with the DNA immunoprecipitated with the hStaf/ZNF143 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, compare lanes 1, 2 and 3, 4 of the test). In contrast, no specific signal could be obtained with the control primer pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4 in the control). As an additional control, the same DNA samples were used to show the binding of hStaf/ZNF143 to the human tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene promoter, known to be targeted by hStaf/ZNF143 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). As expected, a specific signal was obtained only for the PCR reaction using the DNA immunoprecipitated with hStaf/ZNF143 and performed with the test primer pair (compare lanes 2 and 3 of the test and control reactions).

The mutant constructs were then transfected into COS-7 cells and promoter activities were reported by the luciferase activity. Mutation of the SBS1 and SBS2 resulted in a slight decrease to 78 and 61% of the wild-type level, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The simultaneous mutation, however, induced a much more pronounced effect since the activity dropped to 19% of the wt level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), indicating that SBS1 and SBS2 are of prime importance to BUB1B promoter activity. We also observed that the TTAAATT sequence (positions &#x02212;180 to &#x02212;174) is very similar to the Inr consensus sequence YYAN(T/A)YY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). To test the functional importance of this interspecies conserved motif, the TTAAATT sequence was changed to TTCCCTT. The activity of the luciferase reporter decreased to 49% of the wild-type level (mInr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

This model offers the advantage to lack many of the homologs to vertebrate transcription factors, in particular ZNF143 and ZNF76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, effectors for ZNF143 (pPac-hStaf/ZNF143), ZNF76 (pPac-ZNF76) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the empty vector pPac under the control of SL2-specific promoter, were co-transfected along with the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the wild-type &#x02212;436/&#x02212;31 BUB1B promoter. The effect on promoter activity of varying the intracellular level of ZNF143 or ZNF76 was assessed by introduction of increasing amounts of the expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Expression from the pPac-hStaf/ZNF143 or pPac-ZNF76 expression vectors was confirmed by gel retardation assays with SL2 extracts and probe II containing SBS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). No binding was observed with extracts from untransfected or empty-pPac transfected SL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, increasing the amount of expression vectors in the transfection led to higher yield of retarded complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lane 1 with lanes 4&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;9). As ZNF143 and ZNF76 recognize a same DNA motif with identical affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), the yield of the complexes is a gauge of the expression of hStaf/ZNF143 and ZNF76 in SL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;9). In these assays, the luciferase activity in cells extracts was normalized to the amount of the effector proteins. ZNF143 and ZNF76 exhibited a dose dependent transactivation effect on the &#x02212;464/&#x02212;31 promoter, reaching 24-fold for ZNF143 and 8-fold for ZNF76 compared to the empty vector pPac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

These observations suggest that the two putative <italic>cis</italic>-elements can also function as a G1/S-specific repressor, as previously reported for the G2/M-specific genes. To test the hypothesis, we introduced mutations in the putative CHR and CDE motifs (mCHR and mCDE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).

Drug treatment resulted in the synchronization of at least 85% of the cells in the various phases as determined by propidium iodine staining and flow cytometry (data not shown). The luciferase activity in extracts of cells transfected with the wild-type &#x02212;464/&#x02212;31 and arrested in G1/S was 2.2-fold lower than that from cells arrested in G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and D).

In G2/M arrested cells transfected with the CHR and CDE mutants, however, the measured activities were similar to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and D).

In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the human BUB1B gene. We identified that regions &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;585 and &#x02212;305/&#x02212;107 in the promoter are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the BUB1 gene. Region &#x02212;1185 to &#x02212;585, which performs a positive regulation on BUB1B gene expression, contains two transposable elements. Sequence comparison of the regions homologous to &#x02212;1185/&#x02212;585 in other mammalian genomes did not reveal the presence of conserved transcription factor binding sites. This suggests that the positive regulation is performed by species-specific elements. Similar to other cell cycle regulated genes, the BUB1B promoter does not possess a TATA box and, as a consequence, gives rise to many transcription start sites. We identified five interspecies conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region &#x02212;305 to &#x02212;107, and a trans-acting factor involved in the control of BUB1B gene expression. Three <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs positively regulate transcription and the other two constitute a cell cycle dependent transcriptional repressor. The motif surrounding the major transcription start site is likely to function as an initiator. The other two positively <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs, SBS1 and SBS2, are specifically recognized by hStaf/ZNF143 which itself was found associated to the BUB1B promoter in HeLa cells. Mutations of SBS1 and SBS2, singly or in combination, led to a sharp decrease of reporter activity. Analysis of the BUB1B promoter activity in insect cells demonstrated that hStaf/ZNF143 and ZNF76 can reconstitute BUB1B promoter activity. Although Staf was originally identified as the transcription factor regulating tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene transcription, it also controls snRNA, snRNA-type and mRNA gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">14&#x02013;20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The present study extends the role of hStaf/ZNF143 to BUB1B gene transcription. The two identified SBS1 and SBS2 sites, distant by 31&#x02009;bp, were found associated to the 7&#x02009;bp ACTACAA motif which lies immediately 5&#x02032; to the SBS. This motif, under our conditions, is apparently not involved in transcription activity of the BUB1B promoter since we observed that the 5&#x02032; deletion eliminating the ACTACAA sequence did not affect promoter activity. Scrutiny of the sequences flanking the SBS in snRNA and snRNA-type genes did not reveal the presence of an ACTACAA-associated motif. In contrast, it is found in the SBS characterized in the SYBL1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and in 58% of the SBS that we recently identified by a genome scale analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The finding that the SBS are essential for expression of the BUB1B gene raises the interesting question of whether hStaf/ZNF143, the main activating factor of the Staf family, is involved alone in transcription activation of the BUB1B gene. Alternatively, could ZNF76 also play a role in the expression of this gene? Although the ChIP assay was performed with antibodies recognizing specifically hStaf/ZNF143, this does not exclude the possibility that ZNF76 can also be involved in BUB1B expression.</p><p>The other two <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs that we identified are localized in the region covering the transcription start site and we showed that they function as cell cycle dependent repressor elements. They harbor high identity with the consensus sequences of the CDE (G/CGCGG) and CHR (TTGAA) elements identified in the cell cycle regulated promoter genes such as CDC25, CDC2, CCNA2 (coding for cyclin A), PLK1 (polo-like kinase) and RB6K (rabkinesine 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). These two elements are known to induce repression of transcription and we established that their mutation led to almost complete impairment of the cell cycle dependent transcription activity of the BUB1B promoter. Worth of note, however, the tandem repressor element is organized in the CHR-CDE configuration in the BUB1B gene whereas the arrangement CDE-CHR occurs in all the other identified repressors.</p><p>Careful inspection of the promoter sequences of other genes known to be regulated with a tandem of CDE and CHR repressor elements pointed to the presence of SBS in the promoters of the RBL2 (p130 protein), PLK1 (polo-like kinase protein) and BIRC5 (survivin protein) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Studies on genes that are cell cycle regulated by the CDE-CHR tandem of repressor elements (CDC25C, CDC2 and aurora A) revealed that ubiquitously expressed transcription factors such as Sp1, NF-Y and E4TF1 act positively by binding to target sequences upstream of the CDE-CHR motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The cell cycle dependent repression of upstream activators via the CDE and CHR elements has been established as the major regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). As shown by genomic footprinting on these promoters, both CDE and CHR elements are protected in a periodic fashion, suggesting involvement of a specific factor. A binding activity termed CDF-1 has been identified and proposed to interact with both CDE and CHR in the CDC25C gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In a further work, a factor (CHF) interacting specifically with CHR has been isolated in the CCNA2 gene promoter, encoding cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In the situation described for the CDC25C promoter, it was proposed that CDF-1 presumably functions by specifically repressing the NF-Y mediated activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, no further characterization of the CDF-1 and CHF complexes was undertaken. Recently, a very interesting mechanism was reported to involve the CDE and CHR elements in chromatin remodeling of the CCNA2 promoter. In this case, the CDE-CHR tandem which is needed for repression in quiescent cells, was also demonstrated to be required for organizing the chromatin structure specific for the inactive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, this particular nucleosome organization becomes disorganized as a consequence of mutations in the CDE-CHR repressor element. In the case of the BUB1B promoter, we have clearly demonstrated the functionality of the CDE-CHR tandem as a repressor element, but the precise underlying mechanism remains to be investigated. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the SBS identified in the RBL2, PLK1 and BIRC5 gene promoters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">SBS sequence</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Position</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RBL2 (p130)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCCCCAGCAGCCCGTGCT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;166</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PLK1 (polo-like kinase)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTCCCATGGTGCCGCGCG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;88</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BIRC5 (survivin)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTCCCGGCACACCCCGCG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;111</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BIRC5 (survivin)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTCCCAGAAGGCCGCGGG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;79</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BIRC5 (survivin)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTCCCGACATGCCCCGCG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;35</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to R.
