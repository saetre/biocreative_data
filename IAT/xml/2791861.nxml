However, these two ChoREs are not sufficient to mediate the induction of Txnip expression by glucose or adenosine-containing molecules; and two CCAAT boxes, both of which can recruit nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) to the Txnip promoter, are also required for the induction.

When cold probes with mutations at the CCAAT box (mCAT) or the inverted CCAAT box (miCAT) were used in competition assays, two bands were preserved (arrows, lanes 5 and 13); these two bands were significantly competed by a short cold probe containing ATTGG sequences (sNFY, lanes 6 and 14). These results suggest that both labeled probes (CAT/ChoRE-a and iCAT/ChoRE-b) can at least form three major DNA-protein complexes, one (star) is formed between ChoRE and the MondoA/MLX complex, and the other two (arrows) are formed between CCAAT boxes (CCAAT or inverted CCAAT) and their associated factors.</p><fig id="pone-0008397-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008397.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>EMSAs using two Txnip promoter segments containing ChoRE-a or ChoRE-b.</title><p>(A) the formation of DNA-protein complexes were competed with different cold probes.

Hence, NF-Y and MondoA/MLX might coordinate to maximize the Txnip expression. NF-Y constitutively occupies the Txnip promoter even in glucose-free medium, and this binding might facilitate the Txnip promoter occupancy, in a glucose-dependent manner, by MondoA/MLX. These promoter-bound factors in turn recruit co-activator(s), which set up local epigenetic environment that favors the induction by other signals from, e.g., adenosine-containing molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008397-g010">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>A very recent paper has reported the Txnip promoter dynamics under glucose treatment in INS-1 cells, of pancreatic origin, using ChIP assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008397-ChaMolstad1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. This study shows that, with glucose stimulation, ChREBP can recruit p300 to increase histone acetylation, which in turn enhances recruitment of Pol II to induce the Txnip transcription. Indeed, we found that ChREBP, but not MondoA, was recruited to the Txnip promoter in (pancreatic) INS-1 cells and (hepatic) HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008397.s007">Figure S7C and S7D</xref>). In our hands, these cell lines express high ChREBP levels, as opposed to low levels of MondoA (not shown). Thus, in a cell-context-dependent manner, either MondoA or ChREBP may respond to glucose evoked signaling and induce Txnip expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008397-g010">Figure 10C</xref>; here, Mondo represents either MondoA or ChREBP); however, we do not rule out the possibility that transmitting the glucose signaling to MondoA or ChREBP (in complex with MLX) might involve distinct intermediate molecules.</p><p>It has been shown that NF-Y can also cooperate with several other transcription factors, such as upstream stimulatory factors (USF1/2), Oct1, GATA-1, SP-1, ATF-2, Regulatory factor X (RFX) and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008397-Zhu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008397-Ericsson1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> to regulate the transcription of target genes under nutritional, hormonal or immunological challenges. For instance, the promoter of another metabolic related gene, that of the type II Hexokinase (HKII), contains a CCAAT box, an inverted CCAAT box and multiple GC boxes that are bound by the SP family transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008397-Lee2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. CCAAT box-containing promoters might employ a common regulatory mechanism in which NF-Y might function as a regulator that facilitates the function of other gene specific transcription factors to induce gene transcription as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008397-g010">Figure 10C</xref>.
