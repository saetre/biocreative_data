Usually, functions are assigned based on similarity of the coding sequences to sequences of known genes, or by identification of transcriptional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that are known to be associated with specific pathways or conditions. In trypanosomatids, where regulation of gene expression takes place mainly at the post-transcriptional level, new approaches for function assignment are needed. Here we demonstrate the identification of novel S-phase expressed genes in <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, based on a post-transcriptional control element that was recognized in <italic>Crithidia fasciculata</italic> as involved in the cell cycle-dependent expression of several nuclear and mitochondrial S-phase expressed genes. Hypothesizing that a similar regulatory mechanism is manifested in <italic>L.major</italic>, we have applied a computational search for similar control elements in the genome of <italic>L.major</italic>. Our computational scan yielded 132 genes, of which 33% are homologues of known DNA metabolism genes and 63% lack any annotation. Experimental testing of seven of these genes revealed that their mRNAs cycle throughout the cell cycle, reaching a maximum level during S-phase or just prior to it. It is suggested that screening for post-transcriptional control elements associated with a specific function provides an efficient method for assigning functions to trypanosomatid genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trypanosomatids are eukaryotic protozoa that diverged early from the main lineage of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Their genes are transcribed forming polycistronic messages that mature into individual mRNAs by a process of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, which involves the addition of a spliced leader, a capped RNA of &#x0223c;40 nt, to the 5&#x02032;-end, and polyadenylation at the 3&#x02032;-end [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. The lack of transcriptional control in trypanosomatids suggests that other control mechanisms may have evolved in order to regulate mRNA levels. Indeed, it was shown that S-phase expressed genes in the trypanosomatid <italic>Crithidia fasciculata</italic> are controlled by a special, cell cycle-dependent, post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). It was demonstrated that mRNA transcripts of four genes accumulate at the beginning of S-phase, and degrade rapidly after DNA replication is completed. All the genes showing this post-transcriptional cell cycle-dependent regulation encode for proteins that participate in DNA metabolism. These include the genes encoding the large subunit of replication protein A (<italic>RPA1</italic>), Dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (<italic>DHFR-TS</italic>), the kinetoplast type II DNA topoisomerase (<italic>TOP2</italic>) and the histone H1-like kinetoplast associated protein 3 (<italic>KAP3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). It was shown that cycling is controlled prior to mRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), and that an octamer sequence [(C/A)AUAGAA(G/A)], located at either the 5&#x02032; or the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNAs, was involved in the regulation of the cell cycle-dependent accumulation of these mRNAs. Six copies of the octamer sequence, cloned into the 5&#x02032; UTR of the gene encoding calcium binding protein (CaBP), expressed constitutively in <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> cells, conferred strong cycling to the CaBP transcript, while a single base change in this sequence was sufficient to abolish the cycling of a reporter gene <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Two protein complexes, designated CSBP I and CSBP II, were shown to bind specifically to this sequence. A single base change of the octamer consensus sequence was sufficient to prevent binding of the protein complexes to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In addition, it has been recently shown that in <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> mRNA transcripts of the kinetoplast topoisomerase II accumulate during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Examination of the <italic>L.infantum</italic> topo II gene's flanking sequences revealed the presence of a sequence element which is similar to the <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> octamer associated with mRNA cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>As the genome of the trypanosomatid <italic>Leishmania major</italic> is extensively sequenced, a current major challenge is to assign functions to the novel genes that are identified. Usually, such functions are assigned by sequence similarity of the coding sequences to known genes, or by identification of transcriptional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that are known to be involved in regulation of a specific pathway. In trypanosomatids it is conceivable that functions can be assigned by identification of specific post-transcriptional control elements. Here we speculate that similarly to <italic>C.fasciculata</italic>, the <italic>L.major</italic> S-phase expressed genes may be regulated by a cycling control element present in their UTRs, which fulfills a similar biological function. Thus, we attempt to identify novel <italic>L.major</italic> S-phase expressed genes, through the identification of a similar cycling control element in their UTRs. Indeed, searching <italic>L.major</italic> genome for cycling control elements that exhibit the same characteristics of the <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> control elements yielded 132 genes, of which 33% encode for proteins with known functions during S-phase. 63% of the identified genes lacked any annotation and were predicted as putative S-phase expressed genes. Experimental testing of seven of the genes identified in the screen showed that they reach a maximum level in S-phase or just prior to it, suggesting that identification of the cycling control element is valuable for determining new <italic>L.major</italic> genes that are expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sequence extraction</title><p>Sequences of the <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> genes encoding for the large subunit of replication protein A (<italic>RPA1</italic>), Dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (<italic>DHFR-TS</italic>), the kinetoplast DNA topoisomerase II (<italic>TOP2</italic>) and the histone H1-like kinetoplast associated protein 3 (<italic>KAP3</italic>) were obtained from GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>, accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z23163">Z23163</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M22852">M22852</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X59623">X59623</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY143553">AY143553</ext-link>, respectively).

We have used the known occurrences of the cycling control element in <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> to characterize it by the number of repeats and their location relative to the gene's ORFs. This analysis revealed several characteristics: (i) The element's core contained the consensus sequence ATAGAA; (ii) When two copies of the motif were present within the same UTR they were separated by a maximum of 500 nt; (iii) The motif appeared on the same strand as the coding sequence (CDS); (iv) At least one of the identified motifs was positioned at a distance not greater than 500 nt from the beginning or the end of the CDS; (v) The motif was located either at the 5&#x02032; or the 3&#x02032; UTR of the gene, but not within the CDS. These characteristics can be used as a set of rules which can be applied in the genome-wide search for S-phase expressed genes that are supposed to be regulated by the cycling control element.</p></sec><sec><title>Conservation of the cycling control element in <italic>L.major</italic></title><p>To study the conservation of the octamer sequence in <italic>L.major</italic> we compared the coding sequences and UTRs of <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> genes that were shown to contain the octamer sequence (and demonstrated the consequent mRNA cycling) with their <italic>L.major</italic> orthologues. These orthologues (as determined by a BLAST search in <italic>L.major</italic> genome) are: <italic>RPA1</italic>, encoding the 51 kDa <italic>RPA1</italic> subunit (geneDB accession no. LmjF28.1820), <italic>TOP2</italic>, encoding the DNA topoisomerase II (geneDB accession no. LmjF15.1290), <italic>KAP3</italic>, encoding the kinetoplast associated protein 3 (geneDB accession number LmjF32.3780) and <italic>DHFR-TS</italic>, encoding the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (geneDB accession number LmjF06.0860). Comparison of <italic>L.major</italic> and <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> sequences revealed high similarity within the CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): identity of 67% in <italic>KAP3</italic>, 79.2% in <italic>DHFR-TS</italic>, 85% in the <italic>TOP2</italic> and 91.6% in <italic>RPA1</italic>. However, the similarity decreases significantly in the flanking regions. A search for the octameric cycling control sequence [(C/A)ATAGAA(G/A)] revealed a single copy of the sequence in the <italic>lmKAP3</italic> and the <italic>lmTOP2</italic> flanking sequences. A search for the core sequence, ATAGAA, resulted in the addition of one more site in the <italic>lmKAP3</italic> flanking sequence. The locations of these elements in regard to the ORFs were consistent with the rules determined for the <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> sequences. However, they did not appear in a few copies in the UTRs. A possible explanation for these observations was that the signal in <italic>L.major</italic> is slightly different from the signal in <italic>C.fasciculata</italic>, and by searching for the exact <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> signal we might have missed it. To this end we turned to analyze the flanking regions of <italic>L.major</italic> genes involved in DNA metabolism, attempting to identify in them a common signal that might be the <italic>L.major</italic> cycling control element.</p></sec><sec><title>UTRs of <italic>L.major</italic> homologues of DNA metabolism genes contain a CATAGA motif</title><p>Genes involved in DNA metabolism in <italic>L.major</italic> were identified by their sequence similarity to sequences of genes encoding known proteins that participate in DNA metabolism in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as revealed by BLAST (Supplementary Table 1). The sequences flanking the identified ORFs, a 1000 nt stretch residing 5&#x02032; to the ATG or 3&#x02032; to the stop codon, were analyzed. In the case of genes that were spaced at a distance shorter than 1000 nt, the intergenic region between the stop codon and the ATG of the next ORF was analyzed. In this set of sequences, containing 164 sequences, the shortest sequence was 292 nt long, the longest sequence was 1000 nt long and the average sequence length was 927.8 nt. The MITRA algorithm for detection of common motifs in unaligned sequences identified a CATAGA sequence as a significant motif in the set of sequences analyzed. This sequence, which comprises the 5&#x02032; sequence of the <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> octamer, is proposed by us as a putative cycling control sequence (PCS) in <italic>L.major</italic>. Interestingly, analysis of the genomic context of the PCSs in these genes revealed that they are rich in adenine, while in the whole intergenic regions adenine was the least frequent nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, re-analyzing the <italic>RPA1</italic>, <italic>TOP2</italic>, <italic>KAP3</italic> and <italic>DHFR-TS</italic> UTRs by searching for the PCS resulted in a total of 12 hits in all four genes. Ten of the elements were located within less than 500 nt from the coding sequence. Two PCSs were identified in <italic>lmDHFR-TS</italic> upstream region. Four PCSs were identified in the <italic>lmTOP2</italic> upstream region. Three PCSs were found in <italic>lmRPA1</italic>, one upstream and two downstream to the CDS. Three PCSs were found in <italic>lmKAP3</italic>, two upstream and one downstream to the CDS. These locations are consistent with the rules determined above, but differ from the locations of the previously characterized <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> mRNA cycling signal in the gene homologues' UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Given the nucleotide background in the intergenic regions of the 164 genes in our training set, which is 0.19, 0.3, 0.24 and 0.27 for A, C, G and T, respectively, the probability to find the sequence CATAGA is 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, and hence, the probability to find it at least once per 1000 nt in all four sequences is less than 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. The finding of three pairs and a quartet of the CATAGA sequence in the examined sequences is, therefore, highly statistically significant, and suggests that this sequence may have a functional role in <italic>L.major</italic> S-phase expressed genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening the <italic>L.major</italic> genome for genes containing a CATAGA sequence</title><p>To get an idea of the abundance of the PCS in the genome, we first searched the CATAGA hexamer in the whole genome sequence, and found that it occurred 6,324 times in the <italic>L.major</italic> genome. Pairs of PCSs that are located less than 500 nt apart on the same strand, as defined above, were found 554 times. Since the experimental data in <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> suggested that the cycling control elements reside in the UTRs of the genes they regulate, we aimed to identify genes that exhibit the PCS in their UTRs. Thus, we extracted those genes where the PCS pairs resided in a distance less than 500 nt from a CDS, either upstream or downstream. This analysis retrieved 132 CDSs. Examination of the distance between neighboring PCSs revealed that 44% of these sequences are positioned less than 100 nt apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Extending the distance to 200 nt covers 71% of the data and about 10% is added to each 100 nt addition, up to 500 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PCS is abundant within genes encoding for DNA metabolism proteins</title><p>In order to determine the possible cellular roles of the 132 genes selected by the above screen, we submitted each of these genes as a query for a Blastx search against the NCBI non-redundant database and for motif identification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A biological function could be assigned to 49 genes, accounting for 37% of the dataset, based on either significant similarity to other genes of known function, or by the identification of motifs associated with specific biological functions. The other 83 genes were either orphan sequences or conserved hypothetical genes. Out of the 49 genes for which a function could be assigned, 43 genes are homologous to DNA metabolism genes or have motifs that suggest such a role. This result is highly statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;41</sup> by a hyper-geometric test). Within the group, 30.6% of the genes encode for replication proteins, such as DNA primase, DNA polymerases, PCNA, topoisomerase II and <italic>RPA1</italic> (both 51 and 28 kDa subunits). Some of the identified genes have a known function in nuclear DNA replication, while some of them have previously been associated with kDNA replication in <italic>C.fasciculata</italic> (e.g. the gene encoding the structure-specific endonuclease 1, SSE1). The next class, about 34.7% of the group, contains genes encoding proteins with known function in chromosome maintenance. Genes in this group play a major role in chromosome organization and condensation. Another gene, possibly a thymidine kinase involved in nucleotide metabolism, has been identified in addition to <italic>DHFR-TS</italic>, which was part of our training set. 8.2% of the genes are related to cell proliferation, while another group, encompassing 10.2% of the annotated genes, contain motifs related to DNA replication, such as probable DEAE helicases and nuclease sequence signature. The last group, which contains 12.2% of the annotated genes, involves genes that do not have a known role in DNA metabolism. Supplementary Table 2 shows the complete list of annotated genes, identified by this screen. While the rest of the sequences found using the computational search (63%) have no known function, they are especially intriguing, since they may represent genes, yet unknown, that are involved in <italic>L.major</italic> nuclear and kinetoplast DNA replication. Supplementary Table 1 shows the complete list of these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA transcripts of candidate genes peak at S-phase</title><p>To test whether the genes selected by our computational screen are expressed during S-phase, we monitored the mRNA levels of several candidates throughout the cell cycle, in hydroxyurea-synchronized <italic>L.major</italic> cultures. We followed the progress through two rounds of the cell cycle (&#x0223c;14 h) by fluorescence microscopy of DAPI stained cells, monitoring the changes in cells morphology, and by FACS analyses of propidium idodide-stained cells, following the changes in their DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Abundance of specific mRNA transcripts of seven of the genes found in our screen was followed during the progress in the <italic>L.major</italic> cell cycle, using northern blot hybridization analysis of cell samples, withdrawn at 1 h intervals after the removal of hydroxyurea. The gene encoding &#x003b1;-tubulin, which does not show the PCSs in either of its UTRs, was used as a control. The seven genes that were analyzed vary in their putative relevance to S-phase: <italic>LmjF06.0860</italic> is the gene homologue of <italic>CfDHFR-TS</italic>, which contains two cycling control elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and was shown to cycle in an S-phase dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). <italic>LmjF21.1210</italic> and <italic>LmjF15.1450</italic> are homologues of the thymidine kinase and PCNA encoding genes, respectively, both of which encode for proteins involved in DNA metabolism in other eukaryotes, and are expected to be expressed during S-phase. The next three genes have homologues with unassigned function in other organisms, but there are some hints that may suggest that they are involved in DNA metabolism: The <italic>LmjF12.1220</italic> gene is similar (<italic>E</italic>-value 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;19</sup>) to the <italic>X.laevis AND-1</italic> gene, X98884, encoding a nuclear DNA binding protein with HMG and WD domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The <italic>LmjF12.0510</italic> gene is similar (<italic>E</italic>-value 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;18</sup>) to the <italic>H.sapiens Cep164</italic> gene, NM_014956, encoding the Cep164 protein, which was putatively localized to the centromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The <italic>LmjF31.0070</italic> gene contains an SSL2 domain (<italic>E</italic>-value 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;24</sup>) and is highly similar (<italic>E</italic>-value 10<sup>&#x02212;150</sup>) to the African swine fever virus helicase gene, <italic>NP_042734</italic>. The last gene, <italic>LmjF33.0650</italic>, is a conserved hypothetical gene, with a predicted mitochondrial signal peptide, which contains seven PCSs within its flanking sequence.</p><p>The steady state levels of mRNA transcripts of the <italic>LmjF06.0860</italic>, <italic>LmjF21.1210</italic>, <italic>LmjF15.1450</italic>, <italic>LmjF12.0510</italic>, <italic>LmjF31.0070</italic> and <italic>LmjF33.0650</italic> genes were found to vary during cell cycle progression. Two peaks of mRNA could be detected during two consecutive cell cycles. The first peak occurred at 2 or 3 h after the release from hydroxyurea arrest, during the first cell cycle, and the second peak occurred at 9&#x02013;10 h during the second cell cycle. Both peaks occurred within the respective S-phases of the two consecutive cell cycles monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The levels of RNA transcripts were 3- to 7-fold higher during S-phase for most of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The <italic>LmjF12.0510</italic> had an additional prominent transcript of a smaller than expected size. This transcript reached a maximum level that was 2-fold higher at the second hour after the removal of hydroxyurea, relative to its abundance during the rest of the cell cycle. The <italic>LmjF12.1220</italic> transcript was expressed periodically, but reached maximum levels at 8 h and subsequently at 12 h post hydroxyurea arrest release, just prior to S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The &#x003b1;-tubulin transcript, used as a control, was found to be expressed at a constant level during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that genes in <italic>L.major</italic> that contain the PCSs in their flanking regions cycle throughout the cell cycle, reaching their peak levels during S-phase or at the G<sub>1</sub>/S boundary. Three of the genes, <italic>LmjF06.0860</italic>, <italic>LmjF21.1210</italic> and <italic>LmjF15.1450</italic>, were selected for the experimental testing because their homologues are known to play a role in DNA metabolism, and our results support the possible involvement of these genes in DNA metabolism in <italic>L.major</italic>. The four other genes have no homologues with known function. Our results suggest that the cellular function of these genes may be related to the S-phase, and furthermore, it may allude to the function of their homologues in other organisms. Thus, it is conceivable that the gene products of <italic>Cep164</italic>, the human homologue of <italic>LmjF12.0510</italic> and helicase <italic>NP_042734</italic>, the African swine fever virus homologue of <italic>LmjF31.0070</italic>, play a role in DNA metabolism during the S-phase. Likewise, it is possible that <italic>AND-1</italic>, <italic>LmjF12.1220</italic> homologue in <italic>X.laevis</italic>, plays a role at the G<sub>1</sub>/S boundary. Finally, <italic>LmjF33.0650</italic> which is a hypothetical gene conserved only within the group of Trypanosomatidae, is also implied to have a role in DNA metabolism, and thus, could be a potential drug target. There are other genes among the 132 candidates with the PCSs in their UTRs that are specific to trypanosomatids, and therefore may also be useful in future development of anti-trypanosomatid drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Obviously, not all S-phase expressed genes in <italic>L.major</italic> show the cycling control element as defined by our rules. As can be seen in Supplementary Table 1, some DNA metabolism gene homologues in <italic>L.major</italic> do not show the PCS at all, and some show it only once, and therefore were not included in the group of 132 candidates. It is possible that with more experimental knowledge on DNA metabolism genes in <italic>L.major</italic>, the rules determined in this study will be refined, or other predictors of S-phase expressed genes may be found. It is also possible that other groups of functionally related genes in <italic>L.major</italic> are regulated by other specific post-transcriptional control signals. The approach described here is applicable to such groups of genes as well. By compiling a database of known genes related to a specific function, a common element can be detected in their UTRs, and used, in turn, for detecting additional genes that contain the signal and may play a similar role. Finally, this approach can be used more widely for the annotation of genes in other trypanosomatids, with possible important implications to the assignment of function to their homologues in the genomes of other organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF</title><p>Our analysis has been performed prior to the recent completion of the sequence of the <italic>L. major</italic> genome [Ivens,A.C. <italic>et al</italic>.
