PARP-1 may be involved in homologous recombination, and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 represents one possible mechanism that activates p53 as a recombination surveillance factor. Here, we examined the influence of PARP-1 on homology-directed double-strand break (DSB) repair by use of a fluorescence- and I-SceI- meganuclease-based assay with either episomal or chromosomally integrated DNA substrates. Surprisingly, the transient expression of both full-length PARP-1 and of a dominant negative mutant, retaining the DNA-binding but lacking the catalytic domain, down-regulated DSB repair in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was seen regardless of p53 status, however, with enhanced inhibition in the presence of wild-type p53. Taken together, our data reveal that PARP-1 overexpression counteracts DSB repair independently of its enzymatic activity and of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 in particular, but synergizes with p53 in suppressing chromosomal rearrangements.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent the most detrimental DNA lesion and may be formed by ionizing radiation, oxygen radicals, inhibition of topoisomerase or DNA polymerase activity, or by specific endonucleases, such as the V(D)J recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c2">2</xref>). Error-prone DSB repair may lead to cancer-inducing genetic aberrations, including translocations, deletions, chromosome losses or gene amplification. Mammalian cells utilize two major DSB repair pathways, namely the mutagenic mechanism of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the generally nonmutagenic process of homologous recombination (HR). Conservative HR, i.e. gene conversion or cross-over, depends on the strand transfer activity of Rad51 and auxiliary proteins of the Rad52 epistasis group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c3">3</xref>). Nonconservative HR, i.e. single-strand annealing (SSA) or replication slippage, represents a Rad51-independent mechanism. The critical importance of HR for mammalian organisms was convincingly demonstrated by the embryonic lethal phenotypes of knockout mice with deficiencies in either <italic>Rad51</italic>, <italic>Rad50</italic> or <italic>Nbs1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Activation of PARP-1 and p53 represents two of the earliest DNA damage responses that trigger various cellular functions involved in the maintenance of the genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c8">8</xref>). PARP-1 binds to DNA strand breaks with high affinity and subsequently poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself and other nuclear proteins involved in chromatin structure, DNA base excision repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>). Automodification of PARP-1, which entails a massive increase in negative charges, may lead to the dissociation of PARP-1 from the strand break and thus give access to DNA repair enzymes in a controlled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c11">11</xref>). In agreement with an involvement of PARP-1 in DSB repair, <italic>PARP-1</italic> disruption in knockout mice or inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in cellular systems stimulate micronucleus formation, sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c15">15</xref>). HR participates in SCEs and gene amplifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c17">17</xref>), suggesting an involvement of PARP-1 in HR. Moreover, PARP-1 was reported to co-immunoprecipitate with the Werner syndrome (WRN) protein, a RecQ helicase that suppresses error-prone Rad51-dependent recombination by branch migrating illegitimate recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c19">19</xref>). However, recent observations indicated that PARP-1 is not required for the assembly of Rad51 foci in the nucleus and does not colocalize with Rad51, indicating that PARP-1 does not represent a component of the recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c20">20</xref>). So far, the results from recombination measurements have not provided a conclusive picture of the role of PARP-1 in HR. Waldman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c22">22</xref>) showed that in mouse fibroblasts, a competitive inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation does not affect extrachromosomal HR but stimulates intrachromosomal HR. In contrast, Semionov and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c23">23</xref>) noticed that chemical inhibition of PARP-1 in the same cell type positively regulates extrachromosomal HR, while Schultz <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c20">20</xref>) were unable to see any changes in HR frequencies with chromosomally integrated substrates, when using Chinese hamster cells.</p><p>PARP-1 was proposed to act upstream of p53 in the damage signalling pathway, either via physical interactions with and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 or, indirectly, via stimulation of the DNA strand break sensing ATM kinase which phosphorylates p53 on serine 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c32">32</xref>). Moreover, PARP-1 and p53 were demonstrated to cooperate in stabilizing the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>), suggesting a functional connection in DNA repair. In addition to a role of p53 in checkpoint control, numerous studies showed a close association between p53 and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c33">33</xref>). In particular, compelling evidence indicates that wild-type p53 (wt-p53) down-regulates spontaneous and DSB-induced HR, independently of its role in transcriptional transactivation, cell cycle control and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). Concerning the mechanism by which p53 directly counteracts HR, important clues have come from the identification of p53&#x02013;Rad51 complexes, the characterization of the physical interactions between p53 and strand exchange intermediates, and from studies on the DNA substrate dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c39">39</xref>). From these results, it is conceivable that p53 abrogates continued strand exchange by the recombinase Rad51 after specifically recognizing erroneous intermediates of HR. Phosphorylation by ATM and the interaction with Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (BLM) protein, another RecQ DNA helicase which may counteract defective processing of DNA replication intermediates, seem to be important in stabilizing p53 contacts in the vicinity of the DSB repair machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c40">40</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we evaluated the precise role of PARP-1 in homology-directed DSB repair. Previous studies utilized recombination assay systems that rely on colony outgrowth under drug selection, but conflicting data were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c23">23</xref>). Here, we applied our fluorescence-based DSB repair assay that scores the fraction of EGFP-positive cells in a population of nonfluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). To discriminate between PARP-1 functions in recombinative versus alternative DNA repair pathways, we applied a test system which has been designed in such a way as to trigger recombinative DNA exchange processes by DSB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). Trans-dominant inhibition of poly(ADP- ribosyl)ation by overexpressing the DNA-binding domain of PARP-1 (PARP-DBD) has previously been exploited as a powerful tool to examine the role of PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c43">43</xref>). We therefore compared the consequences of ectopically expressing PARP-DBD and PARP-1 on HR within extra- or intrachromosomal DNA substrates. To understand whether recombination regulation by PARP-1 involves direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53, we extended our studies on DSB repair to cellular systems with differing p53 status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>pGC-PARP-DBD and pGC-PARP-1 were created by transferring the SmaI fragment, encompassing the region of cDNA encoding truncated and full-length PARP-1, from the vector pPARP6 and pPARP31, respectively, into the EcoRV- restriction site of pGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c44">44</xref>).

LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(p53her) cells are a LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(neo) derivative expressing p53her, i.e. human wt-p53 fused to the human estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain, which represents bona fide wt-p53 in the presence of estradiol as verified by functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c45">45</xref>). p53her expression resulted in a 49&#x00025; decrease in HR measured by <italic>EGFP</italic> reconstitution among successfully transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f1">1</xref>B). When we subjected LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(p53her) cells to cotransfections with pPARP6 or pPARP31, we monitored a 58&#x00025; and 55&#x00025; reduction in the LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(neo) control recombination frequency due to the combined expression of exogenous p53her/PARP-DBD and p53her/PARP-1 proteins, respectively.</p><p>To examine the DSB repair phenotype of cells after chemical inhibition of PARP-1 enzyme activity, we determined the effect of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>).

Taken together, in our experiments with an extrachromosomal recombination plasmid, suppression of HR by PARP-1 did not depend on its enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of either PARP-DBD or PARP-1 suppress HR between chromosomally integrated DNA substrates</title><p>PARP-1 has been shown to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate several architectural components of the eukaryotic chromatin including histones H1 and H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>). To ask the question whether chromatin packaging of the DNA exchange substrates may influence the regulatory effect of PARP-1 on DSB repair, we chose to modify the PARP-1 activity status in cell lines carrying recombination substrates in the cellular chromosomes. For that purpose, we utilized K562-derived KMV cell clones, which carry a stably integrated HR-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f1">1</xref>A). In our previous study, we demonstrated by genomic PCR analyses of the recombination products from the chromosomes of sorted green fluorescing cells that green fluorescence indeed resulted from the reconstitution of a wt-<italic>EGFP</italic> gene by homology-directed DSB repair.</p><p>To introduce a DSB at the position of the I-SceI recognition sequence within the chromosome, we electroporated the tester strain with the I-SceI expression plasmid pCMV-I-SceI. To alter PARP-1 activities, we simultaneously introduced either pPARP6 or pPARP31. In control experiments with pBS, we recorded an absolute recombination frequency of 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> for the p53-negative KMV line. Strikingly, almost complete recombination suppression was caused by the ectopic expression of either PARP-DBD or PARP-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f2">2</xref>A). To be able to detect cooperativity between PARP-1 and p53 in the combined analysis, expression constructs for low-level expression were purposefully chosen such that only small effects were achieved with PARP-DBD or PARP-1 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f2">2</xref>B). For that purpose we utilized the pGC-vector, which produces &#x0223c;100-fold lower protein amounts as compared with the pCMV-vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f2">2</xref>C). Consequently, no significant recombination suppression was noted in KMV cells upon transfection with either pGC-PARP-DBD or pGC-PARP-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f2">2</xref>B). To examine the effect of p53, we utilized KMV cells stably transfected with both the HR-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP recombination plasmid and with pSV53her, the latter providing stable expression of p53her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). In KMV(p53her) cells HR between <italic>HR-EGFP</italic> and <italic>3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>EGFP</italic> was reduced by 58&#x00025;, as compared with the KMV control. In contrast to the situation in KMV cells, transfection of KMV(p53her) cells with either pGC-PARP-DBD or pGC-PARP-1 caused a dramatic decrease in the recombination frequencies down to background values. In conclusion, recombination interference by PARP-DBD and PARP-1 became apparent both with DNA substrates that were presented on transiently transfected plasmid DNA and on the chromosome and was dose-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological consequences of PARP-1 expression in stably transfected cells</title><p>So far, our data from transient expression studies demonstrated that PARP-1 inhibits DSB repair. Next, we generated stable cell clones inducibly expressing PARP-1. As a parental line we chose LMV, i.e. LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> cells stably expressing the transcription factor Gal4ERVP for estradiol-inducible transgene expression via pGC vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c35">35</xref>). In our previous study, we demonstrated that the pGC vector system and the SV40 driven pSVp53her plasmid yield equivalent protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>), thus enabling us to express comparable amounts of PARP-1 and p53her by pGC-PARP and pSVp53her and to induce both protein activities by estradiol. After cotransfection of LMV cells with phyg, which confers hygromycin resistance, and either pSVp53her, pGC-PARP-1 or pSVp53her plus pGC-PARP-1, hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened by western blotting. Ectopic expression of either p53her or PARP-1 was detectable in various clones; however, only one PARP-1 positive clone was successfully established after pSVp53her plus pGC-PARP-1 cotransfection. p53her was constitutively produced and functionally stimulated after estradiol application (LMV-p53her, LMV-p53her/PARP), whereas PARP-1 expression was estradiol-inducible (LMV-PARP, LMV-p53her/PARP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>A,B). LMV-p53her and LMV-PARP cells were characterized by a significant growth retardation, as indicated by a 3- to 4-fold increase in the generation times in the presence of estradiol and a 2-fold increase even in its absence, probably due to residual amounts of estradiol-like substances in the stripped media (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>B). LMV-p53her/PARP proliferated at extremely retarded growth rates in the absence of estradiol, which again can be explained by basal levels of exogenous PARP-1 and residual p53her activation. Even more strikingly, cultivation in the presence of estradiol resulted in a daily 20&#x00025; decrease in cell numbers rather than an increase.</p><p>PARP-1 has been implicated in induction or execution of apoptosis, although contradictory opinions exist on the underlying mechanism with respect to the involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and signalling to p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c49">49</xref>). The unusual growth characteristics of LMV-p53her/PARP cells prompted us to analyse these cells for potential apoptotic features. Thus, we performed cell cycle analysis at different times after estradiol exposure by FACS&#x000ae; analysis of propidium iodide stained cells. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>C, the percentage of LMV-p53her/PARP cells with a sub-G<sub>1</sub> DNA content, which is strongly indicative of apoptosis, represented &#x0223c;10&#x00025; before and after estradiol treatment. Interestingly, a sub-G<sub>1</sub> cell population also appeared in LMV-PARP cells around 48 h (2.5&#x00025;) of hormone exposure with a further increase until 72 h (8.8&#x00025;), and similar results were obtained after &#x003b3;-irradiation with a dose of 5 Gy (data not shown). Under the same conditions, sub-G<sub>1</sub> cells were absent in LMV-p53her and LMV cells. Consistently, when we inspected DAPI stained cell nuclei by fluorescence microscopy, LMV-p53her/PARP cells exhibited typical features of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>D). Using this method, highly condensed and fragmented nuclei were also found in the samples of estradiol-induced LMV-PARP cells as early as 12 h after irradiation, whereas unirradiated LMV-PARP or LMV-p53her and LMV cell nuclei remained intact. In order to understand whether PARP-1 is a positive regulator of p53-dependent transcriptional transactivation in LMV-p53her/PARP cells under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c31">31</xref>), which may be related to the abnormal growth characteristics of these cells, we also investigated the expression of the two major target genes, <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>Bax</italic>, by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>E). As compared with the other LMV lines, LMV-p53her/PARP cells showed dramatically increased levels of p21 and Bax. Our results indicated that PARP-1 expression in cells derived from the rhesus monkey cell line LLC-MK<sub>2</sub> is followed by growth retardation and programmed cell death, particularly in a wt-p53-positive background.</p></sec><sec><title>DSB repair in stably transfected cells expressing exogenous PARP-1</title><p>To investigate whether recombination interference by PARP-1 was also detectable in LMV-PARP and LMV-p53her/PARP cells, we transfected the newly generated stable cell clones with pCMV-I-SceI and either the recombination vector EJ-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP, HR-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP or &#x00394;-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP. <italic>EJ-EGFP</italic> at the acceptor position additionally supports in frame reconstitution of <italic>EGFP</italic> via NHEJ, <italic>HR</italic>- versus &#x00394;-<italic>EGFP</italic> raises the length of homology with <italic>3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>EGFP</italic> neighbouring the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis was performed after 72 h of cultivation in the presence of estradiol and relative recombination frequencies were calculated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f4">4</xref>). In the parental LMV cells, we measured mean recombination frequencies of 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for <italic>EJ-EGFP</italic>, 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for <italic>HR-EGFP</italic> and 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for &#x00394;-<italic>EGFP</italic>. In LMV-p53her cells, 71&#x02013;75&#x00025; of the control values were measured with all three recombination substrates. The relative frequencies in LMV-PARP cells were similarly reduced to 69&#x02013;81&#x00025;, whereas in LMV-p53her/PARP cells, we recorded increased rather than decreased mean values (101&#x02013;138&#x00025;). Thus, unlike the results after transient PARP-1 expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f2">2</xref>), the down-regulatory effect of PARP-1 was abolished in stably transfected LMV-p53her/PARP cells coexpressing p53her.</p><p>To examine whether the unexpectedly high DSB-repair activities in LMV-p53her/PARP cells were related to the apoptotic features of these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f3">3</xref>C,D), we introduced the recombination plasmid &#x00394;-EGFP/3&#x02032;EGFP into the same series of cell lines followed by a 24 h treatment with the irreversible caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, which also inhibits caspases 6, 7, 8 and 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c50">50</xref>). FACS&#x000ae; analysis of EGFP-positivity was performed after a total cultivation period of 72 h. Importantly, control transfections served to normalize each single recombination frequency, so that we could rule out the possibility that rate deviations were simply caused by altered transfection efficiencies, by growth regulatory effects or differences in cell lethality with the individual cell line used. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh227f5">5</xref>, in LMV cells no changes in the HR frequencies were detectable in the presence of Z-DEVD-FMK. Similarly, only a minor drug-dependent reduction in the recombination frequencies was measured in LMV-p53her and LMV-PARP cells. However, caspase inhibition in LMV-p53her/PARP cells caused a significant down-regulation of HR (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.036), resulting in the same relative recombination frequency of 78&#x00025; as seen with LMV-p53her cells. For comparison, Z-DEVD-FMK treatment of LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(neo) and LLC-MK<sub>2</sub>(p53her) cells upon transient transfection with pGC-PARP-1 did not cause a statistically significant reduction in the HR values (data not shown). These findings suggest that apoptotic processes induced by coexpression of PARP-1 and p53her in stably transfected cells may indirectly cause an apparent stimulation of DNA exchange processes that neutralize the anti-recombinogenic activities of PARP-1 and p53her.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Numerous studies have indicated critical roles for both PARP-1 and p53 in the maintenance of genome integrity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c51">51</xref>). PARP-1 and p53 are thought to promote base excision repair (BER) via physical interactions with the BER multiprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c55">55</xref>). A large body of evidence also indicates that wt-p53 down-regulates spontaneous and DSB-induced HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c38">38</xref>). From our current knowledge, p53 may either block erroneous strand exchange by the recombinase Rad51 or exonucleolytically degrade mispaired intermediates of HR, thereby preventing detrimental rearrangements. However, the molecular mechanism that may underlie the putative anti-recombinogenic role of PARP-1 has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c20">20</xref>). Thus, PARP-1 may directly protect strand breaks from processing or recruit recombination surveillance proteins like WRN or p53. Alternatively, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histones may alter the chromatin configuration and activate p53 functions in HR regulation. From recent reports, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may additionally modulate recombination indirectly, because NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> depletion inhibits the activity of the Sir2/SIRT1 deacetylase which also affects chromosome remodelling and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c57">57</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we investigated the role of PARP-1 in DSB repair by use of the rare-cutting, site-specific I-SceI endonuclease, rather than by ionizing irradiation, which introduces base modifications in addition to strand breaks. Therefore, by focusing on targeted DSBs, we were able to exclude indirect effects on HR by DNA excision repair. For our analysis, we utilized two well-established isogenic cellular systems, each with and without wt-p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c38">38</xref>). Using two experimental strategies to inactivate PARP-1 enzymatic activity, namely overexpression of PARP-DBD and chemical inhibition, we have observed decreased DSB repair activities in the wt-p53-negative background. Moreover, down- regulation of HR by wt-p53 was further enhanced after PARP-DBD overexpression. Although less markedly, the overexpression of full-length PARP-1 also exerted an inhibitory effect. These results largely excluded an involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and p53 signalling in the anti-recombinative effect of PARP-1. Our data rather support the idea that tight binding of PARP-1 to DSBs prevents access for recombination enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c11">11</xref>). The less prominent effect by PARP-1 versus PARP-DBD may be explained by the fact that the interaction of PARP-1 with strand breaks is modulated by automodification, i.e. DNA-break sealing will be possible after release of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Our recent studies on the regulatory role of p53 in recombination had indicated an influence of the protein/DNA substrate ratio on the degree of recombination interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). In agreement with a similar dose-dependence, the effect of PARP-DBD and PARP-1 on HR was dramatic when the protein/DNA substrate ratio was high in experiments with high-level protein expression and less then 10 intrachromosomally located recombination substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). Conversely, intermediate HR frequency changes were observed with high-level protein expression and extrachromosomal substrates at estimated copy numbers of 10<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c58">58</xref>). Moreover, a dose-dependence also became apparent when we studied intrachromosomal HR in the presence of different PARP-DBD and PARP-1 protein levels. Thus, high-level expression of exogenous PARP-DBD or PARP-1 led to a complete suppression of HR as compared with a minor reduction with 100-fold lower protein amounts. High-level expression conditions generated PARP-DBD and PARP-1 levels, which, according to western blot analysis, were similar to endogenous PARP-1, i.e. amounted to &#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup> molecules per cell or one molecule per 1000 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c59">59</xref>). Importantly, DSB concentrations in the order of the affinity constant of PARP-1 (10<sup>&#x02013;10</sup> M) were achieved in these KMV cells which carried approximately six I-SceI cleavable substrates after chromosomal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c37">37</xref>). In conclusion, HR suppression by exogenous PARP-DBD and PARP-1 can be explained by direct interactions with DNA breaks.</p><p>Interestingly, the small influence of low levels of PARP-DBD and PARP-1 on intrachromosomal recombination was dramatically enhanced in a wt-p53 background. This finding suggested a synergistic effect by p53 and both PARP-DBD and PARP-1, although in experiments with extrachromosomal substrates, the data rather indicated an additive effect. With the DNA-binding domain of PARP-1 being sufficient, this synergism cannot be explained by an involvement of PARP-1 enzymatic activity, thereby excluding p53 activation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, Sir2/SIRT1 inhibition or chromatin opening via charge repulsion by poly(ADP-ribose) chains. The DNA binding domain of PARP-1 was proposed to participate in molecular complexes with proteins involved in genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c43">43</xref>). However with respect to p53, mapping data of the physical interaction site on PARP-1 argue against a synergistic mechanism that would involve physical interactions of p53 within the PARP-DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c27">27</xref>). Similar to PARP-1 and p53, synergistic activities in minimizing end-to-end fusions and other chromosomal aberrations were also reported for PARP-1 and Ku, another DNA-end binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c60">60</xref>), as well as for p53 and Ku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c61">61</xref>). p53 has been shown to complex V(D)J recombination intermediates, to specifically recognize early strand exchange intermediates, particularly in trimeric complexes with Rad51, and to abrogate NHEJ and HR involving sequence divergences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c64">64</xref>). Therefore, the combined protection of DNA breaks and repair intermediates by PARP-1 and p53 coupled to complementary interactions with repair enzymes of Rad51-independent and -dependent HR pathways may cause a synergistic inhibition particularly in highly organized repair complexes within the nuclear chromatin.</p><p>In accord with the results from transient expression studies, HR was down-regulated after PARP-1 expression in stably transfected LMV cells lacking wt-p53. In contrast, in cells stably coexpressing PARP-1 and p53her, indirect effects antagonized HR interference by PARP-1 and wt-p53. Importantly, in these LMV-p53her/PARP cells, a severe reduction in cell survival and a marked transactivation of two p53 target genes were observed in parallel. These results are consistent with two models involving apoptotic signalling of PARP-1 upstream of p53: First, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 rapidly enhances accumulation of p53, activation of sequence-specific DNA binding and p53-dependent apoptotic DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c31">31</xref>). Second, prolonged PARP-1 activation and NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> depletion may inhibit Sir2/SIRT1, the NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylase which suppresses p53-mediated transactivation and delays apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c57">57</xref>). Yet, in the presence of the inducing agent, we also detected apoptotic features in LMV-PARP cells without wt-p53, although to a much lesser degree as compared with LMV-p53her/PARP cells. From this, p53-independent functions of PARP-1 in apoptosis induction may contribute to the phenotype of LMV-p53her/PARP cells. Our recombination experiments performed in the presence of the caspase inhibitor supported the idea that apoptosis induction in LMV-p53her/PARP cells was underlying the failure of exogenous PARP-1 and p53her to down-regulate HR. Previous observations have led to the suggestion that apoptosis positively regulates gene rearrangements; however, the precise mechanism remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c65">65</xref>). One possibility is that the formation of DNA strand breaks which is mediated by apoptotic nucleases may trigger DNA rearrangements.</p><p>Our findings on the anti-recombinogenic role of PARP-1 are consistent with previous reports that documented negative regulation of micronuclei formation, SCEs, chromosome fusions and gene amplification after genotoxic treatment by endogenous and ectopically expressed PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c67">67</xref>). They also support the conclusions drawn from double knockout studies indicating a cooperation between p53 and PARP-1 by suppressing chromosome aberrations such as fragmentations, end-to-end fusions and abnormally long and heterogeneous telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>). Our data are also in accord with a previous report which demonstrated that resealing of irradiation-induced DSBs is slowed down by PARP-DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c68">68</xref>). Conversely, in another study PARP-DBD overexpression was shown to enhance gene amplification in response to MNNG treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c12">12</xref>). At first glance, our data also seem to contradict the results from studies using chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Thus, 3-AB stimulated SCEs but not translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c69">69</xref>), 3-methoxybenzamide potentiated intra- but not extrachromosomal HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c22">22</xref>) and 1,5-isoquinolinediol increased the frequency of extrachromosomal HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c23">23</xref>) but did not significantly influence HR on meganuclease-cleaved chromosomally integrated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c20">20</xref>). One possible explanation for the different outcomes may be that the known effects of PARP-1 inhibition on DNA base-excision repair and the consequent (indirect) activation of the HR pathway may override to some extent the direct inhibitory effect on HR reported here. Additionally, PARP-1-mediated growth regulation may affect HR measurements as determined by colony formation assays. Taken together, differences in the repair trigger, in the PARP-1/DNA substrate ratio, in the p53-status and cytotoxic effects may have influenced previous studies on the role of PARP-1 in genome stabilization, and this may resolve some of the contradictions. In this work, we largely excluded rate deviations related to indirect effects by targeted DSB formation to trigger HR, by use of a fluorescence-based HR assay with a fast readout and by use of various cellular systems differing in PARP-1 status.</p><p>In summary, we have established that PARP-1 is a negative regulator of DSB repair in a manner that is dose-dependent and apparently does not involve the covalent modification of target proteins like p53 with poly(ADP-ribose) or NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> depletion. The present study further demonstrated cooperative functions of PARP-1 and p53 in suppressing DSB-repair on cellular chromosomes. PARP-1 null mice exhibit high genomic instabilities with a further increase seen in PARP-1 and p53 double knockouts, which are characterized by chromosome aberrations, indicative of deregulated HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh227c10">10</xref>). Moreover, after PARP-1 inactivation in p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, tumorigenesis is enhanced and the tumour spectrum widened. Consistently, our results suggest a synergistic role between PARP-1 and p53 in controlling DSB repair processes, thereby synergistically minimizing aberrant chromosomal rearrangements and suppressing tumorigenesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh227f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Effect of PARP-1 and PARP-DBD expression on DSB repair with episomal DNA substrates.
