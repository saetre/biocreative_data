A positive clone, EGFREB, of 2575 bp length, was isolated from an expression library of RL95 cells with a multimer of the EGFRE sequence. In this work, we have identified that EGFREB encodes the C-terminus of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5). This mRNA is most abundant in human colon and small intestine. A full-length cDNA clone was isolated from a human colon library using EGFREB as the hybridization probe. The full-length cDNA consists of 3336 bp with a 302 bp 5'-UTR, a 1663 bp 3'-UTR, and a 1371 bp sequence coding for a 457 amino acid polypeptide. Based on its tissue distribution and sequence homology to the mouse IKLF, we renamed this protein IKLF. DNase I footprinting and electrophoresis mobility shift assay confirmed the binding of IKLF to the EGFRE. The human IKLF gene spans &#x0003e;20 kb in length and is organized into four exons, whose intron/exon junctions follow the GT/AG rule. The three zinc fingers are encoded by three exons. Nuclear localization of IKLF was demonstrated by green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged IKLF in transfection experiments and western analysis. Overexpression of IKLF in RL95 cells represses the activity of reporter constructs containing the CAAT/GT box of the mouse lactoferrin gene. These findings imply that IKLF is a nuclear transcription factor that binds to the CAAT/GT box, and functions as a modulator of the mouse lacto-ferrin gene promoter activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
