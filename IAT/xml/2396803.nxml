We show that RasGEF Q can bind to F-actin, has the potential to form complexes with myosin heavy chain kinase (MHCK) A that contain active RasB, and is the predominant exchange factor for RasB. Overexpression of the RasGEF Q GEF domain activates RasB, causes enhanced recruitment of MHCK A to the cortex, and leads to cytokinesis defects in suspension, phenocopying cells expressing constitutively active RasB, and myosin-null mutants. RasGEF Q<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants have defects in cell sorting and slug migration during later stages of development, in addition to cell polarity defects. Furthermore, RasGEF Q<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants have increased levels of unphosphorylated myosin II, resulting in myosin II overassembly. Collectively, our results suggest that starvation signals through RasGEF Q to activate RasB, which then regulates processes requiring myosin II.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.

Coordinated cell movement requires protrusive forces generated by polymerization of actin filaments at the leading edge and contractile forces via myosin motors at the rear of a cell. Myosin II, the conventional two-headed myosin, is also the primary motor protein required for cytokinesis in eukaryotes. <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells lacking <italic>MhcA</italic> show a plethora of defects, which include cytokinesis defect in suspension but undergoing cytokinesis when grown on a solid support by a &#x0201c;traction-mediated&#x0201d; mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Lozanne and Spudich, 1987</xref>). These correspond to the localization of myosin at the contractile ring (cleavage furrow) during cytokinesis. <italic>MhcA<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells have a decreased chemotactic efficiency caused by reduction in cell polarity and an inability to suppress lateral pseudopods and retract the uropod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wessels and Soll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wessels et al., 1988</xref>). They also have a developmental defect, halting the developmental process shortly after cells have aggregated. The regulation of myosin II appears to differ between higher and lower eukaryotes.</p><p>In <italic>D. discoideum</italic> phosphorylation of myosin takes place at three threonine residues in the tail region by myosin II heavy chain kinases (MHCKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luck-Vielmetter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaillancourt et al., 1988</xref>). Phosphorylated myosin is inactive and does not assemble into filaments, whereas unphosphorylated myosin II can spontaneously assemble into bipolar filaments. It is only these filaments that perform cellular myosin II functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egelhoff et al., 1993</xref>). Significant knowledge about the function of myosin II regulation has been derived from mutant myosin IIs: 3XALA myosin, where the three phosphorylatable threonines have been mutated to alanine, rendering it a poor substrate for MHCKs; and 3XASP myosin, where the three threonines were replaced by aspartate, mimicking the phosphorylated state. 3XALA myosin mutants show significant myosin overassembly in cytoskeletal fractions and form stable myosin II filaments, which accumulate in the rear cortex. Cells expressing 3XALA myosin are drastically impaired in cell migration and chemotaxis, making frequent turns and extending lateral pseudopods, which is caused by the inability to disassemble myosin filaments, and these cells have severely affected motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egelhoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stites et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heid et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, 3XASP myosin does not assemble into bipolar filaments, is nonfunctional in vivo, and fails to complement cytokinesis and developmental defects of myosin II&#x02013;null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egelhoff et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Signaling pathways based on small GTPases of the Ras family regulate a myriad of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. The <italic>D. discoideum</italic> genome encodes a large and varied family of Ras GTPases consisting of 15 Ras proteins. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> uses its Ras proteins to regulate several pathways controlling cell motility and polarity, cytokinesis, phagocytosis and pinocytosis, and multicellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charest and Firtel, 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> expresses at least 25 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilkins et al., 2005</xref>). However, it does not code for conventional receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are the major inputs for Ras signaling in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>). Functions of some of the RasGEFs are slowly being understood through mutant analysis. The <italic>gefA<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<italic>aimless</italic>) cells fail to aggregate upon starvation and are unable to synthesize and respond to cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Insall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kae et al., 2007</xref>), showing phenotypic similarities to <italic>rasC<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, indicating that they may act to regulate activation of adenylyl cyclase. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate binding proteins GbpC and D, which have RasGEF domains, show altered myosin II localization during chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosgraaf et al., 2005</xref>). Cyclic guanosine monophosphate and GbpC induce myosin II filament formation, but its corresponding Ras GTPase has not been identified. GbpD is thought to activate Rap1 and regulate cell surface adhesion and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kortholt et al., 2006</xref>). RasG, the most abundant Ras in vegetative cells and the closest relative to mammalian Ras, is thought to regulate several actin cytoskeleton&#x02013;based processes like cell polarity and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tuxworth et al., 1997</xref>). RasGEF R appears to be required for maximal activation of RasG upon response to cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kae et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we have focused on RasGEF Q. Our experiments identify RasB as a substrate for RasGEF Q. They further indicate that RasGEF Q acts upstream of RasB and regulates processes requiring myosin II, like cytokinesis, cell motility, and suppression of lateral pseudopods. Mutants lacking RasGEF Q show myosin overassembly caused by high levels of unphosphorylated myosin II and produce many random pseudopodia. Cells that overexpress the GEF domain of RasGEF Q have constitutively activated RasB, which is normally activated during aggregation upon a cAMP stimulus, and have defects in cytokinesis in suspension as do <italic>mhcA<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells. Our results also imply an involvement of MHCK A as a downstream regulator of the signaling cascade. We observe that cells that overexpress the GEF domain have higher levels of MHCK A recruited to the cytoskeletal fractions, which occurs when MHCK A is activated in response to cAMP. Furthermore, RasGEF Q is involved in cell sorting and developmental patterning and slug motility.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Domain organization, expression pattern, and functional dissection of RasGEF Q</title><p>RasGEF Q, encoded by the <italic>gefQ</italic> gene, is a 1298-aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 143,000. Apart from the RasGEF domains, it contains a DEP domain (a domain conserved among fly Dishevelled, worm Egl10, and mammalian Pleckstrin) separating the two RasGEF domains and a predicted coiled-coil region at the N terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). RasGEF Q mRNA as examined by RT-PCR analysis of cDNA is present throughout development with elevated levels during aggregation and the loose mound stage (6&#x02013;8 h of starvation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilkins et al., 2005</xref>). Monoclonal antibody K-70-187-1 generated against the DEP domain of RasGEF Q recognized a protein of the expected size, which was present in vegetative cells and in early development till the aggregation stage (6 h) but could not be detected later (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Instead, a smaller and less intense band was seen at subsequent stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, asterisk). The smaller band could arise by translation from a downstream start (ATG) site at position 565. The sequence between both start sites is highly AT rich and could function as an alternative promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Architecture and expression of RasGEF Q and localization of RasGEF Q domains.</bold> (A) Schematic diagram of RasGEF Q depicting its domain organization and constructs used in the study.

We observed that in fixed vegetative (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom) and aggregation-competent cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top), GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> was localized throughout the cytosol but was also enriched in the cortex, colocalizing with actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). When living cells expressing GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> were observed, cells appeared more flat and adhered to the surface, having long filopodia-like protrusions, and the protein was localized throughout the cytosol (Videos 1&#x02013;4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1</ext-link>). To analyze the functions of different domains of RasGEF Q, we expressed the corresponding GFP fusion proteins in AX2. In fixed cells, the RasGEF domain (GFP-GEF) was present throughout the cytosol but was enriched at the cell cortex where it colocalized with F-actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, first row, carats) and was also present in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, first row, arrowheads). Live cell analysis showed that the protein was present throughout the cells. It was also observed in the nucleus, and in moving cells it accumulated in extending pseudopods (Video 5). Cells expressing GFP-&#x00394;GEF-GEFQ, which corresponds to the N-terminal domain (aa 173&#x02013;654), distributed throughout the cytoplasm with enrichment in the cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, second row).

To further investigate the colocalization of GFP-GEF with F-actin in the cortex, we used latrunculin A (LatA), a drug that binds to actin monomers and prevents polymerization. Treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M LatA for 40 min led to a loss of cortical F-actin. In parallel, the cortical localization of GFP-GEF was lost, whereas its nuclear localization and the cytoplasmic staining were not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This indicates that the GEF domain is recruited to the cortical region by F-actin. To test whether the GEF domain directly interacts with actin filaments, we performed cosedimentation assays. We used the GST-tagged GEF domain in these assays and found that it cosedimented with actin filaments by high speed centrifugation at 120,000 <italic>g</italic>, whereas the fusion protein alone stayed in the supernatant. The GST-GEF interaction with F-actin occurred even at high salt concentrations (100 mM KCl), which is known to drastically reduce the binding efficiency of several actin binding proteins like &#x003b1;-actinin, comitin, and plastin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prassler et al., 1997</xref>). We then used cells overexpressing GFP-GEF and prepared cytoskeletal fractions. Supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and distribution of GFP-GEF in either fraction was tested with a GFP monoclonal antibody. We found that GFP-GEF was present in the cytoskeletal pellet and the supernatant fractions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Association of the C-terminal part of RasGEF Q with F-actin.</bold> (A) The cortical localization of GFP-GEF is sensitive to LatA treatment.

For interference with the actin cytoskeleton we used 10 &#x003bc;M LatA, which forms 1:1 complexes with actin monomers and inhibits actin polymerization, and 20 &#x003bc;M cytochalasin D, a drug that binds to the growing or barbed end (&#x0002b; end) of F-actin filaments and prevents addition of G-actin at these sites. Blebbistatin (used at 100 &#x003bc;M) is a drug that blocks the myosin heads and lowers the affinity of myosin for actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kovacs et al., 2004</xref>). We found that in control cells treated with DMSO (solvent for the drugs), GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> showed a cytosolic staining and was present in cortical regions of the cell colocalizing with actin. Upon treatment with LatA, the cells rounded up, the typical cortical actin staining was lost, and a patchy pattern appeared. GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> was present in the cytosol. On treatment with cytochalasin D, we observed the cells rounding up and actin staining in the cortex was fragmented. In this case, GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> was also seen in the periphery of the cell together with actin. Treatment with Blebbistatin did not alter the cell morphology or the actin staining and GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> was still enriched in the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Thus, LatA that disrupts the cortical actin cytoskeleton also affects the localization of GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>172</sup> at the cortex. Collectively, our results imply that RasGEF Q associates with F-actin in vitro and in vivo and that the C-terminal region containing the RasGEF domain may mediate this binding.</p></sec><sec><title>RasGEF Q&#x02013;null cells have defects in developmental patterning and slug motility</title><p>To study the functions of RasGEF Q in vivo we generated cells lacking RasGEF Q. <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells were generated by homologous recombination, screened by genomic PCR on genomic DNA, and confirmed by Southern and Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1</ext-link>). Multicellular morphogenesis can be described in its most basic form as a process where cells in a group undergo coordinated changes in cell shape and motility to form an organized structure to perform a particular function. The process of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development is one such example of programmed multicellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chisholm and Firtel, 2004</xref>). Involvement of the cytoskeleton in such processes that require continuous cellular changes is a prerequisite. When developed on nutrient-deficient agar plates, AX2 cells form aggregates by 8 h and tipped mounds by 13 h. The tip elongates to form a standing finger that falls down, becoming a migratory slug or pseudoplasmodium by 16 h. Development is completed by 20&#x02013;24 h with the formation of fruiting bodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A,</xref> top; and Video 7 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710111/DC1</ext-link>).<italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells initiate the developmental program, but in &#x0003e;50% of the mounds, multiple tips arise from a single mound by 13&#x02013;14 h and, as a result, fruiting bodies are smaller than in AX2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle; and Video 8). <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells formed slugs that were relatively smaller, their ability to move was greatly reduced, and they did not perform phototaxis toward a directed light source. In contrast, slugs from AX2 cells expressing GFP-GEF were able to move and perform phototaxis, but the migration was more disoriented compared with AX2.

Using a monoclonal antibody that detects both the phosphorylated (&#x0223c;145 kD) and unphosphorylated (130 kD) forms of MHCK A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steimle et al., 2001</xref>), we found that <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells and cells overexpressing GFP-GEF have both unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated MHCK A. We then analyzed the amounts of MHCK A associated with cytoskeletal fractions, as the cytoskeleton-associated protein represents the active autophosphorylated form of MHCK A. We found that <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells and AX2 cells have similar amounts of MHCK A associated with the cytoskeletal fractions. In contrast, cells overexpressing the GEF domain had at least twofold higher levels of MHCK A associated with the cytoskeletal fractions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if activated Ras could transduce signals for regulation of myosin II, we used the GST-Byr2(RBD) to pull down active Ras from GFP-GEF cells at 6 h and found MHCK A in pulldown eluates with active RasB (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Pulldown eluates did not contain myosin II. Thus, MHCK A, which directly regulates myosin II phosphorylation, may either bind directly to active Ras or associate with complexes containing active Ras, suggesting that it might be regulated by Ras upon activation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>RasGEF Q in regulation of myosin II functions</title><p>Our studies on RasGEF Q reveal that it is required for regulation of myosin II&#x02013;based cellular functions, like cytokinesis and cell shape during chemotaxis, and also affects late developmental decisions. We provide evidence for RasB being a substrate for RasGEF Q and propose that regulation of myosin II functions by RasGEF Q occurs predominantly through RasB. Cells lacking RasGEF Q show myosin II overassembly associated with the inability to suppress lateral pseudopods, which is similar to that observed in 3XALA myosin II mutants. We show that the myosin overassembly is caused by higher levels of unphosphorylated myosin II in these cells, so the defect in myosin phosphorylation might arise from an inability to activate MHCKs. Cells that overexpress the GEF domain of RasGEF Q have a cytokinesis defect in suspension, and these cells also have high levels of constitutively activated RasB. We identified RasB as the substrate for RasGEF Q through in vivo and in vitro binding assays and found that RasB is activated upon cAMP, which indicates an involvement of cAMP and cAMP receptors (seven transmembrane G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors [GPCRs]) in the process of activation.</p><p>We note that RasGEF Q associates with F-actin. The C-terminal region containing the catalytic GEF domain is a possible region involved in F-actin association. The cortical localization of both GFP-RasGEF Q<sup>173</sup> and GFP-GEF are sensitive to Latrunculin A, indicating that an intact cytoskeleton is required for localization of RasGEF Q to the cortex. We also note that RasGEF Q can associate with myosin II and MHCK A, which is also sensitive to Latrunculin A. These results indicate that the F-actin cytoskeleton acts as a scaffold to recruit the signaling complex and that when the F-actin network is disassembled the signaling components do not meet. Myosin II is an F-actin cross-linking protein and, upon a cAMP stimulus, MHCK A localizes to the cell cortex with the help of F-actin. At this point when all the signaling components are assembled, it is critical for RasGEF Q to be in its active state to elicit downstream effects. Signaling components like RasGEFs are active only temporarily, the activation has to be appropriately controlled, and the downstream signals are amplified by orders of magnitude. It is likely that RasGEF Q is active for a very short time after a cAMP stimulus only.</p><p>We ruled out the possibility that RasGEF Q might activate RasG, another Ras isoform. Cells lacking RasG show a cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tuxworth et al., 1997</xref>), whereas in cells that overexpress the GEF domain of RasGEF Q resulting in constitutively high levels of active Ras, we see a cytokinesis defect and, thus, activation of RasG might be independent of RasGEF Q. We also provide a function for the less well understood function of the DEP domain in RasGEF Q, as our results point to the DEP domain acting as an autoregulatory domain of RasGEF Q. Under vegetative conditions when RasB is not activated, the DEP domain can bind to the GEF domain and RasGEF Q is in an inactive conformation. Upon starvation, GPCRs can induce a conformational change upon cAMP binding whereby the DEP domain inhibition is released and, thus, GPCRs activate RasGEF Q, which activates RasB.</p><p>We observed that myosin in <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells has a higher pI, possibly because of higher levels of unphosphorylated myosin II. A higher level of unphosphorylated myosin II is the cause of myosin overassembly in the cortex in <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells. This also implies a role of MHCK in the process. In <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, the most immediate regulators of myosin II are MHCKs. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> has four MHCKs (A&#x02013;D), among which MHCK A has been most extensively studied. MhckA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells exhibit a partial, but significant, level of myosin II overassembly because of higher levels of unphosphorylated myosin II. Overexpression of MHCK A elicits defects comparable to those observed in myosin II&#x02013;null cells, namely a blocked cytokinesis in suspension and arrested development in the mound stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolman et al., 1996</xref>). In chemotaxing cells, MHCK A relocalizes to the actin rich cortex in the anterior of the cell, where it presumably functions to phosphorylate and disassemble myosin II at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steimle et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The GEF domain of RasGEF Q has the ability to coprecipitate MHCK A and myosin II in an F-actin&#x02013;dependent manner. In accordance with the fact that RasGEF Q regulates myosin II functions by regulating MHCK A, we observed that cells overexpressing the GEF domain have a twofold higher level of MHCK A associated with cytoskeletal fractions. This is the result of MHCK A activation by autophosphorylation, whereupon it associates with the actin cytoskeleton in aggregation-competent cells that are stimulated with cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steimle et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, overexpression of the GEF domain causes larger amounts of MHCK A to be activated. In contrast, MHCK A distribution in cytoskeletal fractions is normal in <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, indicating that RasGEF Q plays a role in facilitating MHCK A recruitment to the cytoskeleton and that other (probably passive) processes are important for returning the kinase to the cytosol. Furthermore, the C terminus of RasGEF Q, which harbours the GEF domain, has the potential to bind to F-actin directly in F-actin cosedimentation assays. These results also suggest that the actin cytoskeleton may serve as a scaffold to recruit a signaling complex at the leading edge. RasB, which is activated by RasGEF Q, may promote myosin II phosphorylation by regulating the activity of MHCK A (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), which leads to phosphorylation of myosin II followed by elimination of filamentous myosin II from the leading edge. In a mutant situation where RasGEF Q is absent, RasB would not be active and MHCK A activation would be limited and would result in higher levels of unphosphorylated myosin and, thus, myosin II overassembly in the cortex in these cells. In a situation where we overexpress the catalytic GEF domain of RasGEF Q, we see constitutively high levels of activated RasB, which activates MHCK A, leading to higher levels of phosphorylated myosin II. Because phosphorylated myosin II cannot assemble into filaments that are required to provide force during cytokinesis, these cells fail to divide in suspension. Such a system may be very useful for <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and the expansion of the functional roles for Ras proteins may compensate for the lack of Rho GTPases or its effector molecule ROCK, which regulate myosin II functions in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2000</xref>)</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for a role of RasGEF Q in regulating Myosin II functions.</bold> For details see Discussion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810747f09"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title>RasGEF Q in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development</title><p>The process of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development is an example of programmed multicellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chisholm and Firtel, 2004</xref>), where cells that form and organize the multicellular organism undergo continuous coordinated changes in shape and motility that require the cytoskeleton. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> tip formation is an event that can serve as a model to understand similar developmental processes in other organisms. Normally, only one tip arises from a mound and this apical tip serves as an organizer to control morphogenesis of the organism by acting as a cAMP oscillator from which waves are initiated and propagated posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siegert and Weijer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siegert and Weijer, 1995</xref>).

Besides <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, mutations in other components of signal transduction cascades lead to similar defects. A defect in Scar, a WASP-related protein identified in a mutant screen which suppresses phenotypes of <italic>cAR2<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, also leads to a multiple-tipped phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bear et al., 1998</xref>) as well as overexpression of an activated RasD<italic><sup>G12T</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reymond et al., 1986</xref>). Similarly, a double knockout of two isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K<sup>1&#x02212;/2&#x02212;</sup>) and overexpression of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1 also resulted in the multiple-tip phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Multiple tips arising from <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> mounds may result from the formation of more than one oscillator (or embryogenic organizer). It is also possible that a single embryogenic organizer subdivides to form multiple organizers, causing the multiple-tip phenotype. The tip of the slug is also critical in sensing light and phototactic migration of the slugs. <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> mounds gave rise to slugs, but when analyzed for their ability to migrate in phototaxis assays they showed severe impairment. In contrast, slugs from cells overexpressing GFP-GEF formed migratory slugs but their orientation toward the light source was severely impaired.

Absence of RasGEF Q may cause defects in proper directional movement of cells within the slug necessary to maintain proper spatial patterning. The cell-autonomous nature of this defect in <italic>gefQ</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants may suggest a role of RasGEF Q in processing external signals. Similar patterns of mutant cell distributions in chimeras have been reported for cells lacking the GPCR CrlA, G protein G&#x003b1;5, or ERK1 protein kinase, suggesting that these components might function in the same or related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaskins et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Natarajan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raisley et al., 2004</xref>). The findings that myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain are required for cell patterning during <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development may also be relevant for RasGEF Q regulating myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eliott et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1998</xref>).

The regulatory light chain of myosin has also been thought to be required for directional sorting of prestalk EcmAO cells at the tip of a developing mound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clow et al., 2000</xref>). Although RasGEF Q transcripts are present throughout development, a protein of higher molecular mass is present in the first 6 h of development and a smaller isoform generated by an alternative promoter is present in low amounts during later stages of development. This smaller form of the protein might have functions in regulating processes in late development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and development</title><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells of strain AX2 were grown either with <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> on SM agar plates or axenically in liquid nutrient medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claviez et al., 1982</xref>) in shaking suspension at 160 rpm at 21&#x000b0;C. <italic>gefQ<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells were cultivated in nutrient medium containing 7 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Invitrogen).

The strips were then focused on the IPGphor system (GE Healthcare) with a current limit of 50 &#x003bc;A per strip at 20&#x000b0;C with the following program: 1 h at 200 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1,000 V, gradient to 8,000 V in 1 h, and a final focusing step at 8,000 V for 28 kVh. After IEF, the strips were briefly rinsed with water and prepared for the second dimension by a two-step equilibration and cystine alkylation process. The strips were incubated two times in equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% vol/vol glycerol, and bromophenol blue) for 12 min, in which 1% (wt/vol) DTT (step one) or 4% (wt/vol) iodoacetamide were added, respectively. Subsequently, the strips were loaded on SDS gels (8% acrylamide) and resolved in the second dimension. Gels were subjected to immunoblotting using myosin II&#x02013;specific monoclonal antibody mAb 56&#x02013;396-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pagh and Gerisch, 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Miscellaneous methods</title><p>For treatment with drugs, cells were treated with 10 &#x003bc;M Lat A, 20 &#x003bc;M cytochalasin D, or 100 &#x003bc;M blebbistatin in nutrient medium with shaking for 40 min. Cells were fixed with 3% PFA/picric acid and stained for F-actin using TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) or cold methanol, and actin was detected with mAb act1&#x02013;7.
