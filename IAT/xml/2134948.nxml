Viruses, in turn, have evolved elaborate mechanisms to subvert apoptotic processes. Here, we report that a novel viral mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein (vMAP) of murine &#x003b3;-herpesvirus 68 (&#x003b3;HV-68) interacts with Bcl-2 and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in a genetically separable manner. The N-terminal region of vMAP interacted with Bcl-2, and this interaction markedly increased not only Bcl-2 recruitment to mitochondria but also its avidity for BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby suppressing Bax mitochondrial translocation and activation. In addition, the central and C-terminal hydrophobic regions of vMAP interacted with VDAC1. Consequently, these interactions resulted in the effective inhibition of cytochrome c release, leading to the comprehensive inhibition of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. Finally, vMAP gene was required for efficient &#x003b3;HV-68 lytic replication in normal cells, but not in mitochondrial apoptosis-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that &#x003b3;HV-68 vMAP independently targets two important regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis-mediated intracellular innate immunity, allowing efficient viral lytic replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Apoptosis is a conserved cell death program that contributes to restriction of viral replication and elimination of infected cells. Whether triggered via internal inducers such as DNA damage or via external stimuli such as engagement of the death receptor, apoptosis takes place through a cascade of regulated internal proteolytic digestion, resulting in a collapse of cellular infrastructure, mitochondrial potential, genomic fidelity, and cell membrane integrity. Indeed, apoptosis represents a predominant form of virally infected cell demise. In response, viruses have evolved numerous ways of circumventing this host-cell apoptosis. Most of the DNA viruses including murine &#x003b3;-herpesvirus 68 (&#x003b3;HV-68) are genetically equipped with anti-apoptotic ability to ensure viral replication and propagation. The authors have identified a new viral mitochondrial protein (vMAP) of &#x003b3;HV-68 that interacts with Bcl-2 and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in a genetically separable manner. These interactions markedly suppress Bax mitochondrial translocation and activation and inhibit cytochrome c release, leading to the comprehensive inhibition of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. The authors also demonstrate that vMAP gene is required for efficient &#x003b3;HV-68 lytic replication in normal cells, but not in mitochondrial apoptosis-deficient cells. These findings are entirely novel and significantly advance our understanding of how virus escapes host intracellular apoptosis-mediated innate immunity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Feng P, Liang C, Shin YC, E X, Zhang W, et al.

Whether initiated by receptor ligation at the cell surface or through signal transduction from intracellular organelles, both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways degrade cellular components, leading to the complete dismantling of targeted cells. Particularly, mitochondria serve as gatekeepers for the life-or-death decision, conveying apoptotic signals by releasing death-promoting factors (e.g., cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and DIABLO/Smac from the intermembrane space &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Recent studies have largely elucidated the complex mechanism that eukaryotes have evolved to regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis, particularly with regard to Bcl-2 homology (BH) family proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Bcl-2 family members are classified as either anti-apoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Bcl-w, and A1) or pro-apoptotic, the latter of which can be further divided into the multi-BH domain and BH3-only subgroups. Similar to anti-apoptotic proteins, the multi-BH domain members, such as Bax and Bak, adopt a globular fold consisting of up to nine a-helices that form an extended hydrophobic cleft on the surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This cleft serves as an authentic BH3-binding site that mediates their translocation and oligomerization within the mitochondrial outer membrane and, ultimately, mitochondrial permeabilization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Additional regulation of the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the permeability transition pore (PTP), a complex composed of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). VDAC is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and its transmembrane can form a barrel with a pore size consistent with the estimated open-channel diameter to allow the escape of cytochrome c. A direct interaction between Bcl-2 family members and VDAC may control cytochrome c permeation across membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, VDAC-mediated closure of the PTP supercomplex may prevent ATP/ADP exchange across the membrane, which ultimately results in outer membrane permeabilization and subsequent release of pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space; this, in turn, triggers apoptosis in the cytoplasm or nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Although current studies favor the latter model, these hypotheses may not be mutually exclusive in defining the nature of the PTP complex.</p><p>Apoptosis is part of host innate immunity that eliminates the propagation of intracellular pathogens such as viruses. As a countermeasure, viruses have evolved to encode numerous open reading frames (ORFs) to circumvent cellular apoptotic pathways. Herpesviruses, particularly &#x003b3;-herpesviruses, including human Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus, and murine &#x003b3;-herpesvirus 68 (&#x003b3;HV-68), provide unique models for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic regulation. A common aspect of these &#x003b3;-herpesviruses is that they encode viral homologs of Bcl-2, designated vBcl-2, and these vBcl-2 genes effectively prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis upon various stress responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. vBcl-2 has been speculated to serve a vital role in the virus lifecycle by inhibiting the premature apoptotic death of host cells during acute replication, allowing completion of viral replication cycle and favoring the spread of progeny virus. However, the previous studies have found that &#x003b3;HV-68 vBcl-2 has no role during acute infection but its activity is critical specifically to latent infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, to identify viral protein that evades host apoptosis-mediated innate immunity during acute infection, we searched for mitochondrial proteins within the &#x003b3;HV-68 genome. We report that viral mitochondrial anti-apoptosis protein (vMAP) specifically interacts with cellular Bcl-2/Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and VDAC and that these interactions effectively dampen host apoptotic processes, which ultimately contributes to efficient lytic replication in culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The &#x003b3;HV-68 vMAP Gene Encodes a Mitochondrial Anti-Apoptotic Protein</title><p>To test the role of the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis in &#x003b3;HV-68 replication, wild-type (wt) and Bax<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Bak<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double knockout (DKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with a GFP-containing &#x003b3;HV-68 (&#x003b3;HV-68&#x00394;K3-GFP). DKO MEFs supported &#x003b3;HV-68&#x00394;K3-GFP replication with accelerated kinetics as compared with wt MEFs: the virus titer in DKO MEFs was 50&#x02013;100 times higher than that in wt MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg001">S1</xref>B).

These results indicate that mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis plays a negative role in &#x003b3;HV-68 lytic replication, suggesting that &#x003b3;HV-68 needs to deregulate this pathway to maximize its propagation. To search for the potential mitochondrial protein(s) encoded by &#x003b3;HV-68, we employed two computer programs, MITOProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mips.gsf.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter">http://mips.gsf.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter</ext-link>) and PSORT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/">http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/</ext-link>), which assess the likelihood of each candidate viral gene product to be targeted to the mitochondrion. This survey identified an M8 gene product &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; that we have named vMAP. vMAP is present in the second exon of ORF57 and shares the identical nucleotide sequence with ORF57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, vMAP has a &#x0002b;1 shift in reference to ORF57 frame, thus encoding a polypeptide of distinct amino acid sequence from ORF57. vMAP contains 157 amino acids, with a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at its N-terminus and a putative transmembrane domain at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). vMAP protein was readily detected during &#x003b3;HV-68 lytic replication with an apparent molecular weight of 16 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, left panel). However, we failed to detect vMAP protein in &#x003b3;HV-68 latently infected S11 cells under the same conditions (unpublished data). When vMAP expression vector was transfected into NIH3T3 cells, however, vMAP migrated as 7-, 14-, and 16-kDa species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel). Mutational analyses indicated that the 7- and 14-kDa proteins were derived from translational initiation at the third (Met<sub>70</sub>) and second (Met<sub>21</sub>) internal initiation codon, respectively (unpublished data). Intracellular fractionation demonstrated that vMAP was present exclusively in the mitochondrion-enriched heavy membrane (HM) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel). The position and integrity of the fraction was confirmed by the presence of the mitochondrial resident protein COX4. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy also showed that vMAP was present in the cytoplasm extensively colocalized with MitoTracker, a dye that specifically labels mitochondria in living cells, and with Hsp60 and cytochrome c mitochondrial resident proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg002">S2</xref>A, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg002">S2</xref>C). GFP fusions containing the N-terminal region of vMAP were constructed to define the MTS of vMAP. The N-terminal 40 residues of vMAP were sufficient to target GFP to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, this N-terminal sequence of vMAP is predicted to contain &#x003b1;-helical structure, followed by a stretch of positively charged residues that are the potential MTS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In fact, deletion mutations within this motif considerably impaired the mitochondrial localization of GFP fusions containing vMAP N-terminal sequences in confocal microscopy and intracellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg002">S2</xref>B). Of note, the vMAP(1&#x02013;30)-GFP and vMAP(21&#x02013;49)-GFP also showed the nuclear localization, which was likely contributed by GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These results indicate that the N-terminal 40 residues are sufficient for mitochondrial targeting activity.</p><fig id="ppat-0030174-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Genomic Localization and Protein Organization of &#x003b3;HV-68 vMAP</title><p>(A) vMAP is encoded within the ORF57.

Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that vMAP interacted with cellular Bcl-2 in transiently vMAP-expressing 293T cells and in &#x003b3;HV-68-infected NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg003">S3</xref>A). In addition, vMAP interaction with cellular Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> was readily detected in &#x003b3;HV-68-infected NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Despite the equivalent expression of three different species of vMAP in 293T cells, the 16-kDa vMAP predominantly interacted with Bcl-2, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence of vMAP is likely required for Bcl-2 interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). To further define the interaction between vMAP and Bcl-2 family proteins, a mammalian GST fusion protein containing vMAP (1&#x02013;50) was coexpressed in 293T cells along with HA-tagged Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, Bid, or Bad. vMAP(1&#x02013;50)-GST efficiently interacted with Bcl-2 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> but not with Bax, Bak, Bad, or Bid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and unpublished data). However, vMAP&#x00394;20-GST fusion lacking the N-terminal 20 amino acids completely lost its ability to bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, the N-terminal sequence containing the first 20 amino acids of vMAP is predicted to adopt an amphipathic helical structure and share limited similarity with the BH3 peptide of Bad (unpublished data). However, deletion mutation analysis indicated that unlike the BH3 peptide binding that requires the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Bcl-2, the vMAP binding required the Bcl-2 85&#x02013;186-aa region containing the BH1 and BH3 domains only in living cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B).

Additionally, vMAP binds to the mitochondrial VDAC1 through its internal and C-terminal hydrophobic sequences, thereby inhibiting cytochrome c release upon apoptotic stresses. Taken together, these data indicate that vMAP engages cellular Bcl-2 and VDAC apoptosis checkpoint proteins to comprehensively inhibit the mitochondrion-mediated intracellular innate immunity, which allows completion of efficient viral lytic replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g009">Figure 9</xref>E).</p><p>Previous functional studies have classified BH3-only proteins as either death agonists such as Bid and Bim or survival antagonists like Bad &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, this has been formally proposed as the &#x0201c;hierarchy model&#x0201d;, which postulates that the survival antagonist mainly promotes apoptosis by neutralizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, the death agonist induces a conformational change, oligomerization, and activation of Bax/Bak through a &#x0201c;hit-and-run&#x0201d; mechanism, thereby amplifying apoptotic signaling with a limited amount of cleaved Bid or dephosphorylated Bim &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In normal cells, the death agonist is held in check by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. When apoptosis is triggered, the survival antagonist binds to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that release the death agonist, which subsequently activates Bax or Bak. This model places the survival antagonist upstream of the death agonist. Thus, BH3-only proteins display a synergistic effect in activating Bax/Bak and inducing apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data is in support of the hierarchy model regarding the action of BH3-only molecules. Conceivably, vMAP interaction may activate Bcl-2/Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to adopt their anti-apoptotic conformation, effectively neutralizing the pro-apoptotic BH3-only molecules through a direct interaction, which ultimately blocks Bax activation. It has been shown that cellular orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 has an activity to modulate Bcl-2 conformation and convert Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic molecule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that vMAP may resemble Nur77 by altering cellular Bcl-2/Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> conformation, but this activity transforms Bcl-2 into an anti-apoptotic conformation rather than a pro-apoptotic form. However, it should be noted that the vMAP exhibits no specificity in Bcl-2 interactions with the death agonist Bid or the survival antagonist Bad. It is possible that vMAP increases the pool of activated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in general, which is reflected by the elevated interaction with Bid as well as Bad. In contradiction to the hierarchy model, BH3-only molecules have recently been proposed to induce apoptosis primarily through neutralization of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins, but not through activation of Bax/Bak &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The reason for this seemingly discrepancy between these two models is not clear and may be derived from various different mutant proteins and functional tests that each study relied on &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, further studies are required to resolve this issue regarding BH3-only molecules. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the vMAP facilitates the interactions of Bcl-2/Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> with Bid/Bad BH3-only molecules, which neutralizes Bid/Bad pro-apoptotic activity, inhibits Bax activation, and thereby likely raises the threshold for cells to execute apoptosis.</p><p>In addition to Bax/Bak activation, the PTP complex represents an additional apoptotic checkpoint within the mitochondrial membrane. Along with accessory components, the PTP complex is mainly composed of ANT and VDAC that connect the mitochondrial outer membrane with its inner membrane at contact sites. Although ANT and VDAC may not be required for mitochondrion permeabilization, accumulating data indicate that they are implicated in releasing pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Cellular Bcl-2 family proteins and viral polypeptides differentially modulate the PTP complex through a direct interaction with ANT, VDAC, or their accessory components, and therefore regulate apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Our present study adds vMAP to the expanding family of proteins that influence the permeability transition by virtue of protein&#x02013;protein interactions. The two vMAP LLxL repeats independently mediate an interaction with VDAC1 that is required to efficiently inhibit cytochrome c release, an indication of the mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><p>We have defined two functional domains within vMAP: the N-terminal Bcl-2-binding domain and the central/C-terminal VDAC1 interaction domain. It is reasonable to speculate the potential presence of a ternary complex consisting of vMAP, Bcl-2, and VDAC1. Given that Bcl-2 physically and functionally interacts with VDAC1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, the introduction of vMAP to this complex may influence the Bcl-2/VDAC1 interaction if a ternary complex is present. However, we observed no detectable effect of vMAP on the interaction between Bcl-2 and VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). On the other hand, it is also possible that vMAP independently binds to cellular Bcl-2 or VDAC1. Consistent with this, the aforementioned two binding domains of vMAP are genetically separable in that mutations within each domain only affect its corresponding interaction, leaving the other interaction intact. Alternatively, the formation of a ternary complex may be dependent on the integrity of a lipid bilayer. Therefore, additional approaches other than traditional immunoprecipitation are required to assess vMAP interactions with Bcl-2 and VDAC1.</p><p>While both Bcl-2 and VDAC1 interactions are essential for vMAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, Bcl-2 binding seems to be more functionally important in vMAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis than that of VDAC1. This is consistent with the findings that Bax and Bak are the essential players that open the mitochondrial gate to the cell death program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, Bcl-2 family proteins are also important in regulating cytochrome c release during apoptosis. Indeed, vMAP&#x00394;20 that no longer bound to Bcl-2 partially lost its activity to inhibit cytochrome c release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). While vMAP L/A mutant that no longer bound to VDAC1 significantly failed to block cytochrome c release, a detectable amount of cytochrome c was still retained in the mitochondrion in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). These data support the idea that vMAP interaction with Bcl-2 also plays a role in the inhibition of cytochrome c release. Taken together, these results indicate that vMAP interactions with both Bcl-2 and VDAC1 synergistically contribute to its inhibition on the mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>The N-terminal MTS of vMAP entirely overlaps with its Bcl-2 binding motif. This suggests that the N-terminal deletion mutation, vMAP&#x00394;20, may ablate two functions of vMAP simultaneously: Bcl-2 binding and mitochondrial targeting. However, the results of cell fractionation and confocal microscopy showed that the majority of vMAP&#x00394;20 still localized to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg002">S2</xref>D). This indicates that vMAP&#x00394;20 mutation ablates only the Bcl-2 binding activity without significantly affecting vMAP mitochondrial localization. This also suggests the presence of additional mitochondrial targeting sequence. Unfortunately, our GFP fusion strategy failed to identify additional linear sequence for its mitochondrial localization (unpublished data). This implies that, perhaps, a higher order of structure of vMAP may be required to function as an MTS as seen with VDAC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The cleavable N-terminal MTS generally sends protein into the matrix or interior membrane of mitochondria, while the uncleavable N-terminal MTS targets protein into the outer membrane of mitochondria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, vMAP N-terminal MTS appeared to be not cleaved based on its molecular weight in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030174-g004">4</xref>A). Additionally, a mutation at the potential mitochondrial signal peptide cleavage site of vMAP did not affect its mitochondrial localization (unpublished data). These results collectively suggest that an alternative MTS exists in addition to the N-terminal MTS.</p><p>The expression profile and function activity of &#x003b3;HV-68 vMAP has unique features. First, vMAP is present within the second exon of the ORF57 transcript, which encodes an immediate early gene product that is essential for viral replication, a homolog of herpes simplex virus ICP27 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that the vMAP gene has co-evolved with ORF57 and likely plays a critical role in &#x003b3;HV-68 replication. Second, the putative N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical region of vMAP has both mitochondrial targeting and Bcl-2-binding activities. Of note, the vMAP contains an unidentified MTS, in addition to its N-terminal MTS, that potentially targets vMAP to the outer membrane of mitochondria. Finally, vMAP targets two mitochondrial proteins, Bcl-2 and VDAC1, to affect a comprehensive inhibition of the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) vMIA uses a similar strategy to deregulate mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis: vMIA neutralizes and inhibits permeability transition pore activity through its direct interactions with Bax &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Intriguingly, vMIA is also encoded within the first exon of UL37 of HCMV, an immediate early gene transcript that is required for viral replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

Initially, the vMAP coding sequence was replaced with a Kan<sup>R</sup>/<italic>Lac</italic>Z cassette (&#x003b3;HV-68 Bac &#x00394;vMAP Kan<sup>R</sup>) by allelic exchange &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030174-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030174-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A).
