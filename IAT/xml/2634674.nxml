Moreover, low basal or induced RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> expression is a common feature of many human cancers, suggesting that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> may act as a tumour suppressor gene in the absence of supplemented retinoid. We have previously shown that low RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> expression is a feature of advanced neuroblastoma. Here, we demonstrate that the ABC domain of the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> protein alone was sufficient for the growth inhibitory effects of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> on neuroblastoma cells. ATP7A, the copper efflux pump, is a retinoid-responsive gene, was upregulated by ectopic overexpression of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>. The ectopic overexpression of the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> ABC domain was sufficient to induce ATP7A expression, whereas, RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> siRNA blocked the induction of ATP7A expression in retinoid-treated neuroblastoma cells. Forced downregulation of ATP7A reduced copper efflux and increased viability of retinoid-treated neuroblastoma cells. Copper supplementation enhanced cell growth and reduced retinoid-responsiveness, whereas copper chelation reduced the viability and proliferative capacity. Taken together, our data demonstrates ATP7A expression is regulated by retinoic acid receptor <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and it has effects on intracellular copper levels, revealing a link between the anticancer action of retinoids and copper metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>retinoic acid receptor <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>ATP7A</kwd><kwd>retinoids</kwd><kwd>copper and neuroblastoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Retinoic acid receptors are members of the nuclear receptor super family, which act as ligand-regulated <italic>trans</italic>-acting transcription factors that bind to <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA regulatory elements in the promoter regions of target genes. Three RAR subtypes (RAR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and RAR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) originating from three distinct genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Mangelsdorf <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Gronemeyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). RARs belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor super-family, which share a common domain structure, denoted A-F. The C region contains the DNA-binding domain, which is most conserved among the different members of this family and consists of two zinc fingers. The hormone-binding domain is located in the E region and contains, besides the binding domain, a dimerisation domain and a hormone-dependent transactivation function (AF-2). The N-terminal part of the receptor (AB) also contains an autonomous region involved in transactivation (AF-1), which functions independently from the ligand, when coupled with a heterologous DNA-binding domain. As the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus is not conserved among different receptors, they each may achieve this function by distinct means (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Evans, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Leid <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Of particular interest is the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> subtype, which regulates essential pathways associated with the anti-tumour effects of retinoids in epithelial cells. The RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> gene promoter contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE) to which the liganded RAR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/RXR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> heterodimer binds to induce RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Alvarez <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The expression of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> is frequently reduced in many neoplastic tissues when compared with their normal cellular counterparts, including non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, breast cancer and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Cheung <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Castillo <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib27">Picard <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The reactivation of silenced RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> upon induction of RAR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression and concomitant retinoic acid treatment was associated with a clinical response of oral leukoplakia (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Lotan <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). In a clinical study where renal carcinoma patients were treated with 13-<italic>cis</italic>-retinoic acid and interferon-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, the levels of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> increased in tumours that clinically responded to therapy (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Berg <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Copper plays an essential role in human physiology and is indispensable for normal growth and development. Enzymes that are involved in connective tissue formation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, iron transport and other essential physiological processes require copper as a cofactor to mediate their reactions. The transport and cellular metabolism of copper depends on a series of membrane proteins and smaller soluble peptides that comprise a functionally integrated system for maintaining cellular copper homeostasis. Two membrane-bound copper-transporting ATPase enzymes, ATP7A and ATP7B, can catalyse an ATP-dependent transfer of copper to intracellular compartments or expel copper from the cell (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">El Meskini <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), respectively. A truncated splice variant of ATP7A, termed NML45 (Nuclear Menkes Like) has also been described that encodes a theoretical 11.2-kDa protein with one copper-binding site, and may function as a nuclear copper chaperone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Reddy <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We have previously identified the copper metabolism gene ATP7A as a retinoid-regulated gene in neuroblastoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In non-neuronal cells, ATP7A is responsive to levels of intracellular copper, and is predominantly localised to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network when cytosolic copper levels are normal or low. In the presence of excess copper, ATP7A functions in copper excretion and a distinct pool of ATP7A is relocated to the plasma membrane through cytoplasmic vesicles. It is rapidly recycled, returning to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network once cytoplasmic copper levels are normal (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">La Fontaine <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Lutsenko and Petris, 2003</xref>). In neurons ATP7A is developmentally regulated, being initially expressed in cell bodies of developing neurons, with later expression shifting to the extending axons and peaking just prior to synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">El Meskini <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). ATP7A has an important function in neurodevelopment, and is involved in axonal targeting, synaptogenesis and maturation of olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">El Meskini <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> in mediating ligand-dependent and ligand-independent growth inhibition functions by using <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Our results show a previously unrecognised relationship between the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> and the anticancer effects of retinoids with ATP7A and intracellular copper levels.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cell lines were generously supplied by Dr J Biedler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre, NY, New York, USA).

The RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> deletion mutant proteins were transiently expressed in BE(2)-C cells, and, an anti-Myc epitope antibody identified the expression of all mutant proteins expected. Cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation after cells were grown in culture medium without doxycycline for 72&#x02009;h. Overexpression of the full length RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation compared with empty vector. Most importantly, overexpression of the ABC domain (&#x00394;DEF) of the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> protein alone was sufficient for the growth inhibitory effects of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> in BE(2)-C cells. In contrast, overexpression of CDEF (&#x00394;AB) and DEF (&#x00394;ABC) domains of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> did not decrease cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> regulates the expression of ATP7A in neuroblastoma cells</title><p>We have previously identified the copper efflux pump protein, ATP7A, as a retinoid-regulated gene using a cDNA microarray analysis of retinoid-treated neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Here, we examined the hypotheses that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> may regulate ATP7A, and, that ATP7A may be responsible for the growth suppressive effects of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> in neuroblastoma cells. We found that transcription of both the full-length ATP7A, and the ATP7A splice variant, NML45, were markedly induced by aRA in BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cells after treatment with 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> aRA for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with these findings, ATP7A protein expression was also induced by aRA after 3 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Retinoid-induced upregulation of ATP7A appeared to be specific for neuroblastoma cells, as we could not demonstrate an increase in ATP7A mRNA expression in skin, lung or breast cancer cells following retinoid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We have also observed that the aRA decreases ATP7A mRNA expression in oestrogen-receptor positive MCF7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-234 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells.</p><p>We have previously characterised two clonally-derived BE(2)-C cell lines stably overexpressing RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>, which exhibited growth suppression in the absence of added retinoid (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Cheung <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Both RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> clones demonstrated increased ATP7A and NML45 expression, when compared with empty vector transfectants. Interestingly, the levels of the splice variant NML45 does not correlate with the levels of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> in two different RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We next transiently transfected BE(2)-C cells with RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-specific siRNA, treated the cells with 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> aRA for 48&#x02009;h, and examined RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> and ATP7A expression. Consistent with our previous findings, expression of retinoid-induced RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> and ATP7A was coordinately decreased, compared with retinoid-untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, transiently expressing the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> full-length and the &#x00394;DEF deletion mutant, significantly increased ATP7A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, we found a close relationship between RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> and ATP7A expression levels, and growth inhibition in several different model systems, supporting the notion that ATP7A may mediate the retinoid ligand-dependent, and -independent, actions of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>The retinoid anti-cancer effect is mediated by effects on ATP7A and intracellular copper</title><p>We next examined the hypothesis that ATP7A mediates the effects of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> on neuroblastoma cells by its effects on intracellular copper metabolism. We measured copper efflux in neuroblastoma cells (BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y) which were pre-treated with 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> aRA over a time course of 8 days, then loaded with radioactive <sup>64</sup>Cu. After <sup>64</sup>Cu loading, cells were washed, then incubated in normal growth media to allow copper efflux over a short 4&#x02009;h time course. In both cell lines there was a higher copper efflux in cells pre-treated with aRA at 4&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the retinoid treatment affects the cell number at the end of the growth period, <sup>64</sup>Cu uptake was standardised against cell viability, as assessed by the Alamar Blue assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Retinoid treatment resulted in a marked decrease in <sup>64</sup>Cu accumulation in both SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C cells.</p><p>To directly examine the role of ATP7A in modulating copper efflux in neuroblastoma cells, we used siRNA specific for ATP7A. Transient transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with an ATP7A siRNA lead to a 36&#x00025; &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.018 s.e.m. reduction in ATP7A expression and a 27&#x00025; &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.015 s.e.m. reduction in the rate of copper efflux in retinoid-untreated cells, suggesting that the rate of copper efflux in this cell line was dependent on ATP7A, and, was proportional to the level of ATP7A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There was no effect on BE(2)-C cells. The ATP7A knock-down did not alter the copper accumulation in untreated SH-SY5Y or BE(2)-C cells. We next examined the effect of inhibiting ATP7A expression on the viability of retinoid-treated neuroblastoma cells. Owing to the combined toxicity of siRNA and retinoid treatment, the experiment was limited to 24&#x02009;h retinoid treatment, and a lower retinoid concentration of 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> aRA. In both SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C cells, a reduction in ATP7A expression of approximately 30&#x00025; correlated with an increase in cell viability in the Alamar Blue assay, compared with a non-specific siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effects of copper supplementation on the retinoid responses of neuroblastoma cells. BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cells were grown according to standard techniques, in the absence of added retinoid and supplemented with 0, 30, 100 and 300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> copper treatment for 48&#x02009;h. Cell proliferation was assessed using the BrdU incorporation assay. Supplementing BE(2)-C with 30, 100 and 300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> CuCl<sub>2</sub> significantly increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). None of the concentrations tested increased the proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cells were then grown for 7 days with 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> aRA, in the presence or absence of 30 and 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc> CuCl<sub>2</sub>. After 7 days, differentiation was assessed by neurite count. Added CuCl<sub>2</sub> significantly reduced neurite formation in BE(2)-C cells over the 7 day retinoid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the copper chelator, Triethylenetetramine (TETA), reduced the viability and proliferative capacity of BE(2)-C cells compared to cells grown without TETA. The effect was completely abrogated when TETA was added with equimolar CuCL<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Copper supplementation had no observable effect on retinoid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. In both cell lines copper supplementation did not affect the neurite count of cells grown in the absence of the added retinoid (data not shown).</p><p>Lastly, we investigated whether a combination of retinoid and copper chelator could increase their anti-cancer activity. Both BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with a single agent or a combination of aRA (1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc>) and TETA (60&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc>) for 72&#x02009;h. The effect of the copper chelator by itself had only a minor growth inhibitory effect on SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C cell lines, whereas the combination treatment of retinoid and copper chelator had a marked effect on cell viability and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A therapeutic role for retinoids in several human cancer types, including neuroblastoma, is well established. However, retinoids are not completely effective anti-cancer agents when used alone; thus, a better understanding of their mechanism of action will lead to more evidence-based retinoid combination therapies. In this study we have demonstrated that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> has a strong, retinoid-dependent and -independent, anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, we have, for the first time, identified a link between the retinoid anti-cancer signal and intracellular copper levels, which has important implications for the understanding of the tumorigenic process and therapy of neuroblastoma.</p><p>In human neuroblastoma cells, knocking down RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> expression resulted in a clear increase in cell proliferation, regardless of whether or not exogenous retinoid was added. Conversely, overexpression of RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> resulted in a strong decrease in cell proliferation. The RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> anti-proliferative effect required only the ABC domain (AF1 and DNA-binding domains), and not the retinoid-binding domain or receptor dimerisation interface. This result strongly suggests that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> has both retinoid-dependent and -independent anti-cancer functions.</p><p>In a previous study using the cDNA microarray, we found that the copper transporter ATP7A was strongly upregulated in neuroblastoma cells in response to retinoid (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In this study, we found that ATP7A protein expression is upregulated in neuroblastoma cells after retinoid treatment. As retinoid treatment did not result in similar upregulation of ATP7A expression in the non-neuronal cell lines, which tested, we suggest that retinoid regulation of ATP7A is tissue type-dependent and may be specific to neuronal cells. We have also shown that ATP7A upregulation can be achieved by ectopic expression of full-length RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> or the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub> ABC domain in the absence of added retinoid. Our data supports the notion that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>, directly or indirectly regulates ATP7A expression in a retinoid-dependent and -independent manner.</p><p>During neuronal development, ATP7A expression over time is precisely regulated, and varies according to cell type (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Linz and Lutsenko, 2007</xref>). Studies of the mouse brain show that ATP7A expression is most abundant in the early postnatal period and decreases from birth to adulthood (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Niciu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The mechanism by which RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> regulates ATP7A expression is unknown. As there are no known RARE in the ATP7A promoter region, it is likely that RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> regulates ATP7A expression level indirectly. Previous studies focused on the role of ATP7A in Menke's disease, have shown that ATP7A expression and copper plays an important role in neural differentiation and neuritogenesis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">El Meskini <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Birkaya and Aletta, 2005</xref>). We found an increase in cell viability when ATP7A expression was knocked down in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The significant correlation between ATP7A and RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression suggests that ATP7A may contribute to the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> anti-cancer therapeutic effect.</p><p>The role of copper in biological phenomena that involve signal transduction is poorly understood. A cellular model of neuronal differentiation has been utilised to examine the requirement for copper during nerve growth factor (NGF) signal transduction that leads to neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Birkaya and Aletta, 2005</xref>). NGF increases cellular copper content within 3 days, whereas copper chelators reduce the effects of NGF on neurite outgrowth and copper accumulation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Birkaya and Aletta, 2005</xref>). Our data supports a model of malignant neural cells requiring higher intracellular copper levels for viability, and that retinoid-induced neuritic differentiation of neuroblastoma cells causes intracellular copper depletion. In non-neuronal cells ATP7A regulates copper homeostasis by translocating copper from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, in response to an increased copper load. In Menkes disease a defect in the ATP7A protein leads to a reduced transport of copper from the intestine into the circulation and central nervous system, as well as reduced transport of copper into the Golgi apparatus. In our studies, a significant increase in copper efflux, and decrease in copper uptake occurred over 8 days of retinoid treatment. Thus, reduction in cellular copper levels directly contributes to the retinoid therapeutic effect.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that ATP7A is an important component of the RAR<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> anticancer effect. Most importantly, copper chelators reduce viability and proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. ATP7A and copper are novel potential drug targets that may be exploited in the treatment of neuroblastoma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Health and
