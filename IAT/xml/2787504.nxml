The aim of this study was to examine MMP -2 regulation by PKA in invasive trophoblasts: JAR choriocarcinoma cell-line and 6-8 w first trimester trophoblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The effect of Forskolin (PKA) on MMP-2 expression was assessed by Northern Blot and RT-PCR. Possible transcription factors binding to consensus MMP-2 promoter sequences in response to Forskolin, were detected by EMSA binding assay and their expression assessed by western blot analysis. Antisense transfection of relevant transcription factors was performed and the inhibitory effect assessed on MMP-2 expression (RT-PCR), secretion (zymography) and trophoblast invasiveness (transwell migration assay).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that Forskolin increased MMP-2 mRNA in JAR cells within 24 hours, and induced binding to p53, Ets, C/EBP and AP-2. Transcription factors Ets-2, phospho- p53, C/EBP epsilon, C/EBP lambda and AP-2 alpha bound to their respective binding sequences in response to Forskolin and the expressions of these transcription factors were all elevated in Forskolin- treated cells.

However, in sharp contrast to aggressive tumors, trophoblast invasion process is a spatial and temporal strictly regulated process, controlled by multiple interactions between cells and environment, mediated by several factors including growth factors, hormones and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Trophoblast are highly invasive due to the secretion of extracellular proteases, like Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), mediating degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and of their balancing inhibitors Tissue inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The two gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, digest type IV collagen, the main component of the basement membrane and are therefore regarded as key enzymes in trophoblast invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression is differential during the first trimester of pregnancy. MMP-2 production is dominant until 8 weeks of gestation and then declining, whereas MMP-9 production significantly increases from 8 weeks, causing a shift of dominant gelatinase from MMP-2 to MMP-9 from 9 week of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The implantation process occurs by two waves of invasion by the trophoblast, the first strictly controlled to the implantation site and completed at 8 weeks of gestation, and the second wave deep into the uterine wall at the end of first trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MMP-2 is likely to be the key-enzyme in the first physiological invasion wave, whereas MMP-9 may be the key-enzyme in the second invasion wave.</p><p>The JAR cell line, obtained from choriocarcinoma, is comprised of highly invasive trophoblast, expressing mainly MMP-2 and to a much lesser extent MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. JAR cells were shown in our lab to resemble early 1<sup>st </sup>trimester trophoblast in gelatinase profile and invasiveness, and can therefore be used as a good model for studying early invasive trophoblast regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several factors with importance in embryo implantation act via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway, including human chorion gonadotropin (hCG), the primary signal of an implanting pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. hCG was found to increase collagenolytic activity, trophoblast invasion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Forskolin is a prototypical stimulator of the cAMP pathway by direct activation of adenylate cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that Forskolin (PKA) induces MMP-2 and MMP-9 and trophoblast invasiveness in both JAR cells and 1<sup>st </sup>trimester trophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Forskolin has been used also in other studies to induce invasion or invasion-related molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additionally, Forskolin/cAMP has been used to induce syncytiotrophoblast formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The use of cell-lines of different origin as well as primary or term trophoblast may be the cause of these differential effects.</p><p>Most MMPs are regulated at the transcriptional level, by several cytokines and growth factors, which influence multiple signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The MMP gene promoter contains several <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, often acting synergistically, with varying importance and effect, depending upon cell-type and inducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The MMP -2 promoter lacks a typical TATA-box, but is not refractory to modulations as previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The transcriptional regulation on MMP-2 in trophoblasts is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 in cAMP- activated invasive trophoblast. Other MMP regulation levels include mRNA stabilization, protein activation or inhibition, surface localization and secretion; however these levels were not part of the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The JAR (Jar, HTB 144, ATCC) human choriocarcinoma line was a generous gift from Pr.

In order to assure binding specificity, competing non-labeled 8x excess oligonucleotide was added to reaction mixture. The non-labeled excess oligonucleotide strongly reduced the gelshift band, hereby ensuring binding specificity. Additionally, in order to assure involvement of the PKA signaling pathway, specific PKA inhibitor H89 (100 &#x003bc;m) was added to cell culture and gelshift performed (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

The maximal mRNA response in JAR cells appeared only after 24 hours of incubation, suggesting that Forskolin may stimulate MMP-2 by inducing other, early response genes. The MMP-9 gene has similarly been reported to be induced within 24 h in trophoblasts by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and TNF, through transcription of early response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In 6-8 w trophoblasts, in contrast, Forskolin induced MMP-2 mRNA within 1 h, indicating that Forskolin apparently can stimulate MMP-2 expression more directly, probably through initiating phosphorylation and migration of already present transcription factors. The controversy found here between JAR cells and 6-8 w trophoblasts, in regards of time for maximal mRNA response to Forskolin, underlines that some differences are to be expected between primary cells and a cell-line. One can speculate that in choriocarcinoma cells like JAR, an altered presence of transcription factors or activation of phosphorylation cascades may be part of the malignancy of these cells. The difference observed in ultimate magnitude between JAR cells and 1<sup>st </sup>trimester trophoblasts in response to Forskolin is consistent with our previous findings, showing the invasive choriocarcinoma cell-line to be highly expressing MMP-2, both in response to Forskolin and EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The primary trophoblast are less invasive and express less MMP-2 than the JAR cells.</p><p>Forskolin increased the binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus sequence of AP-2, C/EBP, p53 and Ets response elements in the MMP-2 promoter. These binding activities were induced specifically through PKA, since specific PKA- inhibitor H89 reduced this effect. The supershift EMSA assay revealed, that transcription factors AP-2&#x003b1;, phospho- p53, Ets-2 and C/EBP&#x003b5; and -&#x003bb; bind to their respective binding sequence under stimulation of Forskolin. Forskolin also increased the protein expression of Ets-2, C/EBP&#x003b5;, C/EBP&#x003bb; and AP-2&#x003b1;, and the phosphorylation of p53 as shown by western blot. These transcription factors may therefore be involved in transregulation of the MMP-2 promoter by Forskolin.</p><p>Several transcription factors have been found to be involved in MMP-2 regulation in various cells, including AP-2, AP-1 and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Only a few studies of MMP-2 transcriptional regulation in trophoblast have been published, and have focused mainly on the signaling pathway involved. In 1<sup>st </sup>trimester trophoblast the MAPK/Erk1/2 pathway was found to be involved in induction of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by Cyclosporin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase named focal adhesion kinase was found to be involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and MMP-2 activity in early trophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In another study from our lab, progesterone was found to regulate MMP-2 through differences in progesterone-receptor isoforms, apparently by binding to co-activators or transcription factors, since there is no progesterone response element in the MMP-2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. hCG, which like Forskolin acts through PKA, induces MMP-2 expression and trophoblast invasion through ERK 1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our study is the first to focus on transcription factors, which mediate MMP-2 transcriptional regulation in trophoblasts. We chose to focus our further investigation upon two transcription factors, Ets-2 and p53, which have previously been suggested to be involved in the implantation process. We showed that that Ets-2 mediates Forskolin-induced MMP-2 activity, since Forskolin increased Ets-2 expression in trophoblast and since antisense inhibition of Ets-2 reduced the Forskolin-induced MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity and trophoblast invasion. Inhibition of Ets-2 did not significantly reduce MMP-2 transcription, indicating that this transcription factor alone, although essential to MMP-2 activity and function, is not sufficient to MMP-2 transcriptional regulation. Based on our results we hypothesize that Ets-2 may effect MMP-2 regulation on a post-transcriptional level, however further investigation is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism.</p><p>The ETS transcription factor family is characterized by an highly evolutionary- conserved DNA- binding domain, that binds to a purine- rich GGA(A/T) core sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Ets members direct cytoplasmic signals to control gene expression and mediate multiple signaling pathways such as the Ras- Map Kinases, Erk1,2, p38, JNK and the PI3 kinases, which control their activity, protein partnership and specification of downstream target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Ets members have been shown to interact with several transcription factors including AP-1, pit-1, NF<sub>k</sub>B and SP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Ets proteins play important roles in cell development, differentiation and proliferation, and participate in malignancy of tumor cells, including invasion and metastasis, by activating the transcription of several cancer-related genes such as proteases and angiogenesis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Binding sites for the ETS family are found in promoters of the MMP family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and regulation of matrix degrading proteases by Ets factors in tumor invasion and metastasis is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Ets-2 is expressed in many cell types in developing mouse embryos. Targeted deletion of Ets-2 in mice results in retardation and death of the mouse embryo before 8.5 days of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These embryos show defects in the extraembryonic tissue gene expression and function, including deficient expression of MMP-9, MMP-13 and MMP-3 and die as a result of trophoblast failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Apparently. Ets-2 is not essential for specifying trophoectoderm before the morula-blastocyst transition, since blastocyst do form and initiate implantation. Properly Ets-2 coordinates early expression of genes providing full characteristics to cytotrophoblast, including the production of key enzymes and hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. MMP-2 may be one of these genes. Ets proteins mediate the control of several genes characteristically up-regulated in human trophoblast and involved in trophoblast differentiation and placenta development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This includes the hCG-&#x003b1; and hCG-&#x003b2; subunit gene, placental lactogen II, p-450 side chain cleavage enzyme, decidual/trophoblast prolactin related gene and MMP-1, -3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The hCG subunits are activated in stimulation to cAMP through interactions between Ets and CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>We also found that Forskolin increases p53 expression, and that p53 mediates Forskolin-induced MMP-2 expression, gelatinolytic activity and both basic and PKA-induced trophoblast invasion. In contrast to Ets-2, transient transfection of antisense mRNA to p53 into trophoblasts decreased MMP-2 transcription, both in control and in Forskolin-treated cells. This indicates, that p53 may be involved in the constitutive expression of MMP-2, and additionally mediates the response to PKA. We have recently published that p53 is involved in MMP-2 regulation and trophoblast invasion by EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. p53 was among the transcription factors increased under EGF stimulation (p53, SP-1, AP-2&#x003b1; and -&#x003b3;, C/EBP&#x003b5; and-&#x003bb;). p53 antisense inhibition was found to decrease EGF- induced MMP-2 mRNA expression, secretion and trophoblast invasiveness. Together our two studies emphasize the conclusion that p53 is involved in MMP-2 regulation in trophoblast. Since AP-2&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b5; and -&#x003bb; were also increased by both stimulators, they should be further examined by functional assays. Other transcription factors, like ETS-2, may be specific for a certain pathway.</p><p>p53 is a 53 kDa nuclear transcription factor, that recognizes and binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence consisting of two copies of the 10 bp motif 5'-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3', separated by 0 to 13 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. p53 acts as an activator by binding to this sequence and can also act as a transcriptional repressor of promoters lacking a p53 binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. p53 activates genes involved in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Many p53 functions are mediated through the activation or repression of a series of genes, and this includes the MMP-2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mutation of p53 may inactivate the growth regulatory function and cause a loss of tumor-suppressive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Mutation at the specific DNA binding domain have been identified in nearly 50% of all human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. p53 is present in the preimplantation human embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and is expressed throughout mouse implantation development. The p38 MAPK pathway was found to regulate p53 expression in 2-8 cell mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. p53-deficient mice are viable and reproductive, however in p53- null (p53(-/-) the placenta is altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In rodent placenta, a decrease in p53 is part of the transition of trophoblast from a state of proliferation to differentiation in trophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. p53 has a short half-live, and is therefore normally present at very low concentrations in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, p53 is detectable in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and this apparently overexpression of p53 in trophoblasts may be controlling excessive proliferation in normal placentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. It appears that most p53 protein forms complexes in the cytoplasm and tetramers in the nuclei in cytotrophoblasts, suggested to stabilize p53 and hereby prolong the half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. p53 is correlated with enhanced apoptosis in trophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], and can be induced by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Increased p53 and apoptosis was found in different pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], fetal growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and Gestational Trophoblastic diseases (GTDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In invasive hydatidiform moles, characterized by abnormal growth of chorionic tissues with various degrees of local invasion and metastasis, MMP-2 and mutant p53, but not wild type p53 (wtp53), were increased, as compared to normal placenta, and may be involved in this pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. However, since mutant p53 may still perform normal suppressive activity, depending on the localization of the mutation, and since other reports found wtp53 to be elevated in hydatidiform moles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], the role of wtp53 in this pathology is not clear. A recent article described that exogenous p53, but not endogenous p53, decrease MMP-9 in cytotrophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. In their report, in contrast to our results, p53 inhibition had no effect on either MMP-2 or MMP-9, and the authors suggested that p53 is inactivated in trophoblasts, maybe through formation of high molecular weight complexes. These controversial results regarding MMP-2 may result from differences in experimental design, including the use of JAR cells as a model as well as primary trophoblast of different gestational ages (early versus late 1<sup>st </sup>trimester trophoblast).</p><p>The examined transcription factors in this study are involved in transactivation and transrepression of many genes, thus the EMSA does not allow us to conclude, that MMP-2 is one of them. However, the studies using transfection of p53 and Ets-2 antisense in JAR demonstrate that at least p53 is involved in Forskolin-induced MMP-2 expression, while Ets-2 may effect post-transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that MMP-2 regulation in trophoblast is mediated by several transcription factors, including p53 and Ets-2, however since MMP-2 transcription, secretion and trophoblast invasion were not completely diminished, other transcription factors must be involved. This may include C/EBP-&#x003b5;, C/EBP&#x003bb; and AP-2&#x003b1;, which should be subject to further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MMP-2 regulation by PKA is mediated through several binding sites and transcription factors including Ets-2, p53, C/EBP&#x003b5;, C/EBP&#x003bb; and AP-2&#x003b1;.
