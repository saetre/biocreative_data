In the current study we were interested to examine the role of HBD in the clearance of apoptotic cells, and whether the phagocytic and tolerizing state of DCs is mediated by the HBD itself, or whether the entire TSP-1 is needed. Therefore, we have cloned the human HBD, and compared its interactions with DC to those with TSP-1. Here we show that rHBD by itself is not directly responsible for immune paralysis and tolerizing phenotype of DCs, at least in the monomeric form, but has a significant role in rendering DCs phagocytic. Binding of TSP-1-C-terminal domain on the other hand induces a tolerizing phenotype in dendritic cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian thrombospondins are a group of matricellular proteins of complex spatial structure, which mediate a wide range of intercellular activities, and participate in cell-matrix interactions.

The most important receptors identified to date for the varying effects moderated by TSP-1 are CD91, syndecan-1, and alpha3beta1 (&#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1) integrin for HBD; CD47 for the C terminal domain, CD36 HSPG and beta1 (&#x003b2;1) integrins for type I repeats; and alpha v beta 3 (&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3) for type III repeats. Different proteins in vertebrates and invertebrates include domains with similar structure and function to those of HBD, as reviewed in Adams and Lawler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Adams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We showed earlier that TSP-1 induced a phagocytic and tolerizing state for iDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we were interested to examine the specific role that the isolated rHBD may play in this interaction. Our interest is due not only to the importance of understanding TSP-1 functions, but also because HBD is discretely secreted from apoptotic monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Elzie1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. For this purpose we have cloned and expressed recombinant monomeric HBD (rHBD) using human throbospondin-1 N-terminal domain c-DNA.</p><p>HBD, as part of TSP-1, was suggested to bind multiple receptors, including syndecan-1, syndecan-4, perlecan, Decorin, CD91 and its complex with calreticulin, VLDL-receptor, and integrins &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1, and&#x003b1; 3&#x003b2;1, as reviewd by Elzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Elzie1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we were able to show that rHBD by itself can make iDCs better phagocytes of apoptotic cells. What could be the underlying mechanism? According to the model suggested by Savill and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Savill1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, TSP-1 may serve as a bridging molecule in the engulfment of apoptotic cells. We have shown that TSP-1 alone, without the presence of apoptotic cells, makes iDCs more phagocytic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, Thus, it is likely that this HBD effect is achieved via signaling events following its binding. Using monoclonal antibodies, we were able to show that this effect was abrogated by inhibiting the action of CD29 and CD91, which are most likely involved in the signaling cascade. CD29, an integrin family member, is a membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and recognition for a variety of processes, including embryogenesis, hemostasis, tissue repair, and immune response. CD29 was not previously known to be involved in phagocytosis. Here we show for the first time that CD29 may be required for HBD-dependent engulfment activity.</p><p>Interestingly, and in contrast to the effect of HBD as part of TSP-1, no inhibition of DC maturation by the rHBD was documented in our system. In other words, whereas isolated HBD mediates the phagocytic state it does not mediate the tolerizing phenotype of DCs. This can be due to several reasons. The first is that HBD is not required for DC maturation inhibition. In a previous work performed by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> we showed that blocking antibodies directed against TSP-1 C-terminus and type 1 repeats (CD47, CD51 and CD36 respectively) inhibited up to 80&#x00025; of the TSP-1 tolerizing phenotype. Thus, the tolerance effect could very well be mediated by interaction of the TSP-1 C terminus with CD47 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Demeure1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Doyen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, or interaction of the type I repeats with CD36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Febbraio1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility is that HBD plays a role in creating the tolerizing phenotype, but only as a part of TSP-1, when a signalosome is formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, some actions mediated by TSP-I require simultaneous interactions in other regions of the molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Adams4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> where intracellular crosstalks, mediated simultaneously through several receptors, are necessary. Our finding that blockage with anti-HBD (N20, Santa Cruz) did inhibit development of a tolerizing phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Krispin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> supports this concept. An additional explanation may be a two-step mechanism, for example augmentation of apoptotic cell uptake that leads later to a more pronounced tolerizing phenotype. Thus, HBD is essentially a prophagocytic protein that enhances phagocytosis of apoptotic cells when binding to an iDC. Binding of TSP-1 as well as Annexin-1, phosphatidylserine, and probably additional molecules, allows DC immune paralysis. Finally, it is possible that trimeric HBD is needed for the full HBD effect, as it has been shown that trimetric HBD may act differently from monomeric HBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Calzada1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006840-Vogel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There was some difference in phagocytic efficiency in the two rHBD samples. Our rHBD lacks the leader peptide (the first 19 amino acids), which is present in the rHBD2. The rest of the protein is completely identical. Both rHBD samples significantly increased phagocytic state and did not alter maturation, however activity was somewhat reduced in the rHBD2 sample. It seems that the cause for this difference is storage conditions, which preserve the HBD's biological activity. Indeed, we have found that storage of rHBD1 in 20&#x00025; glycerol at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C protects the best biological activity, whereas storage at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in PBS, the storage regimen for the rHBD2, activity was reduced (not shown).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that rHBD by itself is not directly responsible for immune paralysis and tolerizing phenotype of DCs, at least in the monomeric form, but has a significant role in rendering DCs phagocytic. Indirectly, as a part of TSP-1, or in its trimeric form, rHBD may influence development of the tolerizing phenotype of DCs following binding of TSP-1.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jack Lawler, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, for kindly providing Recombinant heparin binding domain (rHBD2).
