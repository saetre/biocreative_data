The amino acid sequence FIGQY containing a conserved phosphorylated tyrosine is found in the intracellular domain of all L1-type cell adhesion molecules. This conserved tyrosine is phosphorylated at the cell periphery of plasmatocytes and lamellocytes prior to parasitisation, but dephosphorylated after immune activation. Intriguingly, another pool of Nrg located near the nucleus of plasmatocytes remains phosphorylated after parasitisation.

Plasmatocytes resemble the mammalian monocyte/macrophage lineage and are involved in the phagocytosis or encapsulation of invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Lamellocytes are larger than the other haemocytes, are rarely seen in healthy larvae and seem to be specialized for the encapsulation of invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Crystal cells rupture to secrete components of the phenol oxidase cascade, involved in melanisation of invading organisms, wound repair and coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]</p><p>Endoparasitic wasps from the Hymenoptera family are known to parasitize <italic>Drosophila </italic>larvae. Once the invader is recognized as foreign circulating plasmatocytes somehow adhere and spread around the egg. After spreading the plasmatocytes form cellular junctions between the cells effectively separating the egg from the larval open circulatory system (hemoceol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Following plasmatocyte adherence and spreading, lamellocytes recognize the plasmatocytes surrounding the egg, and finally the capsule is melanised due to crystal cell rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. From these events it is obvious that adhesion and cell shape change are essential parts of the <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s cellular immune response against parasitoid wasp eggs.</p><p>Circulating immune surveillance cells need to remain mobile until they receive the correct signals to become adherent. In the case of <italic>Drosophila </italic>larvae, haemocytes change from non-adhesive circulating cells to adhesive non-circulating cells after parasitisation. Evidence is mounting that during attachment or encapsulation events leukocytes, platelets, and insect haemocytes use the same adhesion complexes as epithelial and neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In platelets the mammalian homolog of Neuroglian, L1-Cam is necessary for platelet-platelet interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore in the tobacco hornworm <italic>Manduca sexta </italic>the L1-Cam family member Neuroglian has been shown to interact with integrins during immune encapsulation responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

All L1 family members have the conserved amino acid sequence FIGQY containing a tyrosine phosphorylation site in their intracellular domain. Dephosphorylation of the FIGQY tyrosine allows L1-type cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) to interact with ankyrin, and through ankyrin to interact with the spectrin cortical-actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using an antibody raised against phospho-FIGQY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] it was evident that in plasmatocytes bled from non-parasitized control larvae the conserved Nrg-FIGQY tyrosine was phosphorylated at the cell periphery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and also at sites near the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Doublecortin (Dcx) is a microtubule binding protein that when mutated causes a type of neuronal migration disorder known as X-linked lissencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Doublecortin has been shown to interact with another microtubule associated protein known as lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and together they are involved in regulating the movement of the nucleus of neuronal cells during migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Phosphorylation the phospho-FIGQY-Nrg near the nucleus of plasmatocytes could allow Nrg to interact with a Dcx-Lis1 complex.

Melanisation is the final event in encapsulation, so this assay is not able to define the actual defect during the encapsulation process. To gain a better understanding of when the activity of Nrg is required during encapsulation, wasp eggs were recovered from either control or homozygous <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>mutant larvae at various times after parasitisation and stained for haemocyte specific markers. In general plasmatocytes attach to the wasp egg between 6&#x02013;24 h after the egg is laid in the larval hemoceol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Plasmatocytes that had not made cell-cell contacts sent out filopodia from the cell periphery towards other plasmatocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, inset). Eggs recovered from homozygous <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>mutants also had plasmatocytes attached to the wasp egg that had spread on the chorion. In most instances fewer plasmatocytes were attached to the egg than in control larvae and in some cases almost no plasmatocytes were attached (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and data not shown). Nrg mutant plasmatocytes attached to the wasp egg also extended filopodia laterally from their cell periphery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, inset); yet unlike controls, <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>mutant plasmatocytes projected many filopodia from their apical side, giving the cells a fuzzy appearance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>).</p><p>After plasmatocytes spread around the wasp eggs, lamellocytes recognize and attach to the plasmatocytes between 24&#x02013;40 h after the wasp egg is laid in the hemoceol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

It is possible that Nrg plays multiple roles when plasmatocytes adhere and spread on wasp eggs. At the cell periphery it could be involved in cell-cell interactions, while at the cell centre Nrg may regulate the localisation of a lissencephaly-1 containing complex.</p><p>In Drosophila larvae reduced Neuroglian activity caused an impairment of haemocyte adhesion to the wasp egg and reduced cell-cell interactions between plasmatocytes and lamellocytes. Similar to encapsulation events in <italic>M. sexta </italic>these two steps of encapsulation may require heterophilic interaction between Nrg and integrins, Nrg homophilic binding, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, both events may be accompanied by dephosphorylation of FIGQY to allow interaction of Nrg with ankyrin. Nrg may become dephosphorylated at the cell periphery to allow it to interact with Ankyrin protein and thus to the spectrin cortical-cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Nrg has been localised to septate junctions in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic epithelial cells and its activity is necessary for septate junction formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the cellular immune response against parasitoid wasp eggs Nrg may be necessary for plasmatocytes to form cellular junctions during the encapsulation response. Once plasmatocytes spread around the wasp egg and make cell-cell contacts they form cellular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These junctions have been described as looking like septate junctions, and at least one septate junction protein, Coracle, has been localised to the cell-cell interactions of plasmatocytes on wasp eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In neurons it has been shown that the L1-family member neurofascin interacts with doublecortin and this interaction is necessary for neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and along with the microtubule array and neurofascin, doublecortin interacts with lissencephaly-1 (LIS1). In both mammalian and <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurogenesis, Lis-1 is necessary for neuroblast proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The doublecortin-Lis1 interaction is necessary for nucleokinesis during neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is speculated that the interaction with neurofascin may be necessary to anchor the Lis1 complex to generate the force necessary for nucleokinesis, and without the signal from neurofascin nucleokinesis and cell migration cannot occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It may be that phosphorylation of the Nrg-FIGQY tyrosine at the plasmatocyte cell centre is necessary for Nrg to interact with a <italic>Drosophila </italic>doublecortin domain (Dcx) containing protein, to allow for nuclear anchoring. In an <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>mutant plasmatocyte Nrg may not be able to interact with a Dcx-domain protein, thus the Dcx-Lis1 complex cannot interact properly with the nuclear membrane and ends up at the unidentified perinuclear centriole-like structures or diffuse in the cytoplasm. There is no obvious homolog of mammalian doublecortin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but there are three proteins that contain Dcx domains, two of which are very similar to other doublecortin domain proteins called doublecortin-like kinase-1 and -2 in mammals. In a study to define the interaction of doublecortin with neurofascin, three amino acids in doublecortin were discovered to be important for this interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, all three of these amino acids are conserved in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>doublecortin-like kinase homolog CG17528 and the Dcx-domain protein CG42247, while two are conserved in the doublecortin-like kinase homolog CG10177 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). The possibility that Nrg interacts with one of these Dcx-domain containing proteins to anchor the nucleus during plasmatocyte spreading is currently under investigation. Of further interest is the observation that CG42247 was found to interact with another cell adhesion molecule Echinoid in a yeast-two hybrid screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Though Echinoid does not contain the FIGQY sequence found in L1-family molecules it does contain a similar sequence, FEGEY, in its intracellular domain near the C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignments (A) Sequence alignment of three <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins containing Dcx-domains and human doublecortin</bold>.

This leads to the possibility that phosphorylation of the FIGQY tyrosine is not sufficient for interaction of Nrg with the Lis1 complex. In the study where neurofascin was shown to interact with doublecortin, it was shown that doublecortin only slightly bound to L1-CAM, and not at all to NRCAM, even though they also contain phospho-FIGQY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There is another conserved tyrosine found in all L1-family members upstream of the FIGQY sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). This tyrosine is predicted to be phosphorylated in both Neuroglian and neurofascin, but not in L1-CAM or NRCAM. The GFP sequence the <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>allele is incorporated between these two conserved tyrosines and may disrupt their interaction with the Lis1 complex. Also, even though it was shown that phospho-FIGQY was necessary for the interaction of neurofascin with doublecortin <italic>in vivo</italic>, it may not be sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Another possibility is insertion of GFP into the Nrg open reading frame may change the conformation of the intracellular domain blocking the interaction of Nrg with the Lis1 complex even though the conserved FIGQY tyrosine is phosphorylated.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Neuroglian<sup>167 </sup>intracellular domain showing the conserved FIGQY sequence (underline) and the two predicted tyrosine phosphorylation sites (arrows)</bold>.

Yet, one of the first proteins discovered to regulate nucleokinesis, lissencephely-1/NUDF was discovered in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Leukocytes migrating through interstitial tissues must solve many of the same problems as neurons migrating during development, one of the main problems being nuclear migration. What is not fully understood in neurons, and not studied at all in the cellular immune response, is exactly how the nucleokinesis complex regulates nuclear migration. Here evidence was presented showing that in one subtype of <italic>Drosophila </italic>circulating immunosurveillance cells a transmembrane molecule, Neuroglian, somehow regulates the localisation of at least one nucleokinesis complex protein, Lis-1. What has not been elucidated is the significance of this in nucleokinesis or if this aspect of Neuroglian function is important for cellular immune response function. Still, it is intriguing to speculate that similar to neuronal cells, immunosurveillance cells also use the nucleokinesis apparatus to regulate nuclear migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Insects</title><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>strains <italic>w</italic><sup>1118 </sup>and <italic>Nrg</italic><sup><italic>G</italic>00305 </sup>were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Centre. <italic>Hemese-GAL4 </italic>driver line has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>UAS-Nrg</italic><sup><italic>IR </italic></sup>strain number 27201 and <italic>UAS-Lis1</italic><sup><italic>IR </italic></sup>strain number 6216 were obtained from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila </italic>RNAi Centre (VDRC).
