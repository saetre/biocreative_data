A group of HSP genes encode proteins that localize to endosomes. One of these is NIPA1 (non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1) and we have shown recently that its <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue spichthyin inhibits bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling, although the relevance of this finding to the mammalian protein was not known. We show here that mammalian NIPA1 is also an inhibitor of BMP signalling. NIPA1 physically interacts with the type II BMP receptor (BMPRII) and we demonstrate that this interaction does not require the cytoplasmic tail of BMPRII. We show that the mechanism by which NIPA1 inhibits BMP signalling involves downregulation of BMP receptors by promoting their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. Disease-associated mutant versions of NIPA1 alter the trafficking of BMPRII and are less efficient at promoting BMPRII degradation than wild-type NIPA1. In addition, we demonstrate that two other members of the endosomal group of HSP proteins, spastin and spartin, are inhibitors of BMP signalling. Since BMP signalling is important for distal axonal function, we propose that dysregulation of BMP signalling could be a unifying pathological component in this endosomal group of HSPs, and perhaps of importance in other conditions in which distal axonal degeneration is found.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetic disorders characterized by distal axonopathy involving the longest axons of the motor neurons of the corticospinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C3">3</xref>). Their study provides an opportunity to understand molecular cellular mechanisms involved in axonal maintenance and in &#x02018;dying-back&#x02019; axonopathy. Since a similar dying-back axonopathy is seen in some common neurological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C5">5</xref>), understanding its cause may have broad clinical relevance.</p><p>Numerous genes mutated in HSPs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C6">6</xref>). An important subgroup of the proteins they encode localize to the endosomal membrane traffic compartment, suggesting that the long axons of the corticospinal tract may be especially vulnerable to endosomal dysfunction. This endosomal group includes spastin, spartin and NIPA1 (non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1), as well as others including maspardin and spastizin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C7">7</xref>). Mutations in the spastin gene are the most frequent cause of HSP and in most cases are likely to act via a haploinsufficiency mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C11">11</xref>). Spastin is a microtubule-severing enzyme and we have recently shown that it can be recruited to a number of membrane sites, including endosomes, where it couples membrane traffic processes to microtubule remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C12">12</xref>). Mutation of the gene encoding spartin causes Troyer syndrome, an autosomal recessive HSP first identified in the Old Order Amish population, where the causative mutation is a frameshift likely to cause loss of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C14">14</xref>). Spartin can be recruited to endosomes, and endogenous spartin is required for efficient endosomal degradation of the EGF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C16">16</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the gene that encodes NIPA1 cause an autosomal dominant HSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C17">17</xref>). All of the disease-causing mutations reported so far have been missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C18">18</xref>), which affect the trafficking of the protein through the biosynthetic pathway by causing its trapping in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C20">20</xref>). It has been argued, based on data from overexpression systems in mammalian cells and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, that this could cause the disease via a gain-of-function induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C19">19</xref>). An alternative hypothesis arising from our study of spichthyin, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of NIPA1, is that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling could be involved, since spichthyin is an inhibitor of BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, enhanced BMP signalling causes an abnormal distal axonal overgrowth phenotype at the presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C23">23</xref>), and indeed larvae lacking spichthyin have a distal axonal abnormality that includes synaptic overgrowth at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>). The distal axonal phenotype seen in flies lacking spichthyin is rescued by genetic manipulations blocking BMP signalling, indicating that enhanced BMP signalling is critical to its development. The observations in the fly system therefore suggest that abnormal BMP signalling is a potential candidate mechanism by which abnormality of NIPA1 could cause axonopathy in humans.</p><p>In this study, we sought first to test whether NIPA1 regulates BMP signalling in mammalian cells. Using overexpression and depletion systems, we show that NIPA1 is an inhibitor of BMP signalling in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. We elucidate the mechanism of this effect by demonstrating that the type II BMP receptor (BMPRII) is degraded in lysosomes and that NIPA1 enhances this degradation by physically interacting with BMPRII and promoting its endocytosis and trafficking to lysosomes. We also show that mutant versions of NIPA1 are trapped in the ER, but in contrast to previous results, we find no increase in ER stress or induction of UPR on expression of NIPA1 mutants. However, we show that mutant NIPA1 does alter the trafficking of BMPRII, such that degradation of BMPRII is less efficient than when only wild-type NIPA1 is present. In addition, we show by depletion experiments that two other endosomal HSP proteins, spastin and spartin, are inhibitors of BMP signalling. As well as elucidating molecular mechanisms that regulate mammalian BMP receptor trafficking, our results suggest that dysregulation of BMP signalling could be an important unifying mechanism causing axonopathy in the endosomal group of HSPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>NIPA1 is present on endosomes and at the plasma membrane, where it is subject to clathrin-dependent endocytosis</title><p>In HeLa and NSC34 (a murine hybrid neuroblastoma/motor neuronal cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C24">24</xref>)) cell lines stably expressing NIPA1-GFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F1">1</xref>A and B), we observed a predominantly punctate/vesicular cytoplasmic localization of NIPA1.

This plasma membrane staining was enhanced by clathrin heavy chain depletion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F1">1</xref>F and G), indicating that plasma membrane NIPA1-GFP is subject to clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

For the mammalian cell experiments, we concentrated on HeLa cells to facilitate morphological examination. In transfected wild-type HeLa cells, myc-tagged BMPRII is mainly expressed on the cell surface, with a small amount of staining in sparse cytoplasmic vesicles. These co-label with endogenous markers of recycling and early endosomes, but not with late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F3">3</xref>A and B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp324/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). However, in HeLa cells stably expressing NIPA1-GFP, myc-BMPRII was strikingly internalized from the plasma membrane and co-localized with NIPA1-GFP not only in early and recycling endosomes, but also in late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F3">3</xref>C and D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp324/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>).

GADD34 is strongly induced during ER stress, and induction of the ER chaperone BiP has been used extensively as an indicator of the onset of UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C28">28</xref>).

Similar results were found for both mutants (G106R data not shown). We concluded that if it leaves the ER, mutant NIPA1 is trafficked in a similar fashion to wild-type NIPA1 and is capable of redistributing BMPRII from the cell surface to endosomes.

Remarkably, depletion of spastin or spartin in HeLa cells was associated with increased pSmad1/5 concentration in non-BMP4-stimulated cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F9">9</xref>A and B) and increased <italic>Id</italic> luciferase reporter activity in unstimulated and BMP4-stimulated cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP324F9">9</xref>C and D).

Remarkably, our study therefore indicates that all three of these endosomal HSP proteins are inhibitors of BMP signalling.</p><p>How could endosomal proteins influence BMP signalling? In signalling pathways, there is often a close relationship between signal transduction and endocytic membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C32">32</xref>). For many cell surface receptors, e.g. EGFR, plasma membrane receptor levels and the consequent signalling response can be regulated by sorting decisions made at the early endosome, for example between recycling of the receptor back to the plasma membrane, or degradation in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C33">33</xref>). In addition, as well as modulating receptor levels, endocytic processes can be important in maintaining or attenuating the signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C32">32</xref>). Such a relationship between signalling and endocytosis is known to be important in the BMP pathway in flies, where there is an emerging recognition that endocytic processes provide a mechanism to fine-tune BMP signalling. <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking a number of endosomal proteins, such as spichthyin, nervous wreck, Dap160 and spinster, show upregulated BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C34">34</xref>). At least some of these endosomal proteins, including spichthyin, have been implicated in regulating endosomal BMPR traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C23">23</xref>). Thus, spichthyin binds the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMPRII, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, expression of spichthyin promotes endocytosis of BMPRII from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>), although the mechanism by which this, in turn, downregulates BMP signalling in flies is not yet clear.</p><p>In mammals, although it is known that endocytosis is important for BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C36">36</xref>), neither the endocytic trafficking itinerary of BMPRs nor the molecular mechanisms regulating endocytic BMPR trafficking have been fully characterized. We therefore analysed whether mammalian NIPA1 plays a similar role to <italic>Drosophila</italic> spichthyin. We found that NIPA1 resides on the plasma membrane and endosomes, is an inhibitor of BMP signalling and promotes internalization of BMPRII from the plasma membrane to an endocytic compartment. In these respects, it behaves strikingly like spichthyin. In addition, our results have given novel insights into the mechanism by which NIPA1 regulates BMP signalling. We have shown that the lysosome makes a significant contribution to BMPRII degradation and that NIPA1 enhances this by binding to BMPRII and promoting its traffic from the plasma membrane towards the lysosomal compartment. Outside of the serine/threonine kinase domain, there is little sequence homology between the tail of mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMPRII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C38">38</xref>), and neither binding of NIPA1 to BMPRII nor the effect of NIPA1 in promoting endocytosis of BMPRII from the plasma membrane required sequences in the BMPRII tail. Since NIPA1 is strongly hydrophobic and has at least seven transmembrane regions, we speculate that the binding between BMPRII and NIPA1 may be mediated via a transmembrane interaction. Interestingly, there are several transmembrane sequences that show strong conservation between NIPA1 and spichthyin, which could be candidate binding domains.</p><p>BMP signalling is important for axonal function. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, BMP signalling is a main determinant of synaptic growth at the NMJ, and enhanced BMP signalling, for example as found in flies lacking spichthyin or the other endosomal proteins mentioned earlier, causes an abnormal distal axonal overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C23">23</xref>). During mammalian development, BMP signalling regulates axonal growth, guidance and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C41">41</xref>); for example Id2, a member of the Id family of BMP-responsive transcription factors, controls axonal differentiation by regulating a number of axonal inhibitory pathways. These include the Nogo pathway, which is involved in the inhibition of synaptic plasticity and the prevention of CNS axonal regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C41">41</xref>). Moreover, expression of BMPs is upregulated after corticospinal tract injury, and the inhibition of this upregulated BMP signalling promotes corticospinal axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C42">42</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, we have found that three endosomal HSP proteins are involved in the regulation of BMP signalling. Are our findings relevant to the molecular pathology of the disease? For spastin and spartin, where haploinsufficiency or complete loss of the protein are pathological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C14">14</xref>), the cellular depletion assays that we examined are pathologically relevant. Results from these depletion experiments therefore suggest that upregulation of BMP signalling could have a role in the development of the phenotype. The situation is more complex with NIPA1. We modelled the disease here by generating stable cell lines expressing disease-associated mutants. In keeping with previous studies, we found that the mutant protein is more prone to ER retention than the wild-type protein, and that this retention affected BMPRII trafficking. Thus, when mutant NIPA1 was retained in the ER, BMPRII was retained with it, whereas when mutant NIPA1 exited the ER and was endosomal/lysosomal, so too was BMRPII. Mutant NIPA1 was less efficient at promoting BMPRII degradation than wild-type NIPA1, perhaps because BMPRII sequestered in the ER is protected from lysosomal degradation, or because insufficient NIPA1 was available at endosomes to promote efficient degradation of BMPRII. However, despite the obvious effect of mutant NIPA1 on BMPRII traffic, we did not find any effect of expression of the mutant protein on BMP signalling assays. The end result of expression of mutant NIPA1 on the BMP signalling pathway is likely to be determined by an interplay between how much NIPA1 is retained in the ER, how much BMPRII is retained there with it and how much NIPA1 escapes the ER to be active in promoting BMPRII degradation at lysosomes. An overexpression system such as the one we used is unlikely to be able to model all of these factors correctly, and this may explain why we did not see any effects on BMP signalling. The development of models expressing physiological levels of the mutant protein (e.g. knock-in mice) will be required to fully address this issue.</p><p>Recently, Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP324C20">20</xref>) have proposed that the molecular pathological mechanism of NIPA1 HSP is a toxic gain-of-function. In mammalian cells, they found that transient transfection of mutant NIPA1 triggered ER stress and UPR, caused by accumulation of the mutant protein in the ER. However, their transient transfection experiments were associated with massive cell death (&#x0003e;90% cell death 48 h after transfection), so it would appear that this system was highly non-physiological. Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. also presented data to suggest that UPR played a significant role in a motor phenotype seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> overexpressing disease-associated mutant versions of NIPA1. In contrast, we saw no evidence of increased cell death in our stable cell lines expressing mutant NIPA1, nor did we see any evidence of ER stress or UPR above that seen in cell lines expressing equivalent amounts of the wild-type protein. Thus, while not excluding the possibility that ER stress may make a contribution to the NIPA1-HSP phenotype, our results do not support it.</p><p>In summary, we show that three endosomal HSP proteins are inhibitors of BMP signalling. While not excluding involvement of other signalling pathways and ER stress, we propose that upregulation of BMP signalling, caused in at least some cases by altered endocytic BMPR traffic, is an important candidate pathological component of the axonal degeneration seen in the endosomal group of HSPs, and may be relevant in other conditions showing distal axonopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1 and anti-BMPRII were from BD Transduction Laboratories.
