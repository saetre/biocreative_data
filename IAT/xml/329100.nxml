Two approaches were compared for their effectiveness in isolating novel genes: random, vs differential, complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning methods. In the differential approach, only the cDNA clones containing rare sequences (as determined by preliminary clone hybridization) are further analyzed; in the random approach, cDNA clones are isolated at random from the cDNA library. More than two hundred cDNA clones altogether were analyzed, using a PCR-mediated amplification and sequencing strategy. A comparison of these sequences to nucleic acid and protein sequence databases, revealed that 84% of the isolated rare cDNA clones represented new, previously uncharacterized mouse genes. In contrast, less than 63% of the cDNA clones isolated at random from cDNA libraries, contained novel genes. Thus, the probability of isolating new, previously uncharacterized, mammalian genes from cDNA libraries can be markedly improved by focusing efforts on clones containing rare sequences.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00102-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00102-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6124"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00102-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6125"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00102-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00102-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6127"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
