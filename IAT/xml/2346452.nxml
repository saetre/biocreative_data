IC is associated with severe pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction that includes urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Hanno1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Jones1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Wesselmann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinical studies demonstrate elevated mast cell numbers in the lamina propria of IC bladder biopsies, and the partial efficacy of neuromodulatory therapies suggests neural-immune interactions play a role in IC pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Leiby1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Tomaszewski1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Hanno1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). Mast cells contain preformed stores of immune mediators, such as histamine and TNF, and can be activated to release these stores by neurotransmitters such as substance P. These observations have suggested a central role for mast cells in IC pathogenesis whereby activation of bladder-associated circuits in the central nervous system (CNS) initiates substance P release by peripheral nerves in the bladder that then promotes substance P-mediated mast cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Elbadawi1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This mast cell activation, in turn, is postulated to induce bladder inflammation by acting on urothelium, the epithelium that lines the bladder. In support of this hypothesis, murine cystitis models have demonstrated a requirement for mast cells and substance P receptors in bladder inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Dozmorov1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Saban1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, increased levels of urinary histamine metabolites have been detected in IC patient urines, and accumulation of lamina propria mast cells is correlated with IC symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Leiby1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Tomaszewski1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Boucher1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-elMansoury1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, other inflammatory markers are inconsistent features of IC, and the basis of pelvic pain is unclear. Here we examine mechanisms of pelvic pain in an established murine model that recapitulates key aspects of IC, including lamina propria mast cell accumulation and pelvic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen2">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Rudick1">13</xref>.</p><p>The attenuated Bartha's strain of pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an &#x003b1;-herpesvirus that is taken up by neurons and undergoes retrograde transport and viral replication within the CNS. PRV was originally shown to cause cystitis in rats when injected into the tailbase <italic>abductor caudalis dorsalis</italic> muscle and taken up by motor neurons. PRV-induced cystitis is a neurally mediated event triggered by viral action in the CNS, and the cystitis is associated with bladder mast cell activation, even though Bartha's PRV is incapable of descending sensory nerves to the bladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Rudick1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Doggweiler1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Jasmin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Jasmin2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In mice, PRV causes urothelial expression of RANTES (<italic>R</italic>e-<italic>A</italic>ctivated in <italic>N</italic>ormal, <italic>T</italic> cell-<italic>E</italic>xpressed, <italic>S</italic>ecreted), a chemokine known to promote mast cell trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. RANTES drives mast cell accumulation in the lamina propria that juxtaposes activated mast cells with the urothelium, and the proximity of mast cells to the urothelium induces mast cell-dependent, TNF-dependent bladder pathophysiology. This bladder pathophysiology includes the formation of apoptotic lesions in the urothelium and a marked loss of trans-epithelial resistance (TER) that is normally characteristic of urothelial barrier function in the intact bladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Chen3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the pathophysiology of murine PRV cystitis is consistent with human IC where the presence of urothelial lesions in patient biopsies correlates with IC symptoms, and many IC patients are exquisitely sensitive to instillation of nerve-depolarizing concentrations of KCl into the bladder, a finding that suggests a loss of barrier function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Parsons1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Murine PRV cystitis was also recently shown to induce bladder-associated pain specific to the pelvic region in female C57BL6/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Rudick1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Although inflammation was restricted to the bladder, the bladder-associated pelvic pain was blocked by instillation of 2&#x00025; lidocaine into either the bladder or colon, indicating modulation of pelvic pain responses through organ crosstalk by visceral inputs distinct from the site of pathophysiology. Since we previously showed that mast cells mediate the bladder pathophysiology of murine PRV cystitis, we hypothesized that pelvic pain is also mediated by mast cells. In this study, both pelvic pain and bladder pathophysiology were dependent upon mast cells. TNF mediated cystitis pathophysiology, while pelvic pain developed independent of TNF. Conversely, genetic or pharmacologic disruption of histamine receptors H1R or H2R attenuated pelvic pain without altering pathophysiology. These data demonstrate that cystitis pain and bladder pathophysiology are dependent on mast cells through the independent actions of histamine and TNF, respectively, and identify histamine receptors as therapeutic targets for direct intervention in pelvic pain of IC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PRV induces pelvic pain</title><p>Pain originating from a visceral organ is typically referred to a corresponding &#x0201c;dermatome&#x0201d; on the skin that shares spinal innervation with the given visceral organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002096-Sturge1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

In PRV-induced cystitis, both genetic and pharmacologic data presented here suggest that mast cells mediate cystitis pain via H1R and H2R, whereas genetic data exclude TNF as a significant mediator of acute mast cell-dependent pelvic pain. These findings are further supported by the observations that pain precedes TNF-dependent pathophysiology by at least one day in murine PRV cystitis and that efficacy of antihistamines for pain is dissociated from effects on edema.

Three types of behaviors were considered as positive responses to filament stimulation: (1) sharp retraction of the abdomen; (2) immediate licking or scratching of the area of filament stimulation; or (3) jumping.</p><p>Tactile allodynia was tested on the plantar region of the hind paw using von Frey filaments with forces of 0.04, 0.16, 0.4, 1 and 4 grams. The median 50&#x00025; withdrawal threshold was assessed using the up-down method where testing was started with 0.04 g filament applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw until the filament bent slightly. Filaments were tested in ascending order until a positive response was observed. A positive response to the filament was defined as either a sharp withdrawal of the paw or licking of the test paw. When a positive response was recorded the next weaker filament was applied, and if a negative response was observed, then the next stronger filament was applied.</p><p>Spontaneous behavior was recorded (Sony VAIO USB camera) for five minutes in a clear plastic open field chamber (18&#x000d7;29&#x000d7;12 cm) at 96 hours after PRV infection and scored for rearing, grooming and cage crossing to assess general activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Capsaicin Treatment</title><p>Capsaicin (50 &#x000b5;l) was administered as 0.3&#x00025; solution (dissolved in 10&#x00025; ethanol, 10&#x00025; Tween 80 and 80&#x00025; saline) instilled into the colon via a Hamilton syringe catheter (rounded-tip needle 3.8 cm long) while the mouse was maintained under Isoflurane anesthesia.

As a negative control, additional sections were incubated with isolectin B4 that was pre-incubated with 500 mM D-galactose for 1 hour prior to staining. Sections were washed and counterstained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope using Volocity 4.0 software (Improvision) for acquisition and analysis. A Z-stack of 30 &#x000b5;m total thickness was taken at 0.1 &#x000b5;m intervals and was deconvolved using the Volocity Deconvolution module (25 iterations).
