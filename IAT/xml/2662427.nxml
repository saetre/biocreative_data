Classical studies suggest that heterochromatin promotes cohesion, but whether this happens through regulation of cohesin remains to be determined. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a major component of heterochromatin. In fission yeast, the HP1 homologue Swi6 interacts with cohesin and is required for proper targeting and/or stabilization of cohesin at the centromeric region. To test whether this pathway is conserved in human cells, we have examined the behavior of cohesin in cells in which the levels of HP1 alpha, beta or gamma (the three HP1 proteins present in mammalian organisms) have been reduced by siRNA. We have also studied the consequences of treating human cells with drugs that change the histone modification profile of heterochromatin and thereby affect HP1 localization. Our results show no evidence for a requirement of HP1 proteins for either loading of bulk cohesin onto chromatin in interphase or retention of cohesin at pericentric heterochromatin in mitosis. However, depletion of HP1gamma leads to defects in mitotic progression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sister chromatid cohesion is one important mechanism for the cell to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. A physical linkage between the sister chromatids is established by a multiprotein complex named cohesin at the time of DNA replication and persists until all chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase spindle. Cohesin is a ring-shaped complex that consists of a heterodimer of Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) subunits, SMC1 and SMC3, the kleisin subunit Scc1 (also known as Mcd1/Rad21), and Scc3/SA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Losada1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Peters1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

A small population of cohesin, enriched at the centromeric region, remains on chromatin until the onset of anaphase.

It is unknown whether cohesin enrichment is the result of increased recruitment of cohesin around centromeres in interphase, of preferential dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms in early mitosis, or both. A family of proteins known as &#x0201c;shugoshins&#x0201d; do indeed protect centromeric cohesin from dissociation in prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Lee1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Metazoan centromeres are embedded in heterochromatin. Classically, this chromatin domain is defined as the portion of the genome that retains deep staining with DNA-specific dyes and remains cytologically condensed throughout the cell cycle. It is mainly composed of repetitive sequences -satellite DNAs and transposons- and contains few genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Gatti1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Nucleosomes of heterochromatin regions are usually hypoacetylated and histone H3 is methylated in Lysine 9 (H3K9Me) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Martin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Another prominent &#x0201c;mark&#x0201d; of heterocromatin is the presence of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1). Initially identified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, HP1 has homologues in various organisms, from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Swi6) to mammals, in which three HP1 isoforms (alpha, beta and gamma) have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-James1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Lomberk1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Although HP1 proteins are primarily associated with pericentric heterochromatin, they have also been mapped to euchromatic sites as well as telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Minc1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Kellum1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The HP1 isoforms share a common structural organization with a chromodomain and a chromoshadow domain in the amino- and carboxy-terminus, respectively, separated by a flexible hinge region. The chromodomain is responsible for binding to H3K9Me, although additional factors are required to specify HP1 targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Lachner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The chromoshadow domain mediates interactions with a number of nuclear proteins that include the large subunit of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1), the histone H3 lysine metyltransferase Suv39h or the DNA methyl transferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Maison1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A number of classical observations suggest a role of heterochromatin in sister chromatid cohesion. For example, the arms of Drosophila Y chromosome, composed mainly of heterochromatin, maintain their close apposition when cells are arrested in mitosis with colchicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Gonzalez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammalian cells, the order in which chromosomes separate in anaphase correlates with their amount of pericentric heterochromatin, probably because they require more time to completely dissolve cohesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Vig1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The question is whether heterochromatin &#x0201c;stickiness&#x0201d; is due to cohesin-mediated cohesion and how it is regulated. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, mutants in the HP1 homologue Swi6 lack cohesin in the outer centromeric repeat region and, as a consequence, show chromosome segregation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Bernard1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Nonaka1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Supporting the conservation of this mechanism in higher eukaryotes, mouse cells deficient for enzymes responsible for H3K9 tri-methylation (Suv39h1 and Suv39h2), in which there is no apparent enrichment of HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin, showed reduced cohesion in the pericentric major satellite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Peters2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Guenatri1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

After a 90&#x00025; reduction in the levels of the HP1 isoforms, we found no effect on the binding of bulk cohesin to chromatin in interphase cells and no effect on the pericentric accumulation of cohesin in metaphase chromosomes. Treatments with a histone deacetylase inhibitor or a DNA methylation inhibitor that reduce the binding of HP1 to heterochromatin have also no consequences on cohesin behavior. We conclude that, unlike fission yeast, human HP1 proteins are not responsible for the enrichment of cohesin around centromeres.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Localization of HP1 proteins in HeLa cells</title><p>Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells with antibodies that specifically recognize each one of the three HP1 isoforms indicates that they are all nuclear proteins that are bound to chromatin and accumulate on foci in interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005118.s002">Figure S1</xref>, top).

HP1gamma could be immunoprecipitated efficiently from both the soluble and the chromatin-bound fractions, but no cohesin was pulled-down along with HP1gamma. HP1alpha was again found in the HP1gamma immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As an alternative approach, GST-tagged versions of the HP1 proteins were purified from bacteria on glutathione agarose beads and incubated with a HeLa cell nuclear extract.

To test this possibility, we examined the morphology of mitotic chromosomes in cells in which the three HP1 isoforms had been depleted individually or in combination. After a short treatment with colcemid to prevent anaphase, cells were subject to a hypotonic treatment, fixed, and incubated with antibodies against the condensin subunit SMC2 that labels the axis of each sister chromatid and against Aurora B. Most mitotic cells in the control population exhibited chromosomes with well paired sister chromatids along the their entire length, and Aurora B localized to a single dot at the primary constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, top row). In some cells, chromosomes had less tightly paired sister chromatids and delocalization of Aurora B from centromeres in a number of chromosomes (labeled as phenotype &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, second row). Another phenotype was characterized by overcondensed chromosomes in which the distance between the sister chromatids, both at arms and at centromeres, was clearly increased with respect to control chromosomes and the centromeric Aurora B signal was lost (labeled as &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, third row).

For that we omitted the colcemid treatment, fixed the cells and labeled them with antibodies against alpha-tubulin and CREST serum. In a control metaphase, chromosomes become bi-oriented at the spindle equator, and form a tight metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, top row). In some cases, however, we observed multipolar spindles (phenotype &#x0201c;3&#x0201d;), pseudoanaphase with scattered chromosomes along the elongated spindle (phenotype &#x0201c;4&#x0201d;), or cells with a bipolar spindle in which a number of chromosomes (from one to five) had not congressed yet to the metaphase plate (phenotype &#x0201c;5&#x0201d;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Again, quantitation of these mitotic figures phenotypes revealed no defects after HP1alpha or HP1beta knock down, whereas cells with reduced levels of HP1gamma showed at least a 3-fold increase in the occurrence of these aberrant mitotic figures with respect to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, co-depletion of the three HP1 isoforms did not increase the defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005118.s005">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that they are likely caused by depletion of HP1gamma alone. Thus, our results indicate that the HP1gamma isoform has a more prominent role than the other two in mitotic progression. Given the data presented in previous sections, however, this role appears not to be exerted directly on cohesin recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since it was reported that HP1/Swi6 is required for proper centromeric cohesion in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, it has been widely assumed that this mechanism is evolutionary conserved and functions also in higher eukaryotes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-White1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>). However, the results presented here and those from other recent publications discussed below support a different conclusion. To date, no physical interaction between cohesin and HP1 proteins has been observed in metazoan organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Koch1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Yamagishi1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Lechner1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, this study). We have found that depletion of HP1 isoforms by siRNA does not perturb bulk cohesin loading on chromatin in interphase nor the presence of cohesin in the pericentric regions of metaphase chromosomes. Importantly, similar results were observed upon treatment of cells with TSA and AZA that prevent the accumulation of HP1 proteins at heterochromatin foci.</p><p>It has been recently reported that HP1 proteins interact with hSgo1, the protector of centromeric cohesin, and that the presence of HP1alpha is important to maintain hSgo1 at centromeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Yamagishi1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we have not detected a reduction of hSgo1 signals in the mitotic chromosomes from HP1-depleted cells (data not shown). Of note, Yamagishi and colleagues show that hSgo1 recruitment to centromeres in prophase is not altered in the absence of HP1, but only its maintenance after prolonged arrest with nocodazole. Differences in the drug treatment could thus explain the discrepancy with our results. Importantly, however, both studies coincide to point out that HP1 proteins have no role in cohesin recruitment to centromeres in human cells.</p><p>Double depletion of HP1alpha and HP1gamma from human cells results in micronuclei formation, an indication of aberrant chromosome segregation in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Obuse1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, single depletion of HP1gamma was sufficient to cause mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005118-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We suggest that HP1gamma is more important than HP1alpha or HP1beta to ensure a correct progression through mitosis, at least in transformed human cells. This specificity may be variable depending on the species, the tissue, or even the developmental stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Aucott1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>According to our results, the mitotic function of HP1 is not related to cohesin recruitment.

In any of these cases, defects in mitosis could result in loosened cohesion due to prolonged metaphase arrest. In addition, early studies of Drosophila mutant embryos proposed that the requirement of HP1 for proper chromosome segregation could be attributed to a role in chromosome condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Kellum2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, the participation of HP1 in chromosome condensation in human cells has also been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Inoue1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

The functional significance of this resemblance awaits further investigation.

Whether this is also true for mammalian cells remains to be proven.

Thus, the cohesion observed at the major satellite region of metaphase chromosomes in wild type MEFs (and in the pericentric heterochromatin regions of other organisms) may not rely on cohesin. DNA catenation resulting from the replication process also contributes to cohesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Shamu1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005118-Miyazaki1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.
