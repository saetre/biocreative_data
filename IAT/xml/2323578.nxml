Most studies aimed at achieving replication in murine cells have been limited to fibroblast cell lines, but generating an appropriate model requires overcoming blocks to viral replication in primary T cells.&#x000a0;We have studied HIV-1 replication in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from human CD4/ CCR5/Cyclin T1 transgenic mice. Expression of hCD4 and hCCR5 in mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells enabled efficient entry of R5 strain HIV-1. In mouse T cells, HIV-1 underwent reverse transcription and nuclear import as efficiently as in human T cells. In contrast, chromosomal integration of HIV-1 proviral DNA was inefficient in activated mouse T cells. This process was greatly enhanced by providing a secondary T cell receptor (TCR) signal after HIV-1 infection, especially between 12 to 24 h post infection. This effect was specific for primary mouse T cells. The pathways involved in HIV replication appear to be PKC&#x003b8;&#x02212;, CARMA1-, and WASp-independent. Treatment with Cyclosporin A (CsA) further relieved the pre-integration block. However, transcription of HIV-1 RNA was still reduced in mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells despite expression of the hCyclin T1 transgene. Additional post-transcriptional defects were observed at the levels of Gag expression, Gag processing, Gag release and virus infectivity. Together, these post-integration defects resulted in a dramatically reduced yield of infectious virus (300&#x02013;500 fold) after a single cycle of HIV-1 replication. This study implies the existence of host factors, in addition to those already identified, that are critical for HIV-1 replication in mouse cells. This study also highlights the differences between primary T cells and cell lines regarding pre-integration steps in the HIV-1 replication cycle.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A small animal model for HIV infection and pathogenesis would be invaluable for basic research as well as for vaccine development.

Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, for example, are required for the initiation of adaptive immunity, but potentially also harbor viruses and thus contribute to enhancing infection with HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Cameron1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Wu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To understand the role of the immune system in HIV pathogenesis, it is necessary to have an intact host immune system in small animals infectable with HIV-1. In humans, combinations of CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 can mediate cell entry of HIV-1. Cells from rats transgenic for human CD4 and human CCR5 were susceptible to HIV-1 entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Keppler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Goffinet1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In this rat model, primary macrophages and microglia supported some productive HIV-1 replication.

Some mouse strains expressing single HIV proteins developed symptoms of AIDS such as wasting and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell depletion. However, full length HIV-1 RNAs are transcribed inefficiently in mouse cells. hCyclin T1 interacts with HIV Tat protein in a species-restricted manner to enhance RNA transcription and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Wei1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to hCyclin T1, hCD4 and hCCR5 or hCXCR4 are necessary for HIV-1 infection of mouse cells.

The host factors required for viral release in these systems have not yet been identified. Several groups have tried to overcome the assembly/release block by altering the virus, e.g. mutation of matrix protein to enhance membrane targeting, over-expression of Gag to increase intracellular p24 level, replacing MA of HIV-1 with that of Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV), inhibition of HIV-1 RNA over-splicing, and use of the alternative RNA transport element CTE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Hubner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Zheng1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Swanson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Hatziioannou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Reed1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Chen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that some lines of 3T3 cells could support efficient Gag processing and virus release, while other lines could not. Because of these discrepancies, we were concerned that 3T3 cells may not be an appropriate model for studying virus release in mouse cells. Moreover, a mouse model for HIV replication and pathogenesis will require that T lymphocytes can be infected with the virus. It is therefore critical that we have a clear understanding of how HIV replication is affected in primary mouse T cells.</p><p>HIV-1 infection in transformed mouse T cell lines was reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Baumann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In that study, immortalized mouse T cell lines that expressed hCD4 and hCCR5 were found to support normal HIV-1 entry, but reverse transcription and nuclear import were reduced as compared to NIH 3T3 cells or human T cell lines. In the current study, we have compared the replication of HIV-1 in primary human and mouse T cells. We found that viral entry, reverse transcription, and nuclear import of HIV-1 are as efficient in primary mouse T cells as in human T cells. Although chromosomal integration of HIV-1 proviral DNA was inefficient in mouse T cells pre-activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, this block was substantially relieved by providing a secondary TCR signal after HIV-1 infection. Using mutant mice, we found that this signal is independent of the pathways involving PKC&#x003b8;, CARMA1 (CARD 11) and WASp.

Mouse bone marrow derived DCs also expressed hCD4/CCR5 (data not shown). hCCR5 was expressed at a much higher level on T cells from transgenic mice than on human T cells.

Purified mouse and human resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were infected at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) with JRCSF (R5 HIV-1) containing Vpr-&#x003b2;-lactamase. Infected cells were then loaded with CCF2-AM. The cleavage of CCF2-AM by &#x003b2;-lactamase was monitored by flow cytometry using the FITC and DAPI channels, for un-cleaved substrate and cleaved products, respectively. At MOI of 1, 30&#x00025; of human T cells supported virus entry, which was completely blocked by the CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779. For resting mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, entry was more efficient, with about 90&#x00025; of mouse cells supporting entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Treatment with TAK-779 had only a modest effect, most likely due to the extremely high level of CCR5 expression at the surface of T cells in the transgenic mice. Since activation down-regulates hCCR5 expression, we tested the ability of TAK-779 to inhibit HIV-1 entry into activated mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Under these conditions, 20&#x00025; of the cells were infected, and TAK-779 effectively blocked entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). There was no virus entry in control experiments with cells from hCD4/hCCR5-negative mice. Thus, R5 virus can efficiently enter mouse T cells expressing human CD4 and CCR5.

While this virus (HIV-CMV-GFP) gave similar result to HIV-GFP virus in primary T cells from hCyclinT1 transgenic mice, it bypassed the need for hCylin T1 in mouse T cells.

Removal of anti-CD3 and CD28 after HIV-1 infection reduced the percentage of GFP<italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> T cells 5&#x02013;10-fold to 0.5&#x02013;1&#x00025;. Treatment with anti-CD28 or IL-2 was neither necessary nor sufficient for enhanced HIV-1 infection. We further tested if phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin could replace anti-CD3 in promoting HIV replication. Mouse T cells were pre-activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. After HIV-1 infection, PMA and ionomycin were added instead of anti-CD3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, treatment with PMA alone fully recapitulated the role of anti-CD3.</p><p>To determine if the effect of TCR signaling was unique to HIV-1, we treated mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the same way during infection with MLV. At high MOI, infection efficiency was similar with or without the secondary TCR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). At low MOI, removal of the anti-CD3 antibody at 3 h post-infection resulted in a 50&#x00025; reduction in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The secondary TCR signal therefore enhances infection of murine T cells with both MLV and HIV-1, but appears to have a greater effect upon infection with HIV-1.</p><p>To further characterize the requirement for TCR signaling, we infected activated mouse T cells and re-plated them without anti-CD3 stimulation. At the peak of reverse transcription (12 to 15 h post-infection), we re-plated the cells on anti-CD3 (condition (4) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Antibody was removed at 24 h post infection and cells were assayed at 48 h post-infection. Under these conditions, 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; of the maximum infection efficiency was obtained, as compared to 7&#x02013;10&#x00025; if CD3 stimulation was not provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>To establish which stage of the HIV replication cycle was enhanced by TCR signaling, we analyzed reverse transcription under the various stimulation conditions. Late reverse transcription products were decreased about 2&#x02013;3 fold in the absence of secondary stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), but the reduction was more modest than the 10-fold effect in infection efficiency. To measure the difference in integrated provirus, a two round amplification strategy was employed, with the first round using primers specific for HIV-1 Gag and SINE B2 sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Greger1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Ha1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and the second round using primers and probes specific for HIV-1 U5. Integrated provirus levels were reduced 5&#x02013;8 fold in the absence of a secondary TCR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). As pre-activated T cells are actively engaged in cell proliferation (at least once per 24 h) and we did not find consistent down-regulation of 2-LTR circles (data not shown), we do not believe that nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA was affected in the absence of the secondary TCR signal. These results suggest that the activation signals are important for both reverse transcription and other pre-integration steps (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).

Our results indicate that activation of primary mouse T cells prior to infection with HIV is not sufficient for viral replication, and that secondary TCR signals are required for post-entry events.</p><p>Ligation of the TCR/CD3 complex activates several distinct signaling pathways, including the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway that is dependent on PKC-&#x003b8; and CARMA1.

Primary T cells from both strains of mutant mice supported HIV-1 infection as long as secondary TCR signals were provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, signaling pathways involved in efficient integration of the HIV-1 provirus are independent of these upstream effectors of NF-&#x003ba;B activation.

Expression of hCD4, CCR5 and hCyclin T1 in mouse T cells removed the block to HIV entry and greatly enhanced viral transcription. In this study, we relieved the block prior to integration by providing TCR signals and Cyclosporin A after HIV-1 infection. However, multiple additional blocks were found to exist in primary mouse T cells. These blocks together prohibit release of high titers of infectious HIV-1 sufficient for virus spreading.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Virus Entry</title><p>Transgenic constructs containing enhancers, promoter, and silencer of the h<italic>CD4</italic> gene enable high expression of hCD4 and hCCR5 on the surface of mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in the transgenic mice used in this study. There are very few cells that are hCD4 or hCCR5 positive but mouse CD4 negative (Data not shown). While this is a good system to study virus entry, CCR5 is expressed at a much higher level on all mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, in contrast to human T cells, in which it is expressed primarily on memory rather than na&#x000ef;ve T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Sundrud1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the transgenic mouse cells were more permissive than human cells for virus entry. This transgenic model may hence lead to more severe T cell depletion if the other blocks to HIV-1 replication can be solved, and a better model to use may be hCCR5 knock-in mice.</p><p>The expression level of hCCR5 was down regulated by activation using coated anti-CD3/28 antibodies. This is consistent with previous studies showing that anti-CD28 down-regulates CCR5 in human T cells, inhibiting R5 tropic HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Carroll1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in mouse cells, degradation rather than synthesis of CCR5 RNA may be affected, as hCCR5 expression was not driven by the endogenous promoter. CCR5 down-regulation resulted in reduction in entry of HIV-1 into activated mouse T cells. This may not be a problem <italic>in vivo</italic> as HIV-1 can enter resting cells, in which reverse transcription is initiated. Subsequent steps of the HIV life cycle can then be completed upon T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Zack1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Zhou1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We also note that hCCR5 staining with antibody did not correlate well with the efficiency of hCCR5 mediated virus entry. For example, a much lower percentage of human T cells can be stained with hCCR5 antibody, while they supported 30&#x00025; of virus entry. This could be due to the need for few hCCR5 molecules to obtain virus entry.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Reverse Transcription</title><p>Using HIV-1 pseudotyped with VSVG to normalize entry in mouse and human T cells, we found that HIV-1 reverse transcription had the same kinetics in the two species. Reverse transcription products peaked around 12&#x02013;15 h, which was followed by down-regulation of virus DNA induced by an unknown mechanism. From these data, we are able to conclude that there is no block to reverse transcription in mouse cells. These conclusions are supported by a recent publication which also found no block to reverse transcription in primary mouse T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Tsurutani1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, reduction of reverse transcription products was observed in mouse T cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Baumann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This may be because of the use of high MOI of viruses or if mouse T cell lines behave differently from primary T cells. The differences between primary mouse T cells and T cell lines may be due to genetic background or to transcriptional changes that occurred upon transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Nuclear import and integration</title><p>We found similar levels of 2-LTR circles in HIV-infected mouse and human T cells, consistent with equivalent nuclear import of preintegration complexes. Integration is more difficult to compare between mouse and human cells. One way to quantify integration of HIV-1 is to separate genomic from small molecular weight DNA and quantify the integrated provirus. This experiment needs to be carefully controlled since a small amount of contamination with un-integrated HIV DNA can influence the results. To measure integration in human cells, many groups have taken advantage of the abundant Alu sequences which are found, on average, every 500bp throughout the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-ODoherty1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. SINE B2 sequences in mouse cells are less frequent; however, they can be used to compare the efficiency of HIV-1 integration among mouse cell samples. Because HIV-1 integration cannot be quantitatively compared between species by using these methods, we have chosen to compare integration efficiency between mouse and human by infecting cells with HIV-GFP and using GFP expression as a surrogate marker for integration, an approach used previously to study blocks in the HIV replication cycle in 3T3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Bieniasz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Mariani1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found that Cyclosporin A can double the infection efficiency of primary mouse T cells at a concentration that inhibits NFAT signaling. CsA probably works on steps after reverse transcription, since it had similar effect on cells treated between 12 h and 24 h post-infection (data not shown). It was reported that interruption of the interaction between HIV-1 CA and Cyclophilin A has opposite effects in human cells and non-permissive cells from other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Berthoux1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Sokolskaja1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Towers1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, treatment of owl monkey cells with CsA increased the proportion of HIV-1 DNA in the nucleus and led to a 100&#x02013;1000-fold increase in virus titer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Berthoux1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Sokolskaja1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Towers1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It was reported that Cyclosporin A enhanced the infection efficiency in primary mouse bone marrow cells but had no effect on primary mouse splenic T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Noser1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The failure to detect the enhancement in mouse T cells was likely due to the absence of TCR signals, which obscured the effect of Cyclosporin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We speculate that there is a mechanism similar to that in non-human primates, involving Cyclophilin A blockade of mouse T cell infection with HIV-1. It will be interesting to determine whether the G89V HIV mutant, whose CA cannot interact with Cyclophilin A, has a higher infection efficiency in mouse T cells. Mouse cells do not have a Trim5&#x003b1; ortholog, but other related proteins may be involved in this host restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Activation signals for HIV-1 infection</title><p>In the process of optimizing conditions for HIV-1 infection of mouse T cells, we found that additional TCR signals were essential, in a limited time window, for infection of pre-activated T cells. In the absence of a secondary stimulus late reverse transcription products were decreased 2&#x02013;3 fold. Although this suggests that TCR signals can enhance the reverse transcription of HIV-1, this is not likely to be the critical step affected, since providing TCR signals at the peak of reverse transcription did not result in a rebound of reverse transcription (data not shown), but rescued infection to an average of 70&#x00025; of the maximum efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The TCR signals increased the efficiency of HIV-1 integration in mouse T cells about 5&#x02013;8 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). It remains possible that TCR signals also affect steps subsequent to HIV integration. However, similar results were obtained using reporter HIV viruses whose GFP expression was driven by either CMV or LTR. Moreover, there was no change in GFP expression in infected primary mouse T cells when the secondary TCR signal was provided at 5 days instead of 3 hours post infection (data not shown). An accurate assessment will require a reliable technique that can quantify and compare levels of the integrated provirus between primary mouse and human T cells.</p><p>In a recent paper describing HIV-1 infection of primary mouse T cells from hCD4/CXCR4 transgenic mice, a significant pre-integration block was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Tsurutani1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The block was ascribed to mis-localization of HIV-1 integrase protein from nucleus to the cytoplasm, but this was assessed in mouse 3T3 cells. We and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Bieniasz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Mariani1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;&#x0005d;</xref> have not observed a pre-integration block in 3T3 cells, suggesting that the localization of integrase protein is unrelated to successful nuclear import or integration. The major difference between our results and those in the recent paper most likely lies in the continued TCR stimulation that we employ, although it remains possible that there is an effect on integrase localization in the primary T cells.</p><p>Identification of the TCR signaling pathways involved in relieving the pre-integration blocks may provide further insight towards developing a mouse model for HIV-1 replication. It remains to be determined if antigen-presenting cell-T cell interaction is sufficient to provide the secondary TCR signals. Further experiments must be performed to establish which molecules downstream of the TCR can function to increase HIV infection. PKC&#x003b8; and CARMA1, which are required for NF-&#x003ba;B activation in T cells, as well as WASp are dispensable for efficient HIV infection after TCR stimulation. However, the PI3K-AKT pathway may be involved in promoting proviral integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Francois1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. PI3K inhibitor, added 1 h post-infection of primary mouse T cells, completely blocked HIV-1 infection in the presence of anti-CD3/28 and IL-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002035.s003">Figure S3</xref>). It is known that at different concentrations PI3K inhibitor can block both PI3K and its downstream kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Cuenda1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, PI3K is involved in DNA damage repair. Molecules involved in the DNA damage repair pathway have been implicated in HIV-1 integration, although these results are controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Ariumi1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Daniel1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Daniel2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Our preliminary results thus suggest that the PI3K/Akt, but not the NF-&#x003ba;B, pathway is important in facilitating post-entry steps of HIV replication in murine T cells.</p><p>The effect of secondary TCR signaling is not necessary for mouse T cell lines and primary human T cells. This implies that there is a species-specific factor(s) responsible for the pre-integration block in primary mouse T cells. In mouse cell lines, the TCR signals may have been bypassed upon transformation, and hence such stimulation has little effect. We note a much higher infection efficiency found in the mouse T cell lines used in this study, compared to another report indicating significant pre-integration blocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Baumann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This may be due to the different genetic backgrounds between cell lines, similar to the observation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002035-g004">Figure 4C</xref> that primary cells from B6 and Balb/c are less infectable than cells from transgenic or knockout mice with mixed background. Further work needs to be done to identify the specific protein(s) involved in the TCR-dependent increase in HIV-1 infection. This may allow the generation of genetically manipulated mice that are permissive for single round HIV infection and may provide a better understanding of the pre-integration steps in HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Virus release</title><p>The last step of the HIV-1 life cycle is virus budding and release. HIV-1 transgenic mice can potentially be used to study this and other post-gene expression steps. However, HIV has been shown to be toxic for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Sun1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Jamieson1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Holm1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, so mature CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the HIV transgenic mice have potentially undergone changes to allow them to survive. For this reason, we assessed particle maturation and release in freshly-infected T cells from hCyclin T1 transgenic mice. Because primary mouse T cells are very sensitive to apoptosis and activated primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are prone to activation-induced cell death, we used low viral MOI and optimized conditions to avoid cell death. We used VSVG-pseudotyped virus for these assays as the Env protein of HIV-1 was found to be more toxic to primary T cells than VSVG, as indicated by apoptosis analysis based on AnnexinV staining (data not shown). Additionally, removal of CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells resulted in substantial increase in survival of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Under these conditions, we observed a block in release of HIV-1 from mouse cells.</p><p>Compared to virus released from human T cells, virus released from primary mouse T cells was 6&#x02013;10 fold less infectious. Compounding this reduced infectivity of released particles was the dramatic decrease in intracellular Gag. It is possible that viral restriction by host factors is more significant when virus production is low. We will have a better understanding of infectivity of particles released from mouse cells once we have improved the transcription and processing of HIV-1 Gag protein.</p><p>Electron microscopy further confirmed the release block in mouse primary T cells. In these experiments, virus budding appeared to be abnormal in mouse T cells. We observed virus particle budding into the nuclear membrane and inducing swelling between the inner and outer nuclear membrane. We failed to observe virus budding out of the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to human cells where we easily observed viral release from the plasma membrane.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that primary T cells from hCD4/CCR5/Cyclin T1 mice support efficient HIV-1 virus entry, reverse transcription and nuclear import. TCR signals were found to be essential to relieve a pre-integration block in mouse T cells, and this block was further relieved by CsA. The effect on proviral integration was confined to primary T cells, highlighting the importance of studying such cells in addition to immortalized cell lines in our efforts to acquire a better understanding of HIV replication. Our results also indicate that additional host factors wait to be identified to solve inefficient transcription, Gag translation, Gag processing and virus release.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice and Plasmids</title><p>Human CD4/CCR5/Cyclin T1 transgenic mice were generated individually and bred into double or triple transgenic lines.

Real-time PCRs were done using primers and probes specific for U5, 2<sup>nd</sup> transfer and 2-LTR circles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Triques1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002035-Julias1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, Serial dilutions of HIV-GFP or 2-LTR plasmid in genomic DNA were used to generate a standard curve in each plate. Calculation of cell number was determined based on real-time PCR for gene encoding eukaryotic18S rRNA (Hs99999901_s1, Taqman, Applied Biosystem) with common sequence for human and mouse. Real-time PCRs were performed using QuantiTect Multiplex PCR mix (Qiagen) in the i-Cycler Sequence Detection System (Bio-Rad). The running conditions and primer sequences were as the follows. For 2-LTR circles, 95&#x000b0;C 5 min, then 95&#x000b0;C 45 s, 55&#x000b0;C 1 min, 72&#x000b0;C 1 min for 40 cycles.

One day post infection, cells were treated with 0.01&#x02013;0.04&#x00025; pronase to remove the virus stuck to the plasma membrane. Two days following infection, cell pellets and supernatants were separated after centrifugation (2,000x g, 5 min) and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton, 1&#x00025; Deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA). p24 in cell lysates and supernatants was measured by ELISA. ELISA was set up using primary and secondary p24 antibody purchased from CLINIQA. Recombinant HIV-1 p24 was included for standard curves. For western blots, aliquots of cell lysates were separated on 12&#x00025; acrylamide gradient gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. Western blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 p24 (NIH AIDs Research and Reference Reagent Program).
