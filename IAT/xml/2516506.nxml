The aims of the present study were to explore whether the retina produces CST, and to compare its expression between diabetic and nondiabetic donors. Retinal neurodegeneration was assessed by measuring glial fibrilar acidic protein (GFAP) by confocal laser microscopy and counting the apoptotic TUNEL positive cells in which nuclear fragmentation as well as condensation were present.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human postmortem eyes (10) from five diabetic donors were compared with 10 eyes from five nondiabetic donors, matched by age. CST mRNA (RT&#x02013;PCR) and CST (confocal laser microscopy) were measured separately in both the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Retinal neurodegeneration was assessed by measuring glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) by confocal laser microscopy and counting the apoptotic cells by TUNEL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CST was found to be produced by the human retina, and higher levels of CST mRNA were found in RPE than in the neuroretina. CST mRNA levels in diabetic donors were significantly lower in both the RPE (p=0.001) and the neuroretina (p=0.03) in comparison with nondiabetic donors. CST immunofluorescence was in agreement with mRNA expression, but the differences were only significant when comparing neuroretinas (p=0.03). Increased GFAP and a higher degree of apoptosis were observed in diabetic retinas in comparison with nondiabetic retinas. These changes were inversely related with CST levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CST is expressed in the human retina. There is more CST in the RPE than in the neuroretina. A lower expression of CST exists in diabetic retinas and it is associated with retinal neurodegeneration.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) remains the leading cause of blindness among adults aged &#x0003c;40 years in the developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. The balance between the angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors is crucial in determining the progression of PDR. We previously demonstrated that somatostatin (SST) concentration is higher in the vitreous fluid than in plasma in nondiabetic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. In addition, a significantly lower intravitreous concentration of SST has been detected in PDR patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and patients with diabetic macular edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] in comparison with nondiabetic control subjects; SST-28 was the main molecular variant accounting for this deficit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, we have found significantly lower <italic>SST</italic> mRNA expression in retinas from diabetic donors in comparison with nondiabetic donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. These findings suggest both that SST could be added to the list of natural angiogenic inhibitors that exist in the vitreous fluid and that a deficit of intravitreal SST could be involved in retinal neovascularization.</p><p>Cortistatin (CST) is a neuropeptide identified by Lecea et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] that has a strong structural similarity to SST. CST shares 11 of 14 residues with SST, including those that are essential for binding to the five SST receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. As a consequence, it has similar pharmacological and functional properties to SST, including depression of neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], and an inhibitory effect on growth hormone, prolactin, and insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Despite many similar functions between these two neuropeptides, SST and CST are products of different genes. CST-17 and CST-29 are the two main CST molecular variants cleaved from the human prepro-CST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In initial studies, expression of CST has only been described in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], but further studies have demonstrated expression of CST in several peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Indeed, we demonstrated that CST levels were higher in the vitreous fluid than in the plasma and we found no relationship between vitreous and plasma concentrations. In addition, lower intravitreous levels of CST were detected in PDR patients than in nondiabetic controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. These findings suggest that CST is intraocularly synthesized, but to the best of our knowledge there is no information regarding CST expression in the retina.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate <italic>CST</italic> mRNA and protein levels in retinas from diabetic and nondiabetic donors. Moreover, to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the decreased CST concentrations in the vitreous fluid of diabetic patients, we assessed the relationship between retinal <italic>CST</italic> expression and retinal neurodegeneration. This was assessed by measuring glial fibrilar acidic protein (GFAP) by confocal laser microscopy and counting TUNEL positive cells in which nuclear fragmentation and condensation were present.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human retinas</title><p>Human postmortem eyes (10) were obtained from five diabetic donors (64.5&#x000b1;8.3 years). Diabetic donors had no history of renal failure or cardiovascular events. Ophthalmic examinations performed two years before death revealed diabetic donors to be free of fundoscopic abnormalities. Eye cups obtained from five nondiabetic donors (10 cups in total), matched by age (66.2&#x000b1;6.4 years), were used as the control group. Nondiabetic donors had no history of renal failure or cardiovascular events. However, we can not confirm that these subjects had normal eye exams two years prior to death because they were not periodically screened as diabetic patients. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these patients did not have diabetes or any significant ocular disease. Therefore, although they potentially could had some mild ocular abnormalities, these lesions were absolutely unrelated to diabetes and, in consequence, they constituted a good control group for the purpose of the study.

In addition, we provide evidence that <italic>CST</italic> mRNA expression is lower in diabetic retinas (both in the neuroretina and the RPE) than in nondiabetic retinas. This finding could explain our previous results regarding the deficit of intravitreous levels of CST in patients with PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. It should be noted that diabetic fundoscopic abnormalities were not detected in diabetic donors in the two years preceding death, thus suggesting that the lower CST expression detected in diabetic subjects is an early event in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Recently, we have obtained similar results with SST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>The functional role of CST in retinal physiology remains to be elucidated. Since CST binds all five cloned SST receptors, it could be speculated that it acts like SST in sharing antiangiogenic and neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. However, CST also has properties which distinguish it from SST. In this regard, it should be noted that CST, but not SST, has been detected in various human immune cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Because CST levels correlate with the degree of inflammatory cell differentiation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], this peptide could function as a major endogenous regulatory factor in the immune system. The superior potency of CST in reducing inflammation as compared with SST and octreotide might reside in the capacity of CST to activate different receptors and transduction pathways. This is supported by the fact that the SST receptor antagonist cyclosomatostatin completely reversed the antiinflammatory effect of SST and octreotide in vitro, whereas only partially reversing the effect of CST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. CST-29 has recently been shown to prevent inflammation in rodent models for human diseases, raising novel therapeutic properties for this neuropeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that the therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect of CST is mediated by decreasing the local and systemic levels of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Given that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], the low levels of CST detected in diabetic patients might contribute to the enhancement of this pathogenic pathway. Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] have shown that expression of CST and SST and SST-receptors are all downregulated by TNF-alpha in human coronary artery endothelial cells. TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and, therefore, it could also be possible that the lower levels of CST detected in diabetic patients were the consequence rather than the cause of inflammation.</p><p>In the present study, CST retinal levels were inversely associated with apoptosis and glial activation degree, two of the characteristic features of retinal neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. We have recently found similar results with SST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Neurodegeneration is an important event in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and it has been involved in the functional deficits in vision that first appear in diabetes even before vascular abnormalities can be appreciated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. The design of our study does not permit us to answer whether the lower CST expression in diabetic retinas is a cause or a consequence of retinal neurodegeneration. However, given that CST has neuroprotective and antiapoptotic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] it is possible that its lower expression could be involved in diabetic retinal neurodegeneration.</p><p>Finally, the high expression of CST observed in RPE cells deserves a further comment. In the retina, various ion and water transport systems are located at the apical side of RPE adjacent to the subretinal space and, indeed, a high expression of SST receptor 2 has been shown on this apical membrane of RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. We have recently show lower levels of SST in the vitreous from diabetic patients with macular edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. This finding suggest that the lower production of SST might be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema. Given that CST and SST share the same receptors, it is possible that CST (as occurs with SST) participates in the balance of fluid and ion transport through the retina. However, specific studies aimed at evaluating the potential role of CST in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema are needed.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide evidence that CST is expressed in the human retina. In addition, an early reduction of CST expression exists in the retinas of diabetic patients. Since CST has antiangiogenic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects, our results point to lowered CST expression as a mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Further studies are needed to elucidate not only the precise role of CST in the development of diabetic retinopathy but also its potential role as a therapeutic target.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from Fundaci&#x000f3;n para la Diabetes, Novo Nordisk Pharma S.A, the Academia de Ci&#x000e8;ncies M&#x000e9;diques de Catalunya i Balears, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CIBERDEM), and the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (SAF2006&#x02013;05284).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Simo</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Strategies for blocking angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy by intravitreal therapy.
