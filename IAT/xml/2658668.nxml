Their invasiveness and pathogenesis relies on a variable arsenal of virulence factors, paired with resistance to virtually all &#x003b2;-lactams and their derivatives. Their ability to rapidly generate resistance to other unrelated classes of antibiotics, or to take up additional resistance determinants, severely hampers therapy and eradication.</p><p>In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, methicillin resistance is conferred by an acquired, &#x003b2;-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PBP2a is encoded by <italic>mecA</italic>, which is divergently transcribed from its cognate regulators, <italic>mecR1 </italic>(sensor/signal transducer) and <italic>mecI </italic>(repressor). If <italic>mecR1-mecI </italic>are absent or truncated, transcriptional control of <italic>mecA </italic>is taken over by the structurally similar <italic>blaZ </italic>(penicillinase) regulatory elements <italic>blaR1</italic>/<italic>blaI</italic>, if present. In the absence of both regulatory loci, <italic>mecA </italic>is constitutively transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the presence of &#x003b2;-lactams, the transmembrane sensor/signal transducers BlaR1/MecR1, undergo a conformational change, followed by autoproteolytic cleavage of the n-terminal cytoplasmic domain, leading to the activation of the cytoplasmic peptidase and subsequent dissociation of the repressor due to proteolytic degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the signal transduction cascade of this regulatory system has still not been completely elucidated.</p><p>Oxacillin resistance levels conferred by <italic>mecA </italic>are strain specific and can vary greatly, with oxacillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of different strains ranging from phenotypically susceptible levels, as low as 1 &#x003bc;g/ml up to extremely high values of &#x0003e; 500 &#x003bc;g/ml. Methicillin resistance is also generally expressed heterogeneously. Heterogeneously resistant MRSA, when exposed to &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, segregate highly resistant subpopulations, which are much more resistant than the majority of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The frequency of highly resistant subclones generated is often well above the spontaneous mutation frequency, and once selected high level resistance often remains stable, even in the absence of selective pressure. There is currently no satisfactory genetic model which explains how these higher resistance levels are triggered or selected and exactly what factors are functionally responsible for the increased resistance in clinical isolates. Methicillin resistance levels are known to not directly correlate with <italic>mecA </italic>transcription or levels of PBP2a produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, resistance levels can be manipulated by environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, osmolarity, and medium composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown experimentally, that in addition to <italic>mecA</italic>, methicillin resistance depends on the correct interplay of a multitude of genomic factors, termed <italic>fem/aux </italic>factors, including genes involved in peptidoglycan precursor formation, composition and turnover; teichoic acid synthesis; and genes of unknown or poorly characterised functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to structural genes, many regulatory loci have also been shown to influence resistance levels, including global regulators of virulence factor production such as the quorum sensing <italic>agr </italic>system, the staphylococcal accessory regulator SarA and the alternate sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; regulators of metabolism, such as the catabolite control protein A (CcpA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; and the VraSR two-component sensor transducer, which induces the cell wall stress stimulon in response to cell wall active antibiotic challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The vast MIC differences between MRSA strains, the population heterogeneity within single strains and the dependence of resistance levels on external factors are reflected in these many structural genes and global regulators, which can influence resistance levels.</p><p>While typically considered nosocomial pathogens, new faster growing and apparently more virulent MRSA have begun spreading in the community. Interestingly, these emerging strains often express very low methicillin resistance, e.g. the MRSA clone spreading amongst intravenous drug users in the Zurich area, which has an in vitro doubling time of 25 min, but oxacillin MICs of only 0.5 to 4 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This particular clone's low-level resistance is partially due to a promoter mutation, leading to tight repression of <italic>mecA</italic>, but resistance levels appear to be mainly restricted by unknown factors within its genomic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To identify potential factors involved in <italic>mecA </italic>regulation or methicillin resistance levels in such an extremely low level resistant MRSA, we performed DNA-binding protein purification assays, using the <italic>mecA </italic>operator region as bait. A novel, uncharacterized protein, SA1665, was found to bind to this DNA fragment, and shown to increase methicillin resistance levels when deleted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of SA1665</title><p>MRSA strain CHE482 is the type strain for the so-called "drug clone" spreading amongst intravenous drug users in the Zurich area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This strain carries <italic>mecA </italic>and expresses PBP2a, but appears phenotypically methicillin susceptible by conventional phenotypic tests. However, like most other low-level resistant MRSA, it can segregate a small proportion of higher resistant subclones in the presence of &#x003b2;-lactams. We hypothesized that regulation of methicillin resistance in such low-level resistant clonal lineages may differ qualitatively from classical heterogeneously- or highly-resistant MRSA.</p><p>A DNA-binding protein purification assay was performed to identify new potential factors involved in the regulation of <italic>mecA</italic>/PBP2a. The <italic>mecA/mecR1 </italic>intergenic DNA region, including the 5' 9 bp of <italic>mecR1 </italic>and the first 52 bp of <italic>mecA</italic>, was used as bait against crude protein extract from strain CHE482. Proteins binding to this DNA fragment were analysed by SDS-PAGE. Even though CHE482 contained BlaI, which is known to bind to the <italic>mec </italic>operator, this band could not be identified on gels due to co-migrating, non-specific bands the same size as BlaI (14.9 KDa) that bound to both the DNA-coated and uncoated control beads. The most prominent protein band of ~16&#x02013;20 kDa, isolated from DNA-labelled but not from control beads, was identified as the hypothetical protein SA1665 (N315 genome annotation [BA000018]) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). SA1665 encodes a predicted 17-kDa protein with an n-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif characteristic of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. The amino acid sequence of SA1665 showed 100% identity amongst <italic>S. aureus </italic>database sequences and 97&#x02013;98% identity amongst other staphylococci, including <italic>S. haemolyticus</italic>, <italic>S. epidermidis </italic>and <italic>S. saprophyticus</italic>, indicating that SA1665 is highly conserved. Conversely, there were no orfs highly similar to SA1665 found in other bacterial species, with the most similar sequences found in <italic>Bacillus licheniformis </italic>DSM13 and <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense </italic>Y51, which shared only 64% and 59% similarity, respectively.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DNA-binding protein purification assay using <italic>mec </italic>operator DNA region as a bait</bold>.

A band shift was observed with extracts from the strain expressing recombinant nHis<sub>6</sub>-SA1665 but not from the control strain carrying the empty plasmid. Several bands resulted from the shift, which is most likely due to protein oligomerisation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The specificity of the gel shift was also demonstrated by the addition of increasing concentrations of purified nHis<sub>6</sub>-SA1665 protein to the biotinylated-DNA fragment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Band-shift of the biotinylated DNA was inhibited in the presence of specific competitor DNA but not by the presence of the non-specific competitor DNA, confirming that nHis<sub>6</sub>-SA1665 had a specific binding affinity for the 161-bp DNA fragment.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Electromobility shift of <italic>mec </italic>operator DNA by SA1665</bold>.

RNA samples taken from different time points over the growth curve of CHE482 showed that SA1665 was expressed strongly in early exponential phase at OD<sub>600 nm </sub>0.25 and 0.5, then transcript levels decreased and were almost undetectable in early stationary phase at OD<sub>600 nm </sub>4.0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In addition to the main transcript of ~0.46 kb, a weaker, larger transcript of ~0.6 kb was also visible, especially at later growth stages. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> shows the transcriptional behaviour of SA1665 when CHE482 cells were challenged with sub-inhibitory (4 &#x003bc;g/ml) and inhibitory (120 &#x003bc;g/ml) concentrations of cefoxitin. These results showed that low levels of cefoxitin, such as those used to induce <italic>mecA</italic>/<italic>mecR1 </italic>transcription, appeared to slightly decrease SA1665 transcription after 30 min exposure, while larger, inhibitory concentrations caused even more significant alterations in the SA1665 transcriptional profile, making it similar to that normally seen in stationary phase growth. These results indicate that transcription of SA1665 may respond in some way to cell wall stress, rather than in direct response to the presence of &#x003b2;-lactams. This observation is based on relatively subtle changes in SA1665 transcription, especially at low concentrations of cefoxitin such as those required for <italic>mecA</italic>/<italic>mecR1 </italic>induction. Since deletion of SA1665 has been shown to increase &#x003b2;-lactam resistance, reduced SA1665 transcription in the presence of &#x003b2;-lactams may also provide some protection against &#x003b2;-lactam exposure.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Northern and Western blot analyses</bold>.

The effects of SA1665 deletion on directly up- and down-stream genes were also investigated. Northern blots of the neighbouring genes SA1664, SA1666 and SA1667, showed that expression of all three genes was very weak compared to that of SA1665. A weak transcript of about 3 kb was present in hybridizations probed with orfs SA1665-SA1667. This band decreased in size in the SA1665 mutant when probed with SA1666 and SA1667. One of the transcripts hybridising to the SA1664 probe also decreased in size by ~0.5 kb in the SA1665 mutant, suggesting that SA1665 was present on several transcripts of different lengths, including a high abundance monocistronic transcript and low abundance polycistronic transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Transcript abundance of both the upstream SA1666-SA1667 operon and the downstream SA1664-specific transcript all appeared to increase slightly in &#x00394;CHE482.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, all pairs of wild type and mutant strains had similar amounts of PBP2a present both before and after induction with cefoxitin, indicating that SA1665 deletion did not alter amounts of PBP2a produced. Therefore it seems that SA1665 exerts no direct control over <italic>mecA </italic>or PBP2a expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Methicillin resistance in MRSA is primarily dependent on the presence of the <italic>mecA </italic>gene, however, resistance levels are generally governed by strain-specific factors including <italic>mecA </italic>regulatory elements and other chromosomal <italic>fem/aux </italic>factors which either enhance or repress the expression of resistance. For instance, the very low-level methicillin resistance of the Zurich drug clone CHE482, was shown to be controlled by its genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] suggesting that it either contained or lacked certain <italic>fem/aux </italic>factors involved in controlling resistance expression. Many of the currently known <italic>fem/aux </italic>factors are directly or indirectly involved in cell wall synthesis and turnover, or envelope biogenesis, however there still remain factors of unknown function. Most of the currently known <italic>fem/aux </italic>factors reduce methicillin resistance levels when inactivated. A few genes, such as <italic>lytH, dlt</italic>, <italic>norG</italic>, <italic>sarV </italic>and <italic>cidA </italic>increase resistance levels upon inactivation or mutation. All of these genes, except <italic>norG</italic>, which is an efflux pump regulator, play a role in either autolysis or are important for cell physiology and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Other genes increase &#x003b2;-lactam resistance upon overexpression, such as <italic>hmrA </italic>coding for a putative amidohydrolase, <italic>hmrB </italic>coding for a putative acyl carrier protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], or the NorG-controlled <italic>abcA </italic>multidrug efflux pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>SA1665, a predicted DNA-binding transcriptional regulator, was found to bind to a DNA fragment containing the <italic>mecA </italic>promoter region. However, although this protein shifted the <italic>mecA </italic>operator/5' coding sequence, it did not appear to directly control <italic>mecA </italic>or <italic>mecR1 </italic>transcription or PBP2a production. Therefore its binding to the <italic>mecA </italic>region may have no specific regulatory function. Such interactions have been noted before, such as the HTH protein NorG, which was shown to bind specifically to <italic>norA</italic>, <italic>norB </italic>and <italic>norC </italic>promoters, but only transcription of <italic>norB </italic>was increased when NorG was overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We have to postulate therefore that SA1665 may modulate &#x003b2;-lactam resistance in a <italic>mecA</italic>-independent manner, by controlling cellular functions affecting resistance levels. Experiments to determine the SA1665 regulon are ongoing. The impact of deleting SA1665 in MRSA was extremely strain specific, underlining the importance of the genetic background in governing the final methicillin resistance levels of MRSA, and demonstrating the large genomic variability between different strain lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SA1665 is a previously uncharacterised DNA-binding protein that has a negative effect on &#x003b2;-lactam resistance in MRSA. The SA1665 protein was identified in a DNA-binding protein purification assay, in which it bound to a DNA fragment covering the <italic>mec </italic>operator region. However, while nonpolar deletion of SA1665 was shown to increase oxacillin resistance levels in several heterogeneously resistant MRSA, its deletion had no effect on <italic>mecA </italic>transcription or PBP2a production. Therefore the negative impact of SA1665 on methicillin resistance is most likely to be through the regulation of other chromosomal factors or cellular functions required for methicllin resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.
