Similar to SjS patients, these mice develop lymphocytic infiltrates in their salivary glands, which leads to gland destruction and decreased salivary flow. The development of infiltrates is preceded by an accumulation of dendritic cells (DCs). Given the key role played by DCs in the initiation of immune responses, their accumulation as one of the early events in SjS indicates that DCs are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The precise cause of DC accumulation remains to be elucidated, but alterations in monocytes, which are considered to be a precursor population for DCs, have been described in the NOD mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, the subset of Ly-6C<sup>low </sup>monocytes is significantly expanded in the NOD circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This subset is thought to be a mature population that preferentially develops into tissue DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting a link between these cells and the DC accumulation observed in the salivary gland of NOD mice.</p><p>Apart from the low expression of Ly-6C, the mature monocyte subset is further characterized by low expression of CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2, and high expression of CX3C chemokine receptor (CX3CR)1, the fractalkine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fractalkine is the sole member of the CX3C chemokine family, first described in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It differs from other chemokines not only in its structure and relatively large size, but also in the fact that it occurs in both membrane bound and soluble forms. The membrane bound form functions as an adhesion molecule, whereas the soluble form is strongly chemotactic for monocytes and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Given the increase in mature Ly-6C<sup>low </sup>monocytes in the NOD circulation, their propensity to develop into DCs and the importance of fractalkine in chemoattraction of Ly-6C<sup>low </sup>monocytes, we studied the expression of fractalkine in NOD salivary glands. Although fractalkine was present in salivary glands of both NOD and control mice, a unique fragment of the protein was observed in NOD mice. Such a fragment may contribute to disruption of tolerance to fractalkine, resulting in an autoimmune response. Indeed, an anti-fractalkine antibody response in the NOD mouse is identified here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>NOD/LTj mice were bred in our own facility. Mice were tested for diabetes twice weekly and excluded from experiments when positive. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and were fed standard chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Female mice aged 5 to 25 weeks were used in all experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Erasmus University Animal Ethical Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue lysates and protease activity</title><p>Submandibular glands (SMGs) and pancreases were removed and cleared of adipose tissue and lymph nodes. Tissue was placed in phosphate-buffered saline, or phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets; Roche, Woerden, The Netherlands) where indicated, and homogenized by mechanical disruption followed by ultrasound sonification. Finally, lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Caspase-3 and gelatinase (matrix metalloprotease [MMP]-2/MMP-9) activity were measured using EnzCheck assay kits (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. &#x003b1;-Secretase activity was measured using a fluorogenic substrate (10 &#x003bc;g/reaction, alpha-secretase substrate II; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA), as indicated by the manufacturer. All results are shown as arbitrary units relative to the total amount of protein, as measured by Bradford analysis (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Protein content of lysates was measured by Bradford analysis (BioRad) and 50 &#x003bc;g of each lysate was loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and run under reducing conditions. For determination of protein size, the Kaleidoscope-prestained standard was used (BioRad). Afterward, protein was transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were then incubated with anti-fractalkine antibody (C-20, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by Donkey-anti-Goat-HRP (80 ng/ml; Santa Cruz). Expression was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) analysis (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). For detection of autoantibodies, tissue lysates known to contain specific forms of fractalkine were loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. After transfer, membranes were incubated with IgG purified from mouse serum by protein G-column separation or with total serum. This was followed by Rabbit-anti-mouse-HRP (1:20,000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and ECL analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>digestion assay</title><p>MMP-2 (65 ng/reaction; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) and MMP-9 (140 ng/reaction; R&#x00026;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) were activated by 1 mmol/l AMPA in 10 mmol/l CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mmol/l NaCl, and 50 mmol/l (Tris/HCl pH 7.5). Caspase-3 (10 ng/reaction; Gentaur, Brussels, Belgium) was diluted in 10 mmol/l PIPES, 2 mmol/l EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS and 5 mmol/l DTT (pH 7.4). A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain (ADAM)-10 and ADAM-17 (both 500 ng/reaction; R&#x00026;D systems Inc.) were diluted in 50 mmol/l HEPES, 5 &#x003bc;mol/l ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Brij-0 [pH 7.5]). Enzyme activity was confirmed by fluorimetric assay as described above. Active enzyme was then incubated with brain lysate (20 &#x003bc;g protein/reaction) for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C.

Because expression of fractalkine has been clearly described in normal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], this was used as a reference sample. Analysis of SMG tissue from young (age 5 weeks) NOD mice revealed expression of the protein at a molecular weight similar to that observed in brain lysates (31 kDa). However, when salivary glands of 15-week-old mice were studied, additional bands were observed at about 19 kDa and about 17 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Also, the 31 kDa band was less intense or even undetectable at these time points, indicating cleavage of fractalkine with increasing age in the salivary glands of NOD mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Altered fractalkine cleavage in NOD salivary gland.

At age 5 weeks no clear differences were found, with the expression of only the 31 kDa form of the protein in both control strains. At 10 weeks, the approximately 19 kDa band began to appear in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. However, whereas expression of the 31 kDa band frequently disappeared in NOD mice at this age, this band was still clearly present in the control strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The additional approximiately 17 kDa form of fractalkine, which was found in NOD mice, never appeared in either C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice at any time point up to 20 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). These results indicate that the profile of the cleavage process differs between NOD and control strains, and that the specific cleavage in NOD SMG results in the generation of a unique fractalkine fragment in the NOD mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage of fractalkine does not occur in NOD pancreas</title><p>The NOD mouse not only develops sialoadenitis but also autoimmune insulitis. Similar to the salivary glands, lymphocytic infiltration in the pancreas is preceded by an accumulation of DCs. Because the sialoadenitis and pancreatitis observed in NOD mice are usually considered to be the result of at least partly overlapping defects, expression of fractalkine in the pancreas was studied and compared with that of the SMG. In both NOD and control mice, expression of the 31 kDa form of fractalkine was detected at all ages tested. However, smaller products were not observed at any age, either in NOD or in the control strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). This indicates that the increase in protease activity is SMG specific.</p></sec><sec><title>ADAM-17 induces fractalkine cleavage, but ADAM-10 and caspase-3 do not</title><p>Altered protein breakdown has previously been described in the SMG of NOD mice, a specific example being the autoantigen &#x003b1;-fodrin, and this was linked to caspase-3 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, caspase-3 activity was measured in whole salivary gland lysates. Although activity could be detected at all ages, no increase in caspase-3 activity was observed in the NOD mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Furthermore, when brain lysates containing the 31 kDa form of fractalkine were incubated with recombinant caspase-3, no digestion of fractalkine was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> [insert]).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>ADAM-17 but not caspase-3 cleaves 31 kDa fractalkine. <bold>(a) </bold>Caspase-3 and <bold>(b) </bold>&#x003b1;-secretase activities were measured in tissue lysates prepared in phosphate-buffered saline without protease inhibitors using a fluorimetric assay.

These include ADAM-10 and ADAM-17, which have been shown to cleave fractalkine under steady-state and inflammatory conditions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. When measured in whole salivary gland lysates, &#x003b1;-secretase activity was significantly increased in NOD mice from the age of 15 weeks onward (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). When incubated with brain lysate <italic>in vitro</italic>, ADAM-17 but not ADAM-10 was capable of cleaving 31 kDa fractalkine. However, the approximately 19 and 17 kDa bands did not appear (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> [insert]), and neither did any smaller fractalkine fragments down to 6 kDa (data not shown). This indicates that although ADAM-17 may contribute to the fractalkine cleavage observed in NOD SMG, other proteases probably result in the generation of the approximately 19 kDa and 17 kDa fragments.</p></sec><sec><title>MMP-9 activity leads to cleavage of 31 kDa fractalkine</title><p>Increased expression of MMP-9 has been described in the salivary glands of SjS patients, and RNA levels of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are increased in the SMG of NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because fractalkine has been shown to be a ligand for MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], increased activity of these metalloproteases may be involved in the altered proteolysis of fractalkine. When measured in whole salivary gland lysates, gelatinase (combined MMP-2 and MMP-9) activity was increased in NOD mice aged 10 weeks &#x02013; the time point at which the increased cleavage of fractalkine in the NOD first becomes apparent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Furthermore, incubation of brain lysates with recombinant MMP-9, but not with MMP-2, resulted in a clear reduction in the 31 kDa form of fractalkine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). However, the approximately 19 and 17 kDa bands did not appear in this experiment, and neither did any smaller fragments down to 6 kDa (data not shown).

Therefore, the occurrence of autoantibodies against fractalkine was studied by testing the reactivity of mouse serum with blotted brain lysate containing the 31 kDa form of fractalkine. In the serum of young (5 weeks) animals, reactivity against the 31 kDa protein could not be detected. However, in the serum of animals older than 15 weeks, antibodies against a protein running at 31 kDa were detected in 10 out of 14 NOD mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In control animals, this was the case in significantly fewer (one out of six; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Similar results were obtained with purified IgG and total serum (data not shown). Fractalkine specificity of the anti-31 kDa band was confirmed by blotting against recombinant fractalkine (data not shown).

This breakdown did not occur in pancreas, indicating that the phenomenon is organ specific and not a result of local inflammation. Altered proteolytic cleavage in NOD salivary glands has previously been described for &#x003b1;-fodrin and parotid secretory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the case of &#x003b1;-fodrin, proteolysis is caused by the apoptotic enzyme caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although caspase-3 was detected in SMGs from mice of all ages, activity was not increased in NOD compared with control animals. Furthermore, caspase-3 did not cleave 31 kDa fractalkine <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two proteases described to be involved in the physiological shedding of fractalkine are ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, although the joint activity of these enzymes did increase in NOD mice at older ages (&#x0003e; 15 weeks) and ADAM-17 was capable of cleaving 31 kDa fractalkine <italic>in vitro</italic>, this did not results in the generation of the approximately 19 and 17 kDa bands.</p><p>Previous reports describe the abnormal breakdown of extracellular matrix components in SjS salivary glands, and this was linked to increased activity of MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In particular, expression of MMP-9 has consistently been found to be increased in salivary glands of SjS patients. In NOD mice, increased expression of this metalloprotease in SMG was reported in old (&#x0003e; 20 weeks) animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our study shows that MMP-9 activity has already increased at around 10 weeks of age, similar to the time point at which cleavage of fractalkine was first observed. Additionally, MMP-9 has been shown to be capable of degrading the 31 kDa form of fractalkine. However, the characteristic approximately 17 and 19 kDa forms did not appear. When fractalkine was incubated with MMP-9 and analyzed by total protein staining, neither the approximately 19 and 17 kDa fragments nor smaller fragments were detected (data not shown). This suggests that MMP-9 cleavage results in very small fragments, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Hence, although both ADAM-17 and MMP-9 are involved in the degradation of fractalkine, other proteases are likely to be responsible for the generation of the approximately 19 and 17 kDa fragments <italic>in vivo</italic>. Candidates for this function include members of the caspase family, such as caspase-1 and caspase-11, both of which are increased in the salivary glands under inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also, granzyme B may be involved, because this protease has been shown to generate antigenic fragments by cleaving &#x003b1;-fodrin, La protein and muscarinic receptor 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], all of which are known autoantigens in SjS.</p><p>The precise nature of the fractalkine fragments described in this study remains to be further elucidated. Attempts to isolate the fractalkine fragments from SMG lysates were unsuccessful because of the abundant presence of other proteins in the total gland lysates. However, the antibody used to detect fractalkine in this study recognizes the carboxyl-terminal end, indicating that both the approximately 19 and 17 kDa fragments contain this part of the protein. One hypothesis is that the approximately 19 and 17 kDa fragments are the remaining (carboxyl-terminal) fragments after shedding of the amino-terminal part of the protein. This amino-terminal part contains the chemokine domain, which in this model could be released into the circulation and enhance monocyte chemoattraction to the salivary glands. Previous studies have shown that fractalkine is indeed a substrate for metalloproteinases, resulting in the generation of a highly active chemotactic fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, the fractalkine receptor positive population of Ly-6C<sup>low </sup>monocytes is increased significantly in NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This population preferentially develops in tissue DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and fractalkine receptor positive cells resembling DCs were observed in murine salivary glands (HC Reinecker, personal communication). This supports the idea of chemotactic fractalkine contributing to the accumulation of DCs in NOD salivary glands. To investigate further this contribution, it would be interesting to cross CX3CR1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] back to the NOD background, and determine the effect on monocyte infiltration and DC accumulation.</p><p>In the case of &#x003b1;-fodrin, the altered cleavage in pSjS and NOD salivary glands results in an autoantigenic protein and the generation of autoantibodies as well as a specific T-cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Importantly, when cleavage of &#x003b1;-fodrin is inhibited, pathology is prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], indicating the significance of this process. In this study we showed that the abnormal cleavage of fractalkine is also accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies. In NOD mice, antibodies recognizing 31 kDa fractalkine were present from about 10 weeks and increased with age. In control mice, these autoantibodies were found in significantly fewer animals, and at lower concentrations. It is tempting to speculate that the abnormal breakdown of fractalkine in NOD SMG contributes to a break of tolerance against this self protein, thus resulting in the formation of autoantibodies. The source of fractalkine in the NOD SMG remains to be elucidated, but studies in human salivary gland show that fractalkine is expressed in glandular epithelium as well as ductal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. An anti-fractalkine response would therefore be targeted directly against the salivary gland epithelium, and contribute to destruction of the salivary gland tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Increased proteolytic activity in the salivary gland of NOD mice leads to the generation of aberrant fractalkine fragments. These may enhance the ongoing inflammation by functioning as autoantigens. Furthermore, the enhanced cleavage of fractalkine is hypothesized to result in increased chemotaxis. This dual role for fractalkine in local inflammation in SjS salivary glands indicates that fractalkine may be an interesting target for future therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADAM = a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain; CX3CR = CX3C chemokine receptor; DC = dendritic cell; ECL = enhanced chemiluminescence; MMP = matrix metalloprotease; NOD = nonobese diabetic; SjS = Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome; SMG = submandibular gland.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MEW designed the study, carried out the protease activity assays and was responsible for writing of the manuscript.
