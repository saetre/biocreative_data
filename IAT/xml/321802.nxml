Four highly homologous boxes (61, 82, 56 and 97 base pairs) between the human and mouse P1-450 genes are found in the "TATA" box promoter region, -226, -338, and -450 upstream from the cap site, respectively. Nine genomic-DNA samples were digested with each of 23 restriction endonucleases and probed with human P1-450 cDNA fragments; restriction fragment length polymorphisms are detected, although it remains to be seen whether such a recombinant DNA test will be useful in determining individuals at increased risk for cigarette smoking-induced cancer and toxicity. We show in this report, however, that human inducible P1-450 mRNA concentrations are very highly correlated (r = 0.98; N = 6) with genetic differences in benzo[a]pyrene metabolism in mitogen-activated lymphocyte cultures.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0295-a" xlink:role="4516"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4503"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4504"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4505"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4506"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4507"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4508"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4509"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4510"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4511"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4512"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4513"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4514"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4515"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4516"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4517"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4518"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4519"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4520"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
