STEC O157:H7 CCF treatment also led to a sharp drop of platelet counts. The reduction of cell surface CD47 was specific for platelets but not for neutrophil, monocytes and red blood cells. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was also observed in isolated human platelets treated with O157:H7 CCF. Platelet surface CD47 reduction by O157:H7 CCF could be blocked by anti-TLR4 antibody but not anti-CD62 antibody.

These results argue that down-regulation of CD47 expression level on platelet surfaces is positively correlated with platelet depletion by phagocytes such as macrophages, and that the interactions between platelet CD47 and macrophage SIRP&#x003b1; play a critical role in regulating platelet depletion in STEC infection-induced thrombocytopenia.</p><fig id="pone-0007131-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007131.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Enhanced phagocytosis of O157:H7 CCF-treated platelets by human monocytic-derived macrophages.</title><p>Percentage of phagocytosis was calculated as the fraction of macrophages with ingested platelets of the total number of macrophages analyzed in 6&#x02013;8 random selected fields per slide.

This conclusion was supported by the data derived from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. First, co-occurrence of platelet depletion and down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was observed in STEC O157:H7 infected mice. Reduction of CD47 expression level was likely specific for platelets since other cells in mouse blood stream had no alteration of surface CD47 after treatment. Second, we confirmed the effect of STEC O157:H7 CCF on reduction of platelet surface CD47 and showed the direct role of STEC strain 99G144 CCF using isolated human platelets. Furthermore, we found that the reduction of platelet surface CD47 expression by strain 99G144 CCF could be blocked by anti-TLRs antibodies, implicating that TLRs-mediated signal downstream might play a significant role in regulating the interactions of platelets with the virulent components of STEC strain 99G144. Third, employing in vitro binding assay, we showed that the platelets treated with secreted products from STEC O157:H7 (STEC strain 99G144) were in active condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007131-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and contained less functional ligand-binding CD47 on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007131-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, we demonstrated that activated platelets after STEC O157:H7 CCF treatment could be rapidly removed by macrophages through phagocytosis, and that the phagocytosis of platelets by macrophages could be blocked by soluble CD47 extracellular domain recombinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007131-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These results suggest that the binding interaction between CD47 and its cellular liagnd, signal regulatory protein &#x003b1; (SIRP&#x003b1;), serves as a critical negative regulator for platelet depletion by phagocytes such as macrophages.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Shiga toxins producing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are the main cause of the hemolytic uremic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007131-Wadolkowski1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007131-Karpman2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007131-Sauter1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007131-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, although our data implicated that Shiga toxins might directly interact with platelets and play a role in platelet surface CD47 reduction, the exact components in STEC strain 99G144 CCF that affect platelet CD47 expression remain unclear. Besides Stx2, LPS might also be the candidates in down-regulating platelet cell surface CD47 expression. It also remains unknown why infection by STEC O157:H7 (strain 99G144) selectively reduces platelet surface CD47 expression but not other circulating cells such as monocytes, neutrophils and red blood cells. The possible reason underneath this specific platelet CD47 reduction may be that platelets express unknown receptor(s) for virulent factors such as Stx2 or LPS.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that CD47 is a critical molecule that negatively regulates STEC-induced activation and depletion of platelets. Down-regulation of CD47 level on platelet surfaces by virulent factors of STEC O157:H7 is likely through TLRs-mediated signaling pathway. CD47 down-regulation on platelet surfaces results in a loss of the negative regulatory mechanism initiated by CD47-SIRP&#x003b1; interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007131-Gardai1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which in turn, leads to platelet activation and consequent phagocytosis of platelets by macrophages or other SIRP&#x003b1;-positive immune cells. Since soluble CD47 extracellular domain recombinant can block the enhanced phagocytosis of STEC virulent factors-treated platelets by macrophages, CD47 may be a novel therapeutic targets aiming at attenuating and preventing STEC infection-induced platelet depletion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We greatly appreciate Dr. Ling Gu (Jiangsu CDC, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) for providing EHEC O157:H7
