However, this simple hypothesis cannot explain the tissue specificity of disorders caused by homoplasmic mtDNA mutations. We have previously associated a homoplasmic point mutation (1624C<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>T) in <italic>MTTV</italic> with a profound metabolic disorder that resulted in the neonatal deaths of numerous siblings. Affected tissues harboured a marked biochemical defect in components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, presumably due to the extremely low (<bold>&#x0003c;</bold>1%) steady-state levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. In primary myoblasts and <italic>trans</italic>mitochondrial cybrids established from the proband (index case) and offspring, the marked respiratory deficiency was lost and steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> were greater than in the biopsy material, but were still an order of magnitude lower than in control myoblasts. We present evidence that the generalized decrease in steady-state mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> observed in the homoplasmic 1624C<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>T-cell lines is caused by a rapid degradation of the deacylated form of the abnormal mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. By both establishing the identity of the human mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase then inducing its overexpression in <italic>trans</italic>mitochondrial cell lines, we have been able to partially restore steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, consistent with an increased stability of the charged mt-tRNA. These data indicate that variations in the levels of VARS2L between tissue types and patients could underlie the difference in clinical presentation between individuals homoplasmic for the 1624C<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>T mutation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diseases due to mtDNA mutation are a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality, but our understanding of the factors that influence the presentation and course of these diseases is far from complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In particular, the generally accepted explanation for phenotypic diversity of mtDNA mutations is one of uneven segregation of mutated and wild-type mtDNA to particular tissues, with the resulting phenotype being dependent on this ratio or total amount of wild-type mtDNA in these tissues. This explanation is, however, often inadequate for heteroplasmic mutations and inapplicable to homoplasmic mutations, where the same mtDNA genotype is shared between virtually all molecules in all tissues. Homoplasmic mtDNA mutations had generally been considered as having low pathogenicity, with organ-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). These mutations show incomplete penetrance and are believed to cause disease in association with unknown environmental or other genetic factors. Exceptions to this rule are the homoplasmic mt-tRNA mutations, which have now been identified in several individuals and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>We have previously described a family in whom the homoplasmic 1624C&#x0003e;T <italic>MTTV</italic> (equivalent to mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> C25U; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mamit-trna.u-strasbg.fr">http://mamit-trna.u-strasbg.fr</ext-link><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) mutation underlies a devastating multi-system disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Briefly, the proband in this family (II-1) has histochemical, biochemical and molecular biological evidence of mitochondrial disease but has only mild disease with muscle weakness, fatigue and recurrent migraines. She has one surviving affected child (with Leigh's Disease) from 10 pregnancies by four different unrelated partners. Following her most recent pregnancy, she gave birth to a female infant (III-10) who died in the neonatal period from cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis. This infant had the same pathological findings in muscle as her mother and the extremely low steady-state levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> in cardiac and skeletal muscle confirmed that the 1624C&#x0003e;T mutation was pathogenic. This mutation, although homoplasmic in all maternally related family members, is clearly neither of &#x02018;low pathogenicity&#x02019; nor is it organ specific, but probably is dependent on polygenic factors for its phenotypic expression. One candidate for such a factor is the cognate aminoacyl synthetase. Elegant studies have shown that the phenotypic effects of various pathogenic mt-tRNA mutations in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> can be suppressed by over-expression of the cognate synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Indeed, the respiratory-deficient phenotype caused by three separate mutations in mt-tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> were all suppressed by over-expression of leucyl-tRNA synthetase, with different degrees of severity requiring different levels of expression for respiratory compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Steady-state levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> are decreased in primary cell lines from the patient and proband but do not show the dramatically low levels evident in tissues.

This mutation occurs in the D-stem of the tRNA secondary structure that is predicted to weaken the interaction with G10, a base pairing that has previously been shown to modulate interaction with class I-type synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) High-resolution northern blots were performed on RNA isolated from muscle homogenate (B) or myoblasts (C) of the proband (II-1), offspring (III-10) and two unaffected independent controls C1 and C2 from which myoblast cultures were. Differences in specific activity of the various probes are normalized by calculating ratios of signals for the mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and -tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> species (B, upper panel) or &#x02013;tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> (B, lower panel; C) in each sample and comparing these ratios between samples on the same blot. Ratios of mt-tRNA levels in homogenate and myoblast sample are compared to C2 (B) or C1 (C) that is set to 100% and are reported under each lane. Representative experiments are shown. RNA was isolated from cell lines on at least five separate occasions over a 2-year period. Variance in ratios did not differ by &#x0003e;2%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn147f1"/></fig></p><p>Here, we report the establishment of homoplasmic primary myoblasts and fibroblasts plus a variety of <italic>trans</italic>mitochondrial cybrid cell lines all carrying the 1624C&#x0003e;T transition. Although the steady-state level of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was not depleted to the vanishingly low levels measured in mature skeletal muscle from the patients (&#x0003c;1% of control values), decreases of &#x0223c;90% were detected when normalized to other mt-tRNA species and compared to controls. This variability was unexpected, but may give an important clue to why the mutation can lead to such variability in clinical presentation between patients. Hence, an investigation into the underlying cause of this variability was undertaken. The decrease was found to be due greatly to the reduced stability of the deacylated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> C25U. Over-expression of the cognate valyl synthetase, or inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, processes that would be likely to result in the increased aminoacylation of the mutated tRNA, resulted in partial restoration of the mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> levels. We suggest that relative expression levels of <italic>VARS2L</italic> may underlie the tissue and patient variability of this homoplasmic mt-tRNA disease. Further, as the data show, levels of the aminoacylated form can be artificially modulated, thus a potential method for treating patients with this, or similar, disorders could be considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue culture manipulations</title><p>All cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> under humidified conditions.

We first assessed the aminoacylation (charged) status of the remaining mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. RNA was extracted under acidic (pH &#x0003c; 5) conditions from cultured patient (III-10) myoblasts and fractionated through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. High-resolution northern blots probed for specific mt-tRNAs confirmed the absolute amount of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was decreased; however, it also indicated that the proportion of aminoacylated to deacylated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was increased [92% (III-10) versus 71% (control) Figure S2]. To determine whether this level of charged mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was sufficient in these cell lines to allow for normal mitochondrial protein synthesis, the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine into proteins synthesized in mitochondria was evaluated in patient (III-10) and control myoblasts. Although the 1624C&#x0003e;U mutation disrupts a highly conserved residue and base pairing in the stem of the dihydrouridine (DHU) loop of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> secondary structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mamit-trna.u-strasbg.fr">http://mamit-trna.u-strasbg.fr</ext-link>), there was no marked difference in mitochondrial protein synthesis after either 30 min (data not shown) or 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with the rescue in the patients myoblasts of the profound decrease in complex I activity noted in tissue homogenate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Recovery of complex IV activity also occurred, although to a lesser extent. These data show that at least in cultured myoblasts the normal steady-state level of aminoacylated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> has a weak control strength in mitochondrial protein synthesis. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Decreased levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> C25U could not be shown to affect mitochondrial protein synthesis.

The decrease was not as profound as in tissue homogenate from the patients and the remaining mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was sufficient to facilitate normal mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, this variability in levels could be a vital clue to understanding the variable penetrance of this homoplasmic disorder. An investigation was initiated into the lowered steady-state mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. The mtDNA gene encoding tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, <italic>MTTV</italic> is transcribed as part of a polycistronic unit that includes the tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> gene, <italic>MTTF</italic>, therefore both mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and -tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> are encoded on the same RNA precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and when compared to other mt-tRNAs encoded on a separate polycistronic unit, it is clear that the decrease is specific to mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. Thus, the decrease may be due to the mutation causing a more rapid turnover of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. We therefore compared the stability of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> in control and patient-derived myoblasts following incubation with ethidium bromide, a DNA intercalator that can inhibit transcription of the mitochondrial genome. Patient and control myoblasts were treated with ethidium bromide (250 ng/ml), before harvesting after the indicated time points, RNA was extracted and the steady-state levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> were determined for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Using this concentration of ethidium bromide, the estimated half-life of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was considerably reduced in patients III-10 and II-1 (&#x0223c;3 h and 3.75 h, respectively), when compared with controls (5.75 h). The half-life of mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> did not vary significantly between control and patient II-1 but appears to be longer in patient III-10 (&#x0003e;24 h). Whilst the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> is clearly being more rapidly degraded, the alteration in calculated half-life (52&#x02013;65% of control value) was insufficient to explain the substantially reduced steady-state levels (&#x0003c;10% of control value). At steady state, tRNAs are present in both aminoacylated and deacylated forms. To our knowledge, differences in the rates of tRNA decay have never been reported to be dependent on the charged state of the tRNA. However, it is possible that the mutation may cause an alteration in tertiary structure, leading to an increased susceptibility to decay. This may be reduced both by interaction with the cognate synthetase and by aminoacylation. Consequently, one possibility to explain this discrepancy may be that mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> is unstable until aminoacylated. This is supported by the subtle increase in the aminoacylation level of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> population (Figure S2). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Stability of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> C25U is impaired. To compare the stability of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> in patients (II-1 and III-10) and control, mitochondrial RNA synthesis was inhibited by the addition of ethidium bromide (250 ng/ml) and the remaining RNA was isolated at the indicated time points. High-resolution blots were then performed with probes specific for mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and &#x02013;tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup>. Estimates for <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> were calculated by measuring pixel intensity for each mt-tRNA at each time point. For each set of experiments, 5 &#x003bc;g of low molecular weight RNA was separated and equal loading confirmed by reference to the nuclear encoded 5S RNA (data not shown). For ease of comparison, the specific activity of mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> probe was decreased to allow both signals to be visualized on the same blot and time course. A representative time course is shown for RNA isolated from the three cell lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn147f3"/></fig></p><p>To test this hypothesis, we treated the cells with thiamphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial peptidyl transferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). As translation elongation is inhibited, aminoacylated mt-tRNAs will be unable to donate their amino acids to the growing peptide, resulting in an increase in the amount of aminoacylated tRNA, as has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, by inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis there should be an increased level of all aminoacylated tRNAs and consequently an elevation of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> at steady state. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, inhibition with thiamphenicol (TAP) does indeed promote an increase in mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> steady-state levels, but only in the cell line carrying the mutation. To further interrogate this hypothesis, the cells were subjected to a second mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor, doxycycline (DOX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), a derivative of tetracycline that inhibits protein synthesis by preventing charged tRNA binding to the A site in the mitoribosome. In agreement with this hypothesis, a graded increase in tRNA levels was noted as the concentration of DOX was increased to 10 &#x003bc;M. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis partially restores the levels of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>.

As already described in the Introduction section, over-expression of cognate synthetases has been shown to rescue various mutated mt-tRNAs in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although appealing, this approach was complicated at the outset of these experiments by the absence of any reported mitochondrial valyl synthetase. A simple bioinformatic search revealed a strong candidate protein (KIAA1885/VARS2L) containing the HIGH and KMSKS signature motifs of the class I aminoacyl synthetases. The original UNIPROT/TrEMBL entry (Q96QO2) failed to identify an N-terminal methionine but a facile search revealed a candidate methionine 36 residues within the sequence. Strong mitochondrial import predictions were made from MitoProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot">www.ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot</ext-link>) and TargetP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP</ext-link>), 82.2 and 87.9%, respectively. To confirm mitochondrial localization, a C-terminal GFP fusion construct was produced and transient transfection revealed good co-localization with the mitochondrial-specific marker Mitotracker Red CM-H<sub>2</sub>XRos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). To purify the protein and determine the aminoacylation activity of VARS2L, various fusion constructs were made each with a short, predicted N-terminal pre-sequence deletion. In all cases irrespective of the background strain or conditions of expression, only aggregated VARS2L could be made (data not shown). To resolve these problems with aggregation, more extensive N-terminal truncations of VARS2L fused to GST were designed, ensuring that all predicted functional domains were retained in the protein. All constructs were expressed and soluble VARS2L purified following removal of GST as described in Materials and methods section (Figure S3). As initial template, human mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was generated <italic>in vitro</italic> following the ribozyme method outlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn147/DC1">Supplementary Methods</ext-link> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. Unfortunately, only minimal aminoacylation activity above background activity could be detected using tRNA produced from several independent assays (data not shown). The majority of previous reports detailing the function of mammalian mitochondrial synthetases have used <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>). Using the soluble VARS2L carrying a 102 residue N-terminal deletion, tritiated valine was successfully transferred to <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, albeit with a low aminoacylation activity (1.2 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> pmol aminoacylated tRNA/min/pmol for VARS2L&#x00394;102, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn147/DC1">Supplementary Methods</ext-link>). Similarly, low-level activity was noted for all other N-terminal deletions (data not shown). To confirm the activity was indeed due to VARS2L and not to any remnant of contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic> protein, activity was also noted with enzyme immunoprecipitated from the reaction mix with the anti-VARS2L antibodies prior to initiation of the assay (data not shown). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>VARS2L is a mitochondrial protein. (<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a construct expressing the N-terminal 232 residues of VARS2L fused to GFP. Following transfection (24 h), cells were stained with the mitochondriotropic dye Mitotracker Red CM-H<sub>2</sub>XROS. Transfected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

Consequently, to show unequivocally that over-expression of the synthetase could increase aminoacylation of the mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> and restore steady-state levels, it was necessary to control expression of the synthetase in any cybrid. To date, such an inducible recipient &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cell line is not available. To tackle this problem, the commercially available human cell line with a defined integration site that allows inducible expression (HEK293 Flip-In T-REx) was subjected to long-term culture in low-dose ethidium bromide to deplete cells of endogenous mtDNA. Complete removal of mtDNA was found not to be possible, although copy number was depleted to &#x0003c;1% of untreated controls (data not shown). Cybrids were generated by fusion of these mtDNA-depleted cells with cytoplasts derived from patient fibroblasts and selected as detailed in Materials and methods section. DNA was isolated from the cybrids and following RFLP analysis, three clones (clone 5, 11 and 17) containing &#x0003e;94% levels of 1624C&#x0003e;T were retained. Similar to the cell lines homoplasmic for the mutation, biochemical analysis of clone 17 revealed no profound respiratory defect (data not shown). These three cell lines were transfected with the full-length VARS2L-encoding cDNA and stable, tetracycline inducible cell lines were selected as detailed. To confirm expression, transfectants were expanded, induced and mitochondrial extracts subjected to western analysis with anti-VARS2L specific antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, although the endogenous levels of VARS2L were only just detectable, even in large amounts of mitochondrial protein (100 &#x003bc;g, lane a), good induction was noted for each clone.</p><p>Following confirmation of transfection, clone 17 was expanded. The high level of heteroplasmy for the 1624C&#x0003e;T mutation was retained. Further, the steady-state level of mutated C25U mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was confirmed to be lower than the wild type in HEK293 Flip-In T-REx control cells as measured by high-resolution northern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). To determine whether the over-expression of VARS2L could promote increased mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, cells were initially induced for 3 days prior to harvesting, RNA isolation and analysis by northern blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, &#x0223c;4-fold increase in mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was apparent, increasing levels to almost 50% of the control HEK293 Flip-In T-REx line carrying wild-type mtDNA. The control fusion of HEK293/1624C&#x0003e;T that carried the mutation but were untransfected and so could not express the cognate synthetase, showed no increase in mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> levels under identical induction conditions (Figure S4), consistent with growth of HEK293 Flip-In T-REx cells in 1 &#x003bc;g/ml inducer for up to 2 weeks having no measurable effect on the rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis (data not shown). Further, over-expression of VARS2L in cybrid clones retaining the 1624C genotype resulted in no apparent increase of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> steady-state levels (Figure S5). A more detailed time course also confirmed an increase at 3, 5 and 7 day post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), consistent with the over-expression of the mitochondrial valyl synthetase partially suppressing the depletion of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> associated with the 1624C&#x0003e;T mutation. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Over-expression of human VARS2L can increase the steady-state level of mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>.

We confirm the identity of a human mitochondrial valyl synthetase, VARS2L, that we show is localized to mitochondria and can charge <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA with valine. Finally, we show that the depleted steady-state level of the C25U mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> can be partially recovered by over-expression of the cognate mitochondrial synthetase. At the onset of these studies, there had been no report of any candidate mitochondrial valyl synthetase. However, in 2005, Florentz and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) reported a list of candidates for the remainder of the uncharacterized human mitochondrial synthetases, which they identified by database mining. This included reference to a different form of VARS2L. Amongst the aims of this current research, we wished to demonstrate and confirm mitochondrial localization of our version of VARS2L and to determine whether it was a <italic>bona fide</italic> mitochondrial valyl synthetase, not to complete a full biochemical characterization of this protein. Indeed, our initial studies confirmed co-localization and valyl synthetase activity of this enzyme when using total <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA as substrate, albeit with very low specific activity. We were unable to show any great efficiency of aminoacylation by VARS2L with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed human mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> as substrate. However, it has been well documented that mammalian mitochondrial synthetases are less efficient than their cytosolic or prokaryotic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Further, full optimization of conditions had not been performed for this enzyme. Lower activity with mammalian <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mt-tRNA is also not unusual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>). There are clearly cases where post-transcriptional modifications are essential for robust aminoacylation and in the absence of correct modifications tRNAs have been shown occasionally to mis-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Although not unexpected, the poor aminoacylation of the synthetic mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> meant it was not possible to compare the aminoacylation efficiencies of the wild-type and mutated tRNA<sup>Val</sup> substrates.</p><p>We conclude that it is the rapid decay rate of the deacylated form of C25U mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, which is responsible for its low steady-state level in all the primary and <italic>trans</italic>mitochondrial cybrid cell lines that we have generated and studied. This conclusion is based on the following criteria: (i) shorter half-life of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> was observed following inhibition of mitochondrial transcription, (ii) inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, a condition likely to increase aminoacylation states of all mt-tRNAs, led to increased steady-state levels of C25U mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, (iii) the G10-C25 pairing in the D-stem of tRNAs has been implicated in contacting the cognate class I synthetases, suggesting mutations in this pairing may result in decreased association/protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and (iv) over-expression of VARS2L promoted an increase in C25U mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> levels. Partial restoration of mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> levels by over-expression of VARS2L was impressive but as no cell line containing the 1624C&#x0003e;T substitution showed a profound defect in biochemical activity of any mitochondrial respiratory enzyme, we have limited this study to understanding the mechanisms underlying the decreased stability of the mutated mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>. However, with reference to this difficulty in recapitulating respiratory defects due to the 1624C&#x0003e;T mutation, it is interesting to note that we are currently characterizing several independent 143B-based homoplasmic 1624C&#x0003e;T <italic>trans</italic>mitochondrial cybrid clones that are unable to grow on galactose, consistent with these clones being compromised for OXPHOS. This defect is due to the aneuploid nature of the cybrids and amongst several possibilities, may be caused by differing steady-state levels of the mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup>.</p><p>We have previously reported that this unique homoplasmic mutation in <italic>MTTV</italic> underlies a multi-system disease affecting three generations of a family. Despite its homoplasmic nature, this mutation has an extremely diverse clinical phenotype with at least one individual remaining only mildly affected. This diversity is not reflected in the biochemical deficiency in muscle as in the profound (III-10) and mildly affected (II-10) individuals, both showed severe defects in respiratory complex activities. However, there may be variability in mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> levels in neuronal or cardiac tissue, which may cause differences in mitochondrial protein synthesis and consequently respiratory complex defects.</p><p>In summary, on the basis of the data provided in this article, we propose the following hypothesis for the variable effects of the 1624C&#x0003e;T <italic>MTTV</italic> mutation. Steady-state levels are a result of the rate of tRNA production (synthesis, processing, maturation) minus the rate of decay. This mutation causes an increased decay rate of the deacylated form, which is offset in part by aminoacylation. We predict that the dramatic differences in steady-state levels is due to natural variabilities in the rates of synthesis and decay of the deacylated mutant form in a given cell type and the relative amounts of valyl synthetase available to promote increased aminoacylation and therefore increased stability. This hypothesis predicts that although these rates will vary between tissues, over-expression of VARS2L within a tissue will always increase the level of charged mt-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> steady-state levels, potentially restoring mitochondrial protein synthesis.
