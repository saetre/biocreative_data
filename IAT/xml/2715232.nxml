Sequence similarity among these highly repetitive RG domains, combined with interactions between RG-rich proteins, raises the question of whether these regions are general interaction motifs or whether there is specificity within these domains. Using the essential <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mRNA-binding protein Npl3 (ScNpl3) as a model system, we first tested the importance of the RG domain for protein function. While Npl3 lacking the RG domain could not support growth of cells lacking Npl3, surprisingly, expression of the RG domain alone supported partial growth of these cells. To address the specificity of this domain, we created chimeric forms of ScNpl3 with RG-rich domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nucleolar proteins, Gar1 and Nop1 (ScGar1, ScNop1), or of the <italic>Candida albicans</italic> Npl3 ortholog (CaNpl3). Whereas the CaNpl3 RG chimeric protein retained nearly wild-type function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the ScGar1 and ScNop1 RG domains significantly reduced Npl3 function and self-association, indicating RG domain specificity. Nuclear localization of Npl3 also requires specific RG sequences, yet heterologous RG domains allow similar modulation of Npl3 transport by arginine methylation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic gene expression requires the coordination of a complex array of messenger RNA-binding proteins, which chaperone and modify mRNAs from the time they are transcribed in the nucleus until they are translated and eventually degraded in the cytoplasm. While individual RNA-binding proteins perform specific tasks within the cell, many RNA-binding proteins share similar sequence modules, including RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), hnRNP K-homology (KH) domains, zinc fingers and arginine&#x02013;glycine (RG)-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Such RNA-binding domains (RBDs) are not limited to mRNA-binding proteins, but are also shared by proteins involved in ribosome assembly. In addition, multiple RBDs have been implicated in protein-protein as well as protein&#x02013;RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>Most RNA-binding domains are defined by specific amino-acid sequences and structures that interact with the phosphodiester backbone and specific nucleobases of RNA ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In contrast, arginine&#x02013;glycine-rich regions [which are also referred to as <underline>g</underline>lycine&#x02013;<underline>a</underline>rginine-<underline>r</underline>ich (GAR) motifs and RG or RGG domains] are characterized by the presence of multiple RG and RGG peptides, but vary widely in overall domain length and spacing between these short motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). No 3D structure has been determined for any RG-rich domain, potentially due to the high glycine content of these regions. The RG-rich domain of Fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP binds to specific G-quartet-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), but many RG domains may confer non-specific RNA-binding activity to proteins with additional RBD modules, or mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). RG-rich proteins are also frequent targets for arginine methylation; this modification can impact protein function through altering molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The ubiquity of RG-rich domains, combined with the lack of a clear consensus sequence even among some likely orthologous proteins, raises the question of whether these regions are general interaction motifs or whether there is any specificity inherent to these domains.</p><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mRNA-binding protein Npl3 serves as an excellent model to address this question. This protein has been implicated in multiple aspects of gene expression including transcription elongation and termination, 3&#x02032; end formation, splicing, mRNA export and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">10&#x02013;15</xref>). Whereas mutations in the two RRMs of Npl3 affect mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing and nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), mutations in the extensive RG domain and methylation of this domain influence Npl3 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The effects of the RG domain on transport correlate with protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Arginine methylation or arginine-to-lysine mutations in the RG domain decrease nuclear export of Npl3, Npl3 self-association and the interaction of Npl3 with Tho2, a protein involved in transcription elongation and mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). A two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the RG-rich region of Npl3 revealed five RG-rich proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>); this result suggests that RG-rich domains might act as general interaction motifs among RNA-binding proteins. To test this hypothesis, we have replaced the long RG-rich domain of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mRNA-binding protein Npl3 with extensive RG domains from three other yeast proteins and have tested these chimeric proteins for function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Initially we demonstrate that the RG-rich domain of Npl3 is not only necessary for <italic>in vivo</italic> function, but that this domain alone can partially replace Npl3 function. Whereas replacement of the Npl3 RG-rich domain with that of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Npl3 ortholog maintains Npl3 function, the extensive RG-rich domains of two nucleolar proteins, Gar1 and Nop1, only partially support Npl3 function. This result correlates with the ability of the chimeric Npl3 proteins to bind to endogenous Npl3. This RG-domain specificity is not due to differences in domain length, since <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Npl3 with a deletion in its RG-rich domain allows better growth of <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> cells than a chimeric Npl3 protein bearing the slightly longer Nop1 RG domain. Gar1 and Nop1 RG domains increase the cytoplasmic steady-state localization of GFP-Npl3, suggesting the importance of specific sequences within the Npl3 RG-rich domain for transport. Whereas deletion of Hmt1 slows nuclear export of Npl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), it does not affect nucleolar localization of Gar1 and Nop1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We demonstrate that all chimeric GFP-Npl3 proteins are substrates for Hmt1 and that Hmt1 deletion results in increased nuclear localization of chimeric GFP-Npl3 bearing Gar1 and Nop1 RG domains. Therefore, although these heterologous RG domains do not confer full function on Npl3, arginine methylation can modulate transport of Npl3 proteins bearing alternative RG domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

This result indicates that arginine methylation may decrease these putative RG&#x02013;RG interactions, similar to its disruption of Npl3 self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These results raise the question of whether RG-rich domains can serve a general purpose in directing binding to other RG-rich proteins.</p><p>To test this possibility, the first three domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Npl3 were fused to three extensive RG-rich regions from other yeast proteins: two nucleolar <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins (ScGar1 and ScNop1) and the <italic>Candida albicans</italic> Npl3 ortholog [CaNpl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)]. Given that phosphorylation of a serine within a conserved heptapeptide at the C-terminus influences Npl3 nuclear transport and autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>) and also affects transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), this region was included in all chimeric proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These chimeric proteins partially support growth of an <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The major arginine methyltransferase Hmt1, which methylates Npl3, is not essential in otherwise wild-type cells, yet this gene becomes essential in a strain lacking the 80 kDa mRNA cap-binding protein, Cbp80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), potentially due to the increased importance of Npl3 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In this sensitized strain background (<italic>npl3&#x00394;cbp80&#x00394;</italic>), the chimeric proteins bearing the Gar1 and Nop1 RG domains are not functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

These results support the idea that specific sequences within the RG domain are important for Npl3 function. When the chimeric proteins were tested for binding to wild-type Npl3-myc, the chimeric protein containing the CaNpl3 RG domain co-precipitated ScNpl3-myc whereas those Npl3 proteins with Gar1 and Nop1 RG domains showed severely reduced binding to Npl3-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).

In contrast, both deletion mutant proteins show reduced interaction with wild-type Npl3-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In combination, the growth and interaction results indicate that the N-terminal sequences in the RG domain are more important than the length of the domain for overall Npl3 function, whereas both the N and C-terminal portions of the RG domain play a role in stabilizing binding to a full-length Npl3 RG domain in the absence of methylation. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Differential effects of deletions within the RG-rich domain of Npl3.

In addition, methylation of Gar1 and Nop1 RG domains within chimeric proteins may facilitate their export from the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The goal of this work was to determine whether RG-rich regions act as general interaction motifs or whether specific sequences within the RG domain of RNA-binding proteins influence their function. Our results clearly indicate that RG domains contribute specifically to protein function. <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Npl3 can support growth of an <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strain with its own RG domain or with the RG domain of the <italic>Candida</italic> Npl3 ortholog, whereas the RG domains of nucleolar proteins Nop1 and Gar1 only support partial Npl3 function. This assay reflects a complex combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of Npl3, as this protein has been implicated in almost all aspects of gene expression from transcription elongation and termination, to 3&#x02032; end processing, splicing, mRNA export and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">10&#x02013;15</xref>). To explore how RG domain specificity affects Npl3 function, we therefore tested the effect of heterologous RG domains on two specific characteristics of Npl3 that are linked to its RG domain, self-association and intracellular localization.</p><p>The presence of the CaNpl3 RG domain conferred PrA-Npl3 binding to wild-type ScNpl3-myc, but this interaction was significantly decreased by the substitution of RG domains from nucleolar proteins. Similarly, the CaNpl3 RG domain directed nuclear localization of GFP-ScNpl3 whereas the presence of nucleolar RG domains in GFP-ScNpl3 led to mislocalization within the cytoplasm. In contrast, the nucleolar RG domains did confer one key role of the Npl3 RG domain: the modulation of Npl3 localization through methylation. Nuclear export of GFP-ScNpl3 is decreased in the absence of the major arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), whereas nucleolar localization of Gar1 and Nop1 is not influenced by methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Although chimeras with RG domains from Gar1 and Nop1 are distributed throughout the cell at steady state, in the absence of methylation they become increasingly nuclear. This effect may be direct, through methylation of the heterologous RG domain, or indirect, through methylation of another protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). These results indicate that, while RG domains do not act as interchangeable general interaction motifs, some functions of RG domains can be transferred between proteins.</p><sec><title>Partial function of an RG domain in isolation</title><p>Before testing ScNpl3 proteins with heterologous RG domains in our assays, we wished to confirm that the RG domain was required for Npl3 self-association, as suggested by earlier mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We have demonstrated not only that the RG domain is required for Npl3 self-association and growth of <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> cells, but that expression of the RG domain alone can support partial growth of <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Given the effects of point mutations within the RRMs on multiple steps in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>), it is unlikely that the ability of PrA-RG to support growth is due to facilitating any of these processes through direct binding to mRNA. Alternatively, the C-terminal RG-rich domain alone may help direct essential protein&#x02013;protein interactions: RG domains play roles in many protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and physical interactions have been detected between Npl3 and over 70 other proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which likely reflect both direct interactions and association as members of macromolecular complexes (<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">http://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of sequence versus length among RG domains</title><p>Many RG-rich proteins contain similar subsets of other amino acids within their RG domains including phenylalanine, tyrosine, proline, serine and alanine and aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In spite of these similarities, both the arrangement of these amino acids within RG domains and the length of the domains vary among proteins. In testing whether the Npl3 RG domain contains specific sequences that are crucial for function, we therefore considered the length and sequences of heterologous RG domains used to make chimeric Npl3 proteins. Only three <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins contain single RG domains longer than 50 amino acids (aa): Npl3 (109 aa), Gar1 (59 aa) and Nop1 (76 aa). Npl3 and these nucleolar proteins share similar spacing between arginines in these domains (Npl3 = 5.2 &#x000b1; 2.6 aa, Gar1 = 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.3 aa, Nop1 = 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.3 aa) and all three of these RG domains contain eight or more serine residues, many within SR dipeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The RG domain of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Npl3 ortholog, while sharing similar RG spacing (3.0 &#x000b1; 1.8 aa), only contains one serine residue, but has nine aspartate&#x02013;arginine dipeptides. In contrast, the RG domains of both Npl3 proteins are significantly longer than those of the nucleolar proteins and contain many more aromatic (F/Y) residues.</p><p>The greater ability of the CaNpl3 RG domain than those of Gar1 and Nop1 to confer Npl3 function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggests a key role for aromatic residues in Npl3 function <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as in Npl3 self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In previous work we showed that accumulation of arginine-to-lysine substitutions within the RG domain decreased Npl3 function. Similarly, it is likely that multiple aromatic residues can support Npl3 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), since simultaneous substitution of alanine for aromatic residues at four of nineteen positions (293, 301, 310, 340) did not affect growth of strains that require Npl3 or binding to Npl3-myc (unpublished data). In addition, our results indicate that, if serines within the RG domain play a role in Npl3 function, non-phosphorylatable acidic residues such as the asparates in CaNpl3 can also support Npl3 function.</p><p>Since the Gar1 and Nop1 RG domain chimeric Npl3 proteins also differed from ScNpl3 and CaNpl3 in length, we tested whether this difference could explain our results. A C-terminal deletion within the ScNpl3 RG domain, decreasing its length to shorter than the Nop1 chimeric protein, had minimal effects on overall Npl3 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), indicating the greater importance of sequence than overall length. The reduced growth of <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> cells expressing ScNpl3 with a deletion within the N-terminus of the RG domain, which results in a longer protein than the C-terminal deletion, points to the importance of residues in this part of the RG domain. Similarly, we have shown previously that N-terminal arginine-to-lysine (RK) substitutions decrease Npl3 function more than substitutions in the C-terminus of the RG domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, Lukasiewicz and colleagues demonstrated that an N-terminal deletion, but not a C-terminal deletion, within the RG domain altered the kinetics of Npl3 phosphorylation by Sky1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), a post&#x02013;translational modification that has been implicated in transcription, autoregulation and Npl3 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>). In contrast to the different effects on overall Npl3 function, both deletion mutants show reduced binding to full-length Npl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). This result suggests that full self-association is not required for the essential functions of Npl3.</p><p>Therefore, although deletions within the RG domain may decrease Npl3 function by altering overall protein structure, these studies, combined with the RK-mutagenesis results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), suggest that N-terminal and C-terminal sequences within the long Npl3 RG domain differentially affect overall protein function, while both regions help mediate Npl3 self-association. Interestingly, seven of the ten arginines that we previously identified as being exclusively dimethylated in Npl3 are within the N-terminal region that was deleted, which suggests that methylation of this region may positively influence Npl3 function.</p></sec><sec><title>RG-rich proteins and eukaryotic RNA metabolism</title><p>RG-rich RNA-binding proteins participate in complex processes that require the coordination of many proteins and RNAs. Just as Npl3 interacts with a plethora of proteins as it aids in mRNA transcription, processing and transport in yeast, RG-rich heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle proteins hnRNPA1 and hnRNPK play roles in mammalian mRNA processing and transport. Ribosome assembly also relies on a complex series of events involving multiple proteins, including nucleolin and fibrillarin in mammals and Nop1 and Gar1 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Given the flexibility of extensive RG domains, as suggested by the abundance of glycine residues, the structure of these domains is likely influenced by their dynamic interactions with other proteins and RNAs. RG domains may promote remodeling of complexes as their interactions with different binding partners change over time and subtle differences in the sequences within long RG-rich domains may help modulate these transitions.</p><p>Thus, in contrast to the repetitive nature and similar amino-acid contents of RG-rich domains, our work highlights the importance of specific sequences within the RG-rich domain for function of the major mRNA-binding protein, Npl3. In particular, N-terminal sequences and the presence of multiple aromatic residues within this domain are likely to influence protein function. Interestingly, while many arginines within the RG domain are fully dimethylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, several arginines are variably methylated, including two arginines at the N-terminus of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In combination, these results suggest that differential methylation of specific sequences within RG domains may modulate function of RNA-binding proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Science Foundation [grant MCB-0235590 to AEM]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute summer research fellowship (to AKC and CA); <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [Grant Number <award-id>P20 RR-016463</award-id> from the INBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources].
