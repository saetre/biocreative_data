Evolution has furnished the mammalian cell with several mechanisms for responding to the induction of this critical DNA lesion. A central and essential component of the DNA damage response is nibrin, the product of the <italic>NBN</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Carney1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Varon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Nibrin forms a trimeric complex with Mre11 and Rad50 (MRN complex), which is conserved between yeast and mammals. This complex localizes to the sites of DSBs where the DNA binding function of RAD50 and the nucleolytic activity of MRE11 contribute to DNA repair, by both homologous recombination and non homologous end-joining. In addition, the MRN complex at the sites of DSBs promotes the activation of the ATM kinase which is mutated in the genetic disease Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Lee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Uziel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Downstream targets of ATM are then responsible for cell cycle arrest at the major checkpoints. Since nibrin is required for the relocalisation of the MRN complex to DSBs it occupies a critical position in the DNA damage response cascade.</p><p>Not surprisingly, therefore, <italic>NBN</italic> is an essential gene, however, individuals with hypomorphic mutations in the <italic>NBN</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Maser1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> suffer from the autosomal recessive genetic disorder, Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS, MIM 251260). Since null mutation of the <italic>Nbn</italic> gene is lethal in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-DumonJones1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Zhu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, we have previously used Cre recombinase/loxP technology to generate mice with conditional null mutation in the <italic>Nbn</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Demuth1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Kracker1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Induction of <italic>Nbn</italic> null mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> in this conditional mouse model results in chromosome damage, radiomimetic-sensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects and impaired immunoglobulin class switching. Homozygous null mutant cells survive only briefly in culture and in proliferating tissues, such as bone marrow, and are rapidly replaced by heterozygous null mutant cells. However, in liver tissue, null mutant cells survived well and even after two weeks still 95&#x00025; of this organ consisted of null mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Demuth1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The liver thus provides an excellent <italic>in vivo</italic> model to investigate the consequences of a complete lack of nibrin during a DNA damage response. Here we have used a proteomics approach to identify proteins which are differentially expressed in response to IR in liver tissue homozygous for the <italic>Nbn</italic> null mutation. This analysis revealed an altered expression pattern of various proteins involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and strongly suggests a link between DSB repair and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the DNA damage response. These findings indicate an unexpected role for ROS-detoxification in the pathophysiology of NBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> induction of <italic>Nbn</italic> mutations by Cre recombinase</title><p>All the mice used in this study had one <italic>Nbn</italic> allele in which exon 6 was flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites, <italic>Nbn</italic><sup>lox-6</sup>.

In addition to DSB-based gene mutations, which other factors contribute to reduced survival in irradiated NBS cells? The data presented here suggest that a key consequence of unrepaired DSBs in NBS cells may be disturbances in cell redox homeostasis.</p><p>Free radicals are, on the one hand, mutagenic and, on the other, result in general cell damage, apoptosis and necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Barzilai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Vanlangenakker1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The upregulation of genes involved in detoxification of ROS is the natural consequence. The cell has three main defence mechanisms for dealing with ROS. Firstly, these radicals can be inactivated by direct interaction with low molecular weight antioxidants or scavengers such as vitamin E, NADH and glutathione. A second line of defence employs antioxidant enzymes such as the superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferases to detoxify ROS. Finally, damaged macromolecules can be directly repaired by enzymes such as disulfide reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductase. It is just such proteins which were found here to be increased in the livers of irradiated null mutant mice. It is perhaps noteworthy, that of the two proteins differing between unirradiated heterozygous and homozygous null-mutant mice one was gutathione-synthetase. Finally, the alterations in the chaperone and heat shock protein group as detected here also indicate elevated cellular ROS levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005423-Janssen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The persistent upregulation of ROS related proteins in the livers of irradiated null mutant mice suggests that ROS generation continues after the initial DNA damaging event.
