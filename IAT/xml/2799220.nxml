The exocrine and endocrine pancreas are involved in the regulation of food metabolism and energy balance. This function is deranged in diabetes mellitus. This study examined the pattern of distribution of orexin-1 receptor (OX<sub>1</sub>R) in the endocrine cells of the pancreas of normal and diabetic Wistar (a model of type 1 diabetes), Goto-Kakizaki (GK, a model of type 2 diabetes) rats and in orexin-deficient (OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and wild type mice. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in Wistar rats and mice by streptozotocin (STZ). At different time points (12 h, 24 h, 4 weeks, 8 months and 15 months) after the induction of DM, pancreatic fragments of normal and diabetic rats were processed for immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. OX<sub>1</sub>R-immunoreactive nerves were observed in the pancreas of normal and diabetic Wistar rats. OX<sub>1</sub>R was also discernible in the pancreatic islets of normal and diabetic Wistar and GK rats, and wild type mice. OX<sub>1</sub>R co-localized with insulin (INS) and glucagon (GLU) in the pancreas of Wistar and GK rats. The number of OX<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells in the islets increased markedly (p&#x0003c;0.0001) after the onset of DM. The increase in the number of OX<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells is associated with a high degree of co-localization with GLU. The number of GLU- positive cells expressing OX<sub>1</sub>R was significantly (p&#x0003c;0.0001) higher after the onset of DM. The tissue level of OX<sub>1</sub>R protein increased with the duration of DM especially in type 1 diabetes where it co-localized with cleaved caspase 3 in islet cells. In comparison to STZ-treated wild type mice, STZ-treated OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals exhibited reduced hyperglycemia and handled glucose more efficiently in glucose tolerance test. The findings suggest an important role for the OX-OX<sub>1</sub>R pathway in STZ-induced experimental diabetes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies have shown that orexins A and B play a critical role in the regulation of sleep/wake states, feeding behaviour, and reward processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Matsuki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Sinton1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Orexins are related to hypocretins and were first described by Sakurai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Sakurai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Orexins have been demonstrated in the lateral hypothalamic region, an area of the brain closely associated with the regulation of behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Bernardis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A strong indication of the role of orexin-positive neurons in feeding is that genetic ablation of orexigenic neurons results in narcolepsy, hyperphagia and obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Hara1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Orexin-1 receptor (OX<sub>1</sub>R) was the first of the two orexin receptors to be discovered and binds orexin-A with a much higher affinity compared to orexin B. The human OX<sub>1</sub>R protein consists of 425 amino acids and seven putative transmembrane helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Voisin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. OX<sub>2</sub>R consists of 444 amino acids and has equal affinities for both orexin A and B ligands. OX<sub>2</sub>R shares about 64&#x00025; amino acid identity with OX<sub>1</sub>R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Matsuki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, OX<sub>1</sub>R is more selective for orexin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Kukkonen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Kirschgessner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and usually coupled to the Gq subclass of G proteins while OX<sub>2</sub>R can couple to either Gq and/or Gi/o subset of G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Matsuki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding of OX<sub>1</sub>R and OX<sub>2</sub>R to either orexin A or B causes intracellular influx of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> resulting in increased concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Kukkonen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>OX<sub>1</sub>R and OX<sub>2</sub>R are present in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), which is rich in orexin-positive nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Marcus1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the hypothalamic region, OX<sub>1</sub>R mRNA is located mainly in the dorsomedial area of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and the anterior hypothalamic territory, whereas, OX<sub>2</sub>R mRNA is observed in several hypothalamic nuclei including the arcuate nucleus, posteroventricular nucleus, LHA, and tuberomammilary bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Marcus1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The localization of orexin receptors to these hypothalamic nuclei supports the purported function of orexins on the regulation of feeding, since food intake and appetite are regulated by these cortical regions (VMH, LHA, arcuate nucleus). The role of VMH in the regulation of food intake is very strong because the selective ablation of VMH results in obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Kirschgessner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Bray1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, expression of OX<sub>1</sub>R mRNA has been demonstrated in many other parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Marcus1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The localization of OX<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in these cortical regions, which has large quantities of adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters suggests that orexins may also play an important role in the regulation of serotonergic as well as adrenergic systems. OX<sub>2</sub>R is also expressed in the amygdala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Marcus1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> a brain region that is strongly associated with memory and emotion.

The reason(s) for the increase in the number of OX<sub>1</sub>R-immunoreactive cells in the islet of diabetic rats is not clear. A possible reason could be the low intracellular glucose level observed in type 1 DM. The loss of insulin in diabetic rats means less glucose will be transported into most cells, thus up-regulation OX<sub>1</sub>R expression.

The fact that OX<sub>1</sub>R expression was observed in both neurons and pancreatic endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans is not surprising because there is similarity in the origin of neurons and islet cells.

All of these support a functional role of OX<sub>1</sub>R and the orexinergic system in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism.</p><p>This is the first report on the co-localisation of INS and GLU and OX<sub>1</sub>R. The number of GLU-positive cells expressing OX<sub>1</sub>R increased significantly after the onset of type 1 diabetes. Although, OX<sub>1</sub>R is present in the pancreatic islets of GK rats, a model of type 2 diabetes, the degree of co-localization with GLU was minimal compared to that STZ-induced diabetic rat (a model of type 1 diabetes). This may be due to the fact that the hyperglycaemia is much milder in GK compared to STZ-treated Wistar rats. The co-localization of OX<sub>1</sub>R with INS and GLU suggests a pivotal role for INS and GLU in the biological actions of orexins. Moreover, orexins evoked the release of INS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Nowak1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and GLU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Ouedraogo1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> from normal pancreatic islets. This orexin-induced INS release may be due to GLU action. GLU as we know, stimulates INS secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Lambert1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>OX<sub>1</sub>R was also upregulated in PP-positive islets cells after the onset of diabetes (result not shown). The reason for the increase in the expression of OX<sub>1</sub>R in pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-immunoreactive cells is unknown. Since OX<sub>1</sub>R is present in PP-positive cells, orexin may stimulate the release of PP, which may in turn enhance appetite. It has been shown that centrally administered PP elicits food intake via NPY receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Katsuura1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

All of these, in combination with circulating and neural-derived orexins stimulate GLU and PP release. GLU induces gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis resulting in energy utilization, wakefulness and arousal. Moreover, GLU and PP from the circulation and via paracrine effect may stimulate insulin (INS) release resulting in increased intracellular glucose, and energy utilization.

The reason for this observation is not clear, however, it may be due to the irreparable damage done to pancreatic tissue due to persistent hyperglycaemia and other inductors of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a major cause of late complications of DM and may be more pronounced in the pancreas of rats with long and established DM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008587-Adeghate5">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of active caspase 3 was discernible in the cells of the peripheral regions of the islets of OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 mice and normal Wistar rats. The number of caspase 3-positive islet cells was significantly fewer in OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. It is worth noting that OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have significantly fewer OX<sub>1</sub>R compared to wild type. It does appear that the number of OX<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells is directly proportional to that of caspase 3. The use of OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice shows that the fewer the number of OX1R-immunoreactive cells, the lower the number of caspase 3-positive cells becomes.</p><p>In contrast, the number of OX<sub>1</sub>R- and caspase 3-postive cells increased significantly after the onset of STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats. A significant number of pancreatic islet cells of this animal model contain both OX<sub>1</sub>R- and caspase 3.

The tissue level of PARP decreased after the induction of experimental diabetes in orexin-deficient mice. It is not clear why PARP was well expressed in the pancreas of normal wild type and knockout mice at least when they were not subjected to any toxins that could possibly induce oxidative stress and therefore apoptosis.</p><p>The pancreas of orexin knockout mice contained a small quantity of OX<sub>1</sub>R compared to the pancreas of the wild type. However, the tissue level OX<sub>1</sub>R increased after the onset of diabetes in the mutant, but not in control mice. The reason for the increase in not known, but it may be due to the modulation of the orexinergic system by STZ, especially in the absence of orexin in the mutant mice. The increased expression of OX<sub>1</sub>R after the onset of diabetes in the mutant mice was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of PARP when compared to control, non-diabetic mutant mice and control as well as diabetic wild type. The reason for this inverse relationship is unclear but it may be due to the absence of orexin, a major trigger of apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Glucose handling in control OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 and STZ-treated OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 mice</title><p>We showed for the first time that STZ-induced diabetic orexin knockout mice shows a more efficient glucose handling compared to control OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 and STZ-treated C57BL/6 mice.

It is possible that STZ induces pancreatic beta cell apoptosis via the orexin pathway. So if orexin is missing, as in the mutant mice, then less apoptosis will occur and more beta cell will survive after the administration of STZ. The mutant mice injected with STZ will therefore handle glucose more effectively as observed in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The number of cells expressing OX<sub>1</sub>R is increased in pancreatic islets after the onset of diabetes. The longer the duration of diabetes the more intense the OX<sub>1</sub>R expression becomes. OX<sub>1</sub>R-positive islet cells co-localizes with INS and GLU in Wistar rats and with cleaved caspase 3 after the onset of diabetes in Wistar rats treated with STZ. The expression of OX<sub>1</sub>R and caspase 3 is significantly lower in the pancreas of orexin knockout mice compared to wild type and Wistar rats.</p><p>Orexin knockout mice treated with STZ have the ability to handle glucose load more effectively that control OX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL/6 and STZ-treated C57BL/6 mice. STZ requires the orexinergic system to cause severe apoptosis that can consequently lead to an overt diabetes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Tom Scammell,
