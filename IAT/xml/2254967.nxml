The rapid turnover of ocular surface epithelium and microbial colonization of the eyelids are continual sources of DNA in tears. Here, we determine the principal sources of endonuclease activity in tears.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Endonucleases in human tears were identified after Sephadex G100 gel filtration. DNA hydrolyzing activity was measured by the conversion pUC19 plasmid DNA to its circular form in agarose gels. Fractions with endonuclease activity were further isolated using a combination ConA-Sepharose DNA, oligo (dT) cellulose, and anion exchange chromatographies. The molecular weights of the DNA hydrolyzing proteins were estimated in zymograms and by calibration of size exclusion chromatography. DNase activities were characterized for activity at a variety of pH and ion concentrations as well as in the presence of inhibitors including NiCl<sub>2</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, G-actin, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). To determine the mode of hydrolysis, the cleaved ends of the DNA digested by tear DNases were analyzed by 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; end labeling using either terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or polynucleotide kinase with or without pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Tear lipocalin (TL) accounts for over 75% of the DNA catalytic activity in tears while a second endonuclease, ~34 kDa, is responsible for less than 24% of the activity. Both are Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent enzyme endonucleases that are enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, active at physiologic pH, inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid, and catalyze hydrolysis of DNA to produce 3&#x02032;-OH/5&#x02032;P ends. However, the two enzymes can be distinguished by the inhibitory effect of NiCl<sub>2</sub> and the sizes of the cleaved DNA fragments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two magnesium dependent extracellular endonucleases were identified in tears that are different from other major human extracellular nucleases.

The human tear film acts in concert with the corneal and conjunctival epithelium to protect the ocular surface. The corneal epithelium forms a barrier that is five-cell layers thick and turns over every 7&#x02013;14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. The tear film is responsible for the clearance of DNA from both human and microbial sources. An assortment of viral nucleotide sequences have been identified in tears of patients infected with viruses including Herpes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], CMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], Varicella Zoster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], Hepatitis B virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], Hepatitis C virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], and adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Adenoviral sequences have been detected by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) in tears as long as 13 years after presumed initial infection, and the evidence suggests that the virus persists as a chronic follicular conjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Some viruses such as HIV may be easily cultured from the blood but can not be cultured from tears, even in infected patients. Extracellular endonucleases have a potentially important role in tears for the destruction of DNA in apoptosis and the prevention of transfection of viruses to other cells.</p><p>Lipocalins, including tear lipocalin (TL), are known to have endonuclease activity in vitro, but whole tears have not been studied. The enzymatic activity of lipocalins is conferred by a conserved LEDFXR domain of the <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Catalysis of DNA by TL is probably related to the magnesium water cluster formed by the hydrogen bond created between Glu-127 in a conserved &#x003b1;-helical segment and water. The nonspecific endonuclease activity of lipocalin is also divalent cation dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The specific activity of TL is three orders of magnitude less than DNase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. This paucity of specific activity prompted us to consider the possibility of other endonucleases in tears and determine the contribution of TL to overall enzyme activity. Further, the mode of DNA cleavage by TL is unknown but may be functionally important. DNA hydrolysis may result in either 3&#x02032;-OH/5&#x02032;-P or 3&#x02032;-P/5&#x02032;-OH ends. Here, we preliminarily characterize the influence of ions on the principal nucleases and establish the mode of DNA hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tear collection</title><p>Tear secretion was stimulated with onion vapors, and tears were collected from the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac from healthy human donors as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Quantitation of DNA in human tears.

The effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is enhanced in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for both nucleases.

Neither of the two endonucleases in tears is activated solely by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, excluding a significant contribution from the major human extracellular endonucleases, DNase I and DNase X. Both of these are activated by either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone. DNase I is found in many body fluids and plays a role in eliminating extracellular DNA in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. DNase I deficient mice result in the appearance of an autoimmune disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. DNase X is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchored membrane protein located on the cell surface and may prevent endocytosis-mediated transfer of foreign DNA in human muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. The minor tear endonuclease is active with Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone. This is different from two human intracellular DNase &#x003b3; and DNAS1L2, which require both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. DNase &#x003b3; is found in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. DNase &#x003b3; is perinuclear and translocates to the nucleus during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Similar to the DNase I family of DNases, TL and the minor endonuclease are synergistically activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5A,B</xref>).</p><p>Both TL and the minor endonuclease are inhibited by low concentrations of aurintricarboxylic acid, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup>, dissimilar to DNase &#x003b3;. Like DNAS1L2, Ni<sup>2+</sup> minimally affected the activity of the minor endonuclease or TL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. The characteristics of the tear endonucleases appear unique compared to other known human endonucleases. A bacterial source of the minor endonuclease cannot be excluded since tears are in contact with eyelids that are colonized by a wide assortment of bacteria.</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Labeling of the fragments DNA digested by tear lipocalin and the minor tear endonuclease. Kinetics of nicking plasmid DNA by nucleases, TL and minor endonuclease, were obtained as described under Methods.

Both showed some activity at acidic pH. The minor endonuclease appeared to retain slightly more activity than TL outside the physiologic pH range of tears (~7.2&#x02013;7.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Beyond this range, the activity falls precipitously, especially at acidic pH. This behavior is similar to other human endonucleases with one exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. DNAS1L2 has been observed to have maximal activity at pH 5.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], excluding it as a candidate for the minor endonuclease.

The lack of activity with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> as well as the lack of inhibitory effect by G actin for both TL and the minor endonuclease contrast with what occurs for DNase I and DNase X.</p><fig id="f9" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Cleavage of a radioactively labeled single- and double-stranded DNA by tear lipocalin and EndoA. <bold>A</bold>: A 32-mer oligonucleotide was digested by TL (lanes 1&#x02013;3), the minor tear endonuclease (lanes 5&#x02013;7), or DNase I (lanes 6&#x02013;9) at 5, 10, and 20 min, respectively.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>, the 3` ends of the products of both TL (panel A) and the minor endonuclease (panel B) were labeled regardless of alkaline phosphatase pretreatment. In contrast, the 5`-ends could be labeled only after the removal of the phosphoryl groups, indicating that both TL and the minor endonuclease catalyze DNA hydrolysis to produce 3`-OH/5`-P ends.</p><p>To compare the DNA fragment sizes remaining after hydrolysis by TL and the minor endonuclease, dideoxy sequencing gel electrophoresis was performed on the digestion products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>). For single strand hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A</xref>), the majority of the digestion products were less than 8 bp and 26 bp with TL and the minor endonuclease, respectively. The size variation of the final single strand hydrolysis products observed in sequencing gels for DNase I, TL, and the minor endonuclease may reflect mechanistic interactions of the DNA substrate with unique binding and cleavage sites. The electrophoretic cleavage patterns in the double strand hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B</xref>) indicate sequence preferences for the three enzymes. Nonspecific nucleases cleave at nearly all positions but will exhibit variations in cleavage rates depending on the DNA sequence. The sequence dependent rate variation results from many local and global factors including the DNA geometry, flexibility, and bending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. The hydrolysis pattern with TL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, and 3) features larger gaps compared to DNase I and the minor endonuclease. In addition, an intense signal in one of the smaller fragments was not observed with the other enzymes. The different sequence preferences for all three enzymes undoubtedly reflect different active sites. Although the structure of TL has been solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], a more thorough understanding of sequence cleavage preferences awaits structural analysis of the enzyme-oligonucleotide complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional significance of tear endonucleases</title><p>Clearance of human DNA from apoptotic cells is an obviously important potential function for nucleases in tears, but presumably breakdown is at least initiated by intracellular mechanisms.</p><p>The effective clearance of viral DNA from tears may require an extracellular endonuclease. Adenovirus infection of the conjunctiva and corneal epithelium may persist for years after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Adenoviral DNA sequences may be amplified from tears. Some viruses such as HSV-1 suppress cell apoptotic fragmentation of DNA by evading the action of intracellular caspases and the activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. The action promotes the propagation of infection of other cells by promoting replication, transformation, and survival of the virus. A mechanism for extracellular DNA catalysis could counter viral propagation by destroying the viral DNA outside of the intracellular caspase mechanism. Transformation of viral DNA occurs readily in human corneal cells in vitro; adenoviruses transfer with 95% efficiency. As the major endonuclease of tears, TL may have a role in the prevention of viral propagation by transformation. The absence of the major human extracellular nucleases in tears, DNase I and DNase X, serves to heighten the importance of TL in degrading foreign DNA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grant USPHS NIH EY11224 and the Edith and Lew Wasserman Professorship (B.J.G.) as well as the Astrid Mascoe- Mission for Vision Eye Pathology Research Fellowship (K.N.).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bicknell</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Brien</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cell turnover in the adult human eye.</article-title><source>Arch Ophthalmol</source><year>1961</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>695</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13711260</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cenedella</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Fleschner</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Kinetics of corneal epithelium turnover in vivo.
