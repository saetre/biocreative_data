Here we report that the modification of movement timing is highly dependent on signaling through P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Two lines of mutant mice heterozygous for P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels exhibited impaired plasticity of eye movement timing, but relatively intact plasticity of movement amplitude during motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The results thus demonstrate a distinction between the molecular signaling pathways regulating the timing versus amplitude of movements.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motor learning can modify both the temporal properties and the amplitude of movements. However, the signaling pathways supporting these modifications are not fully understood. Here we report that the regulation of these two aspects of movement can be dissociated at the molecular level.

The eye movement required to stabilize image motion is equal to the movement of the visual stimulus relative to the head. During x1/90&#x000b0;lead training, the visual stimulus movement had the same amplitude as head movement but was phase shifted to lead oppositely-directed head movement by 90&#x000b0; (thick upper trace). The eye movement required to stabilize an image under normal viewing conditions with an earth-stationary visual stimulus is also shown (thin upper trace).

With severe disruption of P/Q signaling, there appear to be multiple, primary and secondary pathological processes, which can produce ataxia and severely disrupt many aspects of oculomotor performance, or execution, as well as motor learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Katoh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Stahl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, motor learning is most sensitive to disrupted P/Q signaling, as it is impaired in all P/Q mutant strains that have been tested, whereas only a subset of these strains exhibit additional deficits in baseline performance of the VOR, the optokinetic reflex (OKR) or the oculomotor integrator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Katoh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Hoebeek1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The learning deficit reported previously was a reduction in the changes in VOR phase induced by x(&#x02212;1) training, however, since only a single training paradigm was used in that study, it was not clear whether regulation of the temporal properties of the eye movement was selectively impaired or whether there was a more general impairment of motor learning.

Visual motion stimuli were delivered by a moving optokinetic drum made of a white translucent plastic half-dome with black and white vertical stripes, each of which subtended 7.5&#x000b0; of visual angle.

In all ten training paradigms, the vestibular stimulus was the same, with a sinusoidal angular head velocity profile at 1 Hz, &#x000b1;10&#x000b0;/s. This vestibular stimulus was paired with 1 Hz sinusoidal motion of a visual stimulus, whose amplitude and phase relative to the vestibular stimulus depended on the training paradigm. To investigate the effects of training frequency on the learning impairments in the P/Q mutants, we tested one training paradigm (x1/90&#x000b0;lead, see below) at two additional stimulus frequencies, 0.5 and 2 Hz, with the same peak velocity used for 1 Hz training (&#x000b1;10&#x000b0;/s).</p><p>The notation describing each training paradigm denotes the eye movement gain and phase (relative to head motion) that would stabilize the image of the moving visual stimulus on the retina. The ideal eye movement is the same as the movement of the visual stimulus relative to the head. Normal viewing conditions, in which the visual stimulus is stationary in the world, require an eye movement that is equal in amplitude to the head movement (gain of 1) and exactly in phase with oppositely directed head movement (defined as a phase of 0&#x000b0;), and is hence referred to as x1/0&#x000b0;, or simply x1. To take another example, the x1.4/90&#x000b0;lead paradigm would require a VOR with a gain of 1.4 (larger than normal) and a phase such that eye velocity leads oppositely-directed peak head velocity by 90&#x000b0;.</p><p>Animals were exposed to the training stimulus for three 10-min blocks (30 min total).

The VOR gain was calculated as the ratio of the eye to head velocity amplitudes. The VOR phase was calculated as the difference between the peak eye velocity phase and the peak head velocity phase in the opposite direction. A perfectly compensatory VOR would thus have a phase of zero. Learned changes in VOR gain were measured as a percentage of the initial VOR gain measured immediately before training. Learned changes in VOR phase were measured as the difference between the phase after versus before training. We also measured the gain and phase of the eye movements made in the presence of the visual-vestibular training stimulus, during the first one minute of training and at the end of training.</p><p>With 30 min of training, substantial changes in the VOR were induced, although the fully adaptive gain and phase were not achieved, even in wild-type mice.

Motor learning in the VOR was tested by measuring the eye movement responses to head movements in total darkness, before and after training. In general, training altered the VOR so that the eye movements elicited by the vestibular stimulus in the dark were closer to the ideal eye movement response required to stabilize images in the presence of the visual-vestibular training stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In a subset of wild-type mice, we also measured changes in the gain and phase of the optokinetic reflex (OKR), which shares some circuitry with the VOR. There was no correlation between the changes in OKR gain or phase and the changes in VOR gain or phase across the different training paradigms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003635.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), which suggests that the changes in VOR gain are not simply a reflection of plasticity in the OKR circuit.</p><p>Across the ten training paradigms, there was a correlation between the changes in VOR gain and the changes in VOR phase.

Most of the training paradigms altered both the gain and phase of the VOR, hence the impaired changes in VOR phase were present even within the same training sessions that yielded normal changes in VOR gain (e.g., x1/90&#x000b0;lead training, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, training paradigm &#x02018;a&#x02019;).

Therefore we tested the contribution of P/Q signaling to learning using higher and lower stimulus frequencies to determine whether the selective impairment of changes in VOR phase was present across stimulus frequencies in mice with disrupted P/Q signaling. These experiments employed the x1/90&#x000b0;lead training paradigm, which at 1 Hz induced a decrease in VOR gain and the most robust change in VOR phase of all training paradigms tested. In wild-type mice, x1/90&#x000b0;lead training at 0.5 or 2 Hz also induced a phase lead and decrease in VOR gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, black bars). The &#x003b1;1A hemizygotes exhibited impaired phase adaptation at all frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, red bars; F<sub>1, 56</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;81.1, p&#x0003c;0.0001, ANOVA; p&#x0003c;0.005 at 0.5 Hz, p&#x0003c;0.0001 at 1 Hz and 2 Hz, Bonferroni-corrected t-test). Thus, disruption of P/Q signaling produces a general deficit in adaptive timing that can be observed across a range of training and testing conditions. At 1 and 2 Hz, there was no additional deficit in VOR gain adaptation, however at a lower frequency (0.5 Hz), gain adaptation was also significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>; F<sub>1, 56</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.34, p&#x0003c;0.05, ANOVA; p&#x0003c;0.017 at 0.5 Hz, p&#x0003e;0.90 at 1 Hz, p&#x0003e;0.42 at 2 Hz, Bonferroni-corrected t-test). At all training frequencies, there was no significant difference between P/Q mutants and wild-type mice in the eye movements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003635.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>) or in the retinal image motion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003635.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>) in the presence of the visual-vestibular stimuli used to induce learning. Therefore, all deficits appear to be deficits in learning <italic>per se</italic>, rather than a sensory or motor performance deficit. The contribution of P/Q signaling to learned changes in VOR gain induced with low- but not high-frequency training supports the hypothesis that different neural mechanisms are recruited at different training frequencies. More generally, our results demonstrate that P/Q signaling contributes selectively, but not exclusively, to learned changes in the temporal properties of the VOR.</p><fig id="pone-0003635-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003635.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effect of training frequency on the learned changes in VOR gain (A) and phase (B).</title><p>Frequency-selective impairment of changes in VOR gain (A) and frequency-independent impairment of changes in VOR phase (B) in &#x003b1;1A&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice (red) relative to wild-type mice (black) during x1/90&#x000b0;lead training.

During low-frequency training, the P/Q-dependent component also makes a significant contribution to the gain changes, so both phase and gain changes are impaired in P/Q mutants undergoing low-frequency training. In contrast, during high-frequency training, the P/Q-dependent component makes a smaller contribution to learning, and accounts for a small fraction of the gain changes, rendering gain changes relatively insensitive to disruption of P/Q signaling.</p><p>The components of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003635-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, based on the results from genetically-modified mice, map remarkably well onto the components of a previous model, based on monkey physiology, which suggested that learning in the VOR involved both coordinated changes in the weights of the signaling pathways in the VOR circuit, which contribute selectively to changes in VOR gain, and changes in a time constant in the VOR circuit, which contribute to learned changes in the VOR gain and temporal properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Lisberger1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The mouse data extend this previous model by mapping the components of learning onto specific molecular signaling mechanisms and by revealing that these components are differentially recruited at different training frequencies.</p><p>The frequency range at which gain changes transition from being P/Q-dependent to P/Q-independent is between 0.5 Hz and 1 Hz. Notably, it is in the very same frequency range that gain changes transition from being CaMKIV-independent to CaMKIV-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Boyden2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Electrophysiological analysis in monkeys suggests that the recruitment of different plasticity mechanisms by high- versus low-frequency training reflects the neural &#x0201c;instructive signals&#x0201d; available. The climbing fiber input to the cerebellum carries instructive signals appropriate to guide learning during both low- and high-frequency training, whereas the Purkinje cell simple spikes carry useful instructive signals only during low-frequency training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Raymond2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since P/Q-dependent mechanisms contribute to learning primarily during low-frequency training, this component of learning may be induced by instructive signals carried by the Purkinje cells, whereas the P/Q-independent components may be induced by instructive signals carried by the climbing fibers. This raises the possibility that the P/Q-dependent component involves plasticity in the vestibular nuclei/deep cerebellar nuclei, where instructive signals in the Purkinje cells have been hypothesized to act <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Miles1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At the behavioral level, the timing of the instructive signals available to guide learning also varies with training stimulus frequency. Retinal image motion and/or the tracking eye movements present during training, and their relationship to the vestibular stimulus, are thought to provide the instructive signals guiding learning. The amplitude of retinal image motion and eye velocity, as well as their phase relative to the head movement, was similar during x1/90&#x000b0;lead training at 0.5 Hz as compared with 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003635.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). However, the <italic>timing</italic> of peak eye movement or retinal image movement relative to head movement differed by hundreds milliseconds at the two frequencies. For example, the phase of the retinal slip in wild-type mice was 124.1&#x000b1;6.3&#x000b0; lead relative to peak head velocity at 1 Hz and 127.8&#x000b1;13.7&#x000b0; lead at 0.5 Hz, which represent 345 ms at 1 Hz and 710 ms at 0.5 Hz. This extra time shift of several hundred milliseconds could cause some plasticity mechanisms to drop out at frequencies below 1 Hz, making learning more reliant on a P/Q-dependent mechanism.</p><p>The inhibition of P/Q-type calcium channels can affect a number of neuronal functions, depending on the extent to which P/Q signaling is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Pietrobon1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. One neuronal function that is particularly sensitive to altered P/Q signaling is the precise timing of spikes. Purkinje cells from <italic>leaner</italic> heterozygotes in slice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Walter1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and in <italic>tottering</italic> homozygotes <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Hoebeek1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> exhibit less regular spike timing than Purkinje cells in wild-type mice. The parallel between the high sensitivity of both spike timing and learned changes in the temporal properties of movements to disrupted P/Q signaling raises the intriguing possibility that spike timing dependent plasticity regulates the temporal properties of the VOR. Notably, the induction of LTD at the parallel fiber&#x02013;Purkinje cell synapses, which has been the focus of most studies of cerebellum-dependent learning, should not be sensitive to the few milliseconds of jitter in spike timing observed in P/Q mutants, since LTD at these synapses can be effectively induced within a much broader timing window of hundreds of milliseconds between parallel fiber and climbing fiber activity (climbing fiber activation leading parallel fiber activation by tens of milliseconds or lagging by a few hundred milliseconds) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Safo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Wang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it will be interesting to determine whether other synapses in the cerebellum and related circuitry have plasticity mechanisms that are sensitive to the few milliseconds of spike time jitter caused by reductions in P/Q signaling.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that P/Q signaling does not contribute directly to the plasticity mechanisms supporting VOR motor learning, but to the generation of a neural representation of timing upon which plasticity can act. Computational models have suggested that networks of granule cells and Golgi cells create a &#x0201c;menu&#x0201d; of differently-filtered versions of the input signal to the cerebellar cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Fujita1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003635-Mauk1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The adaptive modification of movement timing would then involve the selection, through synaptic plasticity, of the filtered version of the signal with the appropriate temporal properties. If P/Q signaling contributed to the generation of differently filtered versions of the vestibular signals driving the VOR, representing the range of potential VOR phases, then disruption of P/Q signaling could selectively disrupt the ability of motor learning to adjust the phase, but not the gain of the VOR, as observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003635.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The relationship between the learned changes in A) VOR gain and OKR gain, B) VOR gain and OKR phase, C) VOR phase and OKR gain and D) VOR phase and OKR phase in wild-type mice, induced by the 10 visual-vestibular training paradigms.
