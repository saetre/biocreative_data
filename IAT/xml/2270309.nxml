Mad1, an upstream regulator of Mad2, forms a tight core complex with Mad2 and facilitates Mad2 binding to Cdc20. In the absence of its binding proteins, free Mad2 has two natively folded conformers, termed N1-Mad2/open-Mad2 (O-Mad2) and N2-Mad2/closed Mad2 (C-Mad2), with C-Mad2 being more active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition. Here, we show that whereas O-Mad2 is monomeric, C-Mad2 forms either symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 (C&#x02013;C) or asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 (O&#x02013;C) dimers. We also report the crystal structure of the symmetric C&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer, revealing the basis for the ability of unliganded C-Mad2, but not O-Mad2 or liganded C-Mad2, to form symmetric dimers. A Mad2 mutant that predominantly forms the C&#x02013;C dimer is functional in vitro and in living cells. Finally, the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex facilitates the conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 in vitro. Collectively, our results establish the existence of a symmetric Mad2 dimer and provide insights into Mad1-assisted conformational activation of Mad2 in the spindle checkpoint.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Chromosome missegregation during mitosis results in the gain or loss of chromosomes in the next generation of cells and can contribute to birth defects or cancer. A cellular surveillance system called the spindle checkpoint ensures that accurate chromosome segregation occurs by inhibiting the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) until all sister chromatids have achieved proper attachment to the mitotic spindle. The spindle checkpoint protein Mad2 binds to Cdc20, an activator of APC/C, and inhibits the complex. The Mad2 protein can adopt either an open or closed conformation. The conformational switch in Mad2 is critical for Cdc20 binding and APC/C inhibition, and is regulated by the protein Mad1. We report the crystal structure of the symmetric Mad2 dimer, which is made up of two closed monomers, and is active in APC/C-Cdc20 inhibition.

A series of biochemical, cell biological, and structural studies has established that Mad2 is a highly unusual two-state protein and that the Mad1-assisted conformational switch between these two states is central to Mad2 regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In an early study, Fang, et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; showed that recombinant purified Mad2 has two natively folded conformers, a monomer and a dimer, in the absence of ligand binding or covalent modification. The Mad2 dimer can form tetramers at high concentrations. The Mad2 dimer, but not the monomer, is active in APC/C inhibition in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Furthermore, the Mad2 monomer blocks the function of the Mad2 dimer in a dominant-negative manner. Structural studies were subsequently carried out to explain this striking two-state behavior of Mad2. The structures of the Mad2 monomer and Mad2 in complex with either Mad1 or an unnatural peptide ligand called Mad2-binding peptide 1 (MBP1) that mimics the Mad2-binding motifs of Mad1 or Cdc20 were determined &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These structures revealed that the Mad2 monomer has a globular domain and a flexible C-terminal tail. A Mad2 mutant with its C-terminal tail deleted (Mad2<sup>&#x00394;C</sup>) is an open Mad2 (O-Mad2) monomer, is incapable of binding to Cdc20, and inhibits the activity of wild-type Mad2 in a dominant-negative manner. Mad2 undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon ligand binding. The peptide ligands are trapped by the C-terminal region of Mad2 in a manner similar to the way that passengers are restrained by the seat belts in automobiles.</p><p>The Mad2 point mutant, Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, has two distinct monomeric conformers in the absence of ligands, which allowed us to determine the structure of both natively folded conformers of Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, termed N1-Mad2/open Mad2 (hereafter referred to as O-Mad2) and N2-Mad2/closed Mad2 (C-Mad2), by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

The structure of unliganded C-Mad2 closely resembles that of Mad1- or Cdc20-bound C-Mad2 except that the ligand-binding site is vacant. O-Mad2 can spontaneously convert to C-Mad2 with slow kinetics (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003d; 9 h at 30 &#x000b0;C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Monomeric C-Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, but not O-Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, is active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition. In addition, O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 can form an asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 (O&#x02013;C) dimer that is less active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, explaining why Mad2<sup>&#x00394;C</sup> (which only adopts the O-Mad2 conformation) can block the activity of wild-type Mad2 in a dominant-negative manner. Finally, Mad1 facilitates the conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Mad2 is targeted to unattached kinetochores by Mad1 and turns over rapidly at the kinetochores as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. These studies suggest that Mad1 activates Mad2 at kinetochores by facilitating the structural conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2.</p><p>More recent FRAP studies revealed that only about 50&#x00025; of kinetochore-bound Mad2 undergoes fast exchange with its cytosolic pool &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that there is a stably bound pool of Mad2 at the kinetochores. Musacchio and coworkers then showed that this stably kinetochore-bound pool of Mad2 forms a tight complex with Mad1 and adopts the C-Mad2 conformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic O-Mad2 to kinetochores through asymmetric O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimerization.</p><p>All available data thus support the following main framework to explain the mechanism by which Mad1 assists the binding of Mad2 to Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g001">Figure 1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In this model, Mad2 has two distinct conformations of roughly equal free energy: a latent O-Mad2 and an active C-Mad2. The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex recruits another copy of cytosolic O-Mad2 to kinetochore through O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimerization. O-Mad2 bound to the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex undergoes a conformational change to adopt a short-lived, high-energy intermediate conformation (I-Mad2). (I-Mad2 was previously referred to as O&#x0002a;-Mad2. To avoid confusion, we will use the unified nomenclature described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.) I-Mad2 can be directly passed onto Cdc20 from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex. Alternatively, at least a fraction of I-Mad2 converts to unliganded C-Mad2, which dissociates from Mad1. Because Mad1 is a homodimer, two C-Mad2 molecules dissociated from Mad1 are expected to form a symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 (C&#x02013;C) Mad2 dimer. These unliganded C-Mad2 species are more active for Cdc20 binding and APC/C inhibition. Chemical shift perturbation experiments had initially suggested that, upon binding to C-Mad2, O-Mad2 undergoes a large conformational change to become I-Mad2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The structure of the asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer has, however, revealed that O-Mad2 bound to C-Mad2 has virtually the same conformation as does free O-Mad2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, I-Mad2 is not the stable conformation of O-Mad2 bound to C-Mad2, but rather a high-energy state with a finite lifetime. The existence and nature of I-Mad2 remain to be established.</p><fig id="pbio-0060050-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Model for Mad1-Assisted Mad2 Activation during Checkpoint Signaling</title><p>(A) A model for the conformational activation of Mad2.

In the absence of Mad1 or Cdc20, purified O-Mad2 spontaneously converts into unliganded C-Mad2, because O-Mad2 is at a slightly higher energy state relative to unliganded C-Mad2. We postulate that the O&#x02013;C Mad2 conversion proceeds via an undefined intermediate state of Mad2, termed I-Mad2. The energetic barrier between C-Mad2 and I-Mad2 may be lower than that between O-Mad2 and I-Mad2. Thus, C-Mad2 can reach the I-Mad2 conformation more easily than O-Mad2, explaining why C-Mad2 is more active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition. The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex facilitates the O&#x02013;C Mad2 conversion by lowering the energetic barrier between O-Mad2 and I-Mad2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060050.g001"/></fig><p>In this study, we performed systematic mutagenesis studies of human Mad2 and obtained Mad2 mutants that preferably adopt the closed conformation. We determined the crystal structure of one such mutant, Mad2<sup>L13A</sup>, demonstrating unequivocally that C-Mad2 can form a symmetric C&#x02013;C dimer in vitro. Using NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the wild-type Mad2 can form both an asymmetric O&#x02013;C dimer and a symmetric C&#x02013;C dimer. Mad2<sup>L13A</sup>, which predominantly exists as the symmetric C&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer, is functional in cells and is active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition in vitro. Finally, the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex enhances the conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2.

Inspection of their surface electrostatic potentials reveals that C-Mad2 contains a contiguous, negatively charged patch centered around &#x003b2;6 that is absent in O-Mad2 because &#x003b2;6 is largely buried by &#x003b2;7 and &#x003b2;8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

The binding affinities of these Mad2 mutants toward the Mad2-binding motif of Cdc20 were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The results from these studies are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060050-t001">Table 1</xref>.

The majority of Mad2 mutants formed both O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 conformers that interconverted with rates similar to that of Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>.

We next fractionated both Mad2<sup>WT</sup> and Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> on an anion exchange column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Similar to Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, Mad2<sup>WT</sup> eluted in two well-resolved peaks (Q1 and Q2), which were further fractionated on a gel filtration column. Mad2<sup>WT</sup> in the low-salt peak (Q1) was monomeric, whereas Mad2 in the high-salt peak (Q2) eluted on the gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa, consistent with it being a dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). NMR studies further confirmed that the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> monomer had the O-Mad2 conformation, and at least one copy of Mad2 in the dimer had the C-Mad2 conformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In contrast to Mad2<sup>WT</sup>, Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> eluted as a single high-salt peak on an anion-exchange column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> in this peak eluted as a dimer from a gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). We next used 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N transverse-relaxation optimized heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (TROSY-HSQC) to further characterize the conformational state of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup>. The peaks in the HSQC spectrum of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> largely overlap with those in the HSQC spectrum of C-Mad2<sup>R133A</sup>, indicating that Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> has the C-Mad2 conformation (unpublished data). The HSQC spectrum of the 205-residue Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> protein has only about 190 backbone peaks, consistent with each backbone amide group of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> having a single peak. Thus, the column fractionation profiles and the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> suggest that Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> forms a symmetric C&#x02013;C dimer.</p><p>We next used equilibrium sedimentation to determine the native molecular mass of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> and to measure its self-association affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). After fitting the data to a single ideal species, we obtained a molecular mass of 43.5 kDa, which was about twice the predicted molecular mass of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> (23.5 kDa). Fitting the data to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model yielded a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 0.25 &#x003bc;M for the Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> dimer. Thus, Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> forms a stable symmetric dimer with relatively high affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Crystal Structure of the Symmetric C&#x02013;C Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> Dimer</title><p>Our extensive efforts to crystallize the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer failed, likely due to its conformational heterogeneity.

The two monomers mainly interact through the C-terminal halves of their &#x003b1;C helices. The high resolution of our structure of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> allows clear visualization of side chains as well as several well-ordered water molecules at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). The dimerization interface of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> is symmetric and consists of residues from the C-terminal half of &#x003b1;C, R184 from &#x003b2;8&#x02032;, and Q34 at the C-terminal end of &#x003b1;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Residues in &#x003b2;1 in O-Mad2 do not interfere with the interactions at the dimer interface mainly involving the C-terminal end of &#x003b1;C. Why does O-Mad2 not form a symmetric O&#x02013;O dimer using the same interface as that of the C&#x02013;C dimer? As discussed above, Q134 is a critical residue at the dimer interface. Its side chain forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of T140. The orientation of the Q134 side chain is determined by its packing with F141 from the neighboring monomer and, more importantly, by an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of R184 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In C-Mad2, R184 is located in a &#x003b2; bulge and forms an electrostatic interaction with E127 on &#x003b1;C, thus presenting its backbone amide for hydrogen bonding with the side chain of Q134. In O-Mad2, R184 is located at the opposite side of the molecule. The side chain of Q134 packs against W100 and is not available for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, R184 of &#x003b2;8&#x02032; indirectly contributes to Mad2 dimerization by forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the side chain of Q134, explaining the inability of O-Mad2 to form symmetric dimers. V197 in O-Mad2 is located in the flexible C-terminal tail, whereas it resides in &#x003b2;8&#x02032;&#x02032; and packs against W100 in C-Mad2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. As a consequence, the &#x003b3;2 methyl group of V197 (V197&#x003b3;2) has a high-field <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift at &#x02212;0.34 parts per million (ppm) only in C-Mad2. Hence the &#x02212;0.34 ppm V197&#x003b3;2 peak is unique to C-Mad2. Consistent with the essential role of R184 in symmetric C&#x02013;C Mad2 dimerization, Mad2<sup>R184E</sup> (a point mutant of Mad2 with R184 mutated to glutamate in wild-type Mad2) adopts the monomeric C-Mad2 conformation as evidenced by its apparent molecular weight from the gel filtration chromatography and the existence of the unique V197&#x003b3;2 peak at &#x02212;0.34 ppm in the 1D NMR spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g004">4</xref>F).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mad2<sup>WT</sup> Forms Both Symmetric C&#x02013;C and Asymmetric O&#x02013;C Dimers</title><p>Our previous biochemical and NMR studies have shown that the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer contains at least one copy of C-Mad2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is unclear whether the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer is a symmetric C&#x02013;C dimer, an asymmetric O&#x02013;C dimer, or a mixture of both. To characterize the nature of the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer, we compared its 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectrum with those of the symmetric C&#x02013;C Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> dimer and an asymmetric O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As discussed above, the &#x02212;0.34 ppm V197&#x003b3;2 peak is unique to C-Mad2. The symmetric C&#x02013;C and asymmetric O&#x02013;C dimers each contain a single V197&#x003b3;2 peak at &#x02212;0.34 ppm. However, the V197&#x003b3;2 peak in the C&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer has a higher-field <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift as compared to that in the O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer. The Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer has two peaks for V197&#x003b3;2, with an intensity ratio of about 1:3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The stronger peak overlays well with the V197&#x003b3;2 peak in the O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer, whereas the weaker peak corresponds to the V197&#x003b3;2 peak in the C&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).

Addition of Mad2 to the preformed APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> complex failed to inhibit its activity (unpublished data). Thus, to observe the APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>-inhibitory activity of Mad2, we needed to preincubate Mad2 and Cdc20 before the addition of APC/C. When Mad2 and Cdc20 were preincubated for 2 h prior to APC/C addition, Mad2<sup>WT</sup> and Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> inhibited APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> with similar potency, with Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> being slightly more active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).

The fact that Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> inhibits APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> more efficiently than Mad2<sup>WT</sup> with a shorter preincubation suggests that Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> has a faster on-rate in Cdc20 binding. Because the majority of dimeric Mad2<sup>WT</sup> forms the asymmetric O&#x02013;C dimer, whereas Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> predominantly forms the symmetric C&#x02013;C dimer, this finding further suggests that C-Mad2 is more active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition in vitro.</p><fig id="pbio-0060050-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> Dimer Is More Active Than the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> Dimer in Inhibiting APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup></title><p>(A) Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> is more potent than the Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer in inhibiting APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> in an in vitro reconstituted APC/C ubiquitination assay.

In cells, unliganded C-Mad2 is expected to bind to Cdc20 and is unlikely to accumulate to high enough concentrations to compete with the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex for O-Mad2. Nevertheless, our results indicate that in the absence of Cdc20, O-Mad2 bound to the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex can complete the open-to-closed rearrangement and dissociate from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex as unliganded C-Mad2.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Release of C-Mad2 from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 Core Complex</title><p>The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex recruits O-Mad2 and converts it to C-Mad2. How is C-Mad2 released from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex after the conversion? Mapelli et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; recently determined the crystal structure of the asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer. We thus superposed C-Mad2 onto O-Mad2 in the O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). As described above, a major difference between the fold of O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 is the translocation of the C-terminal region from one side of the molecule to the other, forming the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin that pairs with &#x003b2;5 in C-Mad2. To accommodate this &#x003b2; hairpin and avoid steric clashes, &#x003b1;C in C-Mad2 needs to rotate slightly, which in turn causes a rotation of the &#x003b2;2/3 hairpin. Consequently, in our structural model, &#x003b1;C of C-Mad2 superposed with O-Mad2 develops steric clashes with &#x003b2;8&#x02032; and &#x003b1;A of the original C-Mad2 molecule in the O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Thus, C-Mad2 cannot bind to another copy of C-Mad2 using the asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimerization interface. Conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 on the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex introduces steric clashes between &#x003b1;C of the newly formed C-Mad2 and parts of the C-Mad2 molecule in the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex, enabling the release of the newly converted C-Mad2.</p><fig id="pbio-0060050-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Release of C-Mad2 from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 Core Complex</title><p>(A) Superposition of C-Mad2 with O-Mad2 in the O&#x02013;C Mad2 dimer.

Furthermore, the ligand-binding site and the symmetric dimerization interface of Mad2 are located on opposite sides of the protein. Why then is C-Mad2 incapable of rebinding to the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core using the symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 interface? A superposition of unliganded C-Mad2 and Mad1-bound C-Mad2 reveals a structural difference in the C-terminal end of their &#x003b1;C helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Residues 135&#x02013;141 in &#x003b1;C adopt an irregular helical conformation in unliganded C-Mad2, whereas they adopt a 3<sub>10</sub>-helical conformation in Mad1-bound C-Mad2. Because of this important difference and a difference in the rotamer conformation of F141, the side chain of F141 points into different directions in the two C-Mad2 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). In unliganded C-Mad2, F141 points outward and engages in numerous interactions at the dimerization interface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, F141 in liganded C-Mad2 points inward, forms intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with V181 and Y199, and is unavailable to mediate dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Mutation of F141 disrupts Mad2 dimerization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, confirming the essential role of this residue. Thus, ligand binding at one side of Mad2 might trigger structural changes of F141 at the other side, thereby preventing unliganded C-Mad2 from binding to liganded C-Mad2, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the structural differences involving F141 are caused by crystal packing.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Why Is Unliganded C-Mad2 More Active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> Inhibition?</title><p>We have shown that unliganded C-Mad2 is more active than O-Mad2 in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition in vitro. Because O-Mad2 and unliganded C-Mad2 form the same C-Mad2&#x02013;Cdc20 complex, the difference in their APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>-inhibitory activity is likely caused by different on-rates during their binding to Cdc20. Binding of Cdc20 to O-Mad2 is a complicated process and can be conceptually separated into four steps, not necessarily in the stated order (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). First, &#x003b2;8 dissociates from &#x003b2;6; the C-terminal region of Mad2 either retains the &#x003b2;7/8 hairpin or possibly rearranges into the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin as in C-Mad2. Second, &#x003b2;1 dissociates from &#x003b2;5, traverses through the &#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;C loop, and forms an additional turn in &#x003b1;A. Third, the Mad2-binding motif of Cdc20 forms a &#x003b2; strand that pairs with &#x003b2;6 and extends the main &#x003b2; sheet of Mad2. Fourth, the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin wraps around Cdc20 and translocates to pair with &#x003b2;5, thus trapping Cdc20 in the closed seatbelt conformation. O-Mad2 is thus an autoinhibited conformation in which &#x003b2;8 blocks the accessibility of &#x003b2;6 and, hence, ligand-binding through an intramolecular interaction. Consistent with this notion, a Mad2 deletion mutant (Mad2<sup>1&#x02013;160</sup>) that lacks &#x003b2;7, &#x003b2;8, and the C-terminal tail still folds, exhibits cooperative unfolding with a melting temperature of 47 &#x000b0;C, and retains weak binding to MBP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), possibly through the formation of edge-on interactions between &#x003b2;6 and MBP1. In contrast, Mad2<sup>&#x00394;C</sup> lacks only the C-terminal tail, but retains &#x003b2;7 and &#x003b2;8. This mutant fails to bind to MBP1 because of the blockage of &#x003b2;6 by &#x003b2;8 (unpublished data).</p><p>We propose two nonexclusive models to explain why unliganded C-Mad2 is more active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition than O-Mad2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). In the first model (pathway <bold>a</bold>), dissociation of &#x003b2;1 and its subsequent traversing through the &#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;C loop are rate-limiting steps in the conversion of O-Mad2 to I-Mad2. These structural changes involving &#x003b2;1 have already occurred in C-Mad2. The energetic barrier between C-Mad2 and I-Mad2 may be lower than that between O-Mad2 and I-Mad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, C-Mad2 can reach the I-Mad2 conformation more easily than O-Mad2, explaining why C-Mad2 is more active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition. In the second model (pathway <bold>b</bold>), because &#x003b2;6 is exposed in C-Mad2, but blocked in O-Mad2, the Mad2-binding motif of Cdc20 more readily forms an edge-on interaction with &#x003b2;6 of C-Mad2. Binding of Cdc20 on one side of Mad2 allosterically triggers the dissociation of the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin from &#x003b2;5 on the other side of Mad2. This hairpin then wraps around Cdc20 and completes the binding event.</p><p>Although only C-Mad2 can form symmetric dimers, the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin of C-Mad2 does not directly participate in this symmetric dimerization. Formation of symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimers does not impede the dissociation of &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; from &#x003b2;5 and the binding of C-Mad2 to Cdc20. In contrast, the &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; hairpin of C-Mad2 is a major structural element that mediates the binding of O-Mad2. Formation of the asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 impedes the dissociation of &#x003b2;8&#x02032;/8&#x02032;&#x02032; from &#x003b2;5 and, hence, the binding of C-Mad2 to Cdc20, explaining the dominant-negative effects of O-Mad2 on C-Mad2. Furthermore, O-Mad2 in the O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer is less active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition than C-Mad2, suggesting that O-Mad2 cannot be activated by unliganded C-Mad2 to become I-Mad2, unlike O-Mad2 bound to the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The two-state behavior of Mad2 was discovered nearly a decade ago &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. It was shown that dimeric Mad2 was active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition. Monomeric Mad2 not only was inactive in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition, but also blocked the ability of dimeric Mad2 to inhibit APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> in a dominant-negative manner. We have now determined the crystal structure of an active dimeric Mad2 species, and show that the active Mad2 dimer is a symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer. O-Mad2 forms an asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer and blocks the ability of C-Mad2 to inhibit APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> in a dominant-negative manner. The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex catalyzes the conversion of O-Mad2 to unliganded C-Mad2 in the absence of Cdc20.</p><p>Our results further support the following conformational activation model for Mad2-dependent spindle checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060050-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this model, cytosolic O-Mad2 is autoinhibited and has a high kinetic barrier for binding to Cdc20. Upon checkpoint activation, O-Mad2 is recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex through asymmetric O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimerization. The Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex converts O-Mad2 to a short-lived intermediate Mad2 (I-Mad2). I-Mad2 is kinetically more favorable for Cdc20 binding and can bind directly to Cdc20 to form C-Mad2. Alternatively, I-Mad2 can convert to unliganded C-Mad2 on its own and, upon release from the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 core complex, can form symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimers. Both monomeric C-Mad2 and symmetric C-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer are active in APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Protein expression and purification.</title><p>The coding region of human Mad2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into either a pGEX-KT or pQE30 (Qiagen) vector, each of which also included a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Mad2 mutants were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pQE30-Mad2 plasmids were transformed into the bacteria strain M15&#x0005b;pREP4&#x0005d; to produce various His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Mad2 proteins. These proteins were purified with Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) and cleaved with TEV protease to remove the His<sub>6</sub>-tag. The proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Expression of pGEX-Mad2<sup>L13A,C79S,C106S</sup> (referred to as Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> for simplicity) in the bacterial strain BL21 produced a GST-Mad2 fusion protein. The fusion protein was isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and cleaved with TEV protease to remove GST.

We had previously shown that O-Mad2 was stable at 4 &#x000b0;C, whereas it underwent slow spontaneous conversion to C-Mad2 at 30 &#x000b0;C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060050-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Incubation of O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> with TEV overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C did not result in the cleavage of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag from His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup>, whereas TEV efficiently cleaved other unrelated His<sub>6</sub>-tag proteins under the same conditions. This result suggested that the TEV cleavage site in His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> was not accessible. We thus incubated the mixture of His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> and TEV overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C, which resulted in the cleavage of about 50&#x00025; of the His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> molecules. This mixture of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged and untagged Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> fractionated as a single high-salt peak on an anion exchange column and as a 1:1 heterodimer on a gel filtration column. Moreover, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectrum of the Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> dimer was virtually identical to that of O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;C</sup>&#x02013;C-Mad2<sup>WT</sup> dimer, indicating that Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> indeed formed an O-Mad2&#x02013;C-Mad2 dimer. We reasoned that as His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> spontaneously converted to His<sub>6</sub>-C-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> or an intermediate Mad2 state, its TEV cleavage site became accessible, resulting in the cleavage of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag in this population of Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup>. The formation of the His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup>&#x02013;untagged C-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> dimer prevented the further conversion of His<sub>6</sub>-O-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> to His<sub>6</sub>-C-Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup>, and thus prevented further cleavage of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag in the rest of the Mad2<sup>&#x00394;N10</sup> molecules by TEV.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination.</title><p>The Mad2<sup> L13A</sup> dimer was crystallized at 20 &#x000b0;C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method.

A group of four Mad2 protomers (named Mad2<sup>A</sup>, Mad2<sup>B</sup>, Mad2<sup>C</sup>, and Mad2<sup>D</sup>) is shown in ribbon representations to display the two types of molecular interfaces observed in the Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> structure. The color code is as follows: Mad2<sup>A</sup> is green, Mad2<sup>B</sup> is blue, Mad2<sup>C</sup> is magenta, and Mad2<sup>D</sup> is orange. Mad2<sup>A</sup> and Mad2<sup>B</sup>, as well as Mad2<sup>C</sup> and Mad2<sup>D</sup>, are related by a noncrystallographic two-fold axis. In one interface, Mad2<sup>A</sup> and Mad2<sup>B</sup> interact with each other mainly through the C-terminal halves of the &#x003b1;C helices. In the other interface, the N-terminal regions of Mad2<sup>C</sup> and Mad2<sup>D</sup> insert into the ligand-binding pockets of Mad2<sup>A</sup> and Mad2<sup>B</sup>, respectively. This tetrameric arrangement likely does not reflect the oligomeric status of Mad2<sup>L13A</sup>, as it exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, based on gel filtration and equilibrium sedimentation experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060050-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, mutations of several residues on &#x003b1;C, including R133A, completely disrupt Mad2 dimerization in solution, indicating that &#x003b1;C is the major structural determinant for Mad2 dimerization. Finally, the N-terminal region of Mad2 does not share sequence homology with the Mad2-binding consensus motifs and is dispensable for dimer formation. Therefore, the interactions between the N-terminal regions of Mad2<sup>C,D</sup> and the ligand-binding sites of Mad2<sup>A,B</sup> are very likely a result of crystal packing. Though these types of interactions are unlikely to be functionally relevant, they may explain the ability of Mad2 dimers to form higher-order oligomers at high concentrations.</p><p>(3.8 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060050.sg003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060050-sg004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Both Mad2<sup>WT</sup> and Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> Dimers Inhibit APC/C Efficiently with Longer Preincubation of Cdc20 and Mad2</title><p>Human Cdc20 was incubated with Mad2<sup>WT</sup> or Mad2<sup>L13A</sup> dimers at varying concentrations (1&#x02013;16 &#x003bc;M) for 2 h.
