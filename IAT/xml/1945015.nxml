Children with MPS IIIB develop disturbances of sleep, activity levels, coordination, vision, hearing, and mental functioning culminating in early death. The murine model of MPS IIIB demonstrates lysosomal distention in multiple tissues, a shortened life span, and behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>To more thoroughly assess MPS IIIB in mice, alterations in circadian rhythm, activity level, motor function, vision, and hearing were tested. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) developed pathologic changes and locomotor analysis showed that MPS IIIB mice start their daily activity later and have a lower proportion of activity during the night than wild-type controls. Rotarod assessment of motor function revealed a progressive inability to coordinate movement in a rocking paradigm. Purkinje cell counts were significantly reduced in the MPS IIIB animals compared to age matched controls. By electroretinography (ERG), MPS IIIB mice had a progressive decrease in the amplitude of the dark-adapted b-wave response. Corresponding pathology revealed shortening of the outer segments, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and inclusions in the retinal pigmented epithelium. Auditory-evoked brainstem responses (ABR) demonstrated progressive hearing deficits consistent with the observed loss of hair cells in the inner ear and histologic abnormalities in the middle ear.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The mouse model of MPS IIIB has several quantifiable phenotypic alterations and is similar to the human disease.

Three paradigms were used: 1. Accelerating - acceleration over the first minute from 5 rpm to 30 rpm and maintenance of 30 rpm for the remaining 2 minutes; 2. Constant speed &#x02013; continuous speed of 30 rpm for 3 minutes; 3. Rocking - reversal of direction of rotation with each full turn of the rod at 10 rpm for 3 minutes. Entrainment was done for 2 consecutive days with 3 attempts at each paradigm on a Rotarod (UGO Basile, rota-rod for mice, Varese, Italy). The first testing occurred on the third consecutive day. The length of time each mouse remained on the rod was recorded for each of the 3 attempts at each of the three paradigms. Subsequent testing was done at 3&#x02013;4 week intervals with no subsequent entrainment. Mice were timed for how long they could remain on the rod for each of 3 trials under each of the 3 conditions. The longest time that each mouse remained on the rod for each condition served as the dependent variable. The data were subjected to a repeated measures ANOVA model that included one between-subjects variable (Genotype) and one within-subjects variable (Ages at testing), as well as the Huynh-Feldt adjustment of <italic>p</italic> values for repeated measures variables containing more than two levels.

Mice were anesthetized (80 mg/kg ketamine, 15 mg/kg xylazine, intra-peritoneal) and positioned dorsally in a custom head holder. Core temperature was maintained at 37.5&#x000b1;1.0&#x000b0;C using a thermostatically-controlled heating pad controlled by a rectal temperature probe (FHC Inc., Bowdoinham, ME). Platinum needle electrodes (Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI) were inserted subcutaneously just behind the test ear (recording), at the vertex (reference), and in the back (ground). Responses were differentially amplified and digitally filtered using BIOSIG open source software running on a PC. Sine wave stimuli of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 56.6 kHz, having a 5 ms total duration, including 0.5 ms rise/fall times were generated digitally using SIGGEN in combination with an AP2 microprocessor, and converted using a 200 kHz D/A rate. Stimuli were presented using an ES1 electrostatic speaker located 7 cm directly lateral to either ear, concentric with the external auditory meatus. Stimuli were presented free field and calibrated using an ACO Pacific 7016&#x000bc; inch microphone placed where the external auditory meatus would normally be. Stimuli at each frequency and level were presented 1,000 times at 20/sec. The minimum sound pressure level required for detection of a response was determined using a 5 dB minimum step size.

While melanosomes in normal retinas were typically ovoid in shape and localized to the apical cytoplasm, these structures were prominent in the mid to basal cytoplasm and were distinguished by their round shape. Although similar small structures were seen in control eyes at 30&#x02013;45 weeks, they were seen at younger ages and appeared larger and more numerous in the mutant eyes. Lysosomal storage was also seen in the sclera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000772-g010">Fig. 10F, G</xref>) and ciliary body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000772-g010">Fig. 10H, I</xref>) of MPS IIIB mice. Inclusions were first apparent by 8 weeks of age with increasing accumulation and disruption of the tissues by 30 weeks. The ciliary body included round, dense melanosome-like structures, similar to those seen in the RPE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Motor function and Purkinje cell loss</title><p>In humans with MPS IIIB, the loss of ability to walk has long been described and histological studies have revealed a loss of Purkinje cells in addition to the accumulation of lysosomal inclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Ferrer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The MPS IIIB mouse, as described above, also develops difficulty with coordination as measured by the rocking rotarod technique, though the effect is not as dramatic as is seen in humans. Joint stiffness, which has been described in affected children, may contribute to changes in motor or sensorimotor functions in the MPS IIIB mice. However, the lack of performance differences between MPS IIIB and normal mice between the constant speed or accelerating conditions of the rotarod test argues against joint stiffness as a major source of coordination deficits. The significant progressive loss of Purkinje cells likely contributes to the performance deficits on the rocking rotarod, though the additional contribution of structural and neuronal deficits in the vestibular apparatus has not been ascertained. However, the absence of significant Purkinje cell deficits in the archicerebellum is consistent with a relatively normal central vestibular system. Our assessment of Purkinje cells was limited to the vermis while the cerebrocerebellum was not assessed. The decrease in neuronal counts seen near the midline in the paleocerebellum and neocerebellum would be expected to result in deficits in muscle tone and coordination. Consistent with this, MPS IIIB mice have a visibly altered posture and a wide gait, and although coordination performance deficits were only detectable under the relatively challenging conditions of the rocking rotarod procedure, they nevertheless represent a measurable motor deficit affecting coordination and/or balance. The deteriorating performance on the rocking rotarod and the progressive loss of Purkinje cells seen in the MPS IIIB mouse represent reasonable parallels with the human disease and will serve as objective measures when evaluating therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Circadian deficits</title><p>Sanfilippo syndrome children demonstrate initial hyperactivity and behavioral disturbances with parents reporting increased nighttime activity. The children subsequently have diminished activity levels but retain the nighttime wakefulness. Measuring MPS IIIB mice using real-time locomotor monitoring during the progression of lysosomal storage, we found alterations in the timing of daily locomotor activity at the earliest ages tested. Mice are normally nocturnal with activity highest during darkness and reduced activity during the light time. The MPS IIIB mice demonstrated a significant increase in light phase activity which is consistent with the increased nighttime activity seen in affected children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Colville1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Fraser1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Mariotti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Fraser2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The total activity level did not significantly differ between MPS IIIB and wild type mice over 70&#x02013;250 days of age. A period of hyperactivity was not observed but may have been missed if it occurred prior to 3 months of age. All mice showed a normal decrease in activity with increasing age.</p><p>Our findings are in contrast to those of prior studies on MPS IIIB mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Li2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Cressant1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and further characterize activity levels. One group tested mice at 2.5 and 4.5 months and found low normal activity at 2.5 months but significantly diminished activity at 4.5 months. This contrasts with the findings of the second group, who found normal activity at 5 weeks and increased activity at 29 weeks. Both of these studies tested mice in an open field rather than a home cage running wheel so activity differences due to contextual change (novelty) cannot be assessed using our methods, although our use of longer assessment periods provides a more accurate index of mouse activity. Both groups also assessed spontaneously-occurring and conditioned anxiety-like behaviors. The first group assessed learning in a Pavlovian fear conditioning test and demonstrated diminished freezing (conditioned anxiety) in response to a tone that had been paired with shock at the older age of 4.5 months. However, no differences in freezing were observed when the mice were placed back into the chamber where they had previously received tone-shock pairings to assess contextual fear conditioning. The second group used the elevated plus-maze test to assess anxiety-like behaviors related to avoidance of open arms of a maze at 18 and 34 weeks and demonstrated reduced anxiety response at both ages. The affect of hearing and vision deficits on anxiety testing was not determined.</p><p>MPS IIIB mice showed the greatest activity level changes in the presence of a light-dark cycle. In constant darkness, the level of and duration of locomotor activity did not differ between genotypes. In a light-dark cycle, the fragmented activity during the light phase and delayed activity onset (phase angle of entrainment) during the dark phase of MPS IIIB mice indicate that the disease preferentially targets the pathways responsible for light responsiveness, with little effect on the mechanisms responsible for circadian rhythm generation in the SCN. This is despite the increased numbers of pyknotic neurons and marked accumulation of inclusions in the cells in the SCN. The preservation of circadian function despite obvious SCN pathology supports previous observations that only a small portion of the SCN suffices to coordinate daily rhythms in locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000772-Kriegsfeld1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. That the MPS IIIB mice also become active later than wild-type mice may indicate deficits in the output pathways from the SCN to brain areas involved in waking behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Auditory deficits</title><p>Middle and inner ear pathology in MPS III are not well described in humans or animals.

Many cochlear cell types showed aberrant lysosomal storage in MPS IIIB mice, including outer sulcus cells and pillar cells of the organ of Corti, most fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, and fibrocytes and interdental cells of the spiral limbus. The wide variety of cochlear cells affected could alter fluid homeostasis and the driving force for receptor currents. Although limited lysosomal storage is found in the organ of Corti in MPS IIIB (none in hair cells), abnormal lysosomal storage within mesothelial cells lining the basilar membrane could alter passive mechanics which could elevate hearing thresholds. MPS IIIB mice feature marked lysosomal storage within receptor and supporting cells of all the vestibular organs. It remains unclear whether this impacts vestibular function.</p><p>The MPS IIIB mouse demonstrates hair cell loss and organ of Corti degeneration in the lower cochlear base. If this finding extends to humans, it holds implications for eventual therapies, in that such degenerative changes are not reversible.

We show that the development of histological changes in the MPS IIIB mouse correlates with the functional changes in balance and vision. We establish that the murine model of MPS IIIB has similar phenotypic manifestations to those seen in the human disease with: altered balance and loss of cerebellar neurons; abnormal sleep patterns and imbalanced day to night activity level; hearing loss; diminished vision and typical inclusions in the RPE. The present study describes the progression of phenotypic changes in the MPS IIIB mouse and sets useful parameters for future assessment of therapies with the mouse model that are reflective of the human disease.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge Shannon Macauley for guidance in the Purkinje cell assessment; Patricia M.
