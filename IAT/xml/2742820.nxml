Two isoforms of HO have been identified in mammals: inducible HO-1 and constitutively expressed HO-2. HO-1 and HO-2 share similar physical and kinetic properties but have different physiological roles and tissue distributions. Unlike HO-1, which lacks cysteine residues, HO-2 contains three Cys-Pro signatures, known as heme regulatory motifs (HRMs), which are known to control processes related to iron and oxidative metabolism in organisms from bacteria to humans. In HO-2, the C-terminal HRMs constitute a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates affinity of the enzyme for heme (Yi, L., and Ragsdale, S. W. (2007) <italic>J. Biol. Chem</italic>. 282, 20156&#x02013;21067). Here, we demonstrate that the thiol/disulfide switch in human HO-2 is physiologically relevant. Its redox potential was measured to be &#x02212;200 mV, which is near the ambient intracellular redox potential. We expressed HO-2 in bacterial and human cells and measured the redox state of the C-terminal HRMs in growing cells by thiol-trapping experiments using the isotope-coded affinity tag technique. Under normal growth conditions, the HRMs are 60&#x02013;70% reduced, whereas oxidative stress conditions convert most (86&#x02013;89%) of the HRMs to the disulfide state. Treatment with reductants converts the HRMs largely (81&#x02013;87%) to the reduced dithiol state. Thus, the thiol/disulfide switch in HO-2 responds to cellular oxidative stress and reductive conditions, representing a paradigm for how HRMs can integrate heme homeostasis with CO signaling and redox regulation of cellular metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">R21HL089837</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">GM065318</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">AG027349</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Heme oxygenase (HO<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> ; EC 1.14.99.3) catalyzes the O<sub>2</sub>- and NADPH-dependent conversion of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron in a reaction that is coupled to cytochrome P450 reductase. Then, biliverdin reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of biliverdin to the antioxidant bilirubin. Several recent reviews on HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and biliverdin reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) are available. HO is present in organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes and, as the only known enzyme that can degrade heme, plays a critical role in heme and iron homeostasis.</p><p>There are two major HO isoforms in mammals: inducible HO-1, which is ancient and widely distributed among organisms from bacteria to man, and constitutively expressed HO-2, which emerged 250 million years ago with the amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). HO-1 is found in most tissues and is highly expressed in spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Conversely, HO-2 has a narrow tissue distribution, exhibiting high expression levels in the brain, testes, and carotid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Both HO-1 and HO-2 catalyze the NADPH- and cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent degradation of heme to CO, iron, and biliverdin, which is quickly reduced to bilirubin in the presence of biliverdin reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Controlling cellular heme concentrations is crucial because heme is required as a prosthetic group by regulatory and redox proteins, yet concentrations higher than 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> free heme are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, as the only mammalian proteins known to degrade heme, HOs play a key role in cellular heme homeostasis; furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of cellular and tissue injuries, such as oxidative stress and hemin-induced cytotoxicity, indicate that HO is cytoprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>HO-1 and HO-2 share high sequence and three-dimensional structural homology in their core domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); however, their sequences diverge near their C termini, in which HO-2 contains two conserved heme regulatory motifs (HRMs), involving Cys<sup>265</sup> in HRM1 and Cys<sup>282</sup> in HRM2<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

By expressing HO-2 in bacterial and human cells and trapping the thiols using the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) technique, it was shown that the redox state of the C-terminal HRMs in growing cells responds to the cellular redox state. The disulfide state is favored under oxidative conditions, and the dithiol state is predominant under reducing conditions. Thus, the HRMs act as a molecular rheostat that responds to the ambient intracellular redox potential and, based on earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), controls activity of HO-2 by regulating heme binding to the enzyme.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human HO-2</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were performed using a truncated form of HO-2 (HO-2&#x00394;289&#x02013;316, denoted HO-2<sub>t</sub> here) that lacks the C-terminal membrane-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whereas the full-length protein was used for experiments with growing cells.

The activity of the F253W variant is &#x0223c;2-fold lower than that of HO-2<sub>t</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.015651/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), indicating that major structural changes have not occurred by the replacement of Phe with Trp at this position.

When solutions of the F253W variant are equilibrated at different redox potentials, set by establishing a gradient of GSSG/GSH ratios as described above, the fluorescence intensity is quenched by the disulfide bond. Fitting the data to the Nernst equation provides a midpoint reduction potential of &#x02212;200 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Thus, both thiol modification and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments provide similar values of &#x02212;190 to &#x02212;200 mV for the midpoint potential of the thiol/disulfide redox switch in HO-2<sub>t</sub>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8"><sup>7</sup></xref> This value is within the range of redox potentials for proteins known to catalyze key thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase reactions, from &#x02212;122 mV for the oxidase DsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) to &#x02212;270 mV for the reductase thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

ICAT consists of an iodoacetamide group linked to a cleavable biotin affinity tag via an isotopically light (<sup>12</sup>C) or heavy (<sup>13</sup>C) nine-carbon linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Before initiating experiments with growing cells, we performed the OxICAT analysis on pure HO-2. To determine the redox status of freshly purified protein, we treated HO-2<sub>t</sub> with the light ICAT reagent, reduced all existing oxidative thiol modifications, and alkylated all newly reduced thiols with heavy ICAT. Thus, a peptide containing a free Cys thiol(ate) will have an <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value that is 9 units smaller than one containing a Cys that is engaged in a disulfide bond. Mass spectral analysis of the affinity-purified tryptic peptide harboring HRM1 and HRM2 (Peptide A, residues 264&#x02013;285) generated from as-isolated HO-2 reveals peaks at 2858.9, 2868.0 (+9), and 2877.0 (+18), with the major peak at 2877.0, resulting from labeling with two heavy ICAT molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, the majority of the as-isolated protein contains cysteines in HRM1 and HRM2 that are engaged in an intramolecular disulfide bond. In contrast, when HO-2 is reduced by TCEP before the OxICAT procedure, the light ICAT-labeled peptide is in significantly greater abundance. Thus, the cysteines of HRM1 and HRM2 in purified HO-2 are mainly (90.6%) in the disulfide state, and TCEP converts the HRMs nearly quantitatively (94.2%) to the dithiol state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This result indicates that HO-2 is highly oxidation-sensitive and accumulates in its disulfide bond form when reducing agents are absent during its purification.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>OxICAT analysis of the redox state of the C-terminal HRMs in purified HO-2.</bold> Purified HO-2<sub>t</sub> was treated as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; <italic>Top panel</italic>, as-isolated HO-2<sub>t</sub>. <italic>Bottom panel</italic>, TCEP-reduced HO-2<sub>t</sub>, generated by incubating 100 &#x003bc;g HO-2<sub>t</sub> with 1 m<sc>m</sc> TCEP for 30 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0340983050003"/></fig><p>The minor peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 2868.0 (+9) in the as-isolated protein is likely caused by the presence of a small amount of the sulfenate (S-OH) of Cys<sup>265</sup> in the sample. The peak has a +9 value of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> because the S-OH does not react with iodoacetamide; however, TCEP reduces the S-OH to the SH in the second step of the OxICAT protocol. Furthermore, the intermediate band shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> is probably caused by a small amount of Cys-sulfenate in the sample (see above). Similarly, a sulfenate intermediate was reported in OxICAT analysis of Hsp33 and GapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Our assignment of Cys<sup>265</sup>-S-OH is consistent with earlier studies involving the C127A/C282A HO-2<sub>t</sub> variant, in which the sulfenate of Cys<sup>265</sup> was trapped as an adduct with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and was identified as the sulfonate by mass spectrometry; thus, we proposed that the sulfenate of Cys<sup>265</sup> is an intermediate in the formation of the disulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the thiol/disulfide switch in HO-2 responds to changes in intracellular redox conditions, full-length HO-2 was expressed in human and <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells, and the redox states of the HRMs were determined by the OxICAT method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) (also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.015651/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.015651/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>). When <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was grown under aerobic conditions, the C-terminal HRMs were distributed nearly equally between the reduced (63%) and oxidized (37%) states, which corresponds well with the determined redox potential of HO-2<sub>t</sub>, suggesting that truncation of the membrane-spanning region has little effect on the thiol/disulfide redox potential and that HO-2 is in equilibrium with the cellular GSSG/GSH ratio. The proportion of reduced HRMs increased to 75.0% or 87.0% when cells were grown either anaerobically or treated with 1 m<sc>m</sc> NAC, respectively.

We found that HO-2 expression levels are unaffected by alteration in the cellular redox state (or growth in excess heme); however, the thiol/disulfide switch does exhibit a robust response to redox conditions. When cells are exposed to oxidative conditions, the Cys residues in the C-terminal HRMs in HO-2 are in the disulfide state, which favors heme binding; however, under reducing conditions, the lower affinity dithiol state predominates. Thus, these HRMs of HO-2 act as a redox rheostat, which regulates the binding of heme and, therefore, HO-2 activity as a Nernstian function of the redox state of the cell. Under oxidative stress conditions, HO-2 can degrade heme rapidly, increasing the levels of CO and biliverdin; however, under hypoxic (or otherwise reduced) conditions, where the HRMs are in the dithiol state, the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> (0.35 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) rises well above the free heme pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This redox switching mechanism could potentially connect the many physiological processes regulated by heme homeostasis and CO signaling to the cellular redox state. Such processes include oxygen sensing by the carotid body (the oxygen chemosensor in mammals), regulation of T cell function, blockade of oxidant formation in neurons where HO-2 appears to be the sole source of CO biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), and control of heme homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Our results also suggest that the myriad proposed functions ascribed to HRM/heme interactions in various proteins might actually be mediated by thiol/disulfide redox reactions. Thus, HO-2 may represent a paradigm for how HRMs can integrate heme, CO, and redox regulation of metabolism.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_31_20556__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.015651_Suppdata.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants R21HL089837 (to S.
