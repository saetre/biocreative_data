Currently there is an intense interest in characterizing the function of the different classes of noncoding RNAs and their relevance to human disease. Using genomic approaches we discovered <italic>FMR4</italic>, a primate-specific noncoding RNA transcript (2.4 kb) that resides upstream and likely shares a bidirectional promoter with <italic>FMR1</italic>. <italic>FMR4</italic> is a product of RNA polymerase II and has a similar half-life to <italic>FMR1.</italic> The CGG expansion in the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> appears to affect transcription in both directions as we found <italic>FMR4</italic>, similar to <italic>FMR1</italic>, to be silenced in fragile X patients and up-regulated in premutation carriers. Knockdown of <italic>FMR4</italic> by several siRNAs did not affect <italic>FMR1</italic> expression, nor <italic>vice versa</italic>, suggesting that <italic>FMR4</italic> is not a direct regulatory transcript for <italic>FMR1</italic>. However, <italic>FMR4</italic> markedly affected human cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>; siRNAs knockdown of <italic>FMR4</italic> resulted in alterations in the cell cycle and increased apoptosis, while the overexpression of <italic>FMR4</italic> caused an increase in cell proliferation. Collectively, our results demonstrate an antiapoptotic function of <italic>FMR4</italic> and provide evidence that a well-studied genomic locus can show unexpected functional complexity.

RNAs which do not code for proteins (noncoding RNAs) have been classified into different classes (tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, miRNA, siRNA, piRNA, natural antisense transcripts and long noncoding RNA) based on their size and function. Novel classes of noncoding RNAs have been shown to have a variety of functions which include translational inhibition (miRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Bartel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, mRNA degradation (siRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Fire1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and repressing transposition (piRNA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Carmell1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Houwing1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

There is no overlap between the <italic>FMR1</italic> and <italic>FMR4</italic> transcripts, and therefore, <italic>FMR4</italic> is not a natural antisense transcript to <italic>FMR1</italic>. <italic>FMR4</italic> is expressed in human adult and fetal tissues, and in several regions of human and rhesus monkey adult brain but at varying concentrations. Despite the likelihood that <italic>FMR4</italic> shares a bidirectional promoter with <italic>FMR1, FMR4</italic> is not expressed in the adult testes, ovary and prostate where <italic>FMR1</italic> is highly expressed. It is possible however that <italic>FMR4</italic> is expressed in these tissues during embryonic and/or fetal development as the RNAs used in our experiments from these tissues (testes, ovary, and prostate) were obtained from human adults. Notably, we found <italic>FMR4</italic> to be highly expressed in fetal heart and kidney. The cardiac expression of <italic>FMR4</italic> may possibly be of functional relevance considering the fact that many patients with fragile X syndrome exhibit heart defects such as dilation of the aortic root and mitral valve prolapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Sreeram1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Waldstein1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover the high expression of <italic>FMR4</italic> in the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001486-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) appears consistent with our observations that the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, also expresses <italic>FMR4.</italic></p><p>Bioinformatics analysis shows that the genomic sequence encompassing <italic>FMR4</italic> is conserved in other primates (chimp and rhesus monkey) with only partial homology to the mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001486.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Interestingly, however, there is an apparent transcript in the mouse X chromosome that is on the minus strand that starts approximately 100 bp upstream of the mouse <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene. This transcript (NCBI accession number AK148387) does not have significant homology with the human <italic>FMR4</italic> transcript (&#x0223c;3&#x00025; nucleotide identity by ClustalW using default analysis parameters for nucleotide sequences).&#x000a0;Furthermore, this mouse transcript appears to be highly spliced and contains 4 exons, which is an additional distinction from the human <italic>FMR4</italic> transcript. However, we can not rule out that <italic>FMR4</italic> and AK148387, despite their genomic differences, still perform a similar function. The majority of noncoding RNAs identified to date seem to be poorly conserved even among mammals; this is in contrast to other noncoding RNAs (<italic>e.g</italic>., microRNAs and snoRNAs) which show a high level of conservation among diverse species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Pang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the involvement of poorly studied protein coding gene(s) within the <italic>FMR1</italic> genomic locus cannot be excluded at this time, our results suggest that the <italic>FMR4</italic> function involves a noncoding mechanism. Recently, a long noncoding RNA, similar in size to <italic>FMR4</italic>, was identified in the <italic>HOXC</italic> locus (<italic>HOTAIR</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Rinn1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore possible that <italic>FMR4</italic> may also target a set of genes <italic>in trans</italic> resulting in its antiapoptotic properties. In conclusion, our findings should add further evidence that novel nonconserved noncoding RNAs may be functional and that they do not simply represent &#x0201c;transcriptional noise&#x0201d;.</p><p>While our manuscript was under review, Ladd <italic>et al.</italic> published on an antisense transcript that spans the CGG repeats in the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Ladd1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. This transcript, <italic>ASFMR1</italic>, is up-regulated in premutation carriers and shut down in fragile X patients similar to <italic>FMR1</italic> and <italic>FMR4</italic>. Also, one splice variant of <italic>ASFMR1</italic> overlaps with <italic>FMR4</italic>, therefore it is possible that <italic>FMR4</italic> is nested in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>ASFMR1</italic>, a phenomenon seems to be prevalent in many genes throughout mammalian genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001486-Carninci1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> or another possibility is that these two transcripts may also have contiguous isoforms which is another intriguing possibility. <italic>ASFMR1</italic> appears to be highly spliced and has multiple transcription start sites. One transcription start site is in intron 2 of <italic>FMR1</italic> at position &#x0002b;10243. This transcription start site was identified by utilizing a 5&#x02032; RACE primer in exon 1 of <italic>FMR1</italic>. Also, multiple transcription start sites for <italic>ASFMR1</italic> were also identified in &#x02212;99 to &#x02212;208 upstream of <italic>FMR1</italic> by designing 5&#x02032; RACE primers in the &#x02212;1000 position relative to <italic>FMR1</italic>. From these experiments it is not clear if the transcript which starts in the &#x0002b;10243 is the same transcript as the one that initiates in the &#x02212;99 to &#x02212;208. If these two transcripts were both <italic>ASFMR1</italic>, the authors should have been able to clone the longer transcript which initiates at &#x0002b;10243 using the 5&#x02032; RACE primers which they used to identify the multiple transcription start sites in the &#x02212;99 to &#x02212;208 positions. Therefore, another possibility is that one of the transcripts that Ladd <italic>et al.</italic> cloned and identified as an alternative transcript to <italic>ASFMR1</italic> is the <italic>FMR4</italic> transcript. In essence, our findings along with Ladd <italic>et al.</italic> suggest a complex transcription within the <italic>FMR1</italic> locus than previously thought and should provide an incentive for further studies to determine the exact nature of all the transcripts, and their function, throughout the <italic>FMR1</italic> region and their relevance to <italic>FMR1</italic>-associated human disorders (fragile X syndrome and FXTAS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)</title><p>The genomic sequence for <italic>FMR1</italic> locus was obtained from the UCSC website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>).

We added 14 &#x000b5;l of the probe per 5 ml of hybridization buffer (42 &#x000b5;l total) to the membrane for overnight incubation at 42 C. Two low-stringency and two high-stringency washes were performed for 15 minutes each prior to exposing the membrane for phosphor imager.</p></sec><sec id="s4d2"><title>Cell culture, siRNA transfection and RNA isolation</title><p>HEK-293T and N2A cells were cultured in MEM plus 10&#x00025; FBS. Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were transfected with 20 nM of siRNA using 0.2&#x00025; Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated for 72 h or transfected a second time for an additional 72 hours prior to RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). All samples were treated with RNAse-free DNase (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, #79254) for 20 minutes as described in the manufacturer's protocol.

Twenty-four h later, cells were treated with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml of &#x003b1;-amanitin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were harvested for RNA isolation and RT-PCR at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours post treatment. Three independent samples were taken for each data point and all samples had untreated matching samples for RNA purification and data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d5"><title>Cell proliferation assay</title><p>Using Multidrop 384Titan, 50 ng of PGL3 vector (luciferase vector with SV40 promoter), 20 nM of siRNA and transfection reagents (Lipofectamine 2000 0.2&#x00025; and OptiMEM, Invitrogen, CA) were plated in 96 well plates. Equal number of cells (20,000 per well) were added to each well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 hours. Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Luciferase activity, as a marker of cell proliferation, was measured by Analyst GT Multimode Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and plotted against control siRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4d6"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>We knocked down <italic>FMR4</italic> using two different siRNAs (4 repeats each), and we used a control negative siRNA (4 repeats also) to examine the effects of <italic>FMR4</italic> on the cell cycle. At 72 hours post transfection, we prepared the cells for flow cytometry as follow: cells were washed with PBS, trypsynized and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then the cells were washed again with PBS before being fixed with 70&#x00025; ethanol at &#x02212;20C overnight. The next day the cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS and re-suspended in 38 mM sodium citrate, 69 &#x000b5;M propidium iodide and 19 &#x000b5;g/ml RNAse A for flow cytometry analysis.
