The most pathogenic <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains (i.e., the so-called type I strains) associate the CagA virulence protein with an active VacA cytotoxin but the rationale for this association is unknown. CagA, directly injected by the bacterium into colonized epithelium via a type IV secretion system, leads to cellular morphological, anti-apoptotic and proinflammatory effects responsible in the long-term (years or decades) for ulcer and cancer. VacA, via pinocytosis and intracellular trafficking, induces epithelial cell apoptosis and vacuolation. Using human gastric epithelial cells in culture transfected with cDNA encoding for either the wild-type 38 kDa C-terminal signaling domain of CagA or its non-tyrosine-phosphorylatable mutant form, we found that, depending on tyrosine-phosphorylation by host kinases, CagA inhibited VacA-induced apoptosis by two complementary mechanisms. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA prevented pinocytosed VacA to reach its target intracellular compartments. Unphosphorylated CagA triggered an anti-apoptotic activity blocking VacA-induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level without affecting the intracellular trafficking of the toxin. Assaying the level of apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells infected with wild-type CagA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/VacA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>H. pylori</italic> or isogenic mutants lacking of either CagA or VacA, we confirmed the results obtained in cells transfected with the CagA C-ter constructions showing that CagA antagonizes VacA-induced apoptosis. VacA toxin plays a role during <italic>H. pylori</italic> stomach colonization. However, once bacteria have colonized the gastric niche, the apoptotic action of VacA might be detrimental for the survival of <italic>H. pylori</italic> adherent to the mucosa. CagA association with VacA is thus a novel, highly ingenious microbial strategy to locally protect its ecological niche against a bacterial virulence factor, with however detrimental consequences for the human host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The gram-negative bacterium <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is the main causative agent of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer in humans.

In this paper, we show that the <italic>H. pylori</italic> CagA protein counteracts, by two distinct non-overlapping mechanisms, the apoptotic activity of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> VacA toxin on human gastric epithelial cells so as to allow a protection of the bacterium niche against VacA, giving a rationale for the association of these two virulence factors in the most pathogenic <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains. This is a new, highly ingenious mechanism by which a bacterium locally protects its ecological niche against the action of one of its own virulence factors. However, while exerting a beneficial role for survival and growth of the bacterium by counteracting VacA toxin, CagA injection in the gastric epithelial cells triggers proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic responses which are detrimental for the human host in the long-term and favor the development of ulcer and cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is responsible for gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers but is also a high risk factor for the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid-like tissue (MALT) lymphoma as well as gastric adenocarcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Peek1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains have been classified by the presence or the absence of two virulence factors, namely: an active vacuolating toxin VacA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Cover1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and a 40-kbp pathogenicity island (<italic>cag</italic> PAI) encoding the 120&#x02013;145 kDa immunodominant protein termed cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) as well as a type IV secretion system (TFSS) that injects CagA into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Backert1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Importantly, different effects have been observed depending on the occurrence of phosphorylation by the Src kinase family (SKF) of tyrosine residues contained within EPIYA motifs located in the C-terminal 35&#x02013;45 kDa part of CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Backert1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Backert2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The 38 kDa C-terminal part of the CagA from <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain 26695 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Tomb1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> contains 2 consensus EPIYA motifs (named A and C, respectively) that may be tyrosine-phosphorylated by SKF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Selbach2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study we used only the C-terminal signaling part of CagA since, while the 100 kDa N-terminal domain of the protein is important for determining its intracellular localization, the CagA C-terminal domain is normally phosphorylated by SKF and fully able to reproduce the effects of phosphorylated full-length CagA independently of the presence of the N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Bagnoli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that by preventing EPIYA phosphorylation through site-directed mutagenesis of its tyrosine residues we would preserve only the phosphorylation-independent effects of CagA. We thus mutated the tyrosine residues contained within the two EPIYA motifs into glycine (GFP-CagA C-ter mut) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000603.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Then, we tested the effects of the wt and mut constructions in human gastric epithelial AGS cells. Upon transfection of these DNA constructs into cultured AGS cells, the resulting proteins were expressed at their expected molecular sizes. They reacted with both the anti-GFP and anti-CagA antibodies and exhibited a roughly similar repartition between membrane and cytosolic fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000603.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The GFP-CagA C-ter was associated almost equally between the membrane and cytosolic fractions (differently from the GFP molecule alone that was mainly cytosolic) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000603.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This is in agreement with the observation that a single EPIYA motif favors the recruitment of CagA to the plasma membrane, independently of its tyrosine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Higashi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, the GFP-CagA C-ter wt was tyrosine-phosphorylated whereas the mutated form was not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000603.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). As previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Segal1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Bagnoli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, the CagA C-ter wt greatly increased the number of cells showing the characteristic elongated hummingbird phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), due to deactivation of SKF by the tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Selbach1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Tsutsumi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect was not observed in cells transfected with the GFP-CagA C-ter mut, albeit the fusion protein was expressed at a same level than the wt form in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In AGS cells transfected with the GFP-CagA C-ter wt, only a slight increase in the basal level of NF-kB p65-Rel nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and no IL-8 chemokine response were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This is in agreement with the previous finding that the CagA C-ter domain does not fully reproduce the phosphorylation-independent effects of the full-length CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Bagnoli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, when the GFP-CagA C-ter mut was transfected into cells, a massive translocation of NF-kB p65-Rel into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and a robust IL-8 response were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000603-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as reported previously for CagA injected into gastric cells by the <italic>H. pylori</italic> TFSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Tsutsumi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This result validated the use of the GFP-CagA-C-ter mut construct to obtain the cell effects of CagA independent of its phosphorylation. Finally, we tested whether our CagA C-ter constructs were able to decrease the activation of the c-Src kinase as previously reported for CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Selbach1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In AGS cells transfected with either the wt or the mut form of CagA C-ter, we measured the phosphorylation level of the tyrosine 416 of c-Src. Indeed, tyrosine 416 phosphorylation is required for the activation of the Src kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Hubbard1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Roskoski1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Likely, the drop of SKF activity by the phosphorylated form of CagA blocked a critical step necessary for the motility of VacA-containing compartments to reach its intracellular targets. Using the pan SKF inhibitor PP2 we have shown that, as for the transfection of cells with the GFP-CagA C-ter wt, PP2 blocked the exit of VacA-containing vesicles from GEECs resulting in protection against apoptosis induced by the toxin. These findings indicated that VacA trafficking from GEECs to intracellular targets is controlled by SKF. Restriction of VacA to GEECs, by treatment with CD after the first step of cytotoxin endocytosis, not only decreased the cell vacuolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Gauthier2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> but also both MTP drop and apoptosis induced by VacA (this study).</p><p>One study hypothesized that VacA may act only indirectly on mitochondria to release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> taking that i) isolated mitochondria incubated with VacA had a drop in the MTP but apparently no release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, and ii) in cells incubated with VacA the cytosolic proapoptotic factor Bax was activated while no colocalization between mitochondria and the toxin was found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Yamasaki1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, a possible mechanism for VacA-induced mitochondrial damage could be the following: via endosomes propelled by actin polymerization, VacA is transferred to mitochondria (either directly by membrane-to-membrane contacts or after release into the cytosol followed by importation into mitochondria) where full-length VacA or its p37 N-terminal domain translocates to the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM)/matrix of the organelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Galmiche1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Blanke1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

More recently, the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl1 has been shown to be upregulated, through activation of the NF-kB pathway, specifically by the unphosphorylated form of CagA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Mimuro2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study we have been unable to demonstrate that the C-ter domain of CagA might significantly up- or down-regulate Bcl2, Bcl-xL or Mcl1. Nevertheless, overexpression of Bcl2 and, although to a lesser extent, Mcl1 clearly afforded a protection against VacA-induced apoptosis in both AGS and MKN28 cells mimicking the action of unphosphorylated CagA. Interestingly, it has been quite recently reported that, in nonmyeloid cells, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> was able to induce mitochondrial-dependent cell death but, at the same time, the bacterium was also triggering a prosurvival Nod1-dependent Rip2/IKK&#x003b2;/NF-kB signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Carneiro1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. However, activation of the NF-kB pathway was not acting by increasing the expression level of Bcl2 family members, but rather preventing Bcl2 expression drop during bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Carneiro1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar effect might take place during <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and Bcl2 and Mcl1 might be the anti-apoptotic factors involved in CagA action against VacA-induced apoptosis.</p><p>It is well known that CagA is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated after its injection into host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Backert1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Backert2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Hatakeyama1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. At difference, production of IL-8 by the unphosphorylated form of CagA appears to be a very late event (starting after 24 h of infection) upon cell infection by <italic>H. pylori</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Brandt1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the earliest mechanism for CagA-dependent inhibition of VacA-induced apoptosis would likely rely on the activity of the phosphorylated form of CagA. Indeed, blocking the trafficking of VacA would be an efficient mechanism for its neutralization. In agreement with that possibility, it has been demonstrated that injection of CagA into cells was strongly decreasing the vacuolating activity of the toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Argent1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Vacuolation induced by VacA is an early event and depends on the transfer of the cytotoxin to LEs. In the present study, we have shown that the phosphorylated form of CagA was indeed blocking the trafficking of the pinocytosed VacA and reduced the cell vacuolation induced by the cytotoxin. We have here also shown that blocking the motility of VacA-containing endosomes also decreased both MTP drop and apoptosis provoked by VacA and, interestingly, abolished the colocalization of the cytotoxin with mitochondria. These observations indicate that both the trafficking to LEs and to mitochondria necessitates an actin-driven vesicle activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Gauthier2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, even if the large majority of pinocytosed VacA is prevented to reach its intracellular targets by the protection pathway dependent on tyrosine-phophorylated CagA, also a very small amount of cytotoxin molecules reaching mitochondria could be enough to significantly activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway during the course of infection. Apoptosis could be efficiently counteracted by activation of the NF-kB pathway allowing the upregulation of anti-apoptotic factor(s) (together with the production of IL-8). IL-8 production, a bystander of the NF-kB activation triggered by unphosphorylated CagA, is detectabled only after 24 h of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Brandt1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that this kind of CagA-dependent protection against VacA-induced apoptosis is probably a later event during cell infection by <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Thus the combination of an earlier event (due to phosphorylated CagA), preventing most VacA molecules to reach mitochondria (and LEs), with a later event (due to unphosphorylated CagA), directly blocking the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, would constitute a clever and highly efficient system for protecting the cells against VacA-induced apoptosis.</p><p>Apparently, the VacA toxin plays a role during <italic>H. pylori</italic> stomach colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Salama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, once bacteria have colonized the gastric niche, the apoptotic action of VacA might be detrimental for the survival of <italic>H. pylori</italic> adherent to the mucosa. By injecting CagA into the colonized host cells, protection against VacA apoptosis would be afforded with great efficiency. In addition, as recently proposed, the anti-apoptotic activity of CagA might also dampen epithelial gastric cell renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Mimuro2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> whereas VacA would decrease the CagA-induced cell scattering and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Tegtmeyer1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in this scenario the VacA toxin could still diffuse at distance from the bacteria colonizing the surface gastric epithelium to decrease, for instance, both the innate and adaptive immune response of the host against <italic>H. pylori</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Sewald1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. This might finally explain the virtually constant association of an active VacA toxin with CagA in highly pathogenic <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains. CagA association with VacA is thus a novel, highly ingenious microbial strategy to locally protect its ecological niche against a bacterial virulence factor, with however detrimental consequences for the human host. Indeed, by exerting proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, CagA favors, in the long-term, the occurrence of the most severe gastric diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacteria, VacA purification, human gastric epithelial cells, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>The <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain 26695 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000603-Tomb1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> was a gift of R.

For studying VacA endocytosis, cells were incubated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml acid-activated purified VacA for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After extensive washing, cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in pre-warmed DMEM w/o FBS (for AGS cells) or Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; for MKN 28 cells) for 30 or 120 min in the absence of ammonium chloride or, to allow vacuole development, for 4 h in the presence of 5 mM ammonium chloride. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence analysis. All the pictures shown represent single confocal sections. When the effect of the SKF inhibitor PP2 on VacA internalization and intracellular trafficking was investigated, cells were preincubated with 10 &#x000b5;M PP2 at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min before being exposed to VacA as described above, and the drug was maintained throughout the experiments. To investigate VacA internalization and intracellular trafficking in each transfection condition, by means of extensive confocal microscopy analysis of slides from at least 3 different experiments we calculated the percentage of either cells exhibiting cytoplasmic vacuoles (a widely accepted functional readout for the presence of VacA in the late endosomal compartment) or cells exhibiting the VacA-associated fluorescence strictly limited at the cell periphery (i.e., likely in the GEECs only) or, on the contrary, in the perinuclear area (i.e., cells deeply internalizing VacA). In addition, by means of colocalization and cell counter plugins of ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), in some experiments VacA intracellular trafficking to LEs was evaluated by calculating, in variously treated or control cells, the percentage of LAMP1-positive vesicles (i.e., LEs) containing VacA. When the effect of CD treatment on VacA trafficking to mitochondria and on toxin-induced alteration of mitochondrial morphology, DsRed-Mito-transfected AGS cells were incubated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml activated Cy5-VacA for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing, cells were allowed to internalize the toxin into GEECs by incubation for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM w/o FBS (and without ammonium chloride supplementation), then CD (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml) was added or not and the cells were further incubated for 3 h. After fixation, cells were observed at the confocal microscope. To investigate the effect of CD treatment on VacA-induced MTP drop, MKN 28 cells grown on glass-bottomed dishes were incubated with VacA (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C to allow toxin entry into GEECs, washed and incubated for further 105 min with HBSS (without ammonium chloride supplementation) in the absence or presence of CD (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml). Relative MTP was then measured by using the ratiometric potential-sensitive dye JC-1 (5,5&#x02032;,6,6&#x02032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x02032;,3,3&#x02032;-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; from Molecular Probes).

Mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio which depends only on MTP and not on other factors such as mitochondrial size, shape and density. JC-1 (6 &#x000b5;M) was added to the cells during the last 15 min of incubation and, after washing, cells were immediately analyzed at the confocal microscope.
