Both pharmacological and molecular cloning studies have indicated the existence of multiple subtypes of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs including &#x003b1;<sub>1A/C</sub>-AR, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-AR, and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs play a key role in a variety of physiological processes, such as contraction of vascular and cardiac muscle, contraction of the spleen, liver glycogenesis, or melatonin secretion in the pineal gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Activation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR promotes hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently it has been shown that all three subtypes of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR are also expressed in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and their activation with norepinephrine stimulates migration, proliferation and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, norepinephrine increased SMC hypertrophy, but not DNA synthesis, through &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation in uninjured aorta whereas norepinephrine stimulated proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts through the &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-AR subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Nonvascular fibroblasts, including cardiac fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], generally do not express &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR and have been used for stable transfection of different subtypes of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR to study their respective functions. However, a recent study showed the expression of a functional &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR in primary tendon fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In rat-1 cells, a transformed cell line from embryonic fibroblast, expressing different subtypes of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR, phenylephrine (PE), an &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR agonist, activates phospholipase D and releases arachidonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, unlike SMC, activation of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs in rat-1 cells also increases cAMP levels and PKA activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR is more efficiently coupled to phospholipase D activation, arachidonic acid release and cAMP than &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-AR or &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-AR in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Activation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR expressed in COS-7 and HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-AR or &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-AR in COS and CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also increase cAMP levels. In HepG2 and M12 cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>-AR, PE causes cell scattering and inhibits proliferation through activation of MAP kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The family of connective tissue cells includes fibroblasts, cartilage cells, bone cells, fat cells and smooth muscle cells. Fibroblasts seem to be able to transform into any of other members of the family &#x02013; in some cases reversibly &#x02013; although it is not clear whether this is a property of a single type of fibroblast that is pluripotent or of a mixture of distinct types of fibroblasts with more restricted potentials. These transformations of connective tissue cell type are regulated by the composition of the surrounding extracellular matrix, by cell shape, and by hormones and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Heterologous expression of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs in CHO cells inhibits basal and growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis, in contrast to the &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A recent study in the same model has reported cAMP as the mediator of the antiproliferative effect of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that activation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR with PE in rat-1 cells affects their growth and/or differentiation status. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effect of PE and cAMP modulators on proliferation, growth and morphology in rat-1 cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs. Moreover, we have examined the effect of PE and cAMP modulators on the expression of cell cycle regulators and muscle cell markers, because of the ability of fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts. Our results show that activation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs in rat-1 cells exerts profound effects promoting hypertrophy and expression of specific smooth muscle cell markers. We also show here that &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced cessation of DNA synthesis is independent of cAMP and involves the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, p27<sup>kip1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR inhibits DNA synthesis at the G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint of the cell cycle in rat-1 fibroblasts</title><p>Rat-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR expressed 288 &#x000b1; 2 fmol/mg protein of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

However, the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtype mediating these effects is not known. Exposure to 5 &#x003bc;M PE for 18 h increased [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine incorporation by 64% (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and decreased basal [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine uptake (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), as shown earlier in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. These effects were blocked by prazosin (PRZ, 100 nM), an &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR antagonist.

Analysis of the effect of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation on cell cycle progression revealed that it inhibits the re-entry of cells from G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>into the S phase of the cell cycle.</p><p>Next we attempted to define the mechanism mediating &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced cell cycle arrest, hypertrophy and differentiation of rat-1 cells. Previous studies have shown that in rat 1-cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs, PE promotes increase in cAMP accumulation and PKA activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since cAMP has been reported to inhibit growth in various cell types, including cells of fibroblastic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it seemed possible that cAMP mediates the inhibitory effect of PE on rat-1 cells proliferation. Stable cAMP analogs or adenylyl cyclase activation promoted cell cycle arrest similar to &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation. However, activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway did not promote hypertrophy or differentiation of rat-1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP/PKA did not reverse the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis. Therefore, &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced cell cycle arrest, hypertrophy and differentiation, is independent of the cAMP/PKA pathway in rat-1 cells. Recently, the cAMP pathway has been implicated in &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced cell cycle arrest in CHO cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The difference between these cell lines may be due to the inhibitory effect of PE on ERK in rat-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] vs. PE-induced ERK activation in CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, the potential effect of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation on CHO cells hypertrophy and differentiation is not known. During our investigation of the possible mechanism by which PE induces cell cycle arrest, we observed that although both PE and FN inhibited DNA synthesis, these two agents produced remarkably different morphological changes in rat-1 cells. FN promoted a change in rat-1 cells to a small, shrinked, round shaped morphology whereas PE shifted the cells to a hypertrophied, enlarged and spindle shaped smooth muscle-like phenotype. This &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced morphological change was again independent of cAMP. Differences between PE and cAMP on different cell functions are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. EGF increases DNA synthesis in rat-1 fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and slightly increased protein synthesis (our data).

Recently, it has been reported that the Cdk inhibitor p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mediates angiotensin II-induced cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy in cultured renal tubular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and induces intestinal epithelial cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present study, stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs increased the expression of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>to a much greater extent than p21<sup>cip1/waf1</sup>, suggesting an important role for the former Cdk inhibitor in the action of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR stimulation. Interestingly, the time of upregulation of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>by PE correlated closely with its effect on inhibition of DNA synthesis, which was maximal at 18 h. Depletion of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>prevented both PE-induced upregulation of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>and reversed PE-induced decrease in DNA synthesis. Therefore, p27<sup>kip1 </sup>plays a central role as a mediator of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and probably hypertrophy and differentiation of rat-1 fibroblasts.</p><p>An important finding in the present study was that PE produced a change in the morphology of rat-1 cells characterized by an increase in cell size. Supporting this phenotypic and hypertrophic change was our demonstration that PE increased global protein synthesis and the expression of markers specific to smooth muscle cells such as smooth muscle actin, caldesmon, and myosin heavy chain. The protein levels of these smooth muscle cell markers were found to remain elevated for up to 48 h, consistent with the PE-induced morphological change that persisted for the same time period. Although stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs shifted rat-1 fibroblasts to SMC/myocyte-like phenotype, it also increased the expression of the helix loop helix protein MyoD, a skeletal muscle-specific regulatory transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Surprisingly, PE also caused an increase in pRb expression to a level similar to p27<sup>kip1</sup>. MyoD has been shown to interact with pRb and to promote muscle gene activation and cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Indeed, pRb has been found to contain a differentiation-promoting activity that is distinct from its cell-cycle progression functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. More recent evidence has indicated an essential role for pRb in promoting functional synergism between MyoD and MEF2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although PE increased the expression of MyoD in our study, the rat-1 cells had a smooth muscle/myocyte-like phenotype. It has been reported that vascular smooth muscle cells can spontaneously adopt the skeletal muscle phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that PE increases expression of MyoD in rat-1 cells during differentiation into myocyte-like cells. However, expression of MyoD is not sufficient for the coordinated program of skeletal myogenesis in smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>PE-induced hypertrophy and differentiation of rat-1 cells was also associated with increased levels of cell cycle proteins pRb, cyclin D1, PCNA and Cdk2 that are important for G<sub>1</sub>/S phase progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These data indicate that stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs promotes the transcriptional/translational activation of the machinery required for G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle progression. However, a simultaneous increase in Cdk inhibitors such as p27<sup>kip1 </sup>prevented DNA synthesis. Elevation of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein level alone is sufficient for induction of cell cycle arrest, independent of cyclins or Cdk level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Surprisingly, PE also increased the protein level of Cdk4, which is normally not affected by mitogenic stimuli. Although the Cdk inhibitors bind to cyclin/Cdk complexes and reduce their activity, their interaction is probably much more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Cdk inhibitors may paradoxically activate these kinases, particularly cyclin D/Cdk4, 6 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism by which stimulation of the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR promotes the up-regulation of Cdk inhibitors (p27<sup>kip1</sup>, p21<sup>cip1/waf1</sup>), smooth muscle cell markers, MyoD, and G<sub>1</sub>/S transition cell cycle proteins (pRb, cyclin D1, PCNA, Cdk2/4) leading to inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of hypertrophy and differentiation is not known. The cAMP/PKA pathway was excluded by our results as well as the ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/PKB pathway, a pro-survival/mitogenic and hypertrophic pathway is also unlikely to be involved, because PE does not stimulate this pathway in rat-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Recently, a study on the genetic profiling of rat-1 fibroblasts expressing different subtypes of &#x003b1;-AR has shown that in cells expressing the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR, epinephrine (one hour stimulation) increased the gene expression of IL-6, gp-130 (an IL-6 high affinity receptor and signal transducer) and STAT-3 (an IL-6 activated transcription factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, in cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenergic receptor, epinephrine also increased IL-6 secretion and STAT-3 Ser<sup>727 </sup>phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that IL-6, gp130, and/or STAT-3 contributes to the upregulation of one or more of the cell cycle associated proteins and smooth muscle cell markers responsible for the cells arrest, hypertrophy and/or differentiation caused by &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR activation in rat-1 cells.</p><p>With regard to functional significance <italic>in vivo</italic>, our model uses a transformed embryonic fibroblast cell line that expresses high levels of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the relevance of these results to fibroblasts in tissues remains to be determined. These features in our model may underlie the ability of PE to cause expression of SMC markers and MyoD through &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs in rat-1 cells promotes cell cycle arrest by increasing levels of Cdk inhibitors and promotes hypertrophy and differentiation into a phenotype having the characteristics of smooth muscle cells by a mechanism independent of cAMP or EGF. Moreover, cell cycle progression was blocked at G<sub>1</sub>/S transition without causing apoptosis, and this cycle arrest was critical for rat-1 cell hypertrophy and differentiation. Reducing p27<sup>kip1 </sup>levels reversed &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-promoted inhibition of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, it shows that cell cycle arrest and differentiation are closely coordinated processes but temporally separable. Further studies are underway in our laboratory to characterize the signaling pathway(s) involved in &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR-induced differentiation of fibroblasts to smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[Methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, Inc.

Cells were subjected to flow cytometric DNA analysis as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, rat-1 cells plated on 100 mm dishes were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS until they reached 80&#x02013;90% confluency. Preconfluent cell cultures were serum-starved for 48 h to stop the mitogenic effect of growth factors. The medium was aspirated and cells were incubated for 18 h with different concentrations of PE. Cells were trypsinized in 1 ml trypsin/EDTA for at least 5 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of serum-containing DMEM. The samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, washed three times in ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min each, resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same solution, and then fixed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol (-20&#x000b0;C) added dropwise. The fixed cells were stored at 4&#x000b0;C until analyzed. Cells were then washed three times by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 3 ml of the BSA buffer. The pellet was then finally resuspended in 1 ml of the BSA buffer to which 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of RNAse A was added to remove interfering RNA, and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide was added to stain DNA.

Cells were rinsed twice in PBS to remove non-adherent cells and then fixed for 10 min in [1:1] methanol-acetone mixture at room temperature. Cells were washed once in distilled water and stained in hematoxylin solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed three times in water, air dried and were finally observed under a phase contrast microscope. Images were captured and saved as TIFF files.

Equal amounts of protein were separated on denaturing SDS/polyacrylamide gel and transferred on nitrocellulose blots (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Life Sciences Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) by electrophoresis. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST, washed three times 5 min each in TBST and then incubated with the indicated specific primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C: p27<sup>kip1</sup>, p21<sup>waf1/cip1</sup>, pRb (Biosource International); caldesmon (smooth muscle), myosin (smooth muscle), &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin, &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma Biosciences); MyoD, cyclin D1, Cdk 2, Cdk 4, PCNA, lamin A/C or vimentin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following incubation, the membranes were washed three times 10 min each in TBST and incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Then the membranes were washed three times 10 min each in TBST. Specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Life Sciences Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed with an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem imaging system (Packard Canberra).
