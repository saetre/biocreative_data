The mechanism of p27 down-regulation in prostate cancers in unknown, but presumably involves increased proteolysis mediated by the SCF<sup>SKP2</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we used the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which undergoes G1 cell cycle arrest in response to androgen, to examine the role of the SKP2 F-box protein in p27 regulation in prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that androgen-induced G1 cell cycle arrest of LNCaP cells coincides with inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity and p27 accumulation caused by reduced p27 ubiquitylation activity. At the same time, androgen decreased expression of SKP2, but did not affect other components of SCF<sup>SKP2</sup>. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SKP2 led to ectopic down-regulation of p27 in asynchronous cells. Furthermore, SKP2 overexpression was sufficient to overcome p27 accumulation in androgen arrested cells by stimulating cellular p27 ubiquitylation activity. This resulted in transient activation of CDK2 activity, but was insufficient to override the androgen-induced G1 block.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies suggest that SKP2 is a major determinant of p27 levels in human prostate cancer cells. Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we suggest that overexpression of SKP2 may be one of the mechanisms that allow prostate cancer cells to escape growth control mediated by p27. Consequently, the SKP2 pathway may be a suitable target for novel prostate cancer therapies.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A plethora of circumstantial evidence implicates downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 in prostate cancer. While greater than 85% of terminally differentiated secretory cells in normal human prostate display strong nuclear staining for p27, all cases of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive carcinoma, and pelvic lymph node metastases studied by DeMarzo <italic>et al.</italic> showed down-regulation of p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, low p27 expression correlates with higher mean Gleason scores, a number of prognostic morphological features, and decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, p27 may be a prostate tumor suppressor.</p><p>In support of this notion, the p27 protein has been identified as a target of viral oncoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, unlike traditional tumor suppressors, the p27 gene rarely shows homozygous inactivation in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], a finding that points towards alternative mechanisms of p27 inactivation.</p><p>p27 specifically inhibits CDKs, which mediate entry into S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The level of p27 is higher in quiescent than in proliferating cells, and this increase in p27 abundance is required for an effective cell cycle exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The cell cycle-dependent variations in p27 levels are not reflected by similar changes in p27 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Many aggressive prostate cancers display decreased p27 protein levels in the presence of high p27 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting that p27 depletion may result from ectopic proteolysis. In fact, p27 depletion in several cancers was shown to result from increased proteolysis via the ubiquitin/proteasome system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>This system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that covalently attach a ubiquitin chain to substrate proteins, thereby targeting them to the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The ubiquitin transfer reaction involves three enzymes: E1, which mediates the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin, and E2, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), which, together with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, transfers ubiquitin to the target protein.</p><p>Biochemical studies identified SCF<sup>SKP2</sup>, an E3 that mediates p27 ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This complex consists of at least four proteins: SKP1, CUL1, HRT1 (=RBX1/ROC1), and SKP2. SKP2 contains a so-called F-box, which mediates binding to SKP1, and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats that recognize p27. CUL1, in turn binds to SKP1, and together with HRT1, mediates the interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34/UBC3. CKS1, a small protein that associates with CDKs and greatly stimulates p27 ubiquitylation, was recently identified as a forth SCF<sup>SKP2</sup> component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Two rate-limiting steps for p27 ubiquitylation were defined: (1.) phosphorylation of p27 by CDK2 at threonine 187 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and (2.) binding of phosphorylated p27 to SKP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. SKP2 is down-regulated in resting cells with stable p27, but strongly up-regulated in cells, which progress into S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In some tissue culture cells, overexpression of SKP2 is sufficient to induce p27 degradation and S phase entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and can cooperate with <italic>ras</italic> in transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Significantly, overexpression of SKP2 has been observed in many cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] as well as in primary cancer specimens and many of these tumors also display down-regulation of p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Here, we used the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] as a model system to address the role of SKP2 in androgen-mediated cell cycle control. This cell line undergoes reversible G1 arrest in response to androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The G1 arrest is accompanied by p27 upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], however the pathway leading to p27 upregulation is unknown. We show that androgen-induced p27 upregulation is paralleled by p27 stabilization and SKP2 downregulation. SKP2 overexpression is sufficient to overcome androgen-mediated p27 accumulation, indicating that it is a major mediator of androgen-mediated cell cycle control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Androgen-induced G1 arrest correlates with inhibition of cyclin E kinase activity</title><p>Consistent with our previous studies, the synthetic androgen 7&#x003b1;-17&#x003b1;-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone (mibolerone, MIB) inhibits the proliferation and suppresses the transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). No cytotoxic or apoptosis-inducing activity was associated with this growth inhibition ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and data not shown). To determine whether MIB caused arrest in a particular phase of the cell cycle, MIB treated cells were examined by flow cytometry. MIB induced a time-dependent accumulation of cells in G1 at the expense of both S and G2/M phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Consistent with G1 arrest, MIB induced inhibition of cyclin E-associated H1 kinase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This inhibition correlated with increased recovery of the CDK2 inhibitor p27 in cyclin E immunocomplexes isolated from MIB-treated LNCaP cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Similar finding were previously obtained with the synthetic androgen R1881 and the natural androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The latter study also showed that p27 is quantitatively bound to cyclin E complexes in DHT-treated cells, indicating that p27 upregulation was sufficient to saturate and inhibit cyclinE/CDK2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>MIB induces G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of CDK2 activity</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) LNCaP cells were grown in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml MIB and harvested after the times indicated.

SKP2 levels were down-regulated nearly four-fold by MIB at concentrations and with kinetics that closely paralleled p27 accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). In addition, downregulation of RB1 and accumulation in the underphosphorylated form paralleled SKP2 down-regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, only minor changes were detected in the expression of the SKP2-associated SCF<sup>SKP2</sup> subunits HRT1, CUL1, and SKP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). MIB-dependent SKP2 down-regulation was efficiently counteracted by CA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), again indicating an involvement of the AR. Cyclin A, but not cyclin E levels were also suppressed by MIB in an AR-dependent manner, while the levels of the COP9/signalosome subunit CSN5/JAB1 and tubulin remained constant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Finally, consistent with SKP2 and p27 being integral components of androgen-mediated growth control of LNCaP cells, CA also efficiently reversed the MIB-induced G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the effect of MIB on p27 and SKP2 at the level of individual cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining. In untreated controls, most cells displayed strong staining for SKP2 with few cells positive for p27 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). The nuclear staining patterns of SKP2 and p27 appeared mutually exclusive. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). In contrast, the majority of MIB-treated cells showed strong p27 expression, while only few cells were positive for SKP2.</p></sec><sec><title>MIB-induced p27 upregulation correlates with increased p27 protein stability and decreased ubiquitylation</title><p>Northern blot analysis revealed that MIB-induced SKP2 downregulation at the protein level is reflected by quantitatively similar changes in steady state RNA levels (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, p27 mRNA levels were upregulated by MIB only two-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This suggested that the effect of MIB on p27 RNA levels can not fully account for the accumulation of p27 protein (compare Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>)</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of MIB on p27 protein stability and ubiquitylation</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) LNCaP cells were maintained in the presence of 1 ng/ml MIB and/or 750 ng/ml CA for 72 h.

Protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide in control cells and in cells pretreated with MIB for 72 h.

Using this assay, we determined a p27 half-life of 4 h in control cells, which was increased to more than 6 h in MIB treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This experiment likely overestimates p27 half-life in untreated cells, as SKP2 was itself downregulated by CHX (data not shown).

Parallel cyclin E immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblotting for the amount of precipitated cyclin E and co-precipitated p27 (right panel). H1 kinase activity and the amount of p27 coprecipitated with cyclin E were quantitated using Totallab software (graph below blots). The input amount of H1 is shown in the lower panel on the left.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-3-22-5"/></fig><p>This finding is in contrast to serum starved rat fibroblasts and human U87 cells arrested in G1 by overexpression of PTEN, in which SKP2 overexpression can drive S phase entry. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In both cases, SKP2 overexpression leads to induction of cyclin A and CDK2 kinase activity. We therefore asked whether SKP2-mediated p27 downregulation in MIB arrested LNCaP cells was able to actually bring about CDK2 activation.</p><p>We first determined the effect of SKP2 overexpression on MIB-induced RB1 downregulation and accumulation in the dephosphorylated state (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), which is carried out by CDK2 <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Immunoblotting revealed that RB1 suppression in the hypophosphorylated state was efficiently reversed by SKP2 overexpression for 24 or 48 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In addition, cyclin A expression was partially restored (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). However, both effects were largely annihilated after 72 h of SKP2 overexpression. In contrast, cyclin E levels, while not initially affected by MIB, were decreased after 72 h of SKP2 overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, CDK2 and tubulin levels remained stable at all time points of SKP2 overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>A parallel experiment, revealed that CDK2 kinase activity assayed <italic>in vitro</italic> using histone 1 as substrate was suppressed by MIB, but partially restored by overexpression of SKP2 for 24 and 48 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, left panel). This increase was paralleled by a decrease in the amount of p27 associated with cyclin E (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, right panel). While this decrease was maintained throughout the course of the experiment, CDK2 activation was attenuated again at 72 h of SKP2 overexpression. In summary, SKP2 overexpression caused transient upregulation of cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity, but was inefficient in promoting S phase entry of MIB-arrested LNCaP cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Androgen control of LNCaP cell proliferation</title><p>We have used the cell line LNCaP as a model to examine the role of SKP2 in androgen control of p27 expression and cell cycle progression in human prostate cancer cells. LNCaP cells exhibit a complex, but characteristic biphasic response to androgens: (1.) Stimulation of proliferation at low androgen levels, and (2.) inhibition of proliferation at higher levels such as those used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This dichotomy was compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] to the situation in male rodents, where castration leads to atrophy of the prostate due to apoptosis. Re-administration of androgen induces transient epithelial cell proliferation, presumably mediated by proteolytic downregulation of p27, until pre-castration cell numbers have been restored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. No further proliferation ensues beyond this point, at which p27 levels are increased again, despite the continuous presence of androgen. This may reflect androgen activity in restoring the glandular structure by promoting postmitotic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Consistent with this view, androgen administration to intact rats resulted in suppression of prostate epithelial cell proliferation and maintenance of morphological gland integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Based on these findings, we propose that the effects of high doses of androgens on SKP2 and p27 in LNCaP cells described here reflect a differentiation and consolidation effect <italic>in vitro</italic>. If this is the case, LNCaP cells, despite being highly aneuploid derivatives of a metastatic lesion of an advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], may have retained some aspects of the normal biphasic mechanism of androgen control observed in castrated rodents. This mechanism may also be retained in other prostate cancers, thereby representing a potential target for intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of SKP2 in androgen control of p27 stability</title><p>Our data indicate that SKP2 is an integral component of androgen control in LNCaP cells, as it is down-regulated in an AR-mediated manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, all other known SCF<sup>SKP2</sup> subunits examined were largely unresponsive to androgen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Importantly, SKP2 overexpression is sufficient to reverse androgen-mediated p27 accumulation and induce p27 ubiquitylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Based on the F-box dependency of these processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), we conclude that SKP2 directly triggers the ubiquitylation and degradation of p27 in LNCaP cells, a process which is attenuated by androgen-mediated SKP2 downregulation. This interpretation is consistent with SKP2 being a proximal element in the previously identified androgen-mediated pathway of cell cycle inhibition in LNCaP cells. As a direct consequence of SKP2 downregulation, p27 is upregulated and cyclin A is downregulated. This results in inhibition of CDK2 activity, accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB1, inactivation of E2F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and cell cycle arrest.</p><p>While it may surprise that SKP2 overexpression alone is sufficient to mediate p27 degradation in LNCaP cells, given the known requirement for p27 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], similar observations were made in rat fibroblasts, human U87 cells, and primary rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In rat fibroblasts, these findings correlate with SKP2-induced upregulation of cyclin A and CDK2 kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which could further augment p27 phosphorylation and degradation, ultimately stimulating cells to enter S phase.</p><p>Unlike in rat fibroblasts and human U87 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], SKP2 overexpression is not sufficient to override androgen-induced G1 arrest in LNCaP cells, despite a profound effect on p27 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Consistent with this finding, ectopic SKP2 expression was not sufficient to maintain high cyclin A levels, CDK2 activation, and RB1 phosphorylation for prolonged periods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The transient character of these responses may explain the failure to cause efficient S phase entry in the presence of MIB, in particular as co-expression of cyclins was previously shown to synergize with SKP2 in stimulating CDK2 activity and S phase entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, cyclin A is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In future experiments, it will be interesting to determine the effect of combined overexpression of SKP2 and cyclin A and cyclin E on cell cycle progression of MIB-arrested cells.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of such experiments, our data firmly suggest that SKP2 is a central mediator of the androgen response mechanism of LNCaP cells. However, we do not believe that SKP2 is a direct transcriptional target of the AR, as the kinetics of its downregulation were rather slow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting several intermediate steps culminating in this event. Such a mediator could be AS3, a gene induced by growth inhibiting levels of androgen with kinetics that precede cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition, AS3 overexpression mimics androgen-mediated cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells stably expressing exogenous AR, while anti-sense AS3 confers resistance to androgen-induced growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The function of AS3 is still unknown, but the encoded protein has features of a potential transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>While our study suggests that SKP2 is an important player in p27 regulation in prostate cancer cells, recent studies have also implicated another protein, CSN5/JAB1, in p27 regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. CSN5 is a subunit of the COP9/signalosome (CSN) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], but also forms distinct complexes apparently lacking CSN subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Overexpression of CSN5 in NIH3T3 cells causes p27 export from the nucleus and ectopic degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Notably, like SKP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], CSN5 was found to be overexpressed in cancers devoid of p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. However, our studies did not reveal any effect of MIB on CSN5 expression. Future studies aimed at eliminating CSN5 activity will show whether it is involved in androgen-mediated p27 control.</p><p>Finally, a recent report demonstrated SKP2-independent proteolysis of p27 in lymphocytes derived from SKP2 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. It is thus possible that p27 proteolysis is subject to tissue-specific regulation. In prostate cells, however, SKP2 seems to be a major determinant of p27 degradation, as it is down-regulated by androgen and its overexpression is sufficient to mediate p27 ubiquitylation and degradation. Recent studies involving androgen administration to castrated rats have come to similar conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that androgen-mediated SKP2 downregulation is responsible for decreased ubiquitylation and accumulation of p27 in LNCaP cells, an effect that is readily overcome by overexpression of SKP2. We propose that frequent p27 downregulation in prostate cancer may be caused by SKP2 overexpression thus enabling escape from normal androgen control. Finally, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies validate the SKP2 pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers devoid of p27.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and reagents</title><p>Human SKP2 and p27 cDNAs were kindly provided by H.
