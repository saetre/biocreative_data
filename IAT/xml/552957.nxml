The Psc1 sequence includes an RS domain and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a sequential arrangement of protein motifs that has not been demonstrated for other RS domain proteins. This arrangement was conserved in a second mouse protein (BAC34721). The identification of Psc1 and BAC34721 homologues in vertebrates and related proteins, more widely throughout evolution, defines a new family of RS domain proteins termed acidic rich RS (ARRS) domain proteins. Psc1 incorporated into the nuclear speckles, but demonstrated novel aspects of subcellular distribution including localization to speckles proximal to the nuclear periphery and localization to punctate structures in the cytoplasm termed cytospeckles. Integration of Psc1 into cytospeckles was dependent on the RRM. Cytospeckles were dynamic within the cytoplasm and appeared to traffic into the nucleus. These observations suggest a novel role in RNA metabolism for ARRS proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Repeated and/or interspersed arginine/serine dipeptide repeats are a feature of many nuclear proteins with diverse roles including regulation of splicing, transcription, RNA Pol II binding, actin binding, kinase and phosphatase activity, and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Over 240 RS domain proteins have been identified, the best characterized being the SR and SR-related families, which facilitate spliceosome formation and orchestrate splice site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). SR proteins are characterized by an RS domain, one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and subcellular localization to discrete regions in the nucleus, termed nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Nuclear speckles are 20&#x02013;40 irregularly shaped subnuclear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), which are rich in splicing related factors and recognized by a monoclonal antibody to SC35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) that recognizes a range of splicing factors. Localization to nuclear speckles is believed to be diagnostic for proteins involved in mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). These structures do not correlate with regions of active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and are considered to act as storage sites from which splicing factors are recruited to regulate RNA splicing. Over 140 proteins are known to localize to nuclear speckles including known splicing factors from SR and SR-related families, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other diverse factors such as RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and the regulators of actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>The RS domain has been shown to mediate protein&#x02013;protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), to function in nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and to play a role in the targeting of proteins such as SC35 and Transformer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) to nuclear speckles. RS domains from SR proteins, non-SR proteins and synthetic RS domains have also been shown to activate splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, the RS domain does not appear to facilitate nuclear import and localization for all RS domain proteins, as SF2/ASF and SRp40 are capable of localization to nuclear speckles in the absence of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Where nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of RS domain proteins such as SF2/ASF, U2AF and 9G8 has been demonstrated, the RS domain is required, but not sufficient for cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Nuclear import can be dependent on RS domain phosphorylation and is mediated by SR transportins (TRN-SR) in both mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The export pathways for SR proteins have not been defined, but can also be influenced by phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). It is now emerging that RS domain phosphorylation also functions in mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and RNA binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Peri-implantation stem cell 1 (<italic>Psc1</italic>) was identified on the basis of differential expression between mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells, an <italic>in vitro</italic> equivalent of primitive ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In the early embryo, <italic>Psc1</italic> expression is restricted to the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst and down regulated on the formation of the primitive ectoderm between 5.0 and 5.75 days post coitum. In this paper, we describe the Psc1 sequence, identify related proteins in vertebrates and invertebrates that define a new class of RS domain proteins termed acidic rich RS (ARRS) domain proteins and demonstrate a novel subcellular distribution that includes localization to punctate sites within the nucleus (nuclear speckles) and cytoplasm (cytospeckles), and the transport between the two compartments. We show by mutational analyses that the RRM is critical for the integration of Psc1 into cytospeckles, the RS domain functions in nuclear import, and both the RS domain and the RRM are necessary for subnuclear localization. A conserved C-terminal domain associates with microtubules and may be required for trafficking of cytospeckles into the nucleus. Taken together these observations suggest a novel role for this new family of RS domain proteins in RNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA isolation, sequencing and analysis</title><p>A &#x003bb; ZAP II library (Clontech Inc.), prepared from D3 ES cell RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), was screened using a 381 bp <italic>Psc1</italic> cDNA fragment (nt 1660&#x02013;2040) identified by differential display PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). A third round positive plaque containing <italic>Psc1</italic> nt 901&#x02013;3512 was zapped into pBluescript SK (clone 8.1; Stratagene) and sequenced. RACE PCR to isolate the 5&#x02032; end of the transcript was carried out by ampliFINDER RACE/PCR (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. D3 ES cell RNA was reverse transcribed using primer 1736 (5&#x02032;-TTTACTTTGATTGTTGTTCC-3&#x02032;) and amplified using the 5&#x02032; anchor primer and primer 1064 (5&#x02032;-TAGAATTCGGCAGAGCAACTTCATCAACAACAACTA-3&#x02032;). First round RACE/PCR product was cloned into pBluescript KS and sequenced to generate <italic>Psc1</italic> nt 478&#x02013;1088 bp. For second round RACE/PCR, D3 ES cell RNA was reverse transcribed using primer 1275 (5&#x02032;-TGGGAAGCACAACAGAAGGT-3&#x02032;) and amplified using the 5&#x02032; anchor primer and primer 582 (5&#x02032;-TAGAATTCGTACCGCTCATAGTCTCTCCAC-3&#x02032;), cloned into pBlusecript KS and sequenced to generate <italic>Psc1</italic> nt 1&#x02013;603. The open reading frame (ORF) was identified by the presence of an in-frame ATG start codon preceded by two in-frame stop codons. All plasmids were sequenced in both directions. Protein homologies were identified with the aid of SIM Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kr.expasy.org/tools/sim-prot.html"/>) from the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kr.expasy.org"/>) and BLASTP server software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>). DNA to protein translations used the ExPASy &#x02018;Translate Tool&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kr.expasy.org/tools/dna.html"/>). DNA sequence homologies were identified through BLASTN and &#x02018;ALIGN&#x02019; software from the GENESTREAM network server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.igh.cnrs.fr/bin/align-guess.cgi"/>). Default parameters were applied for all server applications. Sequence analysis of the KIAA1311 cDNA revealed a probable frame shift which did not allow the identification of the start codon.

This region of Psc1 shares no significant similarity with BAC34721 and would, therefore, not be expected to detect this protein or its homologues. However, the Psc1 human homologue, KIAA1311 shares 83% identity across this region, suggesting that the mammalian homologues of Psc1 may be recognized by the anti-Psc1 antibody.

Random movement (5% of cytospeckles) was characterized by short (&#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m), rapid movement (&#x0003c;15 s) and apparent random directional changes with pauses (15 s&#x02013;1 min) between movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The most abundant class, tethered cytospeckles (80% of cytospeckles), showed no net migration through the cytoplasm with mobility restricted to an estimated 1 &#x003bc;m radius. Cytospeckle size correlated with the patterns of movement. The majority of cytospeckles were &#x0003c;0.5 &#x003bc;m in diameter, evenly distributed throughout the cytosol and demonstrated tethered motility. Larger speckles, in the order of 1 &#x003bc;m, were more likely to demonstrate directional movement.

While the specificity of interaction was not addressed by this analysis, binding was abolished by the addition of total RNA from ES cells.

ARRS proteins are typically large, in the order of 800&#x02013;1100 amino acids, and are defined by the sequential arrangement of an N-terminal domain with homology to Hprp3p, RS domain, RRM with unique conserved motifs, C-domain homology, an acidic rich region adjacent to the C-terminus and with the exception of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>D.discoideum</italic> homologues, a C-terminal RSWR/K motif. Phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) indicate that ARRS proteins share a common evolutionary origin. ARRS proteins remain monophyletic to a single putative gene ancestor. Our analyses show the slime-mould protein (AAO51188) is close to the centre (root) of a hypothetical evolutionary tree highlighting the deep biological origin of this protein family. Orthologues of a single gene were easily identified in the mosquito, fruit fly and the nematode worm. However, a putative gene duplication event specific to the vertebrate lineage obscures the order of descent of the two conserved vertebrate homologues, represented by Psc1 and BAC34721 in the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Slightly deeper evolutionary nodes and longer branch lengths suggest the Psc1 clade may be parental to the BAC34721 clade raising the possibility that Psc1 is the orthologue of the invertebrate ancestor. Arguably, a high degree of structural conservation between ARRS proteins reflects conserved functional roles for these proteins in eukaryotes. This diversification of function appears to have arisen within the vertebrate lineage at least 450 million years ago, the estimated time of divergence between human and puffer fish. Interestingly, the duplicated vertebrate proteins have structural differences in that human KIAA1311 and mouse Psc1 proteins contain a PG repeat domain not found in the BAC34721 clade, raising the possibility of diverged functional roles between the two proteins.</p><p>Members of the SR protein family are a well characterized family of RS domain proteins, and have been shown to mediate protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions in the spliceosome. However, it is clear that this description understates SR protein function. Tissue expression variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), apoptotic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), developmental requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), differential RNA binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and roles in cancer/disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), demonstrate the extent to which SR proteins are involved in the regulation of cellular events. The presence of features consistent with SR proteins such as an RS domain, a functional RRM and localization to nuclear speckles, suggests that at least one aspect of ARRS protein function is likely to be involved with RNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Determinants of Psc1 nuclear localization</title><p>GFP&#x02013;Psc1 was localized to punctate areas of the nucleus and colocalized to all nuclear speckles stained with anti SC35, a distribution Lamond and Spector define as diagnostic for proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).

A similar subcellular localization pattern was observed for endogenous Psc1 protein in COS-1 cells. The apparent ingression of cytospeckles observed in real time is a possible explanation for these additional sites of GFP&#x02013;Psc1 localization in the nucleus and consistent with the absence of other RS domain proteins from both these sites and cytospeckles.</p><p>Nuclear localization was observed in GFP fusion proteins containing either the RRM or the RS domain, suggesting that both of these domains contribute to nuclear targeting.

All identified vertebrate ARRS proteins contain an RG-rich region, however, each lacks the RGG Box typically observed in RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) and reported to contribute to a number of nuclear functions such as nucleolar/nuclear targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) and, protein and RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The Psc1 RG-rich region consists of interspersed and consecutive RG dipeptide repeats, similar to the RG Box found in p80 coilin which localizes SMN to cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). While cajal bodies are not sites of active splicing, they are biogenic sites for snRNPs, which subsequently traffic to nuclear speckles and are involved in pre-messenger RNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear speckles containing SR proteins are heterogeneous</title><p>Subnuclear localization patterns of Psc1 and Psc1 mutant proteins point to the existence of heterogeneity amongst nuclear speckles in two respects. First, full-length Psc1 and GFP&#x02013;Psc1&#x00394;RRM localized to nuclear speckles that did not contain SR proteins such as SC35, suggesting a diversity of molecular composition amongst SR protein containing structures in the nucleus. Variability amongst nuclear speckles has been described by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) and others, who suggested a relationship between shape and function, with irregular speckles active in the recruitment/trafficking of splicing factors, and regular, rounded speckles forming in the absence of active transcription. The presence of splicing factors such as SC35 in interchromatin granules, sites implicated in spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>) and perichromatin fibrils, associated with active pre-mRNA transcription and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>), also indicates a relationship between speckle localization/composition and function. In this case, we identify sub nuclear localization as an indicator of speckle heterogeneity, with speckles containing Psc1 but not marked by anti-SC35 often associated with the nuclear periphery. Spatial heterogeneity within individual speckles was evident from the fact that both GFP&#x02013;Psc1&#x00394;RRM and GFP&#x02013;Psc1&#x00394;RS localized to discrete regions within nuclear speckles that overlapped partially but not completely with the anti-SC35 nuclear speckle marker. This is consistent with the localization of cyclin T1, Cdk9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>) and &#x003b2;-actin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>), each of which demonstrate partial or limited overlap with nuclear speckles. Partial overlap may be associated with the formation of &#x02018;subdomains&#x02019; which have been described by Mintz and Spector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>) as 5&#x02013;50 spherical structures within nuclear speckles, heterogenous in size and composed of SR proteins and snRNPs, implying a function separate to factors uniformly found within nuclear speckles.</p></sec><sec><title>Psc1 is located within discrete cytoplasmic structures called cytospeckles</title><p>Given the precedents for RS domain protein localization in the nucleus, the presence of Psc1-containing speckles in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (called cytospeckles) was unexpected. Observation of these structures in both monkey kidney cells (COS-1) and mouse pluripotent cells (EPL) indicates that they are not cell type- or species-specific. Novel aspects of cytoplasmic speckling are likely to be common to all ARRS proteins given the observation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NP_609976 and human se70-2 speckling in the cytoplasm of SL3 cells and HeLa cells, respectively (data not shown). Psc1-containing cytospeckles did not colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes, actin, &#x003b3; or &#x003b1;-tubulin, and their distribution or morphology were not affected by treatment of transfected cells with the microtubule depolymerizing agents, nocodazole and colchicine, alteration of COS-1 cell seeding densities, or variation in transfection time from 8 to 72 h (data not shown). Psc1-containing cytospeckles are therefore, not identical to or associated with these structures. RS domain proteins have previously been identified in cytoplasmic structures. SR proteins have been observed in the two-cell stage of the nematode <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). However, unlike Psc1 containing cytospeckles, the nematode cytosolic speckles are only observed prior to zygotic gene activation and contain SC35. The yeast actin binding protein, Sla1p contains an RS domain and in addition to suggested nuclear roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), is localized to cortical actin in the cytoplasm and regulates actin assembly with a role in endocytosis. Although the function of the Sla1p RS domain is unknown, deletion mutants inclusive of this domain did not perturb cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). A cytoplasmic localization profile can be conferred upon SF2/ASF by amino acid substitution of the RS residues for RG residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). This localization was largely diffuse, and although cytoplasmic punctate structures were apparent, these did not resemble Psc1-containing cytospeckles. Cytospeckles are not a prerequisite for nuclear speckle formation as the GFP&#x02013;Psc1&#x00394;RRM mutant was capable of forming nuclear speckles in the absence of cytospeckle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Formation of Psc1-containing cytospeckles did not appear to result from the export of nuclear speckles and did not require integration of Psc1 into nuclear speckles as Psc1 and GFP&#x02013;RRM containing cytospeckles were observed in the absence of nuclear speckles. It is therefore, assumed that these structures form <italic>de novo</italic> within the cytoplasm.</p><p>Cytospeckles do not appear to be associated with sites of RNA degradation as they do not colocalize with GW182, a marker for GW/DCP bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>) (data not shown), nor do they resemble stress granules which form under conditions of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>), although this observation has not been verified experimentally. The appearance of cytospeckles is reminiscent of RNA containing granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>), large cytoplasmic complexes which contain multiple proteins and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). Statistical analysis suggests that at least in the case of A2RE/hnRNP RNA, each RNA granule is heterogenous with respect to RNA content and contains &#x0223c;30 RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). Consistent with the molecular composition of RNA granules, cytospeckles are deduced to contain multiple protein molecules since GFP&#x02013;Psc1 cytospeckles could be visualized easily using light microscopy, suggesting that multiple Psc1 molecules are integrated into these structures. Further, the demonstrated ability of the Psc1 RRM to bind at least two transcripts expressed within pluripotent cells and the intron containing adenovirus transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), together with the obligatory requirement for the RRM to direct GFP&#x02013;Psc1 to cytospeckles, suggests that cytospeckles are likely to contain a heterogeneous RNA population. It is possible that RNA binding specificity is directed by domains outside the Psc1 RRM, in which case cytospeckle RNA content could be restricted to a limited repertoire of cellular transcripts.</p><p>Trafficking of RNA granules occurs via continuous cycles of anchoring and active transport associated with the cytoskeletal network. Fusco <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>) report distinct patterns of RNA motility including completely immobile, corralled and non-restricted diffusion, similar to these observed during real time analysis of Psc1 cytospeckles. The failure of cytoplasmic Psc1 to colocalize with F-actin and &#x003b1;-tubulin suggests that, if Psc1 cytospeckles traffic via microtubule/actin networks, their associations with these components must be transient. Further investigation is required to determine the rate and pattern of movement given the possible involvement of bi-directional motorized transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>) and/or treadmilling in association with the ends of dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>).</p><p>Association with cytoskeletal filaments may result from interaction with the C domain, shown to colocalize with microtubles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). For those cytospeckles whose fate is proposed to be nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), cytoskeletal association via the C domain may be a significant contributor to the nuclear import pathway given the increased cytoplasmic compartmentalization observed for GFP&#x02013;Psc1&#x00394;CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>RNA granules are proposed to contain all machinery components required for translation and play a role in the regulation of site-specific and temporal translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). While cytospeckles may, by association, be involved in translational regulation, a further possibility is a role for Psc1-containing complexes in the cytoplasm in the storage of Psc1 or Psc1-associated proteins/RNA. In this context, Psc1 may have no function within the cytospeckle, but await signals that mediate transport to sites of functional relevance. The complex subcellular localization and trafficking is consistent with a novel role for Psc1 in the coordination of cytoplasmic events and nuclear RNA metabolism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Joy Rathjen and Dr Rebecca Keough for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript.
