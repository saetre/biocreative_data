AML1/ETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by directly targeting AML1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation determined by AML1/ETO probably relies on a more complex network, since the fusion protein has been shown to interact with a number of other transcription factors, in particular E-proteins, and may therefore target other sites on DNA. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling were exploited to identify AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML1/ETO was found to co-localize with AML1, demonstrating that the fusion protein follows the binding pattern of the wild-type protein but does not function primarily by displacing it. The DNA binding profile of the E-protein HEB was grossly rearranged upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the fusion protein was found to co-localize with both AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO. Our results suggest a major role for the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are a group of hematologic malignancies initiated by chromosomal abnormalities that often give origin to oncogenic proteins with transcriptional regulatory functions. These aberrant transcription factors bind to specific sequences on DNA and influence the activity of adjacent genes. The result is that leukemic blasts display abnormalities in their gene expression programs, which are ultimately responsible for the malignant phenotype. In this study, genome-wide approaches were exploited not only to identify target genes, but also to discover interactions among different transcription factors, with the aim of defining disease-linked regulatory networks. We performed a detailed analysis of the DNA binding pattern of an oncogenic transcription factor, AML1/ETO, which is responsible for approximately 10&#x02013;15&#x00025; of AML. We identified a specific signature, which is characterized by the presence of binding regions for AML1/ETO and for other transcription factors, AML1 and HEB, and found that the DNA binding pattern of AML1 and HEB is significantly affected in cells expressing AML1/ETO. Our results, therefore, describe genes regulated by AML1/ETO and demonstrate that this oncogenic protein can significantly interfere with the function of other transcriptional regulators.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomal translocations generating fusion genes are the genetic hallmark of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Alcalay1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, AML1/ETO binding was measured in human promoters and correlated with global transcriptional regulation. Since transcription factors may bind to DNA sequences far from the promoter, AML1/ETO occupancy was also analyzed on a high-resolution tiling array, designed to cover an entire human chromosome. Chromosome 19 (Chr. 19) was chosen due to its relatively small size and high gene density. Although analysis of a single chromosome may introduce a bias, and the distribution of binding sites may be influenced by gene density, these results can be exploited to infer relevant correlations in the binding patterns of specific transcription factors. With this aim, the binding patterns of AML1 and HEB were also analyzed on the Chr. 19 Array. Finally, AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation of genes localized on Chr. 19 was measured by hybridization with total RNA from U937-AE and U937-Mt cells (expression tiling).</p><table-wrap id="pgen-1000275-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000275.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Microarray experiments included in the study.</title></caption><graphic id="pgen-1000275-t001-1" xlink:href="pgen.1000275.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pgen-1000275-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell line(s)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibody</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aim</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold><italic>Genome-wide analyses</italic></bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Human HG17 Promoter Array set</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ChIP-chip</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-HA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identification of AML1/ETO binding sites in human promoters</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus v.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene expression</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identification of genes whose expression is regulated by AML1/ETO</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold><italic>Analyses on human chromosome 19</italic></bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ChIP-chip</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-HA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis of AML1/ETO binding in different genomic locations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-ETO</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis of AML1/ETO binding in different genomic locations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-AML1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Correlation of AML1 and AML1/ETO binding patterns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-HEB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Correlation of HEB and AML1/ETO binding patterns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">anti-H3K4me3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Correlation of AML1/ETO binding pattern with a mark for active transcription</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NimbleGen Chr. 19 Array</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene expression</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">U937-AE and U937-Mt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Correlation of AML1/ETO, AML1 and HEB binding patterns with gene expression</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of AML1/ETO Binding Sites at Human Promoters and Correlation with Transcriptional Regulation</title><p>The binding profile of AML1/ETO in human promoters was investigated through ChIP experiments with an anti-HA antibody on lysates of U937-AE and U937-Mt cells.

On the other hand, 30&#x00025; of target genes are induced, including <italic>HOX</italic> genes (<italic>HOXA10</italic>, <italic>HOXA5</italic>, <italic>HOXC6</italic>) and the cell cycle regulators <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>CDKN1B</italic>. <italic>CDKN1A</italic> is of particular interest since it is know to regulate maintenance of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Cheng1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and also modulates leukemic development in mouse models of t(8;21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Peterson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, PG Pelicci, subitted for publication). The AML1 consensus sequence is only enriched in downregulated genes, whereas upregulated genes show enrichment in binding sites for other transcription factors. Therefore, a proportion of AML1/ETO binding to DNA may be achieved independently from the AML1 motif recognition.</p><p>AML1/ETO has been hypothesized to function as dominant negative of its wild type component AML1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Meyers2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Frank1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of the DNA binding pattern of AML1 showed that the two transcription factors often bind to the same DNA regions. In many cases AML1/ETO target genes represent native AML1 targets, but the presence of the fusion protein does not displace the wild-type protein. In other cases, the two proteins are present in genomic regions where AML1 is normally not found. Therefore, although the two proteins do not physically associate (data not shown), AML1/ETO expression is capable of driving AML1 to new sites on the genome, perhaps by rendering them accessible. The functional consequences of the co-localization of AML1 and AML1/ETO on transcriptional regulation remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The E-protein HEB has been described as an interactor of both AML1/ETO and ETO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. It was hypothesized that through this interaction, AML1/ETO could be redirected to E-protein target genes, possibly deregulating their expression. We found that the binding pattern of HEB in U937 cells is disrupted upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the fusion protein recruits HEB to its binding regions. Co-occurrence of HEB and AML1/ETO in promoters was also detected in the SKNO-1 cell line, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not peculiar to the cellular system under analysis. The specific repositioning of HEB to AML1/ETO binding sites is also supported by sequence analysis, which identifies the AML1 motif in HEB binding regions only in cells expressing AML1/ETO.</p><p>More information concerning the complexity of AML1/ETO binding can be obtained by looking simultaneously at the binding patterns of AML1 and HEB in the presence and absence of AML1/ETO. The first observation is that these two transcription factors share a proportion of target genes in wild-type conditions, pointing to common regulatory functions in hematopoiesis. When they bind to common target sites, AML1 and HEB are less prone to be displaced by AML1/ETO expression, and these regions represent preferential binding sites for the fusion protein. Furthermore, regulation of gene expression by AML1/ETO is significantly associated with the co-occurrence of AML1 and HEB, suggesting that common binding regions for the three transcription factors are of relevance to AML1/ETO function.</p><p>A proportion of genes regulated by AML1/ETO did not display binding of the fusion protein in proximity of the gene. Our results demonstrate that some of these genes contain regions bound by HEB in wild-type conditions, and that this binding was no longer present in cells expressing AML1/ETO. Therefore, indirect transcriptional regulation determined by AML1/ETO may be partially due to displacement of HEB from its native target genes, and interference with HEB-dependent gene expression.</p><p>In the hematopoietic system, HEB has been studied in lymphoid differentiation: loss of function experiments have shown that HEB is relevant in the early stages of B-cell and T-cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Murre1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that HEB is expressed in the Lin&#x02212; compartment of murine bone marrow, and is absent in more differentiated myeloid cells. HEB expression appears to be necessary for survival of cells expressing the fusion protein (A. Gardini and M. Alcalay, unpublished), suggesting that the translocation may only be viable in cells that express HEB, such as early progenitors or stem cells. Furthermore, HEB protein levels increase in the presence of AML1/ETO, whereas <italic>HEB</italic> mRNA levels remain unchanged, implying that expression of the fusion protein is associated with stabilization of HEB through unknown post-translational mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible that the HEB-expressing subpopulation of progenitor/stem cells might contain the target cell for AML1/ETO, which would then expand the compartment of HEB-expressing cells and sustain HEB protein levels by modulating post-translational regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of AML1/ETO global genomic occupancy and provides a correlation to its effect on gene expression. Our results point to a pivotal role for AML1 and HEB in t(8;21) myeloid leukemogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines</title><p>The U937 AML1/ETO-HA#9 clone (U937-AE) was generated by stable transfection of AML1/ETO-HA cDNA cloned in the inducible pSG-MtNEO plasmid vector as already described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000275-Alcalay2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.
