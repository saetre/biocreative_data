In yeast, Vps34 is associated with a putative serine/threonine protein kinase, Vps15, which is required for Vps34p activity. The mammalian homologue of Vps15p, hVps15 (formerly called p150), also binds to hVps34, but its role in hVps34 signalling has not been evaluated. In the present study we have therefore compared the activity and regulation of hVps34 expressed without or with hVps15. We find that hVps34 has low specific activity when expressed alone; co-expression with hVps15 leads to a marked increase in activity. Notably, beclin-1/UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene) activation of hVps34 requires co-expression with hVps15; this may be explained by the observation that beclin-1/UVRAG expression increases hVps34/hVps15 binding. Regulation of hVps34 activity by nutrients also requires co-expression with hVps15. Finally, given a recent report that hVps34 activity requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (calmodulin), we considered whether hVps15 might be involved in this regulation. Although hVps34 does bind CaM, we find its activity is not affected by treatment of cells with BAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)] or W7. Removal of CaM by EDTA or EGTA washes has no effect on hVps34 activity, and hVps34 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is unaffected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation. The results of the present study show that, in mammalian cells, hVps34 activity is regulated through its interactions with hVps15, but is independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>beclin-1</kwd><kwd>vacuolar protein sorting 15 (Vps15)</kwd><kwd>mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)</kwd><kwd>mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34)</kwd><kwd>UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>BAPTA, 1,2-bis-(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N,N,N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetra-acetic acid</kwd><kwd>BAPTA/AM, BAPTA(acetoxymethyl ester)</kwd><kwd>Bif-1, Bax-interacting factor 1</kwd><kwd>CaM, calmodulin</kwd><kwd>D-PBS, Dulbecco's PBS</kwd><kwd>FBS, foetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>HA, haemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>hVps15, mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 15 homologue</kwd><kwd>hVps34, mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 34 homologue</kwd><kwd>MEM, minimal essential medium</kwd><kwd>MLCK, myosin light-chain kinase</kwd><kwd>mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase</kwd><kwd>S6K1, S6 kinase 1</kwd><kwd>TOR, target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>UVRAG, UV radiation resistance-associated gene</kwd><kwd>Vps, vacuolar protein sorting</kwd><kwd>YFP, yellow fluorescent protein</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Class III PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) specifically produce the lipid PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which acts by recruiting downstream effectors containing FYVE or PX (Phox homology) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Vps34p and hVps34 are also required for starvation-induced autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In mammalian cells, this is in part mediated by the association of hVps34 with the autophagy-related proteins beclin-1, UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene) and Bif-1 (Bax-interacting factor 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Finally, we have shown previously that hVps34 is required for activation of the mTOR [mammalian TOR (target of rapamycin)]/S6K1 (S6 kinase 1) pathway by insulin in cultured mammalian cells, but is not itself regulated by insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Instead, hVps34 activity is regulated by nutrients (glucose and amino acids), consistent with it contributing to the nutrient-regulated inputs to mTOR. Similarly, hVps34 was shown to be required for stimulation of mTOR/S6K1 by amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A recent study has proposed that in cultured mammalian cells, hVps34 activity requires its binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (calmodulin), and that amino-acid regulation of hVps34 occurs via changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Of note, Vps34 is not required for activation of the TOR pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the role of hVps34 in mTOR signalling in mammalian animal models has not yet been investigated.</p><p>In yeast, Vps34 is associated with a putative serine/threonine protein kinase, Vps15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; the mammalian homologue, hVps15 (formerly called p150) also binds to mammalian hVps34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Yeast Vps15p is required for the activity of Vps34p, as deletion of <italic>VPS15</italic> leads to a loss of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> production and a disruption of vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although Vps34p does not appear to be a substrate of Vps15p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the mutations in the kinase domain of Vps15p abolish its binding to Vps34p and lead to a loss of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, increases in PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> can be detected in <italic>VPS15</italic>-null strains that overexpress Vps34p, but this does not lead to a restoration of Vps34p-dependent vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, while Vps34p activity may not be strictly dependent on Vps15p, its function in vesicular trafficking is Vps15p dependent.</p><p>To date, the role of hVps15 in the regulation of hVps34 in mammalian cells has not been extensively studied. <italic>In vitro</italic>, hVps15 leads to a 2-fold activation of hVps34 lipid kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We previously showed that activated Rab5 binds to the WD40 domains of hVps15, and that Rab5 targets hVps34 and hVps15 to early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, in late endosomes, Rab7 and the PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> phosphatases MTM1 and MTM2 (myotubularin 1 and 2) bind to the hVps15 WD40 domains, in a mutually exclusive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23a">23a</xref>]. These studies suggest an important role for hVps15 in the targeting of hVps34 to distinct endosomal locations. Based on results from yeast and flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], hVps15 would be expected to play a role in hVps34-dependent autophagy, but this has not been examined in mammalian cells. However, several groups have reported that the mammalian autophagy proteins beclin-1, UVRAG and Bif-1 bind to overexpressed hVps34 and/or regulate its activity in the absence of overexpressed hVps15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have examined the role of hVps15 in the regulation of hVp34. We find that the specific activity of hVps34 is significantly increased by co-expression with hVps15. Moreover, regulation of hVps34 activity by autophagy-related proteins and by nutrients requires the presence of hVps15. In contrast, we find no evidence to support the hypothesis that hVps34 activity is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. These experiments provide new information on the role of hVps15&#x02013;hVps34 interactions in mammalian cells, and provide strong evidence against the putative role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the regulation of hVps34 activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cell lines and materials</title><p>The insulin-responsive CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary)-derived cell line GRC+LR-73 (referred to as LR73 cells) has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

However, when the activity of overexpressed hVps34 was normalized for protein expression (determined by Western blotting with anti-hVps34 antibodies, which allows us to directly compare the amount of hVps34 in immunoprecipitates from untransfected compared with transfected cells), the specific activity of overexpressed hVps34 was in fact only 15% of endogenous hVps34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, upon co-expression of hVps34 and hVps15, net hVps34 expression was lower, but its specific activity was increased by 2.5-fold. These results suggest that hVps34 is activated when associated with hVps15. To directly test this conclusion, we compared the specific activity of hVps34 in anti-Myc compared with anti-V5 immunoprecipitates from cells transiently expressing Myc&#x02013;hVps34 and V5&#x02013;hVps15. Although the amount of hVps34 in anti-V5 immunoprecipitates was less than in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, the specific activity of hVps34 in anti-V5 immunoprecipitates was 5-fold higher than in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates. The higher activity seen in anti-V5 immunoprecipitates, as compared with anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, presumably reflects the fact that not all of the Myc&#x02013;hVps34 is bound to V5&#x02013;hVps15. Thus in cells transfected with both Myc&#x02013;hVps34 and V5&#x02013;hVps15, there was less hVps34 in anti-V5 compared with anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, and less hVps15 in anti-Myc compared with anti-V5 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lower panel). Similar results were obtained using cells stably transfected with Myc&#x02013;hVps34 and V5&#x02013;hVps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Taken together, these results suggest that hVps15-associated hVps34 is highly active relative to monomeric hVps34.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>hVps34 activity requires hVps15</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control HEK-293T cells or cells transfected with Myc&#x02013;hVps34 alone or with V5&#x02013;hVps15 were lysed, and anti-hVps34, anti-Myc or anti-V5 immunoprecipitates were prepared and assayed under standard conditions as described in the Experimental secion.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Consistent with their findings, hVps34 activity in EGTA-washed samples was nearly abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). However, if the EGTA was removed from the samples by washes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer containing either EDTA or BAPTA, hVps34 activity was completely restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). These results suggest that the loss of activity is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-independent effect of EGTA. To test this directly, we added Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators to hVps34 immunoprecipitates that were first washed in EDTA, which removes bound CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C).

Given that the assay conditions for hVps34 include 10&#x000a0;mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> under these conditions is estimated to be 1.99&#x000a0;mM (WEBMAXC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxc/webmaxcE.htm">http://www.stanford.edu/&#x0223c;cpatton/webmaxc/webmaxcE.htm</ext-link>), suggesting that the effects of EGTA are unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation.

Thus the reported <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of hVps34 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is likely to be due to the removal of EGTA.

In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, hVps34-dependent vesicular trafficking is abolished in <italic>VPS15</italic>-null strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, overexpression of Vps34p in <italic>VPS15</italic>-null strains leads to increased production of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>, suggesting that Vps34p activity does not strictly require Vps15p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This also appears to be the case in mammalian cells; hVps34 has activity when expressed alone, although the specific activity of the enzyme is only 15% of endogenous hVps34. Co-expression of hVps15 with hVps34 leads to an increase in hVps34 specific activity, and the specific activity of hVps34 in anti-hVps15 immunoprecipitates is 5-fold higher than in anti-hVps34 immunoprecipitates. This difference is much more pronounced than the 2-fold change in recombinant hVps34 activity caused by addition of hVps15 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This could reflect either the ability of hVps15 to recruit other activating factors in cells, or the effect of hVps15 on hVps34 folding and/or post-translational modification.</p><p>Experiments to determine the effects of hVps15 knockdown or overexpression on the activity of endogenous hVps34 activity are difficult to interpret. siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown of hVps15 leads to a significant loss of hVps34 expression, presumably due to altered stability (results not shown). In contrast, hVps15 overexpression does not lead to increased hVps34 activity. This is probably due to the fact that hVps15 is in excess over hVPs34, as was previously shown by exhaustive immunodepletion experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of hVps15-mediated activation of hVps34 is unknown, and it is not even clear that hVps15 actually possesses kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The major evidence for the kinase activity of yeast Vps15p is that the immunopurified protein undergoes autophosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and mutations in its kinase domain abolish this autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; however, these same mutations abolish Vps34p binding to Vps15p. Thus it remains possible that the autophosphorylation activity observed in Vps15p immunoprecipitates actually reflects the protein kinase activity of Vps34p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that hVps34 is activated by association with beclin-1 and UVRAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We find that the hVps34 binding and activation by beclin-1/UVRAG requires the presence of hVps15. Beclin-1 binds directly to hVps34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the requirement for hVps15 could reflect a conformational change in hVps34 that enhances its ability to interact with beclin-1/UVRAG. Interestingly, beclin-1/UVRAG also increases the association of hVps34 with hVps15. Given that hVps15 binding increases the specific activity of hVps34, the ability of beclin-1/UVRAG to enhance hVps34&#x02013;hVps15 binding may provide a mechanism for the effects of these proteins on hVps34 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The finding that hVps34 binding to hVps15 is regulated by autophagy-related proteins could have important implications for PtdIns3<italic>P</italic>-dependent steps in autophagy. Studies are in progress to determine whether the increase in hVps34 activity caused by expression of Bif-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also correlates with an increase in hVps34&#x02013;hVps15 binding.</p><p>A recent study has suggested that hVps34 is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, in our hands, we see no effect on hVps34 activity in cells treated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators or CaM inhibitors, and no requirement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or CaM for hVps34 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. We suspect that the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence reported by Gulati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reflects the presence of residual EGTA in the assays, which inhibits hVps34 even in the presence of saturating levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and manganese. Gulati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] did show that mutation of a predicted CaM-binding site in hVps34 causes a loss of activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; however, loss-of-function mutants are by nature difficult to interpret. The mutated sites are in the helical domain of hVps34, which contains a cluster of multiple short helices. The mutations were all hydrophobic-to-charged mutations, which might disrupt the folding of the putative CaM-binding helix or its interactions with other helices within this domain, leading to a loss of activity.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that mammalian hVps15 is critical for hVps34 activity as well as for regulation of hVps34 by autophagy-related proteins and by nutritional stress. In contrast, our results contradict the hypothesis that hVps34 activity requires the binding of hVps34 to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Future experiments will need to address the mechanism by which hVps15 regulates hVps34, as well as the function of the putative kinase activity of hVps15.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Anne Bresnick (Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, U.S.A.) for helpful discussions and for the MLCK reagents.
