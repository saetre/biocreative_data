This expression pattern is similar to those of genes related to DNA replication, suggesting involvement of some common control mechanism(s). In the upstream region (-71 to -64 with respect to the transcription initiation site) of the CycA gene, we found a sequence identical to the DNA replication-related element (DRE; 5'-TATCGATA), which is important for high level expression of replication-related genes such as those encoding DNA polymerase alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Transient expression assays with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were carried out to examine the function of the DRE sequence of the CycA gene. Deletion or base substitution mutations resulted in an extensive reduction in CAT expression. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies against DRE binding factor (DREF) diminished or supershifted the complex of the DREF and DRE-containing fragment. The results indicate that the Drosophila CycA gene is under the control of a DRE/DREF system, as are DNA replication-related genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
