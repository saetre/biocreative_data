The substrates include lipids, ions, sugars, peptides, vitamins, steroid hormones and xenobiotics such as anticancer drugs. Currently, the human ABC transporter family comprises 48 members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Structurally, functional ABC transporters are characterized by two nucleotide binding folds (NBF) with conserved Walker A and B motifs, signature sequences, and two transmembrane domains (TMD), each typically composed of multiple transmembrane segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The energy required for the transmembrane transport of substrates is provided by hydrolysis of ATP at the two NBFs, whereas substrate binding is thought to be determined by the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Functional ABC transporters require the presence of two NBFs and two transmembrane domains. This dual arrangement is accomplished either by a single polypeptide (a so-called full-size transporter) or by dimerization of two half-size transporters. Based on sequence similarities, the human ABC transporter family has been categorized into seven subfamilies, denoted ABC A-G. The human ABC A-subfamily presently comprises 12 full-size transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] which share common structural features including a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane helix and two conserved 80-amino acid segments adjacent to the NBFs. To date, four ABC A-subfamily genes have been causatively linked to monogenetic lipid trafficking disorders. These include familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency (caused by defective ABCA1), neonatal surfactant deficiency (ABCA3), several forms of retinal dystrophies (ABCR/ABCA4) and two types of hereditary keratinization disorders (ABCA12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a new member of the rodent ABC A-transporter subfamily, designated Abca17, has been identified which codes for a 1733 amino acid full-size transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The function of Abca17 is presently unknown, however, its exclusive expression in spermatocytes suggests that this novel transporter may be implicated in lipid transport during spermatogenesis. In this study, we identified the human ortholog of Abca17. We report the surprising finding that the human equivalent of the rodent <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene is a transcribed, nonprocessd pseudogene (<italic>ABCA17P</italic>) which forms a unique complex of overlapping genes with the surfactant deficiency gene <italic>ABCA3</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bioinformatic prediction of human <italic>ABCA17</italic></title><p>Homology searches based on the cDNA sequences of rat and mouse Abca17 and of human ABCA3, respectively, revealed the existence of a homologous gene in the human genome. The identified gene locus on human chromosome 16p13.3 exhibits 84.9%, 85.5% and 90.1% identity with the respective cDNA sequences of mouse/rat Abca17 and human ABCA3. The identification of several EST sequences with identities &#x0003e;99%, as retrieved by BLAT search (UCSC Genome Browser), provided an additional independent clue for the existence of a human homolog of the rodent <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene and it also strongly suggested that it was transcriptionally active. Moreover, homology analyses using the gene prediction program GNOMON resulted in the identification of a 3483 base pair (bp) cDNA sequence [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM_372609">XM_372609</ext-link>] denoted "Homo sapiens similar to ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 3; ATP-binding cassette 3; ABC transporter 3 (LOC390669), mRNA". This sequence exhibits 100% identity with the retrieved genomic sequence which is composed of 21 exons. It contains an open reading frame encoding a putative 1160 amino acid (aa) polypeptide with two nucleotide binding folds and two transmembrane domains, each consisting of three membrane spanning segments and thus predicts a novel member of the ABC A-transporter subfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>The human homolog of the rodent <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene is transcriptionally active but contains numerous mutations</title><p>To authenticate the existence of a transcribed human homolog of rodent Abca17, we performed RT-PCR using multiple sets of primers specific for the putative ABCA17 coding sequence. In fact, this approach confirmed that the human homolog of <italic>Abca17 </italic>is expressed and sequencing of overlapping PCR fragments revealed a full-length transcript of 4.2 kb size. The detailed cDNA sequence has been deposited with the NCBI GenBank Database [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ266102">DQ266102</ext-link>]. The 4.2 kb transcript is significantly shorter than that observed for mouse (5202 bp) and rat Abca17 (5322 bp), respectively, strongly suggesting that the human gene is truncated.</p><p>Unexpectedly, detailed analysis of the human ABCA17 cDNA revealed the presence of numerous mutations including deletions, frameshifts and premature stop codons which preclude its translation into a functional ABC transporter protein product. Based on this, we refer to the human homolog of rodent <italic>Abca17 </italic>as "<italic>ABCA17P</italic>". An alignment of a hypothetical translation of the ABCA17P main transcript with the mouse Abca17 polypeptide sequence is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> which details the topology of the ABCA17P mutations relative to its functional murine counterpart. The longest open reading frame is located in the center portion of the ABCA17P cDNA sequence and comprises 1092 bp. It predicts a hypothetical ABC transporter fragment of 361 amino acids size which contains three transmembrane spanning segments that corresponds to the N-terminal moiety of the second transmembrane domain of full-size ABC transporters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the human ABCA17P nucleotide sequence displays highest identity with mouse (58%) and rat (51%) Abca17. These relatively low overall sequence homologies are not surprising because of the presence of several non-homologous gaps within the ABCA17P sequence. Consistent with this, more detailed segmental BLAT analysis revealed significantly higher homologies (78&#x02013;90%) between the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene and the corresponding exons of the mouse <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene (not shown). Moreover, interspecies comparison of the genomic microenvironments revealed that the human, mouse and rat genes are flanked by homologous genes indicating that the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene is indeed the human ortholog of the rodent <italic>Abca17 </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene structure of human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and identification of a novel mouse Abca17 exon 1</title><p>The gene structure of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene was determined by BLAT analysis on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the identified full-length transcript. The latter displayed 100% identity with a total of 17 adjacent genomic segments (= exons) which span an 88 kb region on chromosome 16p13.3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Of note, systematic database searches and RT-PCR cloning experiments revealed transcripts that originate from an additional first exon (designated exon 1b, see below) positioned 1.8 kb upstream of the initially identified exon 1 (referred to as exon 1a) indicating that the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene is in fact composed of 18 exons. The size of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene corresponds to that of other ABC A-subfamily members which ranges from 21 kb (<italic>ABCA2</italic>) to 449 kb (<italic>ABCA13</italic>). However, the fact that functional ABC A-transporters are routinely encoded by at least 38 exons the presence of only 17 exonic segments strongly suggests that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>is a truncated gene. Analysis of the exon/intron organization of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>demonstrated that exon sizes range from 85 to 1141 bp and introns vary in size between 0.2 and 21.8 kb (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All exon-intron boundaries showed the presence of the canonical dinucleotide GT-AG configuration which are diagnostic of splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, close examination of the chromosomal microenvironment of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>locus revealed that it borders on another ABC A-transporter gene, the lung surfactant deficiency gene <italic>ABCA3</italic>. Both genes are arranged in head-to-head orientation on opposite strands and overlap at their 5' ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Importantly, we found that the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>exon 1b is localized between exons 1 and 2 of the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene and the overlap region (distance between <italic>ABCA17P </italic>exon 1b and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>exon 1) spans 1.2kb. Thus, the human <italic>ABCA17P/ABCA3 </italic>locus represents a unique overlapping complex of a gene and its pseudogene from which both a protein-coding and a non-coding RNA are transcribed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>).</p><p>Beside the observation of overlapping 5' ends, we found significant overall homology between the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes (47%). Segmental sequence comparison revealed discrete regions of high sequence identity between both genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). For example, exons 6&#x02013;9 and exons 13&#x02013;16, respectively, of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene exhibit sequence homologies ranging between 70% and 98% with distinct exons of the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Moreover, we observed that <italic>ABCA3 </italic>exon 30 is highly homologous to a sequence within intron 14 of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene. These sequence homologies in exonic regions together with the chromosomal neighborhood of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes strongly suggest that both genes have originated by duplication of an ancestral gene.</p><p>Interestingly, cDNA sequence comparisons revealed that exon 2 of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>corresponds to exon 1 of the published rodent Abca17 gene suggesting the existence of an additional 5' exon in the rodent genome. Indeed, similarity searches in EST databases led to the identification of an EST sequence [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CB272331">CB272331</ext-link>] which exhibits nearly 100% identity at its 3' end with the 5' portion of the published mouse Abca17 cDNA. RT-PCR and sequencing experiments confirmed the existence of the novel first exon in the mouse <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene (see NCBI [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ660313">DQ660313</ext-link>]). The novel exon 1 is localized 3.7 kb upstream of the previously published first exon and thus places the mouse <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene in closer proximity to its neighbor <italic>Abca3 </italic>with an intergenic region of only 1.0 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Of note, the novel exon 1 displays only low homology (&#x0003c;45%) with <italic>ABCA17P </italic>exon 1a and 1b, respectively, indicating that the first exons of the mouse <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene and its human ortholog are structurally unrelated.</p><p>In the rat genome, the <italic>Abca3 </italic>and <italic>Abca17 </italic>genes are arranged in the same head-to-head orientation as in the mouse and human genomes. Both genes border on each other but do not overlap and each of the genes encodes a full-size ABC transporter. In addition, we also found evidence for tandem arrangement of the <italic>Abca3 </italic>and <italic>Abca17 </italic>genes in the dog and cow genomes (not shown).</p><p>To test whether or not the <italic>ABCA17 </italic>gene is intact in additional mammalian species, we assembled the putative ABCA17 cDNA sequences of dog, cow, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey, respectively, based on available genomic information and sequence identity with the mouse Abca17 cDNA. Using this approach, we identified a 5189 bp and a 5187 bp open reading frame in the dog and the cow which potentially encode ABCA17 full-size transporters in either species [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. Moreover, EST database searches demonstrated the existence of several cow EST sequences with homologies &#x0003e;98% to the 5' and 3' ends of the predicted cDNA strongly suggesting that the cow <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene is transcribed. Conversely, analysis of the <italic>ABCA17 </italic>loci in the chimpanzee and the rhesus monkey genomes revealed numerous sequence alterations including preliminary stop codons, frameshifts, and splice site mutations in multiple exon candidates (not shown) consistent with the view that the <italic>ABCA17 </italic>genes of both of these primate species are indeed pseudogenes.</p><p>Intriguingly, during our cloning experiments we found evidence for multiple alternatively spliced transcripts of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene. Moreover, combined database searches and cloning experiments revealed the presence of an alternative transcription start site upstream of the one that we initially identified which initiates an alternative exon 1 ("exon 1b"). The sequence of the alternative exon 1b has been deposited in the NCBI GenBank under [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ660314">DQ660314</ext-link>]. Together, these findings predict that up to 20 RNA variants are transcribed from the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Our sequencing experiments using pooled cDNA derived from 50 individuals, also resulted in the identification of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (C2297T, G2326T) in the ABCA17P transcript.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific expression of human <italic>ABCA17P</italic></title><p>The tissue-specific expression of human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>was characterized using Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN) Blots and the BD&#x02122; Multiple Tissue Expression Human Array 3 (MTE) containing poly-A<sup>+ </sup>mRNA from various human tissues. Consistent with our RT-PCR cloning results, Northern blot analysis demonstrated the existence of an ABCA17P RNA of app. 4.3 kb size. This transcript was present in virtually all tissues examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Highest expression was found in glandular tissue (salivary gland, adrenal gland and pancreas), heart (left ventricle and apex) and fetal tissues (kidney and liver) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In contrast, ABCA17P RNA expression levels in testis and lung were rather low. The tissue-specific expression pattern of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>thus clearly differs from that of its genomic neighbor <italic>ABCA3 </italic>and also its rodent ortholog <italic>Abca17 </italic>which are almost exclusively expressed in the lung and the testis, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we identified the human ortholog of the rodent ABC transporter Abca17. Unexpectedly, we found that this novel ABC A-transporter member is a ubiquitously transcribed pseudogene (<italic>ABCA17P</italic>) which structurally overlaps with the gene for the lung surfactant regulator ABCA3. The existence of a pseudogene homologous to <italic>ABCA3 </italic>(referred to as <italic>ABCA3P1</italic>) has recently been proposed in an <italic>in silico </italic>genomic survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The authors noted that <italic>ABCA3P1 </italic>consists of 7 exons and borders on the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene at a distance of 50 kb. Our results strongly suggest that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3P1 </italic>are identical, however, they indicate that <italic>ABCA17P/ABCA3P1 </italic>consists of a total of 17 exons and overlaps with the ABCA3 gene at their common 5' end.</p><p>Overlapping genes are often functionally or structurally related and genes transcribed from opposite strands of the same genomic locus may, depending on the exact structure of the locus, either regulate each other through antisense-based mechanisms, or may be coordinately regulated due to the common use of a bidirectional promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An example for such a functional complex of overlapping genes is the <italic>ABCG5/ABCG8 </italic>locus. The <italic>ABCG5 </italic>and <italic>ABCG8 </italic>genes, which encode two highly homologous half-size ABC transporters, are juxtaposed on chromosome 2p21 and transcribed from a common bidirectional promoter which drives their coordinate expression. Our finding that the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes overlap is thus not without precedence within the human ABC transporter gene family. However, the situation in the <italic>ABCA17P/ABCA3 </italic>locus clearly differs from that of the <italic>ABCG5/ABCG8 </italic>gene complex because <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>partially overlap in their transcribed regions and both genes exhibit significant differences in their tissue-specific expression patterns.</p><p>The immediate physical proximity of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes is also observed in the mouse. Systematic analysis of the mouse <italic>Abca17 </italic>&#x02013; <italic>Abca3 </italic>gene border resulted in the identification of a novel first exon of the <italic>Abca17 </italic>gene, which is located 3.7 kb upstream of the previously reported exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our findings narrow down the distance between the first exons of the <italic>Abca17 </italic>and <italic>Abca3 </italic>genes to a region of only 1 kb, however, we did not find evidence that both transcription units overlap. Consistent with this, the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>expression pattern differs considerably from that of its rodent ortholog <italic>Abca17 </italic>which is exclusively expressed in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is thus likely that the overlap between the 5' ends of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes, which is absent from the mouse <italic>Abca17/Abca3 </italic>locus, constitutes the physical basis for the observed disparate tissue-specific expression of human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and mouse <italic>Abca17</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>ABCA17P/ABCA3 </italic>locus is unique because it is the first demonstration in the human genome that a pseudogene and its progenitor gene overlap. To our knowledge, this is also the first example of a pseudogene/gene pair that is transcribed from a common 5' end. The significant homology between the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene and its neighboring progenitor <italic>ABCA3 </italic>and their colocalization in the genome strongly suggest that both genes arose by duplication of an ancestor gene. The fact that <italic>Abca17 </italic>and <italic>Abca3 </italic>are also neighbors in the rodent genome and the genomes of the dog and the cow, respectively, indicates that the gene duplication arose before the boreoeutherian radiation which has been dated to app. 85 Myr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, our combined analyses of the genomes of the above species and those of the chimpanzee and the rhesus monkey suggest that the pseudogenization of the ABCA17 locus occurred after the divergence of rodents and primates.</p><p>Given the fact that mutations in the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene cause neonatal surfactant deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], our identification of the overlapping <italic>ABCA17P/ABCA3 </italic>locus confirms the observation that overlapping genes show a striking association with disease genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The distance between pseudogenes and their progenitor genes is inversely correlated with the likelihood for the transfer of mutations from a pseudogene to its functional gene by gene conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For example, it has been shown that deleterious mutations from <italic>ABCC6 </italic>pseudogenes are transferred to their parent gene <italic>ABCC6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast to the two known <italic>ABCC6 </italic>pseudogenes, which are located 1.3 Mb telomeric and 2.3 Mb centromeric of <italic>ABCC6</italic>, respectively, the distance between <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and its functional gene <italic>ABCA3 </italic>is zero. Thus, there is a high probability that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>serves as a repository for mutations in the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene. However, detailed sequence comparison between the known mutated exons in <italic>ABCA3 </italic>and their corresponding exons in <italic>ABCA17P </italic>revealed that all nucleotide positions in the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene that correspond to mutation sites in <italic>ABCA3 </italic>represent wildtype sequences. Moreover, <italic>in silico </italic>searches for gene conversion events in the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>exons 6&#x02013;9 and 13&#x02013;16, which share highest homology with <italic>ABCA3 </italic>exons, utilizing the program GENECONV did not yield statistically significant results (not shown). Together, these findings do not support the view that sequences of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>may have contributed mutations to <italic>ABCA3</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, we also found that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes share discrete regions of high homology. In particular, exons 8 and 15 of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene exhibit up to 98% sequence identity with the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>exons 16 and 31, respectively. The existence of these highly homologous DNA segments in both genes has immediate practical relevance because accidental amplification of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>sequences may provide erroneous results upon mutation analysis of the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene. Because <italic>ABCA17P </italic>is transcriptionally active in a broad spectrum of human tissues including the lung, the major production site of ABCA3, it also needs to be taken into account that ABCA17P transcripts may potentially interfere with ABCA3 mRNA expression analyses due to cross-hybridization of ABCA3 specific probes or RT-PCR primers with homologous pseudogene sequences.</p><p>Although recent computational approaches estimate that the number of pseudogenes in the human genome ranges between 14,000 and 19,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], only little is known about their biological significance. In particular, there is a great paucity of information on transcriptionally active pseudogenes. Considering that the most comprehensive study thus far focussing on transcribed pseudogenes suggests that up to 20% of the pseudogenes on chromosome 22 may indeed be transcriptionally active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that transcribed pseudogenes may serve defined biological functions rather than represent mere genomic fossils. This view is convincingly supported by a recent landmark paper that provided evidence for a specific function of a transcribed pseudogene by demonstrating that the expressed pseudogene <italic>makorin1-p1 </italic>regulates the stability of the mRNA of its progenitor gene <italic>makorin1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Another mechanism of specific pseudogene-gene interference has been identified for the antisense pseudogene <italic>anti-NOS </italic>whose transcript forms stable RNA-RNA complexes with the mRNA of <italic>nNOS </italic>and thus inhibits protein expression of its parent gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>At this point, the exact function of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene is unclear. However, <italic>ABCA17P </italic>stands out among the known transcribed pseudogenes in that it shares its 5' end with its functional counterpart. Due to this unique genomic architecture the putative <italic>ABCA17P </italic>promoter is part of the <italic>ABCA3 </italic>gene and vice versa. Moreover, the primary transcripts derived from both genes have a 1.2 kb overlap. It is thus conceivable that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>may mutually impact their promoter activities and the elongation rates of their primary transcripts due to steric interference of their transcription machineries. Such a scenario is supported by the largely complementary expression patterns of both genes in human tissues. More work is required to determine whether and to which degree <italic>ABCA17P </italic>is involved in the control of the disease gene <italic>ABCA3</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we identified the primary structure of the human ortholog of the recently cloned murine ABC transporter Abca17 and demonstrate that, unlike its rodent counterpart, it is a ubiquitously expressed pseudogene. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>ABCA17P </italic>overlaps with the gene for the lung surfactant regulator ABCA3 and sequence homology analyses strongly suggest that <italic>ABCA3 </italic>is the progenitor gene of <italic>ABCA17P</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the co-expression of a pseudogene and its progenitor gene from a common overlapping DNA region in the human genome. These unique genomic features suggest potential interdependencies between the regulation of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and the disease gene <italic>ABCA3</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of the human ABCA17P gene and its mammalian orthologs</title><p>The human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene was identified by systematic similarity searches using the BLAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the ParAlign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] software, respectively. The query sequences included the Abca17 cDNAs from rat [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196699">AB196699</ext-link>] and mouse [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB112584">AB112584</ext-link>] and the human ABCA3 cDNA [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001089">NM_001089</ext-link>]. The genomic sequence of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>locus was narrowed down by the adjacent genes <italic>ABCA3 </italic>and <italic>CCNF </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001761">NM_001761</ext-link>] and extracted from the UCSC Genome Browser (assembly May 2004, NCBI Build 35). For identification of available EST sequences specific for human <italic>ABCA17P</italic>, the genomic sequence of the <italic>ABCA17P </italic>locus was analyzed utilizing ParAlign and the UCSC Genome Browser. The gene structure of the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>gene and its genomic microenvironment was determined on the basis of the cloned human ABCA17P cDNA sequence using the BLAT algorithm. Potential CpG islands were identified in a genomic region extending from 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site to the first intron of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>using the CpG Island Searcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The programs SIXPACK and TMAP (EMBOSS) were used to establish open reading frames within the ABCA17P transcripts and identify potential transmembrane domains. The <italic>ABCA17 </italic>genes of cow, dog, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey, respectively, and their respective putative cDNAs were identified on the basis of available species-specific genomic sequence information and sequence homologies with the known human and rodent ABCA17 cDNAs. For this the conservation track in the UCSC Genome Browser was used. For statistical prediction of gene conversion events in the human <italic>ABCA17P </italic>and <italic>ABCA3 </italic>genes the software GENECONV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was utilized.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of human ABCA17P full-length cDNA sequence</title><p>Total RNA from human testis (pooled from 50 individuals) was purchased from Clontech and aliquots of 1 &#x003bc;g were reverse-transcribed in the presence of oligo-dT primers in a 20 &#x003bc;l RT reaction using the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was amplified using the Taq PCR Core Kit (Qiagen). The cycling conditions were 94&#x000b0;C 30s, 54&#x02013;60&#x000b0;C 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C 30s-3min followed by a final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. ABCA17P-specific cDNA segments were amplified utilizing sets of primers with highest homology to the coding region of rat and mouse Abca17, respectively. Missing interspersed segments were amplified using primers specific for the identified fragments and published EST sequences. Amplification primers which resulted in the identification of alternatively spliced RNA variants were TCACGCACTGTCTTTCCTTG/CCAGTACAATGGAACTGATGATG (ABCA17P&#x00394;-85, ABCA17P&#x00394;-213), GCCCTGAAGTCAAGCAGGT/CCAATGGGACATTTTCTATGC (ABCA17P&#x00394;-162) and TGAGGTCCCATAGCAGAGTG (ABCA17P&#x00394;-387, ABCA17P&#x00394;-486), respectively.

The tissue specific expression of <italic>ABCA17P </italic>was characterized using the BD&#x02122; MTE Multiple Tissue Expression Human Array 3 (Clontech). The array is normalized to the mRNA expression levels of eight different housekeeping genes and thus allows for semiquantitative poly-A<sup>+ </sup>RNA expression profiling in &#x0003e;70 distinct human tissues. A 0.4kb ABCA17P specific probe was generated by RT-PCR using primers that were derived from a region of minimal homology between ABCA17P and other ABC A-transporter nucleotide sequences. The primers used were TGCGCTTCAGTTACTTTCAGA and CCAGTACAATGGAACTGATGATG. For signal detection, the probe was radiolabeled with Ready-To-Go&#x02122; DNA Labeling Beads and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridization and washing steps were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization signals were visualized and quantitated in an electronic autoradiography system (Packard InstantImager). Individual activity signals were translated into a linear integer scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0, no expression; 4 maximum expression) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KBFH, PK, WEK supervised the project.
