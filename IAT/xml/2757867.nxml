However, interpretation of such studies is complicated because of the involvement of lymphopenic animals, as lymphopenia drastically alters naive T cell homeostasis and function. In this study, we explored naive CD8 T cell survival and function in nonlymphopenic conditions by using bone marrow chimeric donors and hosts in which class I MHC expression is absent or limited to radiosensitive versus radioresistant cells. We found that long-term survival of naive CD8 T cells (but not CD4 T cells) was impaired in the absence of class I MHC. However, distinct from this effect, class I MHC deprivation also enhanced naive CD8 T cell responsiveness to low-affinity (but not high-affinity) peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands. We found that this improved sensitivity was a consequence of up-regulated CD8 levels, which was mediated through a transcriptional mechanism. Hence, our data suggest that, in a nonlymphopenic setting, self-class I MHC molecules support CD8 T cell survival, but that these interactions also attenuate naive T cell sensitivity by dynamic tuning of CD8 levels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The persistence of a functional pool of lymphocytes is critical to keeping the adaptive immune system ready to respond to pathogens and transformed cells. It is currently believed that maintenance of functional T cells in the periphery is an active process. However, the factors involved in regulating T cell homeostasis and functional reactivity are poorly understood, in part because these factors may vary depending on the T cell subset (e.g., CD4 or CD8 populations), their differentiation state (naive, effector, or memory), and the overall size of T cell pool (lymphoreplete versus lymphopenic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marrack and Kappler, 2004</xref>).</p><p>For CD8 T cells, several studies compared the recovery of donor cells from class I MHC (MHC I)&#x02013;deficient hosts to that from WT hosts, concluding that T cell interaction with MHC is critical for the survival of naive T cells, but irrelevant for memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanchot et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nesi&#x00107; and Vukmanovi&#x00107;, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murali-Krishna et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sprent and Surh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markiewicz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Surh and Sprent, 2005</xref>). However, a feature of these studies is the reliance on analysis of lymphopenic hosts to determine survival of naive CD8 T cells. As subsequent studies have indicated, lymphopenic conditions increase availability of homeostatic cytokines and can also drive proliferation and differentiation of naive T cells, through lymphopenia-driven homeostatic proliferation, which involves TCR engagement with self-peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ernst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kieper and Jameson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldrath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jameson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marrack and Kappler, 2004</xref>). Consideration of the impact of lymphopenia in previous studies has reopened the debate about the role of MHC molecules in maintenance of both CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jameson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorfman and Germain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Germain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandjean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, studies suggest that, in the absence of class II MHC (MHC-II) molecules, naive CD4 T cells survive efficiently in lymphoreplete hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke and Rudensky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorfman et al., 2000</xref>), but decline in a lymphopenic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takeda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brocker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rooke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Witherden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labrecque et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorfman and Germain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Germain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jameson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandjean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, there have been no similar comprehensive studies of the requirement for MHC-I in maintenance of CD8 T cells under nonlymphopenic conditions. This is due, at least in part, to complications in adoptive transfer approaches; WT T cells transferred into MHC-I&#x02013;deficient recipients are rejected because of a small host CD8 T cell pool highly responsive to MHC-I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ljunggren et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vugmeyster et al., 1998</xref>), a problem that is not encountered in transfer of WT cells in MHC-II&#x02013;deficient hosts.</p><p>A related issue is the identity of the MHC-expressing host cell populations that are required for T cell survival. Data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brocker (1997)</xref> suggested that MHC-II expression on DCs was essential for maintenance of CD4 T cells, and that restricted expression of MHC-I on DCs was sufficient for homeostasis of CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruber and Brocker, 2005</xref>). However, studies using BM chimeras suggested that class I expression on either radiosensitive or radioresistant cells was sufficient for maintenance of CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markiewicz et al., 2003</xref>). Once again, however, interpretation of these data is complicated by the use of lymphopenic recipient animals.</p><p>Recent studies suggest self-peptide&#x02013;MHC molecules may have more important effect on T cell function than simple survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stefanov&#x000e1; et al. (2002)</xref> showed that the exposure of naive CD4 T cells in MHC-II&#x02013;deprived condition results in an immediate reduction in sensitivity to foreign antigens associated with the loss of basal phosphorylation and polarization of TCR. Likewise, in the absence of MHC-II ligands, memory CD4 T cells were maintained, yet became functionally impaired (as measured by skin graft rejection; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kassiotis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Riva et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al.

However, polar opposite results have also been reported. Naive CD4 T cells deprived of the contact with MHC-II were shown to exhibit a more vigorous Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after TCR triggering with high-affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2001</xref>), in parallel with decreased levels of CD5, which acts as a negative regulator of TCR signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tarakhovsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2001</xref>).

Here again, the fact that experiments were performed under lymphopenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhandoola et al., 2002</xref>) versus lymphoreplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>) conditions may contribute to these apparently contradictory results, but this has not been directly addressed.</p><p>CD8 is a coreceptor required to enhance the sensitivity of CD8 T cells, at least in part because of the activity of Lck bound to its intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zamoyska et al., 2003</xref>) and CD8's ability to stabilize interactions between MHC-I and TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schott and Ploegh, 2002</xref>).

Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al. (2007)</xref> reported that signals of common &#x003b3;-chain cytokines, including IL-2, -7, and -15, increase CD8&#x003b1; expression at the transcriptional level. This action is impaired by signals via TCR, strikingly reflecting the TCR signal intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>). However, the role of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC-I for the CD8 tuning has not been directly examined.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the survival and function of naive CD8 T cells in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient hosts under lymphoreplete condition. To allow for transfer of cells across an MHC-I mismatch barrier, we used BM chimeras for both donors and hosts in these experiments. We report that the long-term survival of naive CD8 T cells was impaired in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient condition. However, naive CD8 T cells deprived of contact with MHC-I molecules showed phenotypic and functional evidence of retuning. This included elevated transcription and cell surface expression of CD8, which we show leads to enhanced responsiveness to low-affinity TCR ligands. These data demonstrate that engagement with self-MHC class I molecules, in a lymphoreplete environment, leads to divergent effects on CD8 T cell survival versus functional sensitivity.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Loss of MHC-I availability in a lymphoreplete setting leads to reduced long-term maintenance of naive CD8 T cells</title><p>Normal lymphocytes are rejected when transferred to unmanipulated MHC-I&#x02013;deficient mice (including K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, &#x003b2;2m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b2;2m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals) because of residual host CD8 T cells that respond vigorously to WT levels of MHC-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ljunggren et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vugmeyster et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, we initially studied BM chimeric hosts that are partially deficient of &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; class I MHC molecules (referred to as MHC-I) and are expected to be tolerant to WT donor cells. This included K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT and reciprocal WT &#x02192; K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> chimeras (WT &#x02192; WT chimeras were also used as a control chimeric host). CFSE-labeled B6 donor cells were transferred and, 30 d later, analyzed for maintenance and division. Naive (CD44<sup>lo</sup>) donor CD8 T cells remained CFSE<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) and were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>) equivalently in all hosts. As expected, the absolute number of donor naive CD4 cells recovered was comparable in all hosts, indicating that these chimeras were tolerant to MHC-I&#x02013;positive donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Importantly, the lack of proliferation of the donor naive T cells confirms that the hosts are functionally lymphoreplete. These data also suggest that maintenance of naive CD8 T cells in animals was similar whether the predominant expression of MHC-I molecules was on radiosensitive or radioresistant cells.

To exclude a role for MHC-I on donor cells themselves, we used T cells from K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT chimeras as the source of donor cells. Because of availability of MHC-I on thymic stroma, these animals generate a pool of MHC-I&#x02013;restricted CD8 T cells, but the donor cells themselves are K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>. As MHC-deficient hosts, we used unmanipulated K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> chimeras. Alternatively, we used K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT and WT &#x02192; K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts to limit MHC-I expression to radioresistant versus radiosensitive cells, respectively. Because K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells are present in all of these hosts, we expected that they would be tolerant of the K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor cells.</p><p>At 30 d after transfer into these various hosts, CD44<sup>lo</sup> (naive) phenotype donor CD8 T cells retained high levels of CFSE, indicating a lack of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). However, maintenance of donor CD8 T cells was reduced in fully MHC-I&#x02013;deficient hosts compared with K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT hosts (in which MHC-I is expressed by radioresistant cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>). This impaired persistence was not observed for the cotransferred CD4 T cells, arguing against rejection or some generalized decrease in donor cell survival in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts. Nevertheless, the persistence of CD8 T cells at this frequency for 30 d in the absence of MHC-I is greater than might be predicted from previous studies (conducted in lymphopenic conditions) that suggested almost complete loss of naive CD8 T cells within 14 d after transfer into MHC-I&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanchot et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nesi&#x00107; and Vukmanovi&#x00107;, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markiewicz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hao et al., 2006</xref>). We used K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT chimeras as a MHC-I&#x02013;expressing host to avoid potential NK rejection concerns that would be associated with transfer into WT hosts. Surprisingly, we observed rejection of K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor cells in WT &#x02192; K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts (unpublished data); thus, these chimeras were excluded in further studies.</p><p>The half-life of naive CD8 T cells in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient environments has been estimated to be between 2 and 7 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanchot et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorfman and Germain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markiewicz et al., 2003</xref>), whereas studies in which TCR expression was postthymically ablated suggested a naive CD8 T cell half-life of 16&#x02013;19 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labrecque et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polic et al., 2001</xref>). As previously discussed, interpretation of these studies is complicated by lymphopenia in the host animals. To track how host MHC-I influences naive CD8 T cell survival in lymphoreplete hosts, we determined the decay rate of donor K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT hosts until 60 d after transfer. Donor CD8 (and CD4) T cells were detected above background at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>); however, there was a clear difference in the maintenance of the donor CD8 pool in the MHC-I&#x02013;deficient and &#x02013;sufficient hosts. Although we estimated a half-life of 21 d for polyclonal CD8 T cells in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT hosts, the half-life was reduced to &#x0223c;10 d in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>), which is consistent with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>. In contrast, the half-life for naive CD4 T cells was similar in the two hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Our estimated half-lives for CD4 T cells suggested a faster decay rate than those reported in some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hataye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polic et al., 2001</xref>). The reason for this difference is not clear, but does not appear related to use of chimeric hosts because we observed similar half lives using both chimeric and nonchimeric hosts (unpublished data), and our data are consistent with an overall average life span of peripheral naive T cells of 5&#x02013;8 wk, as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">von Boehmer and Hafen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tough and Sprent, 1994</xref>). To control for variability in donor cell maintenance, we also assessed the ratio of donor CD8 to CD4 T cells in individual animals. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the increased decay rate of CD8 cells in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts also lead to a statistically significant difference in the donor CD8/CD4 ratio compared with the K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT hosts.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired survival of CD8 T cells in the complete absence of MHC-I.</bold> Purified K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphocytes (Thy1.1) from K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT BM chimeras were transferred (3&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/mouse) to normal K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x02192; WT BM chimeras.

Analysis of this response also revealed an enhanced response by MHC-I deprived OT-I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 g</xref>). Both of these assays monitored early activation responses, and we also tested proliferation, as a late functional response. Using a CFSE dye dilution assay, we observed similar proliferative potential of OT-I cells derived from either normal or MHC-I&#x02013;deficient environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 h</xref>). This result might suggest that the effects of MHC-I deprivation do not affect all responses equally, and/or that these effects are transient and are lost during longer term functional assays. This issue is explored further in the Discussion.</p><p>Hence, our studies suggested that the phenotypic and functional changes associated with MHC-I deprivation of CD8 T cells arose between 2 and 24 h (and was maintained for at least 14 d), and led to enhancement of early functional responses to low-affinity ligands.</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced reactivity of MHC-I&#x02013;deprived T cells is attributable to increased CD8 levels</title><p>Our studies showed that OT-I T cell transfer into MHC-I&#x02013;deficient hosts caused both enhanced reactivity to the weak agonist G4/K<sup>b</sup> and an increase in CD8 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that changes in CD8 expression or accessibility cannot ably affect T cell sensitivity and ligand binding, especially for low-affinity peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jameson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feinerman et al., 2008</xref>), but the observation that MHC-I deprivation only lead to an increase of &#x0223c;25% in CD8 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5 a</xref>) left open the question of its mechanistic relevance for the changes in T cell sensitivity.

As has been suggested by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holler and Kranz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>), these data suggest that low-affinity ligand engagement and/or reactivity is strongly influenced by the availability of the CD8 coreceptor. However, the OT-I response to OVAp does involve CD8 because stimulation of OT-I cells with low doses of OVAp is highly sensitive to CD8 blockade (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082553/DC1">Fig. S4 c</ext-link>), indicating that this blockade becomes inefficient when TCR stimulation is in excess.</p><p>Anti-CD8&#x003b1; antibody (clone 53&#x02013;6.7) showed blocking properties similar to 53&#x02013;5.8 (Fig. S4, a and b), although they were slightly less effective (Fig. S4 c). These results might at first appear to contradict previous studies (including our own; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daniels and Jameson, 2000</xref>) showing that 53&#x02013;6.7 enhances binding of cognate peptide&#x02013;MHC tetramers to OT-I cells, whereas 53&#x02013;5.8 blocks this binding. This can be explained by the capacity of the CD8 antibodies, under physiological conditions, to induce capping and internalization of CD8; however, this will not occur in the flow cytometric assays used to measure peptide&#x02013;MHC tetramer binding.</p><p>We next used the same approach to determine whether the enhanced CD8 expression levels seen on class I&#x02013;deprived OT-I cells could account for their improved G4/K<sup>b</sup> sensitivity. At 36 h after adoptive transfer, donor OT-I cells exhibited an &#x0223c;15% increase in CD8&#x003b2; expression when recovered from the lymph nodes of K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts compared with WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 c</xref>, no Ab), and the class I&#x02013;deprived population showed enhanced reactivity toward G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 d</xref>, left). Treatment of the class I&#x02013;deprived OT-I cells with low dose (1/102,400) of the anti-CD8&#x003b2; antibody resulted in available CD8 levels being reduced to those found in the WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 c</xref>). Interestingly, this antibody treatment lead to a corresponding decrease in reactivity toward G4, resembling the response of OT-I cells from a WT host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 d</xref>, left). As expected, the response to high-dose OVAp was not affected by either the MHC-I expression status of the host, or partial CD8 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, d</xref> right). Once again, the anti-CD8&#x003b1; antibody, 53&#x02013;6.7, yielded similar results (Fig. S4, d and e). Hence, these results suggested that MHC-I&#x02013;deprivation led to enhanced OT-I T cell reactivity primarily because of increased CD8 expression levels.</p></sec><sec><title>MHC-I deprivation regulates CD8 levels at the level of transcription</title><p>We next sought to determine the mechanism by which CD8 levels are regulated by exposure to MHC-I molecules. At least two models can be imagined. In the first, MHC-I deprivation induces up-regulation (transcriptional or translational) of CD8. In the second model, encounter of CD8 with self-MHC-I molecules might lead to internalization of cell surface CD8.</p><p>To test these models, we developed an in vitro system where CD8 T cells could be more easily manipulated. T cells were cultured overnight in the presence or absence of anti-K<sup>b</sup> and anti-D<sup>b</sup> monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, such treatment revealed that anti&#x02013;MHC-I blockade led to up-regulation of CD8&#x003b1; and CD8&#x003b2; levels on CD8ve T cells from both polyclonal B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 a</xref>) and OT-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 b</xref>) animals. This was not a nonspecific effect because expression of CD4 by polyclonal B6 T cells was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 a</xref>). Furthermore, cell treatment with anti-CD45.2 antibodies (which, like anti&#x02013;class I antibodies, would bind all cells in the culture) did not affect CD8 expression levels (unpublished data). Thus, anti&#x02013;class I antibody blockade appears to specifically up-regulate CD8 expression levels. Notably, the elevation in CD8 levels was completely abrogated when actinomycin D or cycloheximide (which inhibit transcription and protein synthesis, respectively) were added to the in vitro cultures. These data suggest that the increase in CD8 expression after MHC-I blockade is caused by altered transcription.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased transcription of CD8 gene after deprived of MHC-I contact.</bold> Spleen cells from B6 (a) OT-I (a) and E8<sub>I</sub>-CD4 transgenic mice (c) were cultured for 24 h in the absence (control) or presence of anti-K<sup>b</sup> and anti-D<sup>b</sup> antibodies.

This is in large part caused by donor&#x02013;host histoincompatibility issues, which have typically been solved by the use of lymphopenic hosts for adoptive transfer experiments. With the understanding that lymphopenia-driven homeostatic proliferation affects T cell proliferation, differentiation, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorfman and Germain, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Germain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grandjean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jameson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2006</xref>), these studies must be interpreted with care. Alternative approaches have used TCR ablation by genetic means, including cre-lox TCR gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polic et al., 2001</xref>) and tet regulatable TCR&#x003b1; transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labrecque et al., 2001</xref>). However, conclusions from these studies are also complicated because T cell development is terminated in such systems, and because these approaches test the role of the TCR itself, rather than its encounter with self-MHC molecules, during T cell maintenance. In the current study, we make use of established radiation BM chimeras and short-term adoptive transfer experiments to examine how the presence of MHC-I impacts CD8 T cell maintenance under lymphoreplete conditions.</p><p>Our data on naive CD8 T cell survival in the absence of classical MHC-I molecules suggest a much more gradual decline than has previously been reported. We find that the CD8 T cell half-life changed from &#x0223c;21 to &#x0223c;10 d in WT versus K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts, respectively. Earlier studies reported fast decay rates in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient hosts, with almost complete disappearance of donor CD8 T cells by 2&#x02013;14 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanchot et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markiewicz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hao et al., 2006</xref>). However, such studies were conducted in lymphopenic hosts that would allow at least some CD8 T cells to undergo efficient homeostatic proliferation in the WT host. In addition, most previous studies used MHC-I&#x02013;expressing donor CD8 T cells in their studies, which would allow for MHC-I recognition after T&#x02013;T interactions. The absence of CFSE dye dilution in any of the hosts in our study rules out homeostatic proliferation as a basis for their improved maintenance in MHC-I&#x02013;sufficient hosts, but the basis for naive CD8 T cell decline in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient hosts is not yet clear. Interestingly, we observed a reduced expression of the IL-7R&#x003b1; chain (CD127) on MHC-I&#x02013;deprived CD8 T<sup>+</sup> cells. Because IL-7 is a critical survival factor for naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jameson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marrack and Kappler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Surh and Sprent, 2005</xref>), reduced CD127 levels may suggest decreased survival potential. This interpretation is complicated, however, by the finding that CD127 expression is reduced after its engagement by IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2004</xref>), so low CD127 levels can also be a result of efficient IL-7 encounter. Despite the more rapid decay rate of CD8 T cells in MHC-I&#x02013;deficient environments, a small number of CD8 T cells clearly survived as late as 60 d after transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>). This could be caused by a uniform decay rate of the entire population or reflect variability in the requirement for MHC-I recognition, such that some clones are highly sensitive to MHC-I deprivation, whereas others are independent of self-MHC-I ligands. In our studies using OT-I T cells, we noted that their survival was equivalent by day 14 after transfer into MHC-I&#x02013;deficient and control hosts (unpublished data), suggesting that not all clones follow the same decay kinetics. However, analysis of TCR V&#x003b2; usage could not demonstrate a significant bias in the overall repertoire of polyclonal CD8 T cells persisting to day 20 after transfer into WT versus K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts. Nevertheless, further studies will be required to determine whether all CD8 T cells exhibit similar requirements for self-MHC-I for their maintenance. Importantly, our data suggesting a role for MHC-I in the maintenance of polyclonal CD8 T cells contrasts with strong evidence for equivalent survival of CD4 T cells in MHC-II&#x02013;deficient and &#x02013;sufficient hosts (under lymphoreplete conditions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke and Rudensky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorfman et al., 2000</xref>). TCR ablation studies also report faster decay rates for naive CD8 T cells versus CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labrecque et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polic et al., 2001</xref>). Together with our data, these findings suggest distinct requirements for TCR-mediated survival signals within the naive CD4 and CD8 populations.</p><p>By use of distinct BM chimeric hosts, we unexpectedly found a differential role of MHC-I expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Although MHC-I expression in either compartment appeared sufficient to mediate normal CD8 T cell survival, changes in CD8 expression level were more marked when MHC-I was lacking on radioresistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, at short time points, phenotypic and functional aspects of CD8 tuning were more apparent in lymph nodes than in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and c</xref>). At steady state, T cells are thought to migrate within the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs along a network formed by nonhematopoietic stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baj&#x000e9;noff et al., 2006</xref>), and it was recently reported that IL-7 is mainly produced by fibroblastic reticular stromal cells (gp38<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD35<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) in T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Link et al., 2007</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that such radioresistant stromal cells may offer both IL-7 and self-peptide&#x02013;MHC-I molecules to circulating CD8 T cells, and thus regulate the T cell's tuning.</p><p>Previous studies on the impact of self-MHC molecules on T cell sensitivity have yielded strikingly divergent results. Because of the issues with CD8 T cell rejection discussed, such studies have mostly focused on CD4 T cells. Published works indicated that MHC-II&#x02013;deprived CD4 T cells have elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhandoola et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2001</xref>) or diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stefanov&#x000e1; et al., 2002</xref>) sensitivity to antigen, or that intrinsic antigen sensitivity is intact in such cells, but their in vivo reactivity is impaired because of lost motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>). These studies varied in their use of lymphopenic hosts, but also covered a range of time points (from hours to months) in the analysis of CD4 T cell sensitivity. Therefore, it was possible that the discrepancies between the studies could be explained by suggesting that MHC deprivation caused initial desensitization of T cell sensitivity (involving lost basal TCR signaling and polarization of TCR), followed by a compensatory retuning (involving reduced CD5 expression) allowing for improved functional sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hogquist et al., 2003</xref>). Although such a model may still apply to CD4 T cells, our data with CD8 T cells suggest a distinct model, in that MHC-I deprivation (whether for 2 h, 24 h, or 14 d) did not impact sensitivity to strong agonist peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, b&#x02013;e</xref>). However, sensitivity to weak agonist ligands, assessed in vitro, was enhanced after MHC-I deprivation for as little as 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>), and this increased reactivity was maintained for at least 2 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). Although we could confirm and extend previous works suggesting self-MHC deprivation results in decreased CD5 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5 a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2001</xref>), our data also indicated that the functionally relevant change is enhanced CD8 expression. We observed a modest, but reproducible, increase in CD8 expression by OT-I cells in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts, which correlated with their improved reactivity toward the weak agonist G4/K<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and c</xref>), and could demonstrate that mild blockade of CD8 expression levels restored G4/K<sup>b</sup> reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S4), supporting the model that CD8 fine tuning can explain the differential reactivity to low-affinity peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands.</p><p>The observation that MHC-I&#x02013;deprived OT-I T cell responsiveness to the strong agonist OVA/K<sup>b</sup> was not affected even at low doses is consistent with a selective role for CD8 tuning in qualitative regulation of low-affinity TCR ligands. CD8 plays an important role in TCR binding and reactivity for peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands, but this is more profound for low-affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holler and Kranz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maile et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, some data suggest the stability of low-affinity TCR interactions required for thymic positive selection is highly dependent on CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, our data are consistent with the model that MHC-I deprivation causes a compensatory change in CD8 levels, as the cells &#x0201c;cast around&#x0201d; for the low-affinity self-peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands that sustain their basal TCR signaling.</p><p>Initially, it might appear our data contradict studies showing that engagement with nonstimulatory peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands (including self-peptide&#x02013;MHC molecules) can enhance CD8 T cell responses to agonist ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Micheletti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cebecauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yachi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2007</xref>). However, our studies explore how MHC-I deprivation affects subsequent CD8 T cell responses, whereas those previous works test effects of simultaneous exposure to agonist and &#x0201c;coagonist&#x0201d; ligands. Indeed, because our functional studies use WT APCs (expressing the normal array of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands), it is quite feasible that the enhanced sensitivity we observe in the response to low-affinity agonists actually reflects enhanced recognition of self-coagonist ligands. Along these lines, it is worth noting that the cooperative effect of coagonists is most pronounced in the response to low affinity agonists and at early time points during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yachi et al., 2007</xref>), similar to our observations for MHC-I&#x02013;deprived CD8 T cells. It will be interesting to explore this model in future studies.</p><p>The mechanism by which MHC-I deprivation resulted in CD8 up-regulation was also explored. Our data revealed that blockade of MHC-I molecules lead to increased transcriptional activity at the CD8a gene, as revealed by use of transcriptional inhibitors and the E8<sub>I</sub>-CD4 reporter strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, b and c</xref>). CD8&#x003b2; is also elevated on MHC-I deprived CD8 T cells, and it is possible that this is also regulated transcriptionally. However, previous studies have shown that the requirement for mouse CD8b to associate with CD8&#x003b1; for surface expression leads to CD8&#x003b2; expression levels being strongly dependent on the expression level of <italic>Cd8&#x003b1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, our data suggest that loss of encounter with self-MHC-I molecules causes naive CD8 T cells to increase transcription and surface expression of CD8.</p><p>Our data also indicated that &#x0201c;tuning&#x0201d; of CD8 levels was reversible: CD8 T cells deprived of encounter with MHC class I up-regulated CD8, but upon reexposure to a normal environment CD8 expression levels were restored to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 d</xref>). This capacity for &#x0201c;retuning&#x0201d; CD8 expression levels might affect our ability to determine functional consequences of MHC-I deprivation. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, g and h</xref>), MHC-I deprivation led to enhanced early functional responses (induction of CD69, pc-Jun) but no changes in proliferation, in response to G4/K<sup>b</sup>. However, because these assays must (to be physiologically relevant) involve exposure of responding T cells to MHC-I molecules, retuning may occur during the assay, complicating interpretation of later responses (including proliferation). Analysis of other early activation events is complicated by the inability of G4/K<sup>b</sup> to induce detectable proximal activation in OT-I cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosette et al., 2001</xref>). Although further studies will be needed to explore this concept further, these data suggest that CD8 T cells might constantly fine-tune their CD8 expression levels to match their recent encounter with self-peptide&#x02013;MHC class I ligands.</p><p>The capacity of mature CD8 T cells to regulate their ligand binding and functional reactivity by dynamic &#x0201c;co-receptor tuning&#x0201d; has become clear over recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maile et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Singer's group showed that responsiveness to IL-7 enhances <italic>CD8&#x003b1;</italic> transcription, and that this pathway is blocked by TCR encounter with strong agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, terminating self-MHC interactions during thymic development enhanced CD8 expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Our data extend this model of Park et al. by focusing on the fate of mature peripheral CD8 T cells acutely deprived of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC-I molecules. In their work, the effect of IL-7 on coreceptor expression has been attributed to the activity of one of the enhancer elements, E8<sub>I</sub>, specifically used in mature CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>). It is interesting to note the fact that enhanced transcriptional regulation of the E8I-CD4 reporter system was seen in response to both encounter with IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2007</xref>) and MHC-I deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 c</xref>). Whether both systems involve the same elements within the <italic>CD8&#x003b1;</italic> promoter or E8<sub>I</sub> enhancer is not clear, but it is tempting to speculate that the regulatory processes could be overlapping. Our data showed that terminating the interaction with MHC-I ligands led to elevated CD8 expression, but decreased IL-7R&#x003b1; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5 a</xref>, and S2). As discussed earlier, impaired IL-7R expression is difficult to interpret, because it may arise by either reduced IL-7R expression or elevated IL-7R signaling&#x02014;both of which would involve decreased CD127 transcription and expression. Our data might indicate that deprivation of the basal interaction with self-MHC-I directly leads to impaired CD127 expression, which is an interesting contrast to the impact of strong TCR signals, which also leads to loss of CD127 expression. Further studies will be required to investigate whether prolonged loss of self-MHC encounters directly lead to reduced expression of IL-7R&#x003b1;, and whether this in turn accounts for the impaired long term survival of CD8 T cells in K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts.</p><p>In conclusion, we show the first evidence that self-peptide&#x02013;MHC-I complexes are required for efficient survival of polyclonal CD8 T cells in lymphoreplete hosts. At the same time, self-peptide&#x02013;MHC-I encounter also impairs CD8 T cell responsiveness toward low-affinity peptide&#x02013;MHC antigens through down-regulation of CD8, which may contribute to maintenance of T cell tolerance. These findings differ substantially from those observed for maintenance of CD4 T cells, suggesting fundamentally distinct roles of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC ligands in regulating the two T cell subsets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>WT C57BL/6 (B6; CD45.2, Thy1.2), B6.SJL (CD45.1), and B6.PL (Thy1.1) mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) or The Jackson Laboratory.
