The chemokine CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1&#x003b1; (SDF-1&#x003b1;), is a member of the CXC chemokine subfamily and serves as the only known ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR4 expressed on most leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mice lacking CXCL12 or CXCR4 die perinatally of cardiovascular, neurologic, vascular, and hematopoietic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]</p><p>The CXCR4 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and couples to heterotrimeric G-proteins of both the G<sub>&#x003b1;i </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Members of the G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>-family of G-proteins are pertussis toxin sensitive and pre-treatment of cells with pertussis toxin severely attenuates chemotaxis in response to chemokines. G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>-proteins are therefore thought to be essential for chemokine-mediated migration. Of the G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>-family, G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;i3 </sub>are strongly expressed by lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. G<sub>&#x003b1;i3</sub><sup>-/- </sup>mice are without phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] whereas G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub><sup>-/- </sup>mice display dysfunctional T cell functions as well as defective chemotaxis in response to chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>has been shown to be required for chemotaxis of dendritic cells and granulocytes, but not for T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR), the B cell receptor, or the Ly49D activating receptor all reduce lymphocyte migration toward CXCL12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggesting that cells dedicated to proliferation/differentiation are less sensitive towards chemokines. The opposite is also true, as cells exposed to CXCL12 show less phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and LAT following subsequent TCR activation indicating reciprocal regulation between CXCR4 and the TCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, recruitment of chemokine receptors into the immunological synapse has been shown to stabilize T cell-APC interaction through activation of a G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-dependent pathway. This renders the cell less responsive to chemotactic gradients and gives higher T cell proliferative responses and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recently, the TCR and CXCR4 were shown to closely associate upon CXCL12-stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and it was suggested that CXCR4 signaling occurs through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-domain present in the CD3&#x003b6; chain. Collectively, these results point to a direct crosstalk between the signaling machineries utilized by the TCR and CXCR4.</p><p>We have recently shown that G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>knockdown in T cells inhibits the activation of the Src family kinase Lck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>on Lck activation might be conferred by a direct interaction and/or by affecting the threshold for TCR-triggering. We demonstrate here that knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>significantly enhances basal T cell migration while inhibiting TCR-induced Lck activation. Pre-treating cells with CXCL12 prior to stimulation with anti-CD3 leads to a similar inhibition of Lck activation indicating that cells directed to migrate are less responsive to TCR triggering. The signals conveyed by G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>appear to be mediated through a SHP-1 pathway. Our data suggest that optimal TCR activation requires signaling through G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>, and that removal of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>locks the cell in migration modus making the cell less responsive to TCR signaling</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Human recombinant CXCL12 was obtained from Invitrogen (cat. no.

While the TCR is not thought to be directly associated with G proteins, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 can couple to both G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>. Furthermore, CXCR4 has been shown to associate with TCR upon CXCL12 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of tyrosine kinases by G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-subunits has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and could represent the mechanism by which CXCR4 activates Lck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We show here that the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, abrogated CXCL12-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of several proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, marked with *), a further indication that Src family kinases act downstream of CXCR4. However, the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation following CXCL12 treatment are modest compared to those of anti-CD3 treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, pre-treatment of Jurkat T cells with CXCL12 prior to stimulation with anti-CD3 attenuated TCR-induced Lck activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Similarly, we also observed reduced ZAP-70 phosphorylation in cells pre-stimulated with CXCL12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This is in line with a previous report showing reduced TCR-induced phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and LAT in CXCL12-pretreated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggesting that post-activation heterologous desensitization is occurring possibly as a result of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>sequestration. Consistent with this notion surface expression of CXCR4 was also down after 30 minutes incubation with CXCL12. To address the role of G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-subunits in controlling the switch between TCR and CXCR4-signaling events, we subjected Jurkat T cells to siRNAs against G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>or G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>. We achieved more than 90% knockdown with these siRNAs as analysed by Western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). As previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] TCR-induced Lck Y394 autophosphorylation was reduced in G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-knockdown but not G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-knockdown T cells demonstrating that G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>may directly or indirectly activate Lck (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CXCL12-pretreatment attenuates TCR-induced Lck activation.</bold> (A) Jurkat TAg T cells were incubated with or without 10 &#x00026;#956M PP2 for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C prior to stimulation with CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time-points and stopped with lysis buffer.

This implies that migrating T cells are less responsive to activation through the TCR. The physiological relevance of this switch between migration modus and TCR activation modus may be to ensure that migrating T cells do not get distracted by activation cues until they reach their destination. Conversely, TCR triggered T cells are less responsive to chemotactic gradients to ensure optimal activation. We observed that knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>enhanced basal migration 2-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>may set the threshold for directed migration. This supports the findings of Molon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] who speculated that CXCR4 signaling through G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>promoted adhesion instead of migration. Accordingly, we saw that knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>inhibited directed CXCL12-induced migration, while G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>knockdown had no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) confirming the notion that G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>is the principal G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-subunit involved in chemotaxis. The inhibitory effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>knockdown could however be partly reversed with simultaneous knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We speculate that the presence of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>and absence of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>may result in a combined strong inhibitory effect on chemotaxis. Removal of G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>, will then lead to partial release of the inhibitory effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>knockdown alone. Although T cells from G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub><sup>-/- </sup>mice show no migrational defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], data from knockout mice are difficult to interpret as compensatory mechanisms may have been established during development. Acute knockdown with siRNA provides an alternative method to examine protein functions. How CXCR4 switches its signaling through G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>is unknown, but the level of TCR engagement has been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Surface expression of CXCR4 following CXCL12-stimulation was neither affected by knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>nor G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>during a 1-hour time course (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, only 0 minutes and 30 minutes shown). The level of surface expression of CD3 on Jurkat Tags has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, we suggest that neither Ca<sup>2+</sup>-elevation nor ERK1/2 phosphorylation are involved in chemotaxis as has been suggested in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was abrogated in the G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-knockdown cells upon CXCR4-stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), it was intact in G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-knockdown cells. The level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was similar in both G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-knockdown and G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-knockdown Jurkat cells. However, concomitant knockdown of both G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>completely attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), indicating that this is a G-protein dependent event.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>G&#x003b1;q and G&#x003b1;i2 have opposing roles in chemotaxis.</bold> (A) Jurkat TAg T cells were transfected with G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-specific siRNA (GNAQ1103), G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-specific siRNA (GNAI-2-1050) or control siRNA (GNAQ1103 M3). 48 hours post-transfection cells were placed in Costar Transwell wells with/without 10 ng/ml CXCL12.

This suggests that the negative regulatory effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>on migration is normally not observed when the G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>signaling pathway through PI3K is intact, and that a switch from G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>to G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>is necessary to fully inhibit migration. These observations correlate well with the data showing that co-knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>and G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>has a smaller inhibitory effect on migration than knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Although the presence of Lck is shown to be necessary for migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] activating Lck through the TCR receptor has an inhibitory effect on migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consistent with these findings cells transfected with the constitutively active Lck Y505F showed a significant inhibition of migration compared to vector-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-kd on wortmannin-treated T cells in the presence of CXCL12 is reversed when transfected with Lck Y505F indicating that the effect of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>is mediated through Lck (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CXCL12 stimulation primarily activates G&#x003b1;i2.</bold>(A) Jurkat TAg T cells were tranfected with G-specific siRNA (GNAQ1103), G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-specific siRNA (GNAI-2-1050) or control siRNA (GNAQ1103 M3). 48 hours post-transfection cells were pre-treated with Wortmannin for 30 minutes and analyzed for CXCL12 dependent and independent migratory responses.

As we have recently reported that G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>may activate Lck we examined how G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>manipulation would affect SHP-1 regulation in migration. Knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 compared to control cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This may indicate a role for G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>in the activation of SHP-1. Interestingly, increased basal phosphorylation of SHP-1 was observed in G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>knockdown cells. This may be due to skewing of the CXCR4 signaling pathway towards G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>as there is less G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>available. Conversely, knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>might skew the CXCR4 signaling pathway towards G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>. To assess the role of SHP-1 in chemotaxis we transfected Jurkat T cells with the phosphatase-deficient, mutant SHP-1 C453S (c/s) that competes with endogenous SHP-1. Cells transfected with the mutant showed significantly increased basal and CXCL12 induced migration compared to control cells indicating that an Lck-G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-SHP-1 pathway may regulate migration (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Migration is probably not exclusively regulated by SHP-1 and other negative regulators of migration activated by G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-kd might exist.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Migration is inhibited by activation of SHP-1.</bold> (A) Jurkat TAg T cells were transfected with G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>-specific siRNA (GNAQ1103), G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub>-specific siRNA (GNAI-2-1050) or control siRNA (GNAQ1103 M3). 48 hours post-transfection cells were stimulated with CXCL12 for the indicated time periods and lysed in lysis buffer. SHP-1 immunoprecipitation was performed and immune complexes analysed by immunobloting with the indicated antibodies (n = 3). (B) Immunoblots from 3 independent experiments like in (A) were quantified by densiometric analysis. The graph show mean &#x000b1; S.E.M. (C) Jurkat TAg T cells were tranfected with the phosphatase defective SHP-1 c/s (C453S) mutant or empty vector. 24 hours post-transfection cells were placed in Costar Transwell plates with or without CXCL12 (10 ng/ml) and migration analysed as above. Migration index represents fold increase in migration over basal migration in wells with vector tx cells (n = 3). (D) Activation of G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>induces migration through a PI3K pathway whereas activation of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>inhibits migration through an Lck-SHP-1 pathway priming cell for activation through the TCR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2172-10-27-4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have previously shown that knockdown of G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>attenuates TCR-induced Lck activation by an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>has a positive role in inducing migration, G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>may have a negative regulatory role by promoting Lck activity resulting in increased SHP-1 activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Previous reports have demonstrated a reciprocal regulation between the TCR and chemokine-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on our recent report, an optimal TCR-triggering may require the G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>signaling pathway as G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>knockdown attenuates TCR-induced Lck activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>knockdown appears to release migration from tonic inhibition. This is in line with data showing increased proliferation and cytokine-production when chemokine-receptors signal through G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] suggesting that a switch from G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>to G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>through the chemokine-receptor promotes T cell activation rather than migration. In conclusion, we suggest that G<sub>&#x003b1;q </sub>activation strengthens the commitment of T cells to activation through the TCR while G<sub>&#x003b1;i2 </sub>activation commits the T cell to migration. This might contribute to ensure that T cells migrating towards a site of infection do not get distracted by unnecessary activation cues, while activated T cells are fully committed towards differentiation and proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All experiments were designed by JN, MI and KT, and conducted by JI and MI.
