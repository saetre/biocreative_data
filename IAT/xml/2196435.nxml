Myocyte contraction, for instance, is readily stimulated by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR but not &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling, and chronic stimulation of the two receptors has opposing effects on myocyte apoptosis and cell survival. Differences in the assembly of macromolecular signaling complexes may explain the distinct biological outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR forms a signaling complex with a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) in a manner inherently different from a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR/&#x003b2;-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously. The &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR binds a PDE variant, PDE4D8, in a direct manner, and occupancy of the receptor by an agonist causes dissociation of this complex. Conversely, agonist binding to the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of a complex consisting of &#x003b2;-arrestin and the PDE4D variant, PDE4D5, to the receptor. We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with PDEs result in divergent cAMP signals in the vicinity of the two receptors, thus, providing an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>&#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>cardiac myocyte</kwd><kwd>cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase</kwd><kwd>PDE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To meet the increased metabolic demands of stress or exercise, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates cardiac function through activation of the closely related &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR). Even though these highly homologous receptors both activate the G protein stimulatory for adenylyl cyclase (G<sub>s</sub>), signaling through &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR produces clearly distinguishable biological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Xiang and Kobilka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR plays the dominant role in stimulating heart rate and strength of myocyte contraction, whereas &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR produces only modest chronotropic effects. Chronic stimulation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR produces myocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, whereas &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling promotes cell survival. The assembly of distinct macromolecular signaling complexes with transducer, scaffold, and effector proteins, which determine signaling properties and subcellular localization of the &#x003b2;ARs, is thought to be at the core of the divergent properties of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Xiang and Kobilka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, understanding the differences of these receptor complexes has important pharmacological and clinical implications.</p><p>One of the emerging mechanisms that safeguard the specificity of G-protein-coupled receptor/cAMP signaling is the control of cAMP transients via degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Conti and Beavo, 2007</xref>). Biochemical, electrophysiological, and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging studies are consolidating the idea that occupancy of different receptors generates a nonuniform pattern of activation of cAMP effector proteins such as PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PDEs play a critical role for the specificity in cAMP-signaling by preventing the free diffusion of cAMP, thus, effectively creating cyclic nucleotide microdomains and/or cAMP gradients that can be sensed by the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Xiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fischmeister <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>PDEs comprise a large group of over 20 genes that are divided into 11 PDE families based on their amino-acid sequence homology, substrate specificities, and pharmacological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Conti and Beavo, 2007</xref>). Each of the 11 PDE families encompasses one to four distinct genes. In addition, most PDE genes encode for multiple splicing variants through the use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that occupancy of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR initiates the recruitment of a preformed complex consisting of &#x003b2;-arrestin and the cyclic AMP-specific PDE, PDE4D5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Perry <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Conversely, no data are available on complexes between PDEs and the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR even though it has been shown that PDE4 inhibitors potentiate cAMP accumulation induced by either &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR or &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Xiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Here, we show that &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR forms a signaling complex with a PDE4D splicing variant in a manner inherently different from the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR/&#x003b2;-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously. Thus, this study challenges the assumption that the regulation of receptor signaling by PDEs described for the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR also applies to &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR. We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with PDEs provide an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Detection of a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D signaling complex in mouse neonatal cardiac myocytes</title><p>To probe for a possible signaling complex including the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag. A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The PDE activity associated with the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR was inhibited by the PDE4-selective inhibitor, Rolipram, identifying this activity as PDE4. Three PDE4 subtypes, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D, are expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). The fourth gene, PDE4C, is not expressed in the heart and was not investigated. To assess which of the PDE4 subtypes contribute to the activity recovered in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR IP, cardiomyocytes deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D were subjected to pull-down experiments. Whereas ablation of PDE4A or PDE4B had no effect, inactivation of the PDE4D gene prevented co-IP of PDE activity with the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, PDE4D is the endogenous PDE recovered in complex with the receptor. This conclusion is further supported by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated PDE. A band immunoreactive with PDE4D-selective antibodies was consistently detected in the IP pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), and its mobility is consistent with that of a subset of PDE4D splicing variants that include PDE4D3, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Richter <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Together, these data suggest the presence of a signaling complex containing the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, a PDE4D isoform, and perhaps other components of the cAMP signaling pathway in cardiac myocytes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distinct PDE4D splice variants co-IP with the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR</title><p>Through alternate splicing and the use of multiple promoters, nine different proteins, PDE4D1&#x02013;9, originate from the PDE4D gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Richter <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). These proteins are identical in the catalytic domain and C-terminus but diverge at the N-terminus. Long forms contain a conserved UCR1/UCR2 (upstream conserved regions 1 and 2) motif, whereas short forms lack UCR1 and part of UCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Conti <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Houslay and Adams, 2003</xref>). Using antibodies raised against the unique N-terminus of each variant, we determined that PDE4D5, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 are the splicing variants most abundant in cardiomyocytes, with trace amounts of PDE4D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). The co-IP of these PDE4D splice variants expressed exogenously in HEK293 cells identified PDE4D8 as the variant that most efficiently interacts with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR. Other long PDE4D splice variants were also recovered in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR IP pellets with the following rank order: PDE4D8&#x0003e;PDE4D9&#x0003e;PDE4D3&#x0003e;PDE4D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Conversely, the short PDE4D form, PDE4D2, did not co-IP with the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, indicating that the UCR domains unique to long PDE4 splice variants may contribute to the formation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PDE4D binds directly to the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR</title><p>As previously reported, tethering of PDE4D5 to the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling complex is mediated by &#x003b2;-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, the co-IP of exogenous PDE4D and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR from extracts of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in &#x003b2;-arrestin 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Kohout <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) was not decreased compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that formation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex is independent of &#x003b2;-arrestins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). To further characterize the interaction, we performed IPs using PDE4D and &#x003b2;ARs that were purified from a baculovirus expression system to &#x0003e;90&#x00025; purity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for the characterization of the purified proteins). In this paradigm, PDE4D shows robust association with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR but not with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This confirms that &#x003b2;-arrestins are not required for the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex. More importantly, this approach clearly indicates that PDE4D binds directly to the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR but has no significant, or a much reduced affinity for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-adrenergic agonists induces dissociation of the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex</title><p>To determine whether receptor occupancy affects the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex, HEK293 cells expressing exogenous &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and PDE4D8 were incubated with different ligands. Treatment with the physiological &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR agonist, (&#x02212;)-Norepinephrine (NorEpi), caused dissociation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), whereas the stereoisomer, (&#x0002b;)-norepinephrine, which is a poor &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR ligand, had no effect. Dissociation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex was observed also in cardiac myocytes and &#x003b2;-arrestin-deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4</xref>) and occurred whether the overexpressed PDE4D was catalytically active or inactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Dissociation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex by NorEpi binding is rapid (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub>&#x0003c;1 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) and dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), reaching maximum at approximately 100 &#x003bc;M NorEpi. Thus, the concentration-dependence of dissociation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex is comparable to that of receptor occupancy by NorEpi rather than that of receptor-induced cAMP production, which is in the nanomolar range. In addition, washout of the agonist results in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D reassociation (data not shown). This dynamic, receptor occupancy-dependent regulation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex formation may explain why &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D dissociation is not complete and some portion of receptor/PDE complexes (&#x0223c;30&#x00025;) remain at any given time point. Treatment with the &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol (ISO; 10 &#x003bc;M; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) or Epinephrine (100 &#x003bc;M; data not shown), also promoted dissociation of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Selective activation of PDE4D splice variants upon stimulation of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>AR</title><p>All PDE4 long forms are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved PKA consensus site in UCR1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>); this mechanism provides a ubiquitous negative-feedback loop critical for cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Conti <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, stimulation of cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes with &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists leads to a rapid PKA-mediated activation of PDE4D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). If complexes composed of &#x003b2;ARs and PDEs are present in these cells, phosphorylation should be biased toward the PDEs present in the vicinity of the occupied receptors. This is indeed the case when &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR-stimulated phosphorylation of PDE4D isoforms was monitored. In cardiomyocytes lacking &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR, PDE4D8 was the PDE4D isoform predominantly activated after stimulation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR with ISO, with a limited activation of PDE4D9, and no significant effect on PDE4D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Conversely, in myocytes lacking &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, stimulation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR causes a selective increase in the activity of PDE4D5, with a less pronounced increase in PDE4D9, and no increase in PDE4D8 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, upon stimulation with the adenylyl cyclase activator, Forskolin, all PDE4D isoforms show the same increase in activity in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that loss of one &#x003b2;AR subtype or the other has not perturbed overall cAMP signaling. It also demonstrates that the spatial dimension of cAMP signaling is lost when generalized adenylyl cyclase activation is induced with Forskolin. The selective activation of PDE4D splicing variants by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling confirms the selectivity observed in the physical association of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR with PDE4D8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and the preferential sequestration of PDE4D5 to the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR by &#x003b2;-arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Because these experiments are with endogenous proteins, they strengthen our hypothesis of the presence of PDE4D variants in complex with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PDE4D controls the activity of PKA in the vicinity of the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR</title><p>The presence of a PDE4D in the vicinity of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR should affect the activity of PKA localized with the receptor as well as the PKA-phosphorylation state of the receptor itself. This possibility was tested by blocking PDE activity with selective PDE4 inhibitors in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), by using MEFs deficient in PDE4D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), or by overexpressing a catalytically inactive PDE4D in cardiomyocytes, which acts as a dominant-negative construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Perry <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) by displacing endogenous PDE4D from the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). In all instances, blockage of PDE4 activity or, more specifically, ablation or displacement of PDE4D caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the transfected &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR in the absence of &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists. It should be noted that inhibition of PDE3 activity or an overexpression of a dominant-negative PDE3A construct has no effect on &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR phosphorylation, confirming the specificity of the interactions. These findings indicate that PDE4D controls the access of cAMP to PKA localized with the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, effectively creating a domain with low basal cAMP/PKA activity. PDE4D also limits PKA-phosphorylation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR in response to low concentrations of &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists that do not disrupt a large number of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complexes. This is likely due to the control of cAMP levels and PKA-activity in the vicinity of unoccupied, and thus, PDE4D-associated receptors in response to elevated cellular cAMP levels. These findings suggest a function of PDE4D in complex with the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR in the intact cell.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PDE4D ablation promotes <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>AR desensitization <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To assess the role of PDE4D in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR function in a more physiological context, changes in the heart rate of mice in response to &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation were measured, as it is established that <italic>in vivo</italic> contraction rate is primarily controlled by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Rohrer <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Devic <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Wild-type and PDE4DKO mice, matched by age, sex, and genetic background, were sedated using isoflurane. While their heart rate was continuously measured using a mouse pulse oximeter sensor, the mice were then injected with a submaximal concentration of ISO. An additional group of mice was first injected with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) to enhance the heterologous desensitization of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR before the ISO injection. Wild-type and PDE4DKO mice showed no significant differences in basal heart rate (WT=410&#x000b1;52 and 4DKO=386&#x000b1;46 beats/min, means&#x000b1;s.e.m.), the maximal heart rate after ISO injection (WT=544&#x000b1;34 and 4DKO=515&#x000b1;32 beats/min), the maximal heart rate after GLP1 injection (WT=487&#x000b1;14 and 4DKO=448&#x000b1;19 beats/min), or the maximal heart rate after sequential injection of GLP1 and ISO (WT=539&#x000b1;24 and 4DKO=581&#x000b1;17 beats/min). The rate of return to basal heart rate after the initial response to ISO was slightly faster in PDE4DKO mice compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>); however, this effect was greatly magnified by pretreatment of mice with GLP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). The faster decrease in heart rate is in agreement with our stated hypothesis that elevated levels of cAMP/PKA activity in the vicinity of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, due to absence of PDE4D in this compartment, causes an increased phosphorylation and heterologous desensitization of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the above findings, we have identified a novel signaling complex that distinguishes &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR from &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR.

This preference of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR for PDE4D8 was confirmed by co-IP experiments with exogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Conversely, PDE4D5 is the variant tethered to the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR/&#x003b2;-arrestin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) concurring with the preferential activation of PDE4D5 upon &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). In pull-down experiments using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), &#x003b2;1AR efficiently interacts with PDE4D, whereas &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR has negligible affinity for PDE4D, underscoring the direct mode of PDE4D&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR interaction versus the indirect, &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent mode of PDE4D&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR interaction. The most important difference regarding the function of &#x003b2;ARs is the effect of receptor occupancy on the PDE4D complexes. The &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR/PDE4D complex is present in the absence of agonist and dissociates after receptor occupancy, whereas agonist binding to the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of the &#x003b2;-arrestin/PDE4D complex to the receptor. Thus, under basal conditions, PDE4D is poised to control local cAMP concentration and PKA activity in the vicinity of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>), whereas it affects &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR signaling only after ligand binding and &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment. These differences likely impact the time course of cAMP accumulation in the vicinity of the receptors. We propose that these divergent interactions with PDE4D variants specify the property of the signals emanating from the two receptors.</p><p>Tethering of PDE4D to the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR provides a means to target cAMP hydrolytic activity in the vicinity of the unoccupied receptor, thus, preventing a local increase in cAMP under basal conditions. This, in turn, protects the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR from PKA-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Rapacciuolo <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gardner <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and may control PKA-mediated phosphorylation of other localized substrates. Indeed, when PDE4 activity is inhibited in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), is absent, as in the PDE4D-deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), or is displaced, as in PDE4D-DN infected cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E and F</xref>), a substantial increase in basal &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR receptor phosphorylation is observed. In addition to controlling basal cAMP accumulation, targeting of PDE4D to the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR may prevent heterologous desensitization of unoccupied receptors. Consistent with this idea, we report here that PDE4D deficiency accelerates the desensitization of &#x003b2;-adrenergic signals measured as changes in mouse heart rate in response to ISO injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). At the same time and given the observation that occupancy of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR causes dissociation of the complex, it is likely that the ligand-induced dissociation of PDE4D from the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR cooperates to produce a localized increase in cAMP in the proximity of the occupied receptor. This event should decrease local cAMP degradation and therefore amplify the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic signal locally. Consistent with this view, localized cAMP transients in the dyad space are elevated in the PDE4DKO mouse, whereas global cAMP signaling is not perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Lehnart <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The fate and function of the released PDE4D are to be determined and may provide a means to regulate a distinct pool of cAMP away from the membrane.</p><p>Using changes in the heart rate of mice in response to &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation as a read-out, we show here that PDE4D deficiency promotes an accelerated desensitization of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR signaling. Although additional steps in excitation contraction coupling may also be affected by the absence of PDE4D, this observation is consistent with the idea that a major function of PDE4D in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR signaling complex is to protect the receptor from PKA-mediated heterologous desensitization. The direct interaction of PDE4D with the receptor, however, opens additional possibilities for a function of PDE4D in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR complex. These include a direct effect of PDE4D on the conformation of the receptor and a role of PDE4D in the assembly of macromolecular signaling complexes around the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR. The latter may include the competition of PDE4D with other proteins for binding to the receptor or, in an opposite fashion, PDE4D may act as a scaffold by tethering additional proteins to the receptor complex such as the exchange protein activated by cAMP or PKA-anchoring proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dodge-Kafka <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). These possibilities will be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Collectively, our findings demonstrate that stimulation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR has opposing effects on PDE4D recruitment in the membrane subdomain, with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR occupancy causing a local decrease, whereas &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR promotes a local increase in PDE4. A critical role of PDE4s in the submembrane microdomain has been described using a modified CNG channel as a sensor for cAMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Rich <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The dynamic localization of different PDE4D splicing variants that we report, as well as their phosphorylation state, likely play a major role in controlling cAMP accumulation in this submembrane space. This view is consistent with the alterations in local cAMP accumulation observed in PDE4D-deficient cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Lehnart <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). More importantly, the PDE4DKO mouse develops a late onset dilated cardiomyopathy and a propensity to arrhythmias during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Lehnart <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). PDE4D-deficiency in the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) complex has been associated with this phenotype. Lack of PDE4D causes PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 and calstabin depletion from the channel, resulting in a &#x02018;leaky' RyR2 channel phenotype that, in turn, may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias. However, disruption of other PDE4D complexes in the PDE4DKO mouse most likely contributes to the development of the cardiac phenotype. The lack of PDE4D in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR complex and the aberrant &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR responses described in the present study may well contribute to the onset of hypertrophy and heart failure. The observed increased receptor phosphorylation that follows PDE4D deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>) promotes progressive desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>) and downregulation of this receptor, a hallmark in heart failure.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Recombinant Flag-tagged &#x003b2;ARs and Myc-tagged PDE4D splice variants were detected in western blots using antibodies against their respective tags (mouse monoclonal &#x003b1;-Flag AB, Sigma Aldrich; mouse monoclonal &#x003b1;-Myc AB, Roche Applied Sciences).
