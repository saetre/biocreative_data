To date, &#x0223c;60 imprinted human genes are known. Based on genome-wide methylation analysis of a patient with multiple imprinting defects, we have identified a differentially methylated CpG island in intron 2 of the retinoblastoma (<italic>RB1</italic>) gene on chromosome 13. The CpG island is part of a 5&#x02032;-truncated, processed pseudogene derived from the <italic>KIAA0649</italic> gene on chromosome 9 and corresponds to two small CpG islands in the open reading frame of the ancestral gene. It is methylated on the maternal chromosome 13 and acts as a weak promoter for an alternative <italic>RB1</italic> transcript on the paternal chromosome 13. In four other <italic>KIAA0649</italic> pseudogene copies, which are located on chromosome 22, the two CpG islands have deteriorated and the CpG dinucleotides are fully methylated. By analysing allelic <italic>RB1</italic> transcript levels in blood cells, as well as in hypermethylated and 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine&#x02013;treated lymphoblastoid cells, we have found that differential methylation of the CpG island skews <italic>RB1</italic> gene expression in favor of the maternal allele. Thus, <italic>RB1</italic> is imprinted in the same direction as <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, which operates upstream of <italic>RB1</italic>. The imprinting of two components of the same pathway indicates that there has been strong evolutionary selection for maternal inhibition of cell proliferation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process leading to parent-of-origin&#x02013;specific DNA methylation and gene expression. Defects in this process lead to abnormal development, growth, or behavior. It is still unclear why and how imprinting evolved and how many human genes are imprinted. Based on genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in a patient with a generalized imprinting defect, we have found that the paradigmatic retinoblastoma 1 (<italic>RB1</italic>) gene on chromosome 13 is imprinted. Imprinting of <italic>RB1</italic> is linked to the insertion of a DNA sequence derived by retrotransposition from a gene on chromosome 9. Part of the inserted DNA sequence has evolved into a differentially methylated alternative <italic>RB1</italic> promoter. Differential methylation of this sequence skews expression of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene in favour of the maternal allele. The direction of the imprint imposed on the <italic>RB1</italic> gene is the same as of the maternally expressed <italic>CDKN1C</italic> gene, which operates upstream of <italic>RB1</italic>.

Imprints are established during gametogenesis, maintained after fertilization and erased in primordial germ cells (for a recent review see Wood and Oakey, 2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Wood1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It is still a matter of debate, how and why genomic imprinting evolved. The most favoured theory is the kinship theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Moore1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which postulates a tug-of-war between the two parental genomes over maternal resources during pregnancy and early childhood. As predicted by the kinship theory, several imprinted genes are known to regulate cell proliferation and fetal growth.</p><p>To date, &#x0223c;60 imprinted human genes are known (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneimprint.com/">http://www.geneimprint.com/</ext-link>). Based on DNA sequence features, Luedi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Luedi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> have estimated that there might be some 600 imprinted genes in the mouse. It is likely that a similar number of imprinted genes exist in the human genome. There are at least two reasons why it is difficult to determine the actual number of imprinted genes: (i) imprinted expression can be tissue-specific and (ii) is not always an all-or-nothing phenomenon. The identification of imprinted genes in humans is even more challenging due to experimental limitations. On the other hand, naturally occurring imprinting defects have been identified in human patients, but are unknown in mice. These imprinting defects provide a unique opportunity to identify imprinting control elements, imprinting factors and imprinted genes.</p><p>Roughly speaking, imprinting defects are either primary epimutations that occur in the absence of a DNA mutation or secondary epimutations that result from a DNA mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Horsthemke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas a DNA mutation in an imprinting control region results in a secondary imprinting defect in <italic>cis</italic>, a DNA mutation affecting an imprinting factor typically affects the imprint at several loci in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>Recently we have observed a patient with hypomethylation of all imprinted loci tested (Caliebe, Siebert et al., in preparation; for clinical details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Based on genome-wide methylation analysis of this patient as described here we have found that the <italic>RB1</italic> gene is imprinted. <italic>RB1</italic>, a tumor suppressor gene for the childhood tumor retinoblastoma (accession no. NM_000321) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Friend1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, pRb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. When hypo-phosphorylated, pRb acts as a transcriptional cofactor and, by recruiting chromatin remodelling enzymes, represses the proliferation-promoting activities of a subset of E2F transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Friend1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation by activated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) results in derepression and activation of E2F dependent promoters. CDK inhibitors such as CDKN1C inhibit this process. In addition to control the G1-S cell cycle transition, pRb has important roles in embryogenesis and maintenance of trophoblast stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Wenzel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Parent-of-origin effects have been reported in human phenotypes associated with mutations of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene.

These data suggest that independent retrotransposition events resulted in integration of two processed pseudogenes with different extent of 5&#x02032; truncation, one on chromosome 13 and the other on chromosome 22, and that further copies on chromosome 22 are due to gene duplication.</p><fig id="pgen-1000790-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000790.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Structure of <italic>KIAA0649</italic> and processed pseudogenes in human (position numbers according to hg19, UCSC), chimpanzee (panTro2, UCSC), and rhesus (rheMac2, UCSC).</title><p>In the human genome, two of the four small CpG islands in exon 4 of <italic>KIAA0649</italic> (CpG 19 and CpG 17) correspond to CpG 85 in the chromosome 13 copy.

Specifically, CpG 85, which spans 1.2 kb, corresponds to the small islands CpG 19 and CpG 17 at the <italic>KIAA0649</italic> locus, which only contain 229 bp and 209 bp, respectively.</p><p>By <italic>in silico</italic> analyses (UCSC genome browser and BLAT search) we have found that the processed pseudogene with the CpG island is also present in the <italic>RB1</italic> gene of chimpanzee and rhesus, but not in the <italic>Rb1</italic> gene of mice and rat. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the situation in chimpanzee resembles that in humans with the exception that there is an additional pseudogene copy on chromosome 8, which has a CpG island (CpG 73) of 1.1 kb, and that there are only three pseudogene copies on chromosome 22. In the rhesus the situation is different in that the <italic>KIAA0649</italic> homologue has a CpG island (CpG 99) of 1.5 kb and that there are no other pseudogene copies in the genome apart from the copy within intron 2 of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene, which has a 578 bp CpG island (CpG 39). Based on these data it is possible that the human CpG 85 island has not evolved from two small CpG islands in the ORF of <italic>KIAA0649</italic>, but that a big CpG island in this gene was maintained in the processed pseudogene located within <italic>RB1</italic>, but deteriorated in the ancestral gene as well as in chromosome 22 copies in the human and chimpanzee lineage after the retrotransposition events. Irrespective of whether evolution has shaped or maintained the CpG island within intron 2 of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene, it has acquired a new function (see below).</p><p>To find out whether CpG 85 is differentially methylated in a parent-of-origin specific manner, we studied 12 CpG dinucleotides after bisulfite treatment, cloning and sequencing of blood DNA from a normal individual and from five retinoblastoma patients with whole <italic>RB1</italic> gene deletions of known parental origin. Because of the high sequence identity between the repetitive sequences, the 248 bp PCR product obtained for subcloning was not specific for the chromosome 13 copy so that sequence differences were used to assign the clones to the different chromosomal regions. By this we found that the chromosome 9 and 22 sequences are fully methylated (data not shown). In contrast, CpG sites in CpG 85 clones from the normal control were either methylated or unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Almost all clones from the two patients with a maternal <italic>RB1</italic> gene deletion were derived from unmethylated sequences, whereas the sequence of all clones from the three patients with a paternal deletion indicated fully methylated CpG sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We conclude that CpG 85 shows parent-of-origin specific methylation &#x02013; it is methylated on the maternal chromosome 13 and unmethylated on the paternal chromosome 13. Methylation analysis of two independent sperm samples revealed that the CpG 85 is unmethylated in male germ cells (data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000790-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000790.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of CpG 85 and the 2B-transcript.</title><p>(A) Methylation analysis of CpG 85 by DNA cloning and sequencing.

raised the question whether it is made independently of and in addition to the regular paternal <italic>RB1</italic> transcript. If so, the total level of paternal <italic>RB1</italic> transcripts should be higher compared to that of the maternal transcripts. We investigated this by fluorescence-tagged primer extension analyses of blood RNA from 14 individuals heterozygous for expressed sequence variants of known (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) or likely (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2) parental origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000790-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We found allelic expression imbalance in all individuals (2.7&#x000b1;16&#x00025;, ratio&#x000b1;SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g005">Figure 5</xref>), but in all cases the imbalance was in favour of the maternal allele. This finding suggested that lack of methylation of CpG 85 and possibly expression of the 2B-transcript interferes with the expression of the regular transcript from the same, i.e. paternal allele. To test this hypothesis, we treated lymphoblastoid cells (LCs) with 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (AzadC), which inhibits the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Bisulfite sequencing showed that the CpG island associated with the regular <italic>RB1</italic> promoter, CpG 106, was unmethylated in untreated and treated LCs (data not shown). For quantitative analysis of CpG 85 methylation, we established a methylation-specific (MS)-PCR assay. By this we found that in some LCs CpG 85 methylation was greater than 50&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel). In all cell cultures AzadC treatment had the intended effect of partial loss of methylation at CpG 85.</p><fig id="pgen-1000790-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000790.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Allelic expression imbalance of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene.</title><p>Plot of the ratio of allelic expression as determined by SNaPshot primer extension on RT&#x02013;PCR products obtained from RNA from blood of 14 individuals from 7 families informative for expressed variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000790-t001">Table 1</xref>). The primer extension assay for the variant in exon 3 (family A) only detects the regular transcript whereas the assays for the variants downstream of exon 3 (families B to G) detect transcripts initiated in exon 2B in addition to regular transcripts. Of note, direction and extent of skewing in family A are not different from that in the other families and, therefore, the relative abundance of 2B-transcripts compared to regular transcripts is likely to be low.

In family H, we could not investigate allelic <italic>RB1</italic> expression in blood, because we did not have RNA from fresh blood. In this family, a male patient with unilateral retinoblastoma (HII-1) inherited the rare variant from his unaffected mother and transmitted it to his unaffected daughter (HIII-1). (B) Electropherograms of SNaPshot primer extension on RT&#x02013;PCR products specific for the 2B-transcript. Black and red peaks correspond to C and T alleles, respectively.

Numbers below electropherograms with two peaks show the ratios of peak areas (T-allele/C-allele).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000790.g006"/></fig><p>First, we investigated whether demethylation of CpG 85 resulted in activation of transcription from the maternal 2B-promoter. Analysis of LCs from family A showed that expression of the 2B-transcript remained monoallelic after mock-treatment, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In two independent experimental rounds, LCs from individuals A II-1 and A III-1 gained biparental expression of the 2B-transcript after demethylation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), although in several assays the expression levels of 2B-transcripts were low or below the detection limit.</p><p>Next, we investigated the ratio of the parental <italic>RB1</italic> transcripts. All cell cultures treated with AzadC showed reduced skewing of the allelic <italic>RB1</italic> transcripts (1.4&#x000b1;14&#x00025;, ratio&#x000b1;SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, lower panel). The reduction in skewing most likely results from the fact that in many cells the maternal allele has lost methylation and now resembles the paternal allele. Reduced skewing was also observed in the mock-treated LCs (1.7&#x000b1;28&#x00025;, ratio&#x000b1;SD), which showed some increase in CpG 85 methylation compared to fresh blood. Although there was no strict quantitative correlation between the degree of hypermethylation and the degree of reduction in skewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000790-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel), the effect was most prominent in LCs from individuals AII-1 and HII-1, which have the highest degree of hypermethylation. In hypermethylated LCs the reduction in skewing most likely results from the fact that in some cells the paternal allele has gained methylation and now resembles the maternal allele. In summary, these results demonstrate that there is a link between allele-specific methylation of CpG 85 and allelic expression imbalance of <italic>RB1</italic>, although they can not provide evidence in favour of a specific mechanism.</p><p>We also investigated allelic <italic>Rb1</italic> expression levels in mice, which do not have the intronic CpG island. For this, we crossed FVB and C3H mice, which differ by a single nucleotide (T/C) in exon 25 (rs30444047 at chr.14:73599123), and examined blood from four FVBxC3H and four C3HxFVB offspring by primer extension analysis. The maternal/paternal transcript ratios were 0.69&#x000b1;13&#x00025; (mean&#x000b1;SD) and 1.49&#x000b1;13&#x00025;, respectively, which indicate strain-specific effects but no parent-of-origin specific effects on <italic>Rb1</italic> gene expression. This finding strengthens the notion that parent-of-origin specific expression imbalance of the human <italic>RB1</italic> gene is dependent on the presence of the differentially methylated CpG 85.</p><p>One possible mechanism for this link is transcriptional interference. As described above, after demethylation of CpG 85 transcription from the maternal 2B-promoter is activated and the <italic>RB1</italic> expression imbalance is reduced. Possibly, the transcription complex binding to the 2B-promoter acts as a road block for the regular transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Shearwin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of a quantitative correlation between the amount of the 2B-transcript and the degree of the reduction in skewing may to some extent be due to the fact that 2B-transcript levels are very low and difficult to quantify. However, it may also indicate that the assembly of the transcription complex at the 2B-promoter is more important than the actual transcription.</p><p>Another conceivable mechanism is enhancer blocking. Similar to the situation at the <italic>IGF2/H19</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Bell1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Hark1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the unmethylated CpG 85 may bind CTCF or some other insulator protein and block the interaction between the regular <italic>RB1</italic> promoter and a downstream enhancer. So far, however, no such enhancer has been identified, and the <italic>RB1</italic> locus does not contain any experimentally determined <italic>in vivo</italic> CTCF-binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Kim1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that parent-of-origin dependent expression imbalance of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene is linked to the insertion of a 5&#x02032;-truncated, processed pseudogene, which acquired a differentially methylated CpG island.

A very good example in support of the latter hypothesis is the imprinted <italic>PEG10</italic> gene, which shares homology with an LTR-type retrotransposon, sushi-ichi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Ono1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike <italic>PEG10</italic>, however, the DNA sequence inserted into the <italic>RB1</italic> gene is derived from an endogenous gene (<italic>KIAA0649</italic>). This appears to be true also for the imprinted <italic>Zrsr1(U2af1-rs1)</italic>, <italic>Nap1l5</italic>, <italic>Inpp5f_v2 and Mcts2</italic> genes, which are located within introns of other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Wood2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These genes are active, independent genes that are likely to encode a protein. In contrast, the <italic>KIAA0649</italic> cDNA fragments must have been dead on arrival, because they lack the 5&#x02032;-end. They have lost the ORF, and CpG 85 is located within the former ORF. The chromosome 22 copies do not have a CpG island. Thus, the site of integration has determined the evolutionary fate of the cDNA copies.</p><p>Of note, the direction of the imprint imposed on the <italic>RB1</italic> gene is the same as of the maternally expressed <italic>CDKN1C</italic> gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor operating upstream of pRb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The imprinting of two components of the same pathway (<italic>CDKN1C</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>) indicates that there has been evolutionary selection for maternal inhibition of cell proliferation. Neither <italic>CDKN1C</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000790-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> nor <italic>RB1</italic> expression (this work) is strictly monoallelic, probably because complete imprinting would make an individual vulnerable to childhood cancer and would thus have been selected against.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Essen.

PCR conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 20 sec, 64&#x000b0;C for 3 min, and finally 3 min at 68&#x000b0;C. For establishing an expression profile of the alternative <italic>RB1</italic> transcript, total RNA from several tissues (Human Total RNA Master Panel II, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) and blood RNA from a normal control was used for the RT&#x02013;PCR with primers in exon 2B and exon 3 of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene. Expression analysis of human testis was performed on Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Rapid amplification of 5&#x02032; cDNA ends (5&#x02032;RACE)</title><p>The 5&#x02032;RACE was carried out with the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; RACE Kit (2<sup>nd</sup> Generation, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions &#x02013; except of the first-strand cDNA synthesis step.

Using equal amounts of amplicons from cDNA and genomic DNA, quantitative primer extension assay was carried out with ABI Prism SNaPshot ddNTP Primer Extension Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The SNaPshot reaction products were analyzed by gel capillary electrophoresis on ABI 3700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and electropherograms were analyzed with the Gene Mapper 4.0 software. Allelic DNA ratios were used to normalize the cDNA ratios. Sequences of primers for PCR as well as for SNaPshot are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000790.s002">Table S2</xref>.
