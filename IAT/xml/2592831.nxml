Clathrin is recruited to endocytic sites on the plasma membrane by the AP2 adaptor complex. The medium subunit (&#x003bc;2) of AP2 binds to cargo proteins and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate on the cell surface.

APM-2 is highly expressed in the nervous system and is localized to synapses; yet specific loss of APM-2 in neurons does not affect locomotion. In <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants, clathrin is mislocalized at synapses, and synaptic vesicle numbers and evoked responses are reduced to 60 and 65%, respectively.

Recycling is thought to be initiated by the recruitment of clathrin to patches of membrane containing synaptic vesicle proteins. The reformed vesicle with a geodesic coat is budded into the cytoplasm. This model is supported by extensive associative and functional evidence. In electron micrographs of the frog neuromuscular junction, invaginating vesicles at presynaptic terminals are enveloped by a coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>). Purification of vesicles from rat brain indicate that clathrin is associated with synaptic vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maycox et al., 1992</xref>). Genetic disruption of clathrin-associated endocytic proteins such as AP180, synaptojanin, dynamin, and endophilin leads to a depletion of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Camilli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verstreken et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newton et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, specific disruption of clathrin interactions with the adaptor protein AP180 disrupts synaptic vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). These data suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main mechanism used by synapses to recycle vesicles after exocytosis.</p><p>Clathrin is linked to cargo and membranes by the clathrin adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keen, 1987</xref>). Four different adaptor omplexes have been identified in mammals: AP1, AP2, AP3, and AP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simpson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dell'Angelica et al., 1999</xref>). These adaptor protein complexes localize to different membranes in the cell and coordinate cargo selection and vesicle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewin and Mellman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson and Bonifacino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robinson, 2004</xref>). AP2 is the adaptor complex functioning during endocytosis at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mahaffey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Traub, 2003</xref>). There are four different subunits in the AP2 complex: &#x003b1; (large), &#x003b2;2 (large), &#x003bc;2 (medium), and &#x003c3;2 (small; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</xref>), and each subunit serves a specific function. In particular, the &#x003bc;2 subunit recruits cargo proteins containing the tyrosine-based Yxx&#x003c6; motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen and Evans, 1998</xref>) and mediates in part the association of the AP2 complex to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaidarov and Keen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rohde et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honing et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterize mutants that lack &#x003bc;2 adaptin, encoded by the <italic>apm-2</italic> gene (also called <italic>dpy-23</italic>), in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We demonstrate that &#x003bc;2 is partially required for synaptic localization of clathrin and for the stability of the AP2 complex. However, synaptic vesicles are still recycled in the absence of &#x003bc;2. Our data suggest that despite previous predictions, &#x003bc;2 is not absolutely required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Moreover, the decrease in synaptic vesicle number does not cause a locomotion defect in &#x003bc;2 knockout mutants, so a smaller reserve pool might be adequate for <italic>C. elegans</italic> under normal condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>dpy-23/apm-2</italic> encodes &#x003bc;2 adaptin in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Two mutant alleles for the locus <italic>dpy-23 (e840</italic> and <italic>gm17</italic>) have been identified. Both mutants have a variable dumpy (Dpy) phenotype in which animals vary from almost wild-type length to approximately half the size (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1</ext-link>). The dumpy phenotype is likely caused by defects in cuticle morphology. Specific defects in the cuticle are observed in the head and along the body. About 5% of the animals have &#x0201c;jowls&#x0201d; or protrusions on either side of the head (Fig. S1 B). The cuticular ridges along the body, called alae, are distorted and have multiple breaks along their length (Fig. S1 C). In addition, mutant worms are slightly uncoordinated (Unc) and have a strong egg-laying defect suggesting a role for <italic>dpy-23</italic> in the nervous system.</p><p>The <italic>dpy-23</italic> mutant phenotype was mapped to the interval between &#x02013;7.91 to &#x02013;7.55 on chromosome X (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The gene encoding &#x003bc;2 adaptin, called <italic>apm-2</italic>, maps to this interval, and RNA interference to this gene gave rise to a variable dumpy phenotype suggesting <italic>dpy-23</italic> is likely to encode &#x003bc;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>). We cloned the <italic>dpy-23</italic> gene and demonstrated that the mutated gene is <italic>apm-2</italic>. Two overlapping cosmids, D1079 and C33G6, in the region rescued the <italic>dpy-23</italic> mutant phenotype. A 12-kb genomic PCR fragment (5 kb upstream, 5 kb coding sequence of &#x003bc;2 adaptin, and 2 kb downstream) could fully rescue the dumpy, uncoordinated, and egg-laying defects of <italic>dpy-23(e840)</italic> and <italic>dpy-23(gm17)</italic> (Fig. S1 A). Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>dpy-23</italic> in a wild-type background causes the same phenotypes as <italic>dpy-23</italic> loss-of-function mutations (Fig. S1 A). Because <italic>dpy-23</italic> encodes &#x003bc;2 we will refer to the gene by its alternative name, <italic>apm-2</italic> (adaptor protein medium subunit 2), throughout the remainder of the manuscript.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>apm-2</italic> cloning.</bold> (A) Genetic map position of <italic>apm-2</italic> on chromosome X.

It is somewhat surprising that disruption of the single &#x003bc;2 subunit in the worm gives rise to a viable animal. To determine whether &#x003bc;2 adaptin is completely disrupted in the mutants, the lesions were identified. Genomic Southern analysis showed that <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> contains a deletion of &#x0223c;100 kb that includes the entire coding sequence of &#x003bc;2 adaptin. To identify the endpoints of the deletion, individual open reading frames (ORFs) were PCR amplified from <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> mutant DNA and it was found that the deletion removes 17 additional ORFs from <italic>col-165</italic> to F25F6.1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic> was found to contain a G to A point mutation in the splice donor site of the last intron (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Failure to splice at this intron would introduce a stop codon 27 nt downstream of the splice junction. If translated, 9 amino acids encoded by the intron would replace the 40 amino acids at the C terminus comprising &#x003b2; strands 15, 16, and 17. &#x003b2;16 has been shown to be critical for binding cargo containing the YXX&#x003c6; motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohno et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen and Evans, 1998</xref>). Although <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic> appears to have a slightly dominant phenotype, the recessive phenotypes of <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> and <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic> are virtually identical, suggesting that <italic>gm17</italic> fully disrupts &#x003bc;2 function.</p><p>&#x003bc;2 is thought to be a critical component of the AP2 complex and should therefore be present in all tissues. To determine where &#x003bc;2 is expressed, a construct fusing GFP to the APM-2 protein was expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>apm-2</italic> promoter (Fig. S4, pMG4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1</ext-link>). Because the N terminus of &#x003bc;2 adaptin is involved in assembly of the AP2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Collins et al., 2002</xref>), GFP was fused to the C terminus of the APM-2 protein. The APM-2&#x02237;GFP fusion protein fully rescues <italic>apm-2</italic> mutant phenotypes, suggesting the tagged protein is functional and is expressed in tissues that require &#x003bc;2 function. Fluorescence is observed in the nervous system, coelomocyte, spermatheca, and vulva (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, weaker expression is observed in the intestine and the hypodermis. Although fluorescence is not detected in body muscles of animals expressing the tagged protein, muscle expression is observed in animals expressing a transcriptional reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S4, pMG3). Thus, <italic>apm-2</italic> is expressed in all tissues examined, which confirms and extends a previous paper claiming that <italic>apm-2</italic> is expressed in neurons and some hypodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shim and Lee, 2000</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>APM-2 is expressed ubiquitously.</bold> The expression pattern of translational fusion protein APM-2&#x02237;GFP (Fig. S4, pMG4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1</ext-link>) in young adult hermaphrodites. Worms are oriented anterior left and dorsal up. The image of the muscle is from the transcriptional fusion of GFP driven by the <italic>apm-2</italic> promoter (Fig. S4, pMG3) in a young adult hermaphrodite.

If &#x003bc;2 is required for synaptic vesicle recycling, then several predictions can be made. First, &#x003bc;2 should be localized to synapses. Second, &#x003bc;2 should contribute to clathrin localization at the synapse. Third, the focus of the uncoordinated phenotype should be the nervous system. Fourth, <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants will have a depletion of synaptic vesicles as assayed by electron microscopy. Fifth, <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants will have impaired synaptic transmission as assayed by electrophysiology because of an inability to recycle vesicles.</p><p>Because <italic>apm-2</italic> is expressed in virtually all tissues, it is not possible to assay synaptic localization with the rescuing GFP construct, the fluorescence signal is simply too high. To look at a small subset of neurons, the <italic>apm-2</italic> cDNA (R160.1b) was placed under the control of a GABA neuron&#x02013;specific promoter and GFP was fused at the C terminus. APM-2&#x02237;GFP is localized at synapses and colocalizes with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin/VAMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In addition, APM-2&#x02237;GFP colocalizes with C-terminal RFP-tagged clathrin heavy chain (CHC) at the synapse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Interestingly, synaptic localization of APM-2&#x02237;GFP is not dependent on AP180 (<italic>unc-11</italic>), synaptojanin (<italic>unc-26</italic>), synaptotagmin (<italic>snt-1</italic>), or stonin (<italic>unc-41</italic>) (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1</ext-link>).

Thus, if <italic>apm-2</italic> mutations disrupt AP2 function, then it is possible that clathrin localization at the synapse should be altered. We analyzed the distribution of N-terminal GFP-tagged clathrin (GFP&#x02237;CHC) in the dorsal and ventral nerve cords of GABA neurons in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants. In the dorsal cord of <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants clathrin is diffuse compared with the wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; percentage of animals scored with diffuse clathrin in the dorsal cord: in the wild type, 31%, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 29; in <italic>dpy-23(e840)</italic>, 80%, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15, P &#x0003c; 0.01; in <italic>dpy-23(gm17)</italic>, 70%, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 30, P &#x0003c; 0.01). However, in the ventral nerve cord clathrin distribution is punctate, similar to wild-type animals (Fig. S2 B). It is possible clathrin localization near cell bodies in the ventral nerve cord is caused by AP1 function at the Golgi apparatus. Clathrin is still localized at dorsal synapses in 20&#x02013;30% of the mutant animals; perhaps by other clathrin-binding proteins such as AP180, epsin, or amphiphysin. Thus, &#x003bc;2 contributes to, but is not essential for, clathrin synaptic localization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Clathrin but not synaptic vesicle proteins are mislocalized in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants.</bold> For CHC, synaptobrevin (SNB), and synaptotagmin (SNT), GFP-tagged proteins were expressed in the GABA neurons and imaged in the dorsal nerve cord.

For example, in the absence of the endocytosis proteins, such as AP180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>), synaptojanin, and endophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>), synaptic vesicle proteins are diffuse along the axon instead of clustering at synaptic varicosities. In contrast, the vesicle proteins synaptobrevin, synaptogyrin, and synaptotagmin are localized properly in the dorsal and lateral nerve cords of <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that &#x003bc;2, unlike other endocytosis proteins, is not required to maintain vesicle proteins at the synapse.</p><p>Mutants with defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis exhibit reduced synaptic transmission and are uncoordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants are also uncoordinated but the uncoordinated phenotype arises from defects in the hypodermis rather than the nervous system. When APM-2&#x02237;GFP is expressed under the control of a ubiquitous promoter the tagged &#x003bc;2 protein rescues all <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). When &#x003bc;2 protein is expressed under a pan-neuronal promoter, the <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants are still dumpy, uncoordinated, and egg-laying defective, effectively looking the same as the original <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> mutants. In contrast, when &#x003bc;2 protein is expressed under a hypodermal promoter, the <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> transgenic animals are not dumpy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, skin APM-2); moreover, the jerky uncoordinated phenotype is also rescued. Previous studies have demonstrated that the &#x003bc;2 functions in the skin rescue developmental defects in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2008</xref>); our data suggest that these nonautonomous defects might extend to development or function of motor neurons as well. However, skin-rescued animals are egg-laying defective and the body bends are increased in amplitude, suggesting neuronal function is somewhat altered. To quantify locomotion in the mosaic strains, animals were placed in a drop of liquid and body bends were counted for 90 s for each strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Thrashing rates of the hypodermal rescued strains are the same as in the wild type; whereas neuronal expression of &#x003bc;2 does not rescue thrashing. The reduced thrashing is not due to a dominant-negative effect because overexpression of &#x003bc;2 in the neurons does not impair locomotion in the wild type.

In AP180 mutants the diameter of synaptic vesicles is increased, implicating a role for this adaptin in the control of the diameter of the reforming vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>).

In <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> mutants, the number of remaining vesicles are 58% in acetylcholine neurons and 64% in GABA neurons compared with the wild type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Similar vesicle reductions relative to the wild type were also observed in <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic> (unpublished data). Vesicle number is rescued in <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> animals containing the neuron-specific AMP-2&#x02237;GFP construct but not in animals that contain the hypodermal specific APM-2&#x02237;GFP, indicating that the defect is caused by a loss of neuronal APM-2 function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). The decrease in synaptic vesicle number in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants suggests &#x003bc;2 has a significant role in synaptic vesicle recycling. Other mutants lacking endocytosis proteins such as synaptojanin and endophilin have only 38 and 30% the normal number of vesicles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>). Thus the endocytosis defect in the absence of &#x003bc;2 is less severe than other endocytosis mutants. Interestingly, the reduced vesicle pool in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants is able to sustain neuronal transmission because animals lacking &#x003bc;2 in the nervous system are not uncoordinated.

There are two lines of evidence: genetic and biochemical. First, &#x003b1; adaptin knockdowns are more severe than &#x003bc;2 adaptin knockdowns in the yolk uptake assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>). RNA interference against clathrin, &#x003b1; adaptin, or &#x003b2;2 adaptin each abolished uptake of a GFP-tagged vitellogenin (YP170-GFP) into oocytes. In contrast, RNA interference against either &#x003bc;2 or &#x003c3;2 adaptin did not disrupt uptake, suggesting that not all of the subunits of the AP2 complex are required for this process. Because RNA interference is not always fully penetrant we used our deletion allele to assay &#x003bc;2 function in yolk uptake. Approximately 120 gonads of each genotype were assayed for the presence of YP170-GFP fluorescence in oocytes. Over 98% of the gonads in both <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> and <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic> mutants were scored as positive for yolk protein uptake (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). However, the number of oocytes within each gonad containing YP170-GFP was reduced in both alleles of <italic>apm-2</italic> compared with the wild type (wild type: one oocyte, 7%; two or more, 93%; <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic>: one oocyte, 42%; two or more oocytes, 58%; <italic>apm-2(gm17)</italic>: one oocyte, 36%; two or more oocytes, 64%; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>).

Previous results suggested that each subunit is required for function and stability of the AP2 complex; e.g., RNA interference of the &#x003bc;2 subunit in HeLaM cells greatly reduced the expression level of the &#x003b1; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motley et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, expression of any single AP2 subunit in bacteria produces an insoluble protein; only simultaneous expression of all subunits produces a soluble protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Collins et al., 2002</xref>). To determine if the AP2 complex is stable in the absence of the &#x003bc;2 subunit, we performed quantitative Western blot analysis of &#x003b1; adaptin. &#x003b1; adaptin is reduced to 60% in <italic>apm-2(e840)</italic> and to 12% in <italic>amp-2(gm17)</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>). Oddly, the reduction in &#x003b1; adaptin is more severe in the truncated allele of &#x003bc;2 rather than in the null mutant; it is possible that incorporation of truncated &#x003bc;2 leads to a destabilization of the whole complex. Consistent with this result, <italic>apm-2(e840)/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygous animals are wild type, whereas <italic>apm-2(gm17)/&#x0002b;</italic> animals are slightly uncoordinated and have an egg-laying defect. The reduction in &#x003b1; adaptin levels in both alleles indicates that &#x003bc;2 is required to stabilize the AP2 complex; however, some residual &#x003b1; adaptin remains in the absence of &#x003bc;2.</p><p>The residual &#x003b1; adaptin remains bound to &#x003c3;2 adaptin. &#x003b1; adaptin tagged with GFP was immunoprecipitated from the wild type and <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants. &#x003b2; adaptin coimmunoprecipitated from the wild-type animals but not from &#x003bc;2 mutant animals (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806088/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, &#x003c3;2 adaptin (HA tagged) coimmunoprecipitated from both the wild-type and &#x003bc;2 mutant animals (Fig. S5, B and C). Moreover, residual &#x003b1; adaptin can still be localized in the absence of &#x003bc;2. Coelomocytes are scavenger cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with high levels of endocytosis. N-Terminal tagged &#x003b1; adaptin is localized properly to the plasma membrane of mutant coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref>). Similarly, tagged &#x003b1; adaptin is localized to synapses in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants. These data suggest that the protein is folded and transported correctly in mutant cells. Thus, it is possible that AP2 is at least partially functional in <italic>apm-2</italic> mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we characterized the only AP2 &#x003bc;2 adaptin subunit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. &#x003bc;2 adaptin is encoded by the gene <italic>dpy-23</italic> (<italic>apm-2</italic>). It is expressed ubiquitously in adult worms and is highly expressed in the nervous system. Absence of &#x003bc;2 impairs but does not eliminate synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Animals lacking &#x003bc;2 have &#x0223c;60% of the normal number of vesicles at synaptic varicosities, and synaptic vesicle proteins are properly localized at the synapse. This phenotype is much less severe than worm mutants lacking other recycling proteins such as AP180 (<italic>unc-11</italic>), synaptojanin (<italic>unc-26</italic>), and endophilin (<italic>unc-57</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>). For example, the number of synaptic vesicles in synaptojanin and endophilin mutants is reduced to &#x0223c;35%, the normal number of synaptic vesicles found at neuromuscular junctions.</p><p>The conclusion that &#x003bc;2 is not essential for synaptic vesicle recycling leads to several considerations. (a) Do other proteins recruit cargo? (b) Can other medium subunits stabilize AP2? (c) Do other proteins recruit clathrin?</p><p>The specific role of &#x003bc;2 is in cargo recruitment, in particular, its interactions with synaptotagmin were thought to be essential for synaptic vesicle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jorgensen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haucke et al., 2000</xref>). However, our data indicate that &#x003bc;2 is not required to recruit proteins to synaptic vesicles. The essential synaptic vesicle proteins are synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, and the neurotransmitter transporters. Other ancillary proteins have been identified that recruit these synaptic vesicle proteins to sites of endocytosis. AP180 is required to recruit synaptobrevin to synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2005</xref>). Stonin, which is distantly related to &#x003bc;2, is required for synaptotagmin recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fergestad and Broadie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walther et al., 2004</xref>). The vesicular GABA transporter is recruited by a LAMP-related protein called UNC-46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuske et al., 2007</xref>). Because of these defects in cargo recruitment, all of these mutants are severely uncoordinated in worms. In contrast, mutants lacking &#x003bc;2 in the nervous system are not uncoordinated and evoked responses are at 82% of the levels observed in the wild type, indicating that synaptic transmission is largely intact. Thus, if &#x003bc;2 recruits cargo to recycling vesicles it is unlikely to be a component essential for neurotransmission.</p><p>The medium subunit &#x003bc;2 is also known to stabilize the AP2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motley et al., 2003</xref>). One could imagine that medium subunits from the AP1 or AP3 complexes (there is no AP4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) could substitute for &#x003bc;2 and provide AP2 complex function. However, adaptins from different complexes do not appear to be redundant in other organisms. For example, in yeast, overexpression of &#x003c3;2 cannot substitute for the loss of &#x003c3;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phan et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, we found that other medium subunits cannot substitute for &#x003bc;2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Mutants lacking &#x003bc;1 (<italic>unc-101</italic>) are severely uncoordinated and exhibit defects in anterograde transport of olfactory receptors to olfactory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dwyer et al., 2001</xref>). Overexpression of &#x003bc;2 cannot rescue the severely uncoordinated phenotype of the &#x003bc;1 mutant in a thrashing assay (unpublished data). Moreover, <italic>apm-2 unc-101</italic> (&#x003bc;1 &#x003bc;2) double mutants exhibit an additive dumpy and uncoordinated phenotype rather than a synthetic phenotype, suggesting that these proteins are not acting redundantly. Mutants lacking &#x003bc;3 (<italic>apm-2(tm920)</italic>) are outwardly wild type but slightly aldicarb resistant. Again, &#x003bc;2 and &#x003bc;3 mutations do not show synthetic interactions: <italic>apm-2 apm-3</italic> double mutants (with &#x003bc;2 rescued in skin) exhibit similar aldicarb sensitivity as the &#x003bc;3 mutant alone. In addition, our data show that AP2 is destabilized in the absence of &#x003bc;2, suggesting &#x003bc;2 is the only medium subunit used by AP2 in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p><p>Our data are consistent with a study in other systems suggesting that clathrin can be recruited by alternative adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Traub, 2003</xref>). In particular, AP180 is required for normal synaptic vesicle endocytosis and it is likely that AP180 could recruit clathrin and form vesicles in the absence of AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonet et al., 1999</xref>). Our results for &#x003bc;2 seem to conflict with previous studies that suggest that the AP2 subunit &#x003b1; adaptin is essential for synaptic vesicle recycling in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. A weak mutation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b1; adaptin subunit <italic>D-&#x003b1;Ada<sup>1</sup></italic> leads to slowly moving larvae, which die as pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997</xref>). The neurons of these animals are not efficient in taking up FM1-43 dye at boutons upon stimulation. The null mutants die before hatching and the electron microscopy data suggest that these animals are depleted of synaptic vesicles. However, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the behavioral defects of <italic>apm-2</italic>&#x02013;null mutants are less pronounced. The hypodermal rescued mutants have almost normal movement and the evoked current upon stimulation is close to the wild type. Thus the neurotransmission defect in &#x003bc;2 mutants in worms is less severe than that of &#x003b1; adaptin mutants in flies. Although it is possible that residual AP2 function accounts for vesicle recycling in &#x003bc;2 mutants, it is also possible that AP2 is not essential for synaptic vesicle recycling at <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mapping and mutation analysis</title><p>The mutation <italic>e840</italic> was isolated in an x-ray mutagenesis by S.

In brief, 10 young adult hermaphrodites were placed onto a freeze chamber (100-&#x003bc;m well of type A specimen carrier) containing space-filling bacteria, covered with a type B specimen carrier flat side down, and frozen instantaneously in the HPM 010 (Leica). This step was repeated for animals of all genotypes. The frozen animals were fixed in the EM AFS system (Leica) with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone for 2 d at &#x02013;90&#x000b0;C and for 38.9 more hours with gradual temperature increase (6&#x000b0;C/h to &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C over 11.7 h, constant temperature at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 16 h, and 10&#x000b0;C/h to 20&#x000b0;C over 4 h). The fixed animals were embedded in araldite resin following the infiltration series (30% araldite/acetone for 4 h, 70% araldite/acetone for 5 h, 90% araldite/acetone overnight, and pure araldite for 8 h). Mutant and control blocks were blinded. Ribbons of ultra-thin (33-nm) serial sections were collected using an Ultracut 6 microtome (Leica) at the level of the anterior reflex of the gonad. Images were obtained on an electron microscope (H-7100; Hitachi) using a digital camera (Gatan). 250 ultra-thin contiguous sections were cut, and the ventral nerve cord was reconstructed from two animals representing each genotype. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. The numbers of synaptic vesicles (&#x0223c;30 nm), dense-core vesicles (&#x0223c;40 nm), and large vesicles (&#x0003e;40 nm) in each synapse were counted and their distance from presynaptic specialization and plasma membrane as well as the diameter of each were measured from acetylcholine neurons VA and VB and the GABA neuron VD. A synapse was defined as the serial sections containing a dense projection as well as sections on either side of that density, which contain synaptic vesicle numbers above the mean number of synaptic vesicles per profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were grown at room temperature (22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C) on agar plates with a layer of OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Adult hermaphrodite animals were used for electrophysiological analysis. Miniature and evoked postsynaptic currents (mPSCs and ePSCs) at the neuromuscular junction were recorded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) using a technique originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richmond and Jorgensen (1999)</xref>. In brief, an animal was immobilized on a sylgard-coated glass coverslip by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive along the dorsal side. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. After clearing the viscera, the cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and two adjacent muscle quadrants. A microscope (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a 40&#x000d7; water immersion lens and 15&#x000d7; eyepieces was used for viewing the preparation. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9; were used as electrodes for voltage clamping. The classical whole-cell configuration was obtained by rupturing the patch membrane of a gigaohm seal formed between the recording electrode and a body wall muscle cell. The cell was voltage clamped at &#x02212;60 mV to record mPSCs and ePSCs. ePSCs were evoked by applying a 0.5-ms square wave current pulse at a supramaximal voltage (25 V) through a stimulation electrode placed in close apposition to the ventral nerve cord. Postsynaptic currents were amplified (EP10; HEKA) and acquired with Patchmaster software (HEKA). Data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. The recording pipette solution contained the following: 120 mM KCl, 20 mM KOH, 5 mM TES, 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 36 mM sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, and 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and osmolarity at &#x0223c;310&#x02013;320 mosM. The standard external solution included the following: 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM sucrose, 10 mM glucose, and 15 mM Hepes; pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH with osmolarity &#x0223c;330&#x02013;340 mosM.</p><p>Amplitude and frequency of mPSCs were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). A detection threshold of 10 pA was used in initial automatic analysis, followed by visual inspections to include missed events (&#x02265;5 pA) and to exclude false events resulting from baseline fluctuations. Amplitudes of ePSCs were measured with Fitmaster (HEKA). The amplitude of the largest peak of ePSCs from each experiment was used for statistical analysis. Data were imported into Origin, version 7.5 (OriginLab), for graphing and statistical analysis. Unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used for statistical comparisons. A value of P &#x0003c; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
