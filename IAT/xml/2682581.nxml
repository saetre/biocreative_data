A polymorphism in the <italic>SLC30A8</italic> gene is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, although the molecular mechanism through which this phenotype is manifest is incompletely understood. Such polymorphisms may exert their effect via impacting expression level of the gene product. We used an shRNA-mediated approach to reproducibly downregulate ZnT8 mRNA expression by &#x0003e;90&#x00025; in the INS-1 pancreatic beta cell line. The ZnT8-downregulated cells exhibited diminished uptake of exogenous zinc, as determined using the zinc-sensitive reporter dye, zinquin. ZnT8-downregulated cells showed reduced insulin content and decreased insulin secretion (expressed as percent of total insulin content) in response to hyperglycemic stimulus, as determined by insulin immunoassay. ZnT8-depleted cells also showed fewer dense-core vesicles via electron microscopy. These data indicate that reduced ZnT8 expression in cultured pancreatic beta cells gives rise to a reduced insulin response to hyperglycemia. In addition, although we provide no direct evidence, these data suggest that an <italic>SLC30A8</italic> expression-level polymorphism could affect insulin secretion and the glycemic response <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>An understanding of the relationship between zinc and diabetes has evolved over decades.

Cells were stably transfected with pRS vector (Origene # TR20003; cell line Vec-shRNA), pRS-shGFP (Origene # TR30003; encoding non-effective 29-mer shGFP cassette as a negative control; cell line GFP-shRNA), or with a combination of specific ZnT8-directed 29-mer oligos (ZnT8-shRNA; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005679-t001">Table 1</xref>). These 29-mers were incorporated in the forward and in the reverse orientation, separated by a TCAAGAG loop, in the vector pRS shRNA by the manufacturer to generate four pRS-based gene-specific rat ZnT8 shRNA expression vectors (HuSH; Origene). All were independently tested for their ability to down-regulate ZnT8 expression. The two most effective vectors (ZnT8-3 and ZnT8-4) were then transfected in combination under puromycin selection (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) to generate a pooled stable cell line, and were compared to INS-1 cells stably transfected (in parallel) with empty shRNA vector or with GFP-directed shRNA. This procedure was repeated two more times such that three complete and independent sets of Vec-shRNA and ZnT8-shRNA stable transfectants were produced and analyzed. The phenotype of these cell lines remained stable for months in continuous culture; nonetheless, frozen stocks were routinely thawed to ensure consistency throughout. Grossly, morphology (via light microscopy) and growth properties of the disparate cell lines were indistinguishable.

Raw fluorimetric data (e.g., as in figures) are the averaged instrument readings for the indicated number of replicate wells.

INS-1 cells were passaged on day 0 at a density of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/well into 6-well plates in complete medium (containing 11.1 mM glucose). On day 1, medium was changed to fresh medium with 3 mM glucose&#x000d7;&#x0223c;16 h (i.e., overnight). On day 2, cells were washed once with HBSS (NaCl 114; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25.5; KCl 4.7; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2; MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.16; HEPES 20; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5; &#x0005b;all in mM&#x0005d;) supplemented with 3 mM glucose and 0.2&#x00025; freshly-prepared BSA (&#x0201c;HBSS Plus&#x0201d;). Cells were then incubated for 2 h in fresh HBSS Plus, supplemented with glucose (to a final concentration of 6 or 12 mM, as indicated) or KCl (to a final concentration of 30 mM). After the 2-h incubation, supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;20 C overnight, centrifuged to remove any debris, and then used for the secreted insulin assay. Acidified ethanol (1 ml; 75&#x00025; ethanol plus 1.5&#x00025; HCl) was added to monolayers in wells and cells were incubated overnight at &#x02212;20 C. On day 3, these acidified ethanol extracts were collected, centrifuged to remove any debris, and used for the intracellular insulin assay. Total insulin (in ng/ml) was calculated as secreted insulin&#x0002b;intracellular insulin, and percent secreted insulin was defined as (100&#x0002a;(secreted insulin/total insulin)). We used this more specific strategy, rather than normalizing to total cellular protein, because the insulin content differed among the cell lines; we reasoned that this expression of secreted insulin as a fraction of total cellular insulin content, as other groups have done (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Min1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>) would be the most conservative approach in this instance. Because both intracellular and secreted insulin would need to be normalized to total cellular protein, were this alternative approach to be adopted (i.e., normalization to total cellular protein), the quotient would be identical to the numbers we report. Of note, total protein content per well was equivalent in the VEC-shRNA and ZnT8-shRNA cell lines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). Were we to have expressed insulin secretion on a &#x0201c;per cell&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;per mg total protein&#x0201d; basis, then the consequence of ZnT8 downregulation vis-&#x000e0;-vis insulin secretion would have been more pronounced; however, our normalization to total insulin content (rather than protein content) permitted the VEC-shRNA and ZnT8-shRNA bars to be roughly equivalent under control conditions (3 mM glucose) in figures. The immunoassay was then carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's directions (ALPCO 80-INSRTH-E01). Absorbance was read at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Where indicated, protein concentration was measured using the DC Protein Assay (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's directions (Standard Assay Protocol).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>For electron microscopy, cells were released from the plate with trypsin, quenched with 10&#x00025; FBS-containing medium, and gently pelleted in a microcentrifuge tube at 1000 <italic>g</italic>.

Two of these shRNAs (3 and 4) resulted in decreased expression of ZnT8 upon stable transfection in INS-1 cells (36&#x00025; and 44&#x00025; decrease in mRNA expression, respectively; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1). Thereafter, cells were transfected with a <italic>combination</italic> of vectors 3 and 4 to maximize effectiveness. The first set of stable transfectants was created by transfecting INS-1 cells with vectors 3 and 4 (in combination), or with the empty control plasmid. We adopted a pooled stable transfectant strategy as we have used previously to minimize the effect of integration site bias; however, because of potential selection bias in pooled stable transfectants, this entire stable transfection procedure was independently repeated twice more. In all, three complete <italic>sets</italic> of stable transfectants were generated and analyzed. Transfection with the combination of two ZnT8-directed shRNAs decreased ZnT8 mRNA expression by an average of 92&#x000b1;2&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005679-g001">Figure 1</xref>; panel A).

Of note, stable transfection of INS-1 cells with an irrelevant shRNA (directed against GFP) in a total of three separate transfectants exhibited no effect upon ZnT8 mRNA abundance (1.08&#x000b1;0.17, relative to Control; data not shown).

Cells were treated with an equivalent concentration of nickel ions as an additional negative control; there was only a very modest effect of exogenous nickel upon zinquin fluorescence. These data were consistent with the zinquin-dependent fluorescent signal reflecting intracellular zinc concentration. In ZnT8-downregulated INS-1 cells (ZnT8-shRNA), zinquin fluorescence was reduced relative to vector-transfected INS-1 cells. Even in the absence of supplemental zinc, zinquin-dependent fluorescence (i.e., fluorescence in the presence of zinquin, minus background fluorescence in the absence of zinquin) was reduced by 75&#x00025; in the knock-down cells; although not reaching statistical significance (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.16), such a phenomenon could reflect intracellular zinc retained from exposure prior to the 3-h incubation period. Following loading with 75 &#x000b5;M zinc, zinquin-dependent fluorescence was reduced by 56&#x00025; in the ZnT8-down-regulated cells relative to the vector-transfected cells (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03).

As our current understanding evolves, such expression-level polymorphisms may supplant functional polymorphisms (i.e., those giving rise to loss or gain of function) as the primary drivers of inter-individual phenotypic variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Risch1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Spielman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, although we reproducibly decreased ZnT8 expression at the mRNA level, we could not assess whether there had been a corresponding reduction in ZnT8 expression at the protein level. We infer downregulation of ZnT8 expression at the protein level based upon the specific inhibition in zinc-dependent zinquin fluorescence in the ZnT8-shRNA transfectants (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005679-g003">Figure 3</xref>) &#x02013; a phenomenon linked to ZnT8 abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Chimienti2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The widely validated zinc-sensitive fluorophore, zinquin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Chimienti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Zalewski1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Coyle1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, was used in the present studies. We incorporated a number of important controls in support of our conclusion that intracellular zinc is reduced in INS-1 cells in response to ZnT8 downregulation. For example, zinquin fluorescence increased with zinquin concentration in a fashion steeply dependent upon supplemental zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005679-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The issues of potential zinc toxicity and of zinquin specificity were addressed by the inclusion of the irrelevant metal ion, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which failed to influence zinquin fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005679-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, extraneous sources of zinc were eliminated by using nominally zinc-free medium and by treating fetal bovine serum with the heavy metal-chelating resin Chelex as previously described (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005679-Rayner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Third, the effect of ZnT8 downregulation was specific to glucose-inducible insulin secretion and did not impact KCl-inducible insulin secretion. It is possible that the stimulus afforded by KCl depolarization, resulting in maximal recruitment of insulin secretory vesicles, was less susceptible to modulation; alternatively, the nature of the two stimuli &#x02013; in contrast to the magnitude of the stimuli &#x02013; may explain the difference. For example, ZnT8 may participate in the insulin secretory pathway upstream of membrane depolarization; however, there are no data to support this speculation at present. It is also important to note that the absolute amount of insulin secreted in response to both glucose and KCl was markedly less in the ZnT8-downregulated cells; however, the reduction in the insulin response to glucose was disproportionately low, relative to the reduction in total cellular insulin (i.e., data were expressed as percent of total cellular insulin and the ZnT8-downregulated cells expressed only approximately half as much insulin). In related fashion, KCl depolarization may be expected to result in more insulin secretion than glucose challenge. We saw substantial inter-assay variability and in some individual experiments, the effect of KCl exceeded that of glucose; however, the aggregated data showed similar responses in the control (vec-shRNA) stable transfectants.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005679-MacDonald1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
