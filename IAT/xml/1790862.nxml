Especially important are the type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and CXCL-10, which are produced in large amounts after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Haring1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and during allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Yi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. IL-2 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of T cells whereas IFN-&#x003b3; activates immune cells and the antigen presentation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Schroder1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCL-10 (IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible protein-10) is a potent chemoattractant for inflammatory cells and modulates adhesion molecule expression. The production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 by T cells involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation with attenuation of either capable of significantly muting cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Lindstein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Mavropoulos1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The immunosuppressives cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506 which bind to Cyclophilin A (CyA) and FKBP12, respectively, prevent NF-AT mediated cytokine gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Liu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. CyA and FKBP12 are members of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) family that catalyze the <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization of X-Pro peptide bonds. A third PPIase, Pin1, binds to and isomerizes only phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. Isomerization-induced conformational changes alter target protein function, phosphorylation and turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Wulf1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Zhou1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The initially identified Pin1 targets were cell cycle regulators particularly mitotic kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Lu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with such a function, overexpression of Pin1 has been observed in many cancers, and its levels are predictive of cancer recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Wulf2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Ayala1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we implicated Pin1 in the post-transcriptional control of GM-CSF mRNA by activated eosinophils and T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. GM-CSF is a prototypical proinflammatory cytokine, whose mRNA is regulated by 3&#x02032;-untranslated AU-rich elements (AREs). These are also found in and important for the post-transcriptional control of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shaw1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Bakheet1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting a role for Pin1 in the type 1 immune response. In the present report, we show that Pin1 KO mice show an alternated cytokine response, after co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. This reflects an inability of T cells to fully stabilize ARE mRNAs after cell activation. We explore the biology significance of these observations by testing if Pin1 blockade would alter type 1 immune responses to mismatched organ transplants. We show that mismatched lung transplants are not rejected if Pin1 is inhibited. Further, we show that Pin1 blockade is synergistic with calcineurin inhibitors such as Cyclosporin A. These data establish a new role for Pin1 in the T cell immune response and point to a novel target for immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Pin1 function on type 1 cytokine and chemokine expression was first evaluated in Pin1 knockout (KO) mice. Splenocytes from KO mice activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, which normally triggers cytokine mRNA stabilization and accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Lindstein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, showed significantly less IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 mRNA compared to WT (p&#x0003c;0.03 and p&#x0003c;0.008, respectively) while CXCL-10 mRNA was reduced by 50&#x00025; but did not quite reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figure 1A</bold></xref>). Secreted IFN-&#x003b3; was proportionally reduced (4-fold) in the supernatant of KO splenocyte cultures compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figure 1B</bold></xref>). Bulk analysis of activated KO CD4&#x0002b; or CD8&#x0002b; splenocytes by flow cytometry showed reductions in IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figure 1C</bold></xref>) compared to splenocytes from heterozygote mice. In KO mice, no differences were noted in the numbers of splenic or thymic CD3, CD4, CD8 or regulatory T cell populations or activation marker expression after stimulation (<bold>not shown</bold>), eliminating developmental differences between WT and KO mice. As CD3 mediated signaling is necessary for T cell development, these data suggest TCR function is likely normal in Pin1 KO animals. Instead, these data suggested Pin1 was involved in co-stimulatory-CD3/CD28 signaling. Indeed, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 mRNAs were less stable in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activated KO than WT splenocytes while the stability of CXCL-10 mRNA, which lacks AREs was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figure 1D</bold></xref><bold>and not shown</bold>). Therefore, Pin1 is necessary for ARE mediated cytokine mRNA stabilization after T cell co-stimulation. As Pin1 substrates also include NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Lu2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, which regulate cytokine mRNA transcription, the observed reductions in CXCL-10 suggest a nuclear event.</p><p>Pin1 can be selectively blocked by juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), which covalently binds to and irreversibly inhibits Pin-1 activity but has no effect on CyA or FKBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hennig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Prior to its use <italic>in vivo</italic>, WT and KO thymocytes were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 while rat splenocytes were treated with ionophore/PMA (I/P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figures 1E</bold></xref><bold>,</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>2</bold></xref><bold>and not shown).</bold> After 4 hours of I/P, cytokine mRNAs increased by as much as 500 fold (IFN-&#x003b3;. IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 mRNA levels were reduced in the rat or mouse WT cells by 70&#x02013;95&#x00025; after treatment with juglone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figures 1E</bold></xref><bold>,</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>2A, and 2B</bold></xref>). However, juglone had no significant effect on the abundance of IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3; or the housekeeping RNAs in Pin1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g001"><bold>figure 1E</bold></xref><bold>and not shown</bold>), demonstrating the specificity of this drug. At the concentrations used here neither CyA nor FKBP12 peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activities are affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hennig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Juglone (1 &#x000b5;M) completely blocked the accumulation of I/P-induced IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 mRNAs by rat splenocytes without altering actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>figure 2A</bold></xref>). At lower juglone concentrations (0.1 &#x000b5;M), only the accumulation of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA was significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>figure 2A</bold></xref>). These data suggest a variable sensitivity of cytokine mRNAs to Pin1 inhibition. The accumulation of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; after juglone were dramatically reduced in the culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>figure 2B</bold></xref>). The failure to produce cytokines was not a function of cell death as equivalent levels of viability were observed in I/P versus I/P/juglone treated splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g002"><bold>figure 2C</bold></xref>).</p><p>In order to characterize Pin1 function during an <italic>in vivo</italic> type I immune response, we used the widely employed F344 to WKY rat, MHC Class I mismatched, orthotopic, single lung transplantation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Haque1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Sekine1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The donor organ is attached via cuffs to the recipient's bronchial and vascular systems permitting normal function. Nonimmunosuppressed recipients experience profound acute rejection within several days largely mediated by IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 upregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Zhao1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Reinders1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Over several weeks, chronic rejection occurs with alveolar, pleural, and peribronchial collagen deposition, loss of viable pneumocytes and eventual organ loss. Recipients were given a daily, single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 1 mg/kg juglone dissolved in ethanol and diluted in 5 ml saline, while controls received diluents only. This doses of juglone had no effect on red cell mass, white cell counts, serum chemistries, liver function tests, or renal function in control, untransplanted rats (<bold>not shown)</bold>. Therefore juglone administration appeared to be safe and nontoxic. Treatment was started the day of the transplant. At day 7 or 14, animals were sacrificed and the lungs evaluated grossly and by histopathology. In untreated animals, the transplant was visibly shrunken and the pleural surfaces hemorrhagic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>). Palpation revealed a firm and unyielding consistency. The juglone treated animals showed no gross signs of rejection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>) and was indistinguishable from the contralateral control. Microscopically, the untreated transplanted lung showed severe rejection with acute inflammatory cell infiltration predominantly composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages. Alveolar architecture was totally effaced and the small airways packed with inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>). These changes were completely absent in juglone treated animals, which showed normal alveolar architecture, pleural thickness, and airway patency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>). Occasional round macrophages were present in some alveoli. No significant difference was found in the relative proportion of CD4, CD8 or &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in blood and BAL fluid from the native right lung or the transplanted left lung, 7 days after transplantation in juglone treated or untreated animals <bold>(not shown and</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g004"><bold>figure 4A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. This is in contrast to collagen V tolerized animals that show predominantly CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Mizobuchi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These data demonstrate that Pin1 blockade can dramatically attenuate acute transplant rejection.</p><p>One week after transplantation the levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-2 in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g004"><bold>figure 4B</bold></xref>). These data suggest that Pin1 blockade prevented cytokine production by T cells, which were the majority population within the BAL fluid (<bold>not shown</bold>). Since draining lymph nodes are a predominant site for immunological reactivity we analyzed mediastinal lymph node cells for the expression of cytokine mRNAs by qPCR. mRNAs coding for IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, and CXCL-10 were significantly lower in juglone treated animals than controls whereas IL-4 was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g004"><bold>figure 4C</bold></xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOTS of whole spleen showed large reductions in the juglone treated animals from untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g004"><bold>figure 4D</bold></xref>). At day 7, Pin1 PPIase activity and amount were attenuated in BAL cells and draining lymph nodes in juglone treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g005"><bold>figure 5A&#x02013;C</bold></xref>). Once inactivated by juglone, Pin1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Pin1 inhibition prevented IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-2 expression by T cells throughout the immune system and acute graft rejection after lung transplantation. The profound suppression of CXCL-10 presumably reflects both reductions in IFN-&#x003b3;, which normally induces CXCL-10 as well as direct effects of Pin1 on CXCL-10 expression.</p><p>The expression of these cytokines has been highly correlated with rejection in both animal models and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Zhao1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hauser1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to demonstrate a causal role, IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 expression vectors were combined and insufflated into donor lungs immediately before religature in the recipient. To avoid potential Pin1 mediated, post-transcriptional regulation, only the coding region without the 3&#x02032; UTR was inserted downstream of a constitutively active CMV promoter. By 1 week after transplant, the lung grafts underwent significant rejection in untreated controls, which was prevented by juglone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g003"><bold>figure 3</bold></xref>). The forced expression of IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 in juglone treated rats resulted in severe cellular infiltration irrespective of Pin1 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g005"><bold>figure 5D</bold></xref>). Transgenic cytokines were detectable in the BAL at comparable levels to that seen in untreated recipients (<bold>not shown</bold>). These results support a central role of IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 in the process of acute rejection and suggest that cytokine suppression after Pin1 inhibition is likely responsible for graft sparing.</p><p>Immunosuppressive drugs, particularly CsA greatly improves graft survival but have renal damage as a common side effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Duncan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. To avoid toxicity and enhance graft acceptance, immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites, and rapamycin are given in combination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Duncan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Cyclosporine A and tacrolimus indirectly inhibit nuclear factor of T cells (NFAT) preventing the transcriptional upregulation of cytokine genes by activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Duncan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, Pin1 suppresses expression through the regulation of cytokine mRNA stability. Given this distinct mode of action, we asked if combined CsA and juglone therapy would be additive or synergistic. CsA was injected intraperitoneally for 3 days at a dose of 1 mg/kg together with 0.1 mg/kg of juglone, which was then continued alone for 4 more days. Cyclosporine is usually used at 25 mg/kg/day for 3 days which induces long lived lung transplant acceptance in rats while moderate to severe rejection was observed at doses of 5 mg/kg/d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Pierog1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Transplanted animals treated with CsA alone (1 mg/kg/d) showed modest graft discoloration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>) but microscopically severe cellular infiltration diffusely throughout the parenchyma with foci in peribronchial and perivascular areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Similarly, suboptimal inhibition of Pin1 leads to severe rejection pathology with substantial cellular infiltration and hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). In contrast, combined suboptimal treatment with CsA and juglone provided excellent graft protection without identifiable cellular infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000226-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). These data show that combined inhibition of Pin1 and calcineurin are additive or synergistic and suggest that CsA dosage could be signifcantly reduced if Pin1 inhibition is added to the therapeutic regiment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recently reported that Pin1 plays a role in the post-transcriptional control of GM-CSF mRNA expression by activated eosinophils and lymphocytes. Mechanistically, Pin1 interacts with and controls the ARE mRNA-binding activity of AUF1. When associated with AUF1, ARE mRNAs such as GM-CSF are rapidly catabolized by the exosome preventing translation. Cell activation rapidly increased Pin1 activity leading to AUF1 isomerization and loss of mRNA binding. Under these conditions, GM-CSF mRNA was stabilized and translated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggested that other cytokine mRNAs, particularly those with AREs in their 3&#x02032; untranslated region might be similarly regulated. Here we show <italic>in vitro</italic>, using either Pin1 KO or juglone-treated splenocytes from WT rats that Pin1 activity is required to stabilize, accumulate and translate mRNAs coding for several type-1 cytokines including IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2.

CXCL-10 <italic>in vitro</italic> and IL-4 <italic>in vivo</italic> mRNA levels were far less affected by Pin1 blockade, suggesting Pin1 regulates only the most labile AU-rich mRNAs.

Finally, incomplete Pin1 blockade using low dose juglone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> failed to decrease IL-2 mRNA levels but significantly reduced protein secretion. Therefore, in addition to stabilization and transcription, Pin1 may affect the of ARE mRNAs as well.</p><p>Pin1 differs from CyA and FKBP12 in uniquely recognizing phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs via a group IV WW domain and its PPIase is structurally distinct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Gothel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike CyA and FKBP12, Pin1 is sensitive to juglone, which irreversibly binds to cysteines within the isomerase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hennig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Enzymatic assays herein demonstrated that Pin1 activity in cell lysates most proximal to allostimulation (BAL and mediastinal nodes) was completely suppressed. <italic>In vitro</italic>, 5.7 &#x000b5;M juglone eliminated essentially 100&#x00025; of Pin1's and highly related yeast and <italic>E</italic>. coli parvulin isomerases activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hennig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, these juglone concentrations had no effect on cyclophilin A nor FKBP12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hennig1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Assuming complete distribution throughout all body water, the 1 mg/kg dose of juglone used here should generate a maximal concentration of &#x0223c;10 &#x000b5;M. Therefore, it is very unlikely that cyclophilin A nor FKBP12 were affected by juglone treatment and underlie the graft acceptance seen here. While juglone has been shown to affect other enzymes including RNA polymerase, pyruvate decarboxylase and glutathione S-transferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Chao1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, none of these has been implicated in the selective expression of the subset of cytokine mRNAs downregulated in these experiments. Were these enzymes or polymerases inhibited, global rather than selective downregulation of gene expression would be expected. Therefore, we conclude that the immunosuppressive effects of juglone <italic>in vivo</italic> reflect Pin1 blockade. In addition, the specificity of juglone on IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 expression through Pin1 has been confirmed using T cells from KO mice. Indeed, juglone did not affect IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 expression in activated T cells from these animals. Importantly, these doses of juglone were nontoxic. Neither renal, hematology nor liver function tests showed abnormalities after treatment for 2 weeks. While it is unlikely juglone would be employed clinically, these data are encouraging for the development of additional Pin1 inhibitors.</p><p>Irrespective of molecular mechanism, suppression of Pin1 clearly prevented acute and chronic graft rejection. Most prominently absent were inflammatory cells and compensatory alveolar, pleural and bronchial fibrosis. Based on our data, we favor three explanations for graft survival after Pin1 inhibition. First, the production or expression of critical, proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL-10) and cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2) containing 3&#x02032; untranslated region AREs were markedly attenuated. CXCL-10 levels have been well correlated with the rejection by human recipients of renal, cardiac and lung allografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Zhao1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hauser1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Agostini1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Cardiac allografts were not rejected if derived from CXCL-10 deficient donor mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hancock1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> nor if wild type organs were transplanted into CXCL-10 receptor knockout recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hancock2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 have been highly associated with rejection in human cardiac and lung allograft recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-vanBesouw1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Hodge1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and the appearance of IFN-&#x003b3; positive splenocytes predicted the onset of renal transplant rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Nickel2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 appear particularly important for T cell chemotaxis into and propensity to initiate an anti-graft response. This was directly tested here by constitutive overexpression of IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCL-10 within the graft and demonstration that Pin1 blockade was unable to prevent immune cell infiltration and rejection. Finally, the lack of chronic rejection and collagen deposition observed here may reflect a role of Pin1 in TGF-&#x003b2;1 production or signalling to fibroblasts. TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced collagen III mRNA was significantly reduced by escalating doses of juglone (Shen <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript submitted). The mechanism underlying this observation is unknown but presumably involves Smad signalling. These data suggest Pin1 blockade could be effective in reducing the fibrosis characteristic of BOS, which is seen despite immunosuppression with CsA, steroids and other agents.</p><p>The identification of Pin1 as a potential target for immunosuppression could have considerable importance. Most currently employed drugs have been available for 15 years or more and despite combined therapy, continue to have significant side-effects. Based on the data here and previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, Pin1's regulation of immune responses involves post-transcriptional pathways largely unaffected by CsA or FK506. Therefore, we tested if CsA plus juglone showed additive effects. Indeed, combined therapy with suboptimal doses of CsA and juglone showed dramatic inhibition of graft rejection, demonstrating that these agents could be used together with effectiveness and possibly lower toxicity.</p><p>The data presented here show that Pin1 influences the type I immune response by modulating the production of proinflammatory, T cell cytokines including IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2. Based on prior work, Pin1 likely functions through direct interactions with and regulation of key AUUUA specific, mRNA binding proteins such as AUF1, HnRNP C and HuR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Shen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000226-Esnault1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Interference with Pin1 through pharmacologic or genetic means reduced IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 production and substantially attenuated graft rejection. Our data predict that drug combinations directed at the production (CsA, FK506, steroids) and decay of cytokine mRNAs would more effectively suppress alloimmunity and do so with reduced toxicity. More generally, the broad range of type 1 immune responses such as infectious diseases (intra and extracellular pathogens) or autoimmunity (diabetes, multiple sclerosis and lupus) that involve or require IFN-&#x003b3; suggest a role for Pin1 in these processes as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), ethanol, ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO), isoflurane was from Phoenix Pharmaceutical Inc.
