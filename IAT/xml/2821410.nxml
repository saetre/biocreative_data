SIRT1 is a NAD&#x0002b; dependent deacetylase that is known to regulate caloric restriction mediated longevity in model organisms, and has also been linked to the insulin/IGF signaling pathway. Here we investigated the potential regulation of mTOR signaling by SIRT1 in response to nutrients and cellular stress. We demonstrate that SIRT1 deficiency results in elevated mTOR signaling, which is not abolished by stress conditions. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1 interacts with TSC2, a component of the mTOR inhibitory-complex upstream to mTORC1, and regulates mTOR signaling in a TSC2 dependent manner. These results demonstrate that SIRT1 negatively regulates mTOR signaling potentially through the TSC1/2 complex.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dependent deacetylase, SIRT1 (Sir2) has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including aging and lifespan extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Boily1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Guarente1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Lin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results demonstrate that SIRT1 and mTOR signaling pathways are indeed interconnected in a way that promotes stress sensing pro-survival signals, where the regulation of mTOR is mediated potentially through an interaction of SIRT1 with the TSC1-TSC2 complex.</p><p>Stress conditions downregulate mTOR signaling thereby reducing protein synthesis and cell growth. We found that this mechanism is deregulated in the absence of SIRT1 in mouse and human cells. SIRT1 deficiency caused upregulation of mTOR signaling which could not be abolished even under cellular stress caused by leucine starvation and other stress inducible stimuli. Interestingly, SIRT1 has been suggested as a nutrient-sensitive growth suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Narala1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it was proposed that SIRT1 functions through regulation of telomerase activity, our results suggest that SIRT1 functions as a nutrient-responsive growth suppressor also by regulating mTOR signaling.</p><p>SIRT1 has been shown to regulate many metabolic and stress responsive pathways through the regulation of gene expression of critical components. We observed that for mTOR regulation, SIRT1 does not seem to function through regulating expression of mTOR signaling proteins, instead SIRT1 potentially regulates mTOR through an upstream inhibitory complex. Using SIRT1 deficient and TSC2 deficient cells, we observed that SIRT1's inhibitory effect on mTOR was similar to that of the mTOR inhibitory protein TSC2. Further analysis using SIRT1 activator and inhibitor indicated that the mTOR inhibitory effect of SIRT1 was at least partially dependent on TSC2. Resveratrol has been reported to affect insulin signaling through SIRT1 independent pathways. Consistent with these reports, our data demonstrated that at lower doses, resvetratrol regulated the mTOR pathway in a SIRT1 dependent manner. However, at higher doses, reveratrol likely activated SIRT1 independent pathways in parallel, to inhibit mTOR activity.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model where negative regulation of mTOR signaling by SIRT1 is mediated through its association with TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009199-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The TSC1-TSC2 complex is the most prominent upstream inhibitor of mTOR signaling, integrating several upstream signals such as growth factor, energy, stress and possibly amino acids. In response to specific stimuli, such as hormones, low energy, low nutrient or hypoxia, specific kinases and regulatory proteins activate or inhibit the TSC2 protein of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, thereby regulating mTOR signaling. By acting through the main mTOR inhibitory complex (TSC1/TSC2 complex), SIRT1 potentially responds to more than one form of stress or growth signal to regulate mTOR signaling.</p><p>Importantly, our results demonstrating a role for SIRT1 in mTOR signaling is the first evidence for SIRT1 to directly modulate translation-regulation. Previously, SIRT1's role in regulating cellular stress response was shown to involve various transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B, p53 and the FOXO proteins, and other non-transcription factor proteins such as Ku70 and ATG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Cohen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009199-Lee1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with a role for SIRT1 in stress induced translation regulation, we also have demonstrated that SIRT1 interacts with eIF-2alpha, a translation initiation factor, to regulate stress induced translation control (Ghosh et al).</p><p>Future studies are needed for insight into the exact mechanism of SIRT1's regulation on the TSC1/TSC2 complex or other potential upstream regulators of mTORC1. Since both SIRT1 and mTOR affect cellular pathways critical in stress response and aging, the regulatory inter-relationship between these proteins will prove to be helpful for designing effective therapeutic strategies for age-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines and Mouse Tissues</title><p>HeLa and 293 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) were maintained under standard cell culture conditions.
