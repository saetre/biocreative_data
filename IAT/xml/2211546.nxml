Despite their central role in growth and development and defence, resolving their modus operandi remains a major challenge in plant biology. Features of protein sequences and/or structure that determine protein targeting to plasmodesmata were previously unknown. We identify here a novel family of plasmodesmata-located proteins (called PDLP1) whose members have the features of type I membrane receptor-like proteins. We focus our studies on the first identified type member (namely At5g43980, or PDLP1a) and show that, following its altered expression, it is effective in modulating cell-to-cell trafficking. PDLP1a is targeted to plasmodesmata via the secretory pathway in a Brefeldin A&#x02013;sensitive and COPII-dependent manner, and resides at plasmodesmata with its C-terminus in the cytoplasmic domain and its N-terminus in the apoplast. Using a deletion analysis, we show that the single transmembrane domain (TMD) of PDLP1a contains all the information necessary for intracellular targeting of this type I membrane protein to plasmodesmata, such that the TMD can be used to target heterologous proteins to this location. These studies identify a new family of plasmodesmal proteins that affect cell-to-cell communication. They exhibit a mode of intracellular trafficking and targeting novel for plant biology and provide technological opportunities for targeting different proteins to plasmodesmata to aid in plasmodesmal characterisation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In plants, cylindrical, microscopic channels called plasmodesmata provide intracellular connections between cells for communication and material transport, and are important for many aspects of plant growth and defence. We identify a novel family of plasmodesmata-located proteins (called PDLP1) with features of type I membrane receptor-like proteins. In line with the potential for this protein to regulate molecular movement from cell to cell, we show that altered expression of the protein changes the efficiency of protein diffusion from plasmodesmata. We have also analysed the manner in which PDLP1 is transported to plasmodesmata. We show that the single transmembrane domain (TMD) of the protein contains all the information necessary for targeting to plasmodesmata and that proper targeting depends upon specific interactions with other factors within the membrane. Notably, a single amino acid close to the C-terminus of the TMD is critical for determining the intracellular destination. Further, by fusing the TMD to yellow fluorescent protein, we establish that the TMD can be used to target heterologous proteins to plasmodesmata.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Little is know about the structure and function of plant cell-to-cell connections, called plasmodesmata.

Their importance has been highlighted by the range of diverse non&#x02013;cell-autonomous functions that depend on intercellular macromolecular communication through plasmodesmata. Hence, a range of transcription factors in the shoot apical meristem and at the root tip have functional roles in cells other than those in which they were produced &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Last, plant virus pathogens, which are restricted to the symplast, must use plasmodesmata to invade neighbouring cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and very recently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; it has been proposed that biotrophic fungi may exploit plasmodesmata during tissue invasion. All of these macromolecules and organisms are above the experimentally defined normal size-exclusion limits for plasmodesmata, which points to highly regulated plasmodesmal processes for their recognition and transport between cells. This is exemplified by plant viruses, all of which encode so-called movement proteins (MPs) that interact with and modify the properties of these structures to allow the passage of virus particles or other forms of ribonucleoprotein complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The organisational complexity of plasmodesmata remains a matter of speculation constrained by the interpretation of electron microscopical images &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, they comprise plasma membrane (PM)-lined channels that cross the cell wall to join adjacent cells symplastically. They contain an axial-appressed membrane element derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), called the desmotubule, and may contain proteinaceous spoke-like structures that cross the cytoplasmic sleeve between the PM and desmotubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Despite the crucial role of plasmodesmata in growth and development, plant defence, and pathogenesis, almost nothing is known about the integral components of plasmodesmata or plasmodesmal biogenesis. From the identification of proteins interacting with viral MPs, coimmunolocalisation studies applied to candidate proteins, and proteomics approaches, a number of proteins have been identified in association with plasmodesmata &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

Briefly, the proteins are predicted to be type I membrane proteins with molecular mass ranging from 30.2 to 35.3 kDa and comprising an N-terminal signal peptide, a large region containing two similar domains annotated as domains of unknown function 26 (DUF26), a single transmembrane domain (TMD), and a short C-terminal tail.

The PDLP1 families in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice comprise two clades from eight members. C-terminal fusions with GFP were constructed for all eight PDLP1 proteins and analysed for their subcellular targeting after expression from the CaMV 35S promoter; all showed targeting to plasmodesmata (representative proteins from <italic>At2g01660</italic> and <italic>At2g33330</italic> are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, there are three other groups of DUF26-related proteins. These include a group of proteins that contain a signal peptide for secretion, but lack the TMD domain (e.g., protein from <italic>At5g48540</italic>, which was secreted to form large, unresolved bodies in the apoplast), a second group where the TMD and short C-terminus are replaced with a glycosylphosphoinositol (GPI) anchor domain (e.g., protein from <italic>At1g63580</italic>, which was localized to the PM), and a third group of predicted receptor-like kinases (e.g., protein from <italic>At4g23140</italic>) where the short C-terminus is replaced with a serine/threonine kinase domain.

However, scrutiny of the public microarray expression data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch">http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch</ext-link>) showed that the tissue-specific pattern of expression of these genes differed widely with respect to expression in leaf tissues. To accommodate potential problems of functional redundancy within the family, various combinations of KOs were made by crossing.

Addition of BFA led to the complete loss of Golgi stacks and the concomitant formation of large ER&#x02013;Golgi hybrid bodies/BFA compartment in which both PDLP1a:GFP and ManI:RFP accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g006">Figure 6</xref>D to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g006">6</xref>F, stars).

This was likely due to a (dose-dependent) incomplete inhibition of secretion or to pre-existing PDLP1a:GFP molecules within plasmodesmata before addition of BFA. Since BFA induces a range of effects on treated cells due to the inhibition of multiple Arf-GEFs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, additional experiments were performed using a dominant-negative mutant of the Ras-like small GTPase, Sar1 (<italic>Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d;</italic>), to specifically block ER export; the wild-type protein was used as the control. As expected, coexpression of wild-type <italic>Sar1:RFP</italic> with <italic>PDLP1a:GFP</italic> had no effect on PDLP1a:GFP steady-state accumulation within plasmodesmata (unpublished data). In contrast, coexpression with the GTPase-impaired mutant <italic>Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d;</italic> led to the retention of PDLP1a:GFP in the ER as deduced from the perinuclear labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g006">Figure 6</xref>G) and the visualisation of a typical polygonal network in cortical sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g006">Figure 6</xref>H). Similar to BFA treatment, incorporation of PDLP1a into plasmodesmata was not completely abolished in all cells. This could be as a consequence of partial inhibition of secretion following expression of <italic>Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d;</italic>, because inhibition of secretion is directly related to the steady-state accumulation of Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, or prior accumulation of PDLP1a:GFP before <italic>Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d;</italic> expression. Such variability is inherent in experiments using transient expression following agro-infiltration. Most importantly, however, induced retention of PDLP1a:GFP in the ER or in the BFA compartment was never observed under conditions where secretion was unperturbed. It is therefore concluded that PDLP1a utilises the secretory pathway for delivery to plasmodesmata.</p><fig id="pbio-0060007-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>PDLP1a Utilises the Secretory Pathway for Delivery to Plasmodesmata</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">N. benthamiana</named-content> leaves were agro-infiltrated with a construct expressing <italic>35S::PDLP1a:GFP</italic> (A to H) and either a construct expressing a Golgi marker (<italic>35S::ManI:RFP</italic>; &#x0005b;A to F&#x0005d;) or a construct expressing the Sar1 inhibitory mutant variant Sar1&#x0005b;H74L&#x0005d;:RFP that blocks ER to Golgi transport (G and H).</p><p>(A&#x02013;C) Cells expressing <italic>35S::PDLP1a:GFP</italic> and <italic>35S::ManI:RFP</italic> showed discrete punctate structures characteristic of plasmodesmata (arrowheads), and Golgi stacks, respectively.

Being embedded within the relatively rigid cell wall structure has hindered plasmodesmal purification using conventional biochemical approaches and delayed progress on understanding these molecular channels that lie at the heart of cellular communication in plants. Our approach, based upon a bioinformatic analysis of a partial <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell wall proteome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, has identified PDLP1 proteins as a family of novel plasmodesmal constituents. Other plasmodesmata-associated proteins have been identified (cited earlier), but in the majority of cases, these appear to have multiple subcellular locations that could reflect various cellular roles. By drawing parallels with the nuclear complex, which could be considered to have analogous functions in the translocation of macromolecules, plasmodesmata should have many tens of proteins involved in their intrinsic structure and function and which may be uniquely located in that environment. PDLP1a expressed from its own promoter appears to uniquely accumulate in plasmodesmata and, hence, <italic>pPDLP1a::Pldp1a:GFP</italic> transgenic plants provide a valuable marker line for the location and frequency of plasmodesmata. In contrast to TMV MP, which only accumulates in complex plasmodesmata that are a feature of photosynthetic source tissues, PDLP1a:GFP accumulates more widely. It was identified from rapidly dividing suspension cells that contain only simple primary plasmodesmata &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; and identifies plasmodesmata in both very young (photosynthetic sink; unpublished data) and mature leaf tissues.</p><p>The PDLP1 family resides within a larger group of proteins that share the 2xDUF26 domain configuration in common. Some of these have features of receptor-like kinases that are induced in response to treatments with pathogens or signalling molecules associated with pathogen attack (e.g., reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;). These kinases have DUF26 domains located extracellularly and signal through a TMD to the cytoplasmic kinase module &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In accord with the predictions resulting from bioinformatic analysis suggesting that PDLP1a is a type I membrane protein, we showed that the short C-terminal tail of PDLP1a resides within the cytoplasm, leaving the 2xDUF26 domain in the apoplast. It is intriguing that such receptor-like molecules at the PM should be uniquely targeted to plasmodesmata and suggests that extracellular signals could be transduced directly into the environs of the plasmodesma to control molecular trafficking between cells.</p><p>That PDLP1 proteins have the potential to modulate cell-to-cell trafficking was clearly established by altering their expression and measuring the effect in a GFP diffusion assay. This assay has been used widely as a measure of plasmodesmal function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Lines overexpressing <italic>PDLP1a</italic> showed a dramatic reduction in GFP movement. Interestingly, the homozygous transgenic lines showing a large ectopic accumulation of PDLP1 also showed a reduced-growth phenotype indicative of the damaging effect of reduced cell-to-cell communication. The logical corollary of the reduced trafficking would be increased trafficking when PDLP1 proteins were reduced in their expression. However, this makes a number of assumptions: First, that in normally growing plants, the PDLP1 protein is constitutively active, and second, that the effects on single genes would not be masked due to redundancy with other members of the multigene family. The diverse expression patterns of the PDLP1 proteins are distinctive but show extensive overlap across different tissues. Hence, we were not surprised to find that single insertional KO lines showed no visible phenotype and no change in GFP movement. However, by concentrating on clade 1 of the PDLP1 family, within which there are members expressed relatively highly in leaves (the test tissues for our GFP assay), we showed that combined KO lines did exhibit the reverse phenotype (i.e., more GFP movement). Three double KO combinations were tested, but only two showed increased GFP trafficking. We assume that the effect of these combined mutations is dependent upon the relative contribution each gene makes in wild-type plants and that extending the combinations further (e.g., triple and quadruple KOs) would increase the likelihood of an altered response and, possibly, ultimately some negative impact upon plant performance. Uncovering the contribution of the PDLP1 proteins to plasmodesmal function will add important information to our very limited understanding of plasmodesmal control.</p><p>Little has been known of the mechanisms, the chaperones, or the addresses that specify plasmodesmal targeting. For the three best-characterised plasmodesmal-associated proteins, TMV MP, &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase, and the <sup>C1</sup>RGPs, the intracellular route to plasmodesmata is different. TMV MP is a membrane-embedded protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, but in its targeting to plasmodesmata, is BFA-insensitive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and likely involves the actin cytoskeleton &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, targeting of the <sup>C1</sup>RGPs, which are soluble and not membrane proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, depends on active secretion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; although they lack an N-terminal signal peptide. The RGPs have no established function, and the determinants for plasmodesmal targeting remain to be identified. The plasmodesmal &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase is a GPI-anchored protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; that is presumably secreted. It is intriguing that this protein partitions between a general PM location and plasmodesmata, but is not retained at the latter site after plasmolysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. This implies that unlike PDLP1a, the &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase moves to plasmodesmata via the PM and sustains only a superficial physical association with plasmodesmata.</p><p>The PDLP1 family of proteins have structural features typical of secreted proteins and are targeted to plasmodesmata via the secretory pathway. Hence, PDLP1a accumulates in the BFA compartment after treatment and shows sensitivity to disruption of the COPII-mediated ER-export by the GTP-locked form of Sar1. In addition, it is well established that the destination along the secretory pathway for single-pass membrane proteins is influenced markedly by the length of the hydrophobic domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, lengthening the TMD of the plant vacuolar sorting receptor BP-80 from 19 to 22 amino acids resulted in the escape of the protein from the Golgi and its accumulation in the PM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, reducing the length of the TMD of another type I protein from 23 to 20 or to 17 residues led to the retention of the protein in the Golgi or the ER, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The same rule is likely also to apply to PDLP1a and other members of the family. With its predicted 21 amino acids, the TMD is probably sufficient to promote exit from the ER and the trafficking of the protein to the Golgi or even to the PM, a hypothesis further substantiated by the ER retention of the PDLP1a&#x00394;C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:GFP mutant with a shortened TMD. We exclude a contribution from the PDLP1a signal peptide since across the eight members of the family, the signal peptides show no amino acid homology except that they fulfil the hydrophobic and approximate length requirements of signal peptides. It seems very unlikely, however, that the length of the TMD on its own would be sufficient to specify plasmodesmal targeting. Rather, our results where we have mutated the TMD while retaining its predicted length of 21 amino acids strongly support the presence of a sorting signal that would be recognized by a receptor system and machinery (specific vesicles; intermediate compartments; and trafficking regulatory proteins) for delivery to the correct destination. Sorting signals of intrinsic membrane proteins generally reside within the extramembranous domains (exposed toward the cytoplasm or the ER lumen) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060007-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In the absence of such exposed determinants, as demonstrated by plasmodesmal targeting of the chimeric SP:Citrine:TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060007-g008">Figure 8</xref>) that completely lack the N- and C-terminal extramembranous domains of PDLP1a, such a sorting signal must reside within the TMD and its recognition must take place within the lipid bilayer. The most likely scenario would be for this to take place through lateral interaction with other TM proteins. Further experiments are needed to address the existence of such sorting signal mechanisms for the targeting of PDLP1-type and other proteins to plasmodesmata. Also it will be important to determine whether sorting occurs during secretion, i.e., within the Golgi complex or trans-Golgi network where most proteins are sorted, or only once PDLP1a has reached the PM.</p><p>Although we understand little at present about the structure and function of plasmodesmata, that PDLP1a TMD is sufficient to confer plasmodesmal targeting opens up the possibility of targeting other novel functions to this unique subcellular compartment with the potential to selectively control the passage of macromolecules or for the more general control of molecular trafficking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning.</title><p>Gateway technology (Invitrogen) was used to generate all the clones in this publication.
