This potassium efflux constitutes the primary ionic current responsible for maintaining resting membrane potential, and contributes significantly to uterine quiescence during pregnancy. In myometrial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs), changes in the expression or activity of K<sup>+ </sup>channels can translate into inadequate repolarization, thus leading to aberrant uterine activity, and this may contribute to pathophysiological conditions such as pre-term and post-term labor. One determinant of the total K<sup>+ </sup>MSMC current is the large conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (maxi-K channel). This channel provides a repolarizing current in response to excitatory stimuli, most notably in response to increases in the levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and blocking the channel by pharmacological means induces the depolarization of MSMCs and also enhances contraction strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Various mechanisms contribute to the modulation of maxi-K current expression in MSMCs. For example, an association of the channel with accessory beta subunits promotes channel activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Also, both alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and post-translational modifications of protein can lead to either increased or decreased channel activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Adding to the complexity of the regulation of MSMC excitability is recent evidence indicating that the maxi-K channel is targeted to caveolae, where it regulates cellular processes and muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Localization to caveolae and lipid rafts has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for a number of ion channels. For example, isoform 4 of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN4) has been shown to localize to lipid rafts, and disruption of this association following the application of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin results in both channel redistribution within the membrane and changes in channel kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the case of the voltage-gated K<sup>+ </sup>(Kv) channel, different isoforms are normally present in distinct raft domains, with Kv1.5 present in caveolae and Kv2.1 present in non-caveolar lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown that cells transfected with a caveolin mutant that disrupts trafficking sequesters Kv1.5, but not Kv2.1, intracellularly. In addition, depletion of cholesterol, a key component of lipid rafts, alters Kv1.5 channel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Caveolar invaginations are prevalent in human MSMCs (hMSMCs), increasing the geometric cell surface area by as much as ~ 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Maxi-K channels can reside in the caveolae, where they associate with the scaffolding protein caveolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Of three caveolin isoforms (cav-1, -2, and -3), cav-1 and cav-2 are predominant in both non-pregnant and pregnant non-laboring myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These proteins can bind, organize, and functionally regulate multiple cell signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] through a region termed the scaffolding domain, which interacts with a variety of proteins, including G-protein alpha-subunits, Src family tyrosine kinases, and eNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In spite of our knowledge of the existence of an association between the maxi-K channel and caveolin, how this interaction affects MSMC function remains unknown. In this study we investigate the consequences of this interaction--more specifically, how the association between the maxi-K channel and cav-1 influences the current expression and excitability of myometrial cells--with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of normal and aberrant uterine function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of mutants</title><p>Constructs encoding mutant maxi-K channel forms were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

One &#x003bc;g of a maxi-K channel antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was then added, and immunoprecipitates were gently mixed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

The secondary antibody used in all cases was goat anti-mouse (1:3000) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). All antibodies were diluted in PBST (1.37 mM NaCl, 81.01 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 26.82 mM KCl, and 14.7 mM KH2PO4, 0.5% Tween, pH 7.2) containing 3% non-fat dry milk.

For co-localization studies, Ltk- cells were incubated with rabbit maxi-K channel antibody (1:250; Millipore, Temecula, CA) for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C, and then with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch) for 15 min, 37&#x000b0;C. They were then incubated for 15 min in blocking buffer for at 37&#x000b0;C, for 30 min in blocking buffer plus a mouse anti-caveolin antibody (1:500; BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, and finally for 15 min in blocking buffer plus a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch) for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Signals were visualized using a Zeiss 510 confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 5 Image Browser (Zeiss). For controls, Ltk- cells were incubated with primary antibodies alone (30 min at 37&#x000b0;C) or secondary antibodies alone (15 min at 37&#x000b0;C). In general, Ltk- cells do not generate high background when an anti-mouse secondary antibody is used. Moreover, any background issues due to non-specific binding of the secondary antibody would be discovered by performing the experiments with the secondary antibody alone. Bleedthrough of fluorescent signals into the neighboring channels was controlled for by turning off all but one laser at a time, and recording images in all channels. Laser power, pinhole size and detector gain were then adjusted to ensure that the image appeared in its respective channel only. A nuclear counterstain was not performed since confocal microscopy of these cells showed sufficient morphological detail to identify individual cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All patch-clamping experiments were performed at RT. Whole-cell current was measured using an Axopatch 200-B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Signals were filtered with a cutoff frequency of 5 kHz. Data acquisition was controlled using commercial pClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices), and data were digitized using a Digidata 1320 interface (Molecular Devices). Ltk- cells expressing wild-type and mutant channels (see Transfections), and hMSMC in which the caveolin-1 gene was inhibited (see siRNA) were placed in a pH 7.4 bath solution containing, in mM: 135 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 5 Hepes.

In control cells, iberiotoxin (IbTX) inhibited K<sup>+ </sup>current by 74%. Our data suggest that a subpopulation of maxi-K channels whose function is modulated by cav-1 generates 40 to 45% of the total maxi-K current in hMSMCs. The decrease in current density when cells are depleted of cav-1 could reflect a role for cav-1 in trafficking of the maxi-K channel to the plasma membrane. The fact that the current is not abolished demonstrates that maxi-K channels are not solely modulated by cav-1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis of hMSMCs depleted of caveolin-1 using an siRNA approach</bold>. siRNA-mediated depletion of caveolin-1 (cav-1) in non-laboring hMSMCs (C) decreases current density relative to that in non-infected hMSMCs (A) and hMSMCs treated with a scrambled siRNA (B).

The solubilization of non-raft proteins in these samples was complete, as the transferrin receptor (which does not associate with lipid rafts and thus served as a marker of Triton X-100-soluble membranes) was not detected in any of these samples (data not shown).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Western immunoblot analysis of the expression of WT and mutant maxi-K channels in lipid rafts from mouse fibroblasts</bold>.

We therefore used anti-channel and anti-caveolin antibodies in immunocytochemical analysis to determine whether, in Ltk- cells expressing the WT and mutant channels, the channel proteins and caveolin localize to the same area of the membrane. As expected, WT maxi-K channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, red) were localized primarily on the plasma membrane, whereas cav-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, green) was present both on the plasma membrane and intracellularly. Regions of overlap between the cav-1 and WT signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, yellow) were observed in these cells, consistent with co-localization at the plasma membrane. Similarly, mutant F1012A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and mutant Y1007A, F1012A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) were expressed only on the plasma membrane, in a pattern that overlapped with that of cav-1. In contrast, mutant Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A localized to both the membrane and intracellular sites, and its signal did not overlap with that of cav-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Immunofluorence- and immunoprecipitation-based analyses of cellular localization of wild-type and mutant forms of the maxi-K channel in mouse fibroblasts</bold>.

In the case of lipid rafts isolated from cells transfected with the WT channel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, WT), mutant F1012A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, F1012A) and mutant Y1007A, F1012A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, Y1007A, F1012A), cav-1 was observed in the immunoprecipitate. However, when lipid rafts from cells transfected with mutant Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A were tested, cav-1 was absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A). These findings suggest that all three aromatic amino acids contribute to the interaction between the maxi-K channel and cav-1, but that two are sufficient to promote a detectable interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The molecular mechanisms that underlie the process, and particularly the initiation, of labor remain only poorly understood. During labor, the upper segment of the uterus actively contracts, thereby promoting fetal expulsion, whereas the lower portion of the organ (composed of both the lower uterine segment and the cervix) relaxes to permit fetal exit. Cells isolated from the lower uterine segment of humans during late stages of pregnancy generate a current reminiscent of that typically produced by the maxi-K channel, but this channel becomes constitutively active and lacks voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity after the onset of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The reason for this switch in activity remains unknown, but could be due to: 1) variation in the physiological and pharmacological properties of maxi-K channels in MSMCs during pregnancy and/or, 2) rapid changes in maxi-K channel regulation during the transition from the non-laboring to the laboring state. Our recent findings that the maxi-K channel resides in caveolae on the MSMC, and that it associates with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate channel activity, raise the possibility that this channel may interact dynamically with associated proteins to regulate the transition of the uterus from a quiescent to a contractile state. For example, components crucial for the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a key regulator of the maxi-K channel, are localized in caveolae and may serve as initiation sites for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release events, including Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sparks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These data suggest that the caveolar microdomain may play a role in modulating myometrial excitability.</p><p>Myometrial smooth muscle contains an abundance of caveolae, which have been proposed to expose or shield the associated proteins to/from the extracellular milieu by opening and closing, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The vast number of caveolae in the myometrium is likely a reflection of the rich signaling environment. Indeed, several studies have shown that caveolae serve as docking sites for many cell-signaling molecules involved in muscle contraction, i.e. PKC&#x003b1; and rhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, hormones regulate the number of caveolae, with estrogen decreasing caveolin levels and thereby the number of caveolae, and progesterone having the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Based on these findings, we believe that maxi-K channels that are present in caveolae and interact with caveolin would likewise be responsive to the negative effects of estrogen, and that the decrease in channel current expression could account for the more depolarized myometrial membrane and enhanced contractility during labor. However the nature and role of the interaction between caveolar proteins and the maxi-K channel in the myometrium had not been identified prior to this study.</p><p>The maxi-K channel contains a consensus caveolin-binding motif (<sup>1007</sup>YNMLCFGIY<sup>1015</sup>) in its C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and mutation of phenylalanine within the caveolin-binding motif had previously been shown to disrupt the association between the ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu3 and cav-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Here we show that although mutation of the aromatic amino acids that constitute a part of this motif leads to diminished current regardless of the number and placement of substitutions, only the triple-mutant Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A loses its ability to associate with cav-1. A recent study investigating similar maxi-K channel mutants in HEK 293 cells found that single, double and triple substitutions of these aromatic amino acids fail to disrupt the interaction between the maxi-K channel and cav-1, but that complete deletion of the consensus site abolishes almost all (80-85%) interaction with cav-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This is inconsistent with our demonstration that mutant Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A was not present in caveolin-containing fractions, and that it neither immunoprecipitates with cav-1 or co-localizes with it at the plasma membrane. Although we cannot fully explain the differences between the results from the two studies, one possible source of this discrepancy is the fact that the HEK293-cell study relied on the use of heterologous over-expression of both the maxi-K channel proteins and cav-1 (in caveolin-negative HEK293 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, the Ltk- mouse fibroblasts used in our study expressed endogenous cav-1, thus providing a more physiological environment for the study of caveolin-maxi-K interactions. We stress that, in spite of the differences between the two studies, they do agree on the localization and amino acid sequence of the consensus site that mediates binding of the maxi-K channel to caveolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Inhibiting the cav-1 gene in hMSMCs demonstrated the significance of the maxi-K-caveolin interactions for the excitability of myometrial cells. The decrease in hMSMC current density observed in these experiments complements the findings of Shmygol et al., who observed that disrupting lipid rafts by depleting cells of cholesterol also decreased the maxi-K current in freshly dispersed myometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The expression of caveolin isoforms and their association with maxi-K channels change during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is thus possible that changes in the association of the maxi-K channel with various caveolin isoforms plays a role in determining which other cell signaling molecules the maxi-K channel is in proximity to during different stages of pregnancy.</p><p>Interestingly, all three of the mutants used in this study reproduced the inhibitory effects of cav-1 deficiency on maxi-K channel current in hMSMCs, although only in the case of mutant Y1007A, F1012A, Y1015A was the maxi-K-caveolin complex disrupted. These data suggest that the cav-1 regulates the maxi-K channel at a minimum of two independent steps: 1) complex formation and 2) current modulation. Formation of the maxi-K-caveolin complex may involve redundant pathways, thus making it difficult to completely disrupt this complex. In fact, Alioua et al. have identified a second putative caveolin-binding site in the maxi-K channel protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that extensive changes in amino acid sequence within the caveolin-binding site are required to dissociate the channel and cav-1. Given that the physical formation of the maxi-K-caveolin complex may be insufficient to regulate all maxi-K channel activity, a second mechanism involving only the <sup>1007</sup>YNMLCFGIY<sup>1015 </sup>motif may contribute to the ability of cav-1 to activate the maxi-K-generated current. Single amino-acid substitutions may disturb this mechanism so that cav-1 cannot maintain the maxi-K current at physiological levels. The caveolin-binding motif is located within a single exon of the KCNMA1 gene, which encodes the maxi-K channel. This raises the possibility that the heavily alternatively-spliced KCNMA1 transcript could produce a channel lacking this caveolin-binding motif--which this study and another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have shown to lead to a decrease in the current expressed by the channel. However, experiments seeking to identify a protein that encodes a channel without a caveolin-binding motif were inconclusive (data not shown). While it is possible that lacking this entire domain is necessary to produce physiologically relevant changes in current expression, even point mutations might be sufficient to do so. More experiments in this area are needed to convincingly resolve this issue.</p><p>The C-terminus of the maxi-K channel harbors not only the caveolin-binding motif, but also an actin-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and is capable of interacting with the actin-binding protein filamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our own work has shown that the maxi-K channel associates with actin, and has suggested that an actin-channel-caveolin complex could potentially be involved in the regulation of myometrial smooth muscle K<sup>+ </sup>current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further elucidation of how all of these regulatory mechanisms interact is expected to shed significant light on the regulation of myometrial contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showing that inhibiting the cav-1 gene in hMSMCs leads to decreased maxi-K channel current demonstrate the significance of the maxi-K-caveolin interactions for the excitability of myometrial cells. These interactions appear to be regulated, in part, by the aromatic amino acids located within the caveolin-binding motif of the maxi-K channel. Because the maxi-K channel is important for regulating myometrial cell excitability and uterine contraction, the modulation of this channel by dynamic interactions with caveolin could, in part, explain novel mechanisms underlying aberrant uterine activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AMB and VPK carried out all experimental work.
