The htrM gene was identified because its insertional inactivation by the Tn5 transposon results in E. coli's inability to form colonies at temperatures above 43 degrees C. The corresponding htrM+ gene was cloned on the basis of its ability to correct the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the htrM::Tn5 insertion mutations. The htrM gene has been mapped to 81.2 min on the conventional E. coli genetic map. It was sequenced and shown to code for an acidic, 34,893-Da polypeptide. Three transcriptional starts were located 48, 90 and 123 nucleotides upstream of the ATG, initiation codon referred to as the P1, P2 and P3(hs) promoters, respectively. The -10 and -35 regions of the P1 promoter bear a close similarity to the E sigma 70-recognized consensus sequences, while the -12 region of the P2 promoter resembles the consensus promoter sequence transcribed by the rpoN gene product. Transcripts of the htrM gene accumulate with increasing temperature. The -10 and -35 regions of the P3(hs) promoter, represented by nucleotides 160 to 130 upstream of the ATG initation codon, are similar to the E sigma 32-recognized consensus sequences. The sigma 32 transcription factor is essential for maximal htrM gene transcription, since htrM RNA transcripts are made at reduced rates in a rpoH null mutant background. Surprisingly, the htrM gene turns out to be identical to rfaD, whose product is required for the biosynthesis of the ADP-L-glycero-D manoheptose lipopolyaccharide precursor [Pegues et al. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172, 4652-4660].</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0033-a" xlink:role="3814"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0033-b" xlink:role="3814"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0035-a" xlink:role="3816"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0035-b" xlink:role="3816"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0036-a" xlink:role="3817"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0036-b" xlink:role="3817"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3811"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3812"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3813"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3814"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3819"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
