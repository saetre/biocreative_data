It is widely used for studies on cell signaling, movement and multicellular development.

The LisH domain, which is associated with microtubule binding, is seen particularly frequently; other domains that confer interactions with the cytoskeleton are also common.

Their activity is controlled by which guanine nucleotide is bound. When it is GDP, the Ras proteins are inactive and do not bind to their targets. Guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs) catalyze the replacement of GDP with GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This makes the Ras proteins active, and able to bind multiple activators and signal transducers. RasGEFs are therefore the initiators of Ras signaling, and understanding their behavior is the key to understanding Ras signaling.</p><sec><title>Multiple roles of Ras pathways</title><p>The <italic>RAS </italic>gene was originally described as the cellular counterpart of a viral oncogene, v-<italic>ras </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The virally encoded protein, which is constitutively GTP-bound even in the absence of RasGEFs and is therefore constantly active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], causes unchecked mitogenesis and proliferation in appropriate cell lines. Normal mammalian cells encode three different Ras families, Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras and N-Ras, all members of which are highly similar to one another. Examination of tumors from numerous patients has since confirmed that endogenous Ras has a key role in growth control - as many as 90% of pancreatic carcinomas contain a mutated <italic>Ras </italic>gene similar to v-<italic>ras</italic>.</p><p>The connection between Ras and growth has now been found to be far more complex. In primary cultures, expression of activated Ras causes apoptosis, not unrestricted growth, and activation of Ras has been shown to cause a range of effects including increased cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and alterations in cell identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These changes are mediated by a range of downstream effectors, most important of which are the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the protein kinase Raf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>RasGEFs were first identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, in which loss of the <italic>CDC25 </italic>gene was found to arrest growth by blocking Ras activation of adenylyl cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This was followed by the identification of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Son of sevenless (Sos) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and mammalian hSos1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], each of which contains a catalytic domain related to that in CDC25. Hundreds of RasGEFs are now known. All share a considerable stretch of homology, including at least two discrete domains - an amino-terminal domain of unclear function (although crystallographic evidence suggests a structural role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) and a carboxy-terminal one that mediates GTP-GDP exchange.</p></sec><sec><title>RasGEFs and signaling</title><p>In general, RasGEFs are now seen as signaling adaptors and integrators; they couple various signaling processes at the cell membrane to Ras and thus to changes inside the cell. The best understood signals to Ras derive from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). When RTKs are stimulated by their ligands, they recruit adaptors such as Grb2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which bind directly to RasGEFs. This recruitment localizes the RasGEFs to the membrane and thus brings them into proximity with Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other RasGEFs are activated by different signals, for example Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but the underlying mechanism is thought to be similar. The domains that surround the RasGEF catalytic regions are therefore critical, as they mediate membrane localization and activation.</p><p>Several major families of RasGEFs can be found in the literature, classified by their domain structure. The most widely known is typified by the product of the <italic>Drosophila Sos </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Members contain one or two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, implying upstream regulation by membrane phospholipids. They also contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is also found in GEFs for the small GTPases Rho and Rac, although these domains' association with Rac signaling is far less clear than their proven roles as Ras regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The EPAC family of GEFs contains cyclic nucleotide monophosphate binding domain (cNMP) motifs that bind cAMP and activate the GTPase Rap when cAMP is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, the Ras-GRF family of RasGEFs contain EF hands and activate Ras in response to calcium and diacylglycerol signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A significant number of known RasGEF relatives have no obvious signaling domains. The best known of these is C3G, which is thought to activate the Ras-like GTPase Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Ras pathways in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title><p>The social ameba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>uses Ras pathways to control multiple signaling processes including cell movement, polarity and cytokinesis, chemotaxis, macropinocytosis and multicellular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is notable for the relatively large number of Ras subfamily members (there are 15 encoded in the genome, including 11 that most closely resemble Ras, three Rap and one Rheb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). All of the six so far studied appear to have nonredundant and important roles in cell physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (although six of the remaining <italic>ras </italic>genes are exceptionally similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). This is the more surprising as <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>does not encode RTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As described previously, RTKs are thought to be one of the major inputs for Ras signaling in mammalian cells. In the absence of RTKs, the best prospects for finding upstream regulators would appear to be through identification of adaptor proteins and binding partners. Such proteins are presumably responsible for recruiting RasGEFs to the membrane and thus controlling their activity. However, two of the four <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs characterized thus far (<italic>aimless </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and <italic>rasgefB </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) offer few clues to their regulation. Unlike nearly all other RasGEFs described in the literature, which contain a panoply of protein-interaction and regulatory domains including SH3, PH, IQ, and PDZ domains, neither Aimless nor RasGEFB contains recognizable signaling domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Two other RasGEF family members, GbpC and GbpD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], on the other hand, contain multiple domains, including cGMP-binding domains, and in GbpC, a kinase domain, leucine-rich repeats, and a DEP domain. None of these domains have been shown to regulate GEF activity in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, although in the mammalian EPAC family a cAMP-binding cNMP domain is thought to regulate GEF activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It therefore seems plausible that cGMP regulates the activity of at least GbpC. The limited number of signaling domains in the other RasGEFs has been a serious obstacle to understanding Ras family signaling in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>; to date, no binding proteins or signaling partners have been discovered.</p><p>In this paper we describe an unexpectedly large number - at least 25 - of predicted RasGEFs in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome. Several of these contain different known signaling domains and others contain none. This suggests an unprecedentedly complex and poorly understood network of Ras signaling in an organism whose signaling otherwise appears relatively simple.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of RasGEF genes</title><p>The assembly of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome is now complete, representing more than 99% of the genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This allowed us to estimate the total number of RasGEF sequences. We searched the assembled sequence using FASTA and TBLASTN programs and the RasGEF catalytic sequence (also known as the RasGEF domain) as bait. Approximately 30 sequences gave significant scores with these programs.</p><p>An additional domain, known as RasGEF_N (hereafter called RasGEF amino-terminal for clarity), is found in nearly all 'true' RasGEFs (proteins that clearly activate Ras <italic>in vivo</italic>) as well as in GEFs for a number of related proteins such as Rap1. After excluding sequences that did not contain complete copies of both RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domains, we were left with 25 sequences encoding <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs. There were no obvious pseudogenes - all 25 sequences contain a clear open reading frame (ORF) and both domains were complete and uninterrupted.</p><p>Four of the RasGEF genes we found have been described previously. The <italic>aimless </italic>and <italic>rasgefB </italic>genes have roles in chemotaxis and endocytosis, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], while the <italic>gbpC </italic>and <italic>gbpD </italic>genes encode cGMP-binding proteins which are thought to couple intracellular cGMP to other signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For the sake of consistency, we have renamed these genes <italic>gefA</italic>, <italic>gefB</italic>, <italic>gefT </italic>and <italic>gefU</italic>.</p><p>Four further genes encode the carboxy-terminal RasGEF homology domain but not the RasGEF amino-terminal domain, and might therefore be expected to be specific for Ras-related proteins which are not part of the Ras family proper. We have named these <italic>gflA</italic>, <italic>gflB</italic>, <italic>gflC </italic>and <italic>gflD </italic>(full details can be found in Dictybase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). It is not yet clear whether these are likely to be RasGEFs with a subset of normal functions or GEFs for more distant relatives of Ras.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence and domain analysis</title><p>As described earlier, the presence of signaling domains separate from the RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domain has been a central part of the identification of Ras signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, half of the 25 genes we have identified contain no such clues. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the domain structure of the predicted products from the 25 complete RasGEFs. Eight, including RasGEFB, contain no domains detected by SMART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or PFAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], other than the two RasGEF domains. A further five contain no additional domains other than the enigmatic LisH domain, whose function is thought to relate to motility and microtubule function but is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and one contains only two F-boxes, motifs connected with ubiquitination and protein breakdown rather than with upstream signaling.</p><p>We were surprised to find that none of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs resembled members of known families with signaling motifs. Only one of the 25 predicted proteins, GefC, includes a DH/Rho-GEF domain like <italic>Sos </italic>family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, unlike the <italic>Sos </italic>family, GefC does not contain a PH domain. Instead, its amino-terminal region contains three domains that resemble RCC1, a GEF for the small GTPase Ran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Ran is involved in the control of nuclear transport and mitosis, and is unusual in that it does not contain lipid adducts and is therefore not located at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. There is no clear precedent for a connection between Ras and RCC1 signaling.</p><p>The two previously described cGMP-binding proteins RasGEFT and RasGEFU (also known as cGMP-binding proteins C and D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) have cNMP domains, like the mammalian EPAC family. RasGEFU is somewhat similar to EPAC family members, but the three cNMP domains lie beyond the RasGEF amino-terminal and RasGEF domains, unlike the usual upstream location, and the G-protein-associated DEP domain is replaced by a GRAM membrane-localization domain. These large-scale changes make it seem unlikely that EPACs and <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cGMP-binding RasGEFs are evolutionary orthologs. It seems more likely that convergent evolution has selected independent cyclic nucleotide-regulated GEFs. This is supported by phylogenetic analysis (see below), which failed to group RasGEFT and RasGEFU with human EPAC.</p><p>The third principal family of mammalian RasGEFs is the calcium-regulated Ras-GRFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These do not appear to be present in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>at all. Neither the EF hands present in Ras-GRFs nor any other clear calcium-binding motifs are found in any of the 25 RasGEFs examined here.</p><p>The only protein described in the literature that resembles the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEF homologs is the C3G RapGEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but as this similarity is based on an absence of other defined signaling domains rather than any positive homology, it seems uninformative. In particular, the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>gene products lack SH3-binding polyproline domains at their amino termini, which suggests that they have no strong evolutionary relationship with C3G. Again, phylogenetic analysis supports this view (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Actin- and Rho-binding RasGEFs</title><p>Three members of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEF family have domains that suggest a direct link with the actin cytoskeleton. Two contain domains that are associated with direct binding to F-actin. RasGEFF contains three tandem kelch repeats, while RasGEFP contains a calponin homology (CH) domain. A third, RasGEFD, contains a RhoGAP homology domain. While most authors have associated this with inactivation of Rac- and Rho-family members, there is some evidence that some RhoGAP homology domains are found in downstream effectors. We were intrigued to note that <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>BEM2, a RhoGAP homolog that is required for cell polarity and normal actin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], also appears to contain RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domains that have not been described in the literature. This suggests that RasGEFD might perform a similar role in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>to BEM2 in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, although no obvious phenotype was seen in growing <italic>gefD </italic>knockouts (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>We constructed phylogenetic trees using the conserved RasGEF domains of all the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>proteins, both with and without a selection of mammalian RasGEFs for comparison (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). To our surprise, few groupings were strongly supported during bootstrapping. In general, it is clear that RasGEFF, RasGEFO and RasGEFH are the least similar to other RasGEFs in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>and elsewhere. RasGEFI and RasGEFJ are highly similar, suggesting they they arose from a relatively recent gene duplication. Two other pairings, RasGEFs B and V and RasGEFs R and S, were also supported in more than 50% of bootstraps. Other, larger groups that might subdivide the RasGEFs according to function were conspicuously poorly supported, suggesting that the diversification of RasGEF genes happened relatively early in the divergence of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. There is also no evidence that the division of mammalian RasGEFs into SOS, RasGRP, EPAC, C3G and RalGDS families had occurred when <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>diverged from the animal line.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression during growth and development</title><p>To determine whether the large number of <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs was connected with growth (the first role found for Ras pathways), or signaling during development, we determined the expression patterns of all of the 25 genes during growth and development. Initially we screened Northern blots; if a clear result was not obtained we used RT-PCR. We used probes generated from those clones represented in the Tsukuba cDNA project, and used PCR to make the remainder. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the results. All RasGEF genes are expressed at some stage in development; of the genes tested, <italic>gefG</italic>, of which transcripts could only be detected at 12 and 14 hours of development, was the most weakly expressed. This clearly implies that the large RasGEF family is not made up of pseudogenes or evolutionary relics, which are frequently not expressed.</p><p>In general, three patterns of expression were seen. The largest group of genes, which includes <italic>gefA</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>J </italic>and <italic>L</italic>, is expressed in growing cells and with relatively slight changes throughout development. A second group, comprising <italic>gefB </italic>and <italic>K</italic>, is expressed at low levels during growth with a sharp increase early in development, while the third, typified by <italic>gefC </italic>and <italic>E</italic>, is only expressed after about 12 h of development. These results are consistent with varied roles for RasGEFs in multiple aspects of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>life cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of a sample of RasGEF genes</title><p>There are two obvious ways to explain the unexpectedly large number of RasGEF genes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. The first would be that these genes are mainly redundant, and that each biological function of a RasGEF is mediated by several <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genes. The other possibility is that <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>has greatly broadened the scope of Ras signaling at some stage in its evolution, and that most GEFs are required for a distinct signaling process. To distinguish between these possibilities, we disrupted a sample of RasGEF genes and searched for phenotypes. <italic>gefA </italic>(<italic>aimless</italic>) had already been disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and <italic>gefB </italic>was disrupted during the initial part of this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; each mutant has a clear phenotype. We further attempted to disrupt GEFs C, D, E, F, G, K and L. We were successful in all cases except <italic>gefF</italic>, which could not be disrupted even after several attempts. This suggests that <italic>gefF </italic>might have an important role during growth, but confirmation will require disruption in diploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypes of mutants</title><p>All of the mutants we obtained grow normally, with the exception of <italic>gefB </italic>mutants, which grow relatively normally on bacterial plates but are unable to grow in axenic culture due to a loss of fluid-phase endocytosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The morphology of growing cells is apparently normal for each strain apart from <italic>gefB </italic>mutants, which appear flattened and polar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) in a manner reminiscent of growing nonaxenic cells. Similarly, the chemotactic aggregation and development of all mutants examined here except <italic>gefB </italic>were apparently normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), forming morphologically normal slugs and fruiting bodies with the usual timing. As previously described, <italic>gefB </italic>mutants aggregate but form no slugs and make highly aberrant fruiting bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Three RasGEF mutants described elsewhere show abnormal chemotaxis - <italic>gefA</italic>/<italic>aimless </italic>and <italic>gefT </italic>are both seriously defective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], though <italic>gefA </italic>can be coaxed to make rather aberrantly shaped slugs, while <italic>gefU </italic>cells are hyperpolar and better at chemotaxis than wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Slug movement phenotypes</title><p>While testing the late development of mutants, we observed an apparent lack of slug phototaxis in <italic>gefE </italic>mutants, despite morphologically normal slugs and fruiting bodies. We therefore assessed slug phototaxis in each of the mutants apart from <italic>gefB</italic>, which does not form slugs. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref> shows the trails from a sample of slugs migrating towards a lateral light source. Mutants in <italic>gefC</italic>, <italic>gefD</italic>, <italic>gefG </italic>and <italic>gefK </italic>(not shown) exhibit normal phototaxis, but <italic>gefE </italic>and <italic>gefL </italic>mutants are plainly aberrant. The problems with the two strains appear to be different. <italic>gefE </italic>slugs migrate similar distances to the wild type, but far less accurately towards the light source, whereas <italic>gefL </italic>slugs are both less accurate and migrate shorter distances, a phenotype that is frequently observed in phototaxis mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>A more detailed analysis of slug photo- and thermotaxis is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>. Both <italic>gefE </italic>and <italic>gefL </italic>mutant slugs are clearly poor in phototaxis assays at all cell densities, with <italic>gefE </italic>mutants the worst affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, inset) - <italic>gefE </italic>mutant slugs are at least 20 times less phototactically accurate than wild type, though some orientation is clearly visible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) and measurable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, inset). This behavior is strikingly reminiscent of the phenotype of <italic>ras</italic>D mutants, which also move normally but with greatly reduced accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Taken together with the expression pattern of <italic>gefE</italic>, which closely resembles that of <italic>rasD</italic>, this suggests that RasGEFE is the GEF that causes the most RasD activation during phototaxis.</p><p>Unusually for slug phototaxis mutants, the <italic>gefE </italic>and <italic>gefL </italic>mutant slugs are also affected in thermotaxis, although the severity of the phenotypes is reversed. Slugs from both mutant strains show diminished but measurable thermotaxis, but <italic>gefL </italic>mutant slugs seem particularly insensitive to temperature gradients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We initiated this work to assess whether the large number of RasGEFs in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>were functionally redundant, or whether each had a discrete function. Functional redundancy would be caused by groups of RasGEFs having shared or poorly differentiated functions. In particular, one model for RasGEF action suggests that Ras signaling works as a complex network in which specific signals can be transduced by multiple RasGEFs, each of which can activate multiple different Ras proteins. If this model were correct, deletion of any one RasGEF (or indeed Ras) would cause very slight effects, with double and multiple mutants causing progressively more significant deficiencies in a range of different Ras pathways.</p><p>The work described in this paper, in agreement with previous work from our labs (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], suggests that RasGEFs have relatively precisely defined roles. Of the RasGEF genes that have now been disrupted, six out of ten had clear phenotypes. We presume that a more complete study of the minute details of the life cycle would also reveal phenotypes in some of the remaining four. This would not be predicted if genetic redundancy was the rule. These results are somewhat distorted, because the RasGEFs were in general named in the order in which they were isolated. The majority of the genes we disrupted were identified relatively early in the lifetime of the cDNA project in Tsukuba, Japan, and therefore tend to be expressed at reasonably high levels. Later genes were identified by screening sequences provided by the genome project and are therefore likely to be either expressed at lower levels or under non-standard conditions, for example, environmental responses that are not seen under laboratory conditions. Even with this caution in mind, though, the clear phenotypes suggest that <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>uses relatively simple Ras pathways.</p><p>This is further supported by the similarities between specific Ras and GEF mutants. As previously described, Mutants in <italic>gefB </italic>and <italic>rasS </italic>behave similarly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Likewise, in this work we show that <italic>gefE </italic>resembles <italic>rasD </italic>in both mutant phenotype and expression pattern. The <italic>aimless</italic>/<italic>gefA </italic>phenotype is also very similar to that of <italic>rasC </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], although one paper suggests a connection between <italic>rasG</italic>, <italic>gefA </italic>and the effector protein RIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Again, this suggests that <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>Ras pathways are relatively linear, with each GEF in general acting on a single Ras protein, rather than the networks that some might have expected.</p><p>This, of course, raises the question of what role is played by the other GEFs we describe. The <italic>rasB </italic>gene has not yet been disrupted, despite multiple attempts. It is thus not currently possible to discern its biological role. No RasGEF genes have been found to cause phenotypes that resemble those of <italic>rasG </italic>mutants. Finally, at least two other Ras-family proteins (RasX and Rap1) are likely to be activated by RasGEF family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In mammalian cells, the catalytic domains of RapGEFs are indistinguishable from RasGEFs, and frequently contain no obvious signaling domains much like several of the GEF genes described in this paper. We have connected three of the RasGEFs with specific Ras proteins, leaving 22 RasGEFs to couple to the smaller number of remaining Ras family members. This inequality implies that each Ras protein is likely to be activated by multiple RasGEFs, perhaps explaining the slight phenotypes seen in the unpaired RasGEF mutants.</p><p>We have not studied the <italic>gflA</italic>, <italic>gflB</italic>, <italic>gflC </italic>and <italic>gflD </italic>genes, which encode carboxy-terminal RasGEF homology domains without RasGEF amino-terminal domains, and might therefore be expected to be specific for Ras-related proteins that are not part of the Ras family proper. It is not entirely clear what this might mean for <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Two Ras proteins (RasG and RasD) are most similar to the canonical mammalian Ras families, and others (RasB, RasC, the as-yet unpublished RasX, and RasS) are less closely related to mammalian Ras while still plainly being part of the Ras family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We suspect from the phenotypes of the <italic>gefB </italic>mutants that RasGEFB acts directly upon RasS. This would imply that the <italic>gfl </italic>genes act on more distant relatives of canonical Ras than RasS, which would be characterized as unusual small GTPases (for example the RasX family or RsmA-K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) rather than members of the Ras family proper.</p><p>Above all, the complexity in Ras pathways in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>is unexpected for a relatively simple organism with no receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It might be that the limited range of receptors was a driving force for diversification of Ras signaling during evolution, or it might be that a large number of RasGEFs are highly specialized for specific subsets of some complex role (detecting and integrating starvation signals and quorum factors, for example). A complete understanding will require further analysis of RasGEF genes, but above all a better knowledge of the range of signals that <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells use in their normal biological context.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The clear suggestion from our work is that the unexpectedly large number of <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs derive from an unusually diverse range of inputs to Ras pathways, rather than large-scale redundancy or multiple pseudogenes following gene duplications. Identifying the input signals, and the mechanisms by which they connect to RasGEF activation, will be a major future challenge for <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Identification of genes encoding RasGEFs</title><p>Known and previously identified rasGEF genes were used to perform TBLASTN searches against the whole dataset generated by the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>Sequencing Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].
