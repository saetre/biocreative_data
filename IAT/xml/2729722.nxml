Meningococcal pathogenesis relies on the ability of the bacteria to break host epithelial or endothelial cellular barriers. Highly restrictive, yet poorly understood, mechanisms allow meningococcal adhesion to cells of only human origin. Adhesion of encapsulated and virulent meningococci to human cells relies on the expression of bacterial type four pili (T4P) that trigger intense host cell signalling. Among the components of the meningococcal T4P, the concomitantly expressed PilC1 and PilC2 proteins regulate pili exposure at the bacterial surface, and until now, PilC1 was believed to be specifically responsible for T4P-mediated meningococcal adhesion to human cells. Contrary to previous reports, we show that, like PilC1, the meningococcal PilC2 component is capable of mediating adhesion to human ME180 epithelial cells, with cortical plaque formation and F-actin condensation. However, PilC1 and PilC2 promote different effects on infected cells. Cellular tracking analysis revealed that PilC1-expressing meningococci caused a severe reduction in the motility of infected cells, which was not the case when cells were infected with PilC2-expressing strains. The amount of both total and phosphorylated forms of EGFR was dramatically reduced in cells upon PilC1-mediated infection. In contrast, PilC2-mediated infection did not notably affect the EGFR pathway, and these specificities were shared among unrelated meningococcal strains. These results suggest that meningococci have evolved a highly discriminative tool for differential adhesion in specific microenvironments where different cell types are present. Moreover, the fine-tuning of cellular control through the combined action of two concomitantly expressed, but distinctly regulated, T4P-associated variants of the same molecule (i.e. PilC1 and PilC2) brings a new model to light for the analysis of the interplay between pathogenic bacteria and human host cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nme) is a strictly human pathogen that has two facets, a benign and a devastating one.

Nme is primarily an extracellular pathogen with a striking feature of microcolony formation on the surface of the infected cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Pujol1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-BrockNeil1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Among neisserial virulence factors, type IV pili (T4P) appear to be the only bacterial attribute that allows efficient adhesion of capsulated bacteria to host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Nassif2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. T4P are robust thin filaments of up to 40 micrometers long that undergo dynamic cycles of assembly, exposure at the bacterial surface and retraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Morand1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Pilus-mediated adhesion and filament retraction participate in a signalling system in which Nme is capable of modulating the host cell signalling machinery through T4P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Opitz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. T4P-mediated adhesion induces cytoskeleton re-arrangements as well as modification of global intracellular signalling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Lambotin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Signalling is associated with the formation of &#x0201c;cortical plaques&#x0201d;, with dense actin polymerisation underneath bacterial clusters and accumulation of membrane-associated proteins such as ICAM-1, CD44 and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Merz1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In human brain endothelial cells, T4P-mediated meningococcal adhesion leads to the formation of ectopic intercellular junctional domains at the site of bacteria host-cell interaction. This recruitment leads to the depletion of junctional proteins at the cell-cell interface and to the opening of the intercellular junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Coureuil1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Nme evokes early intracellular calcium signalling during the course of infection, paralleled by MAPK pathway activation and interleukin release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Kallstrom1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Cellular response to T4P-mediated infection varies among cell types. Membrane shedding in ME180 cells following gonococcal infection was shown to release CD46-enriched vesicles in the medium in a PilT-dependent manner, but such a phenomenon could not be observed with Hep-2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Gill1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Besides adhesion, Nme can also enter host cells. For endothelial cells, internalisation relies on the activation of ErbB2, cortactin phosphorylation and activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signalling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Lambotin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. ErbB2 is a member of the EGFR family, which belongs to receptor tyrosine kinases. However, it is still unclear if similar signalling also exists in other cell types and little is known about the cellular motile response upon bacterial interaction during meningococcal infection.</p><p>Members of the EGFR family are membrane receptors involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation and motility.

In order to verify if the PilC2 variant could indeed mediate the adhesion of meningococci to ME180 cells, we employed isogenic derivatives of the Nm2C4.3 strain solely expressing either PilC1 or PilC2 in similar amounts under the control of the endogenous promoter of <italic>pilC1</italic>, named Nm604a (PilC1<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC2-) and Nm910f (PilC2<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC1-) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Morand2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. With this setting, the respective roles of each protein could be investigated independently from regulation specificities and this strategy also excluded the possibility of different amounts of PilC being a prime attribute for any observed cellular response.

Using live-cell microscopy, we monitored adhesion of these inducible strains to ME180 cells over time, starting in the absence of induction and followed by the addition of IPTG after 2 hours of bacteria-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006834.s003">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006834.s004">Video S2</xref>). In the absence of induction, the lack of expression of either PilC1 or PilC2 was associated with poor bacterial clumping (linked to defective piliation), and a lack of bacterial adhesion to cells despite the presence of a large bacterial load. In contrast, the expression of PilC1 or PilC2 within minutes of IPTG addition resulted in increased bacterial piliation and bacterial adhesion to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g003">Figure 3</xref>, 20 min post IPTG).

Thus, the ability of both PilC1 and PilC2 meningococcal variants to mediate adhesion and a specific host cell response is observed for unrelated meningococcal strains.</p><p>As already mentioned, IPTG-induced PilC1-expressing meningococci adhered to virtually all cells present, while only a subset of cells in a ME180 monolayer was permissive to PilC2-mediated adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To investigate if different ME180 clonal cell populations could be responsible for the heterogeneity of PilC2-mediated adhesion, we analysed an array of clonal cell subsets, each clone being generated from a single ME180 cell. Using Nm604a (PilC1<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC2-) and Nm910f (PilC2<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC1-) strains that constitutively express either PilC1 or PilC2, the proportion of cells permissive to PilC1- or PilC2-mediated infection among clones of ME180 cells was similar to that of the parental population of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006834.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, differences in cellular susceptibility to PilC2-mediated infection are not restricted to clonal populations among ME180 cells, but more likely due to a particular, yet undefined, metabolic state of the cell in which a cellular receptor(s) for PilC2 is expressed.</p><p>These results show that both meningococcal PilC1 and PilC2 variants mediate specific host cell responses upon adhesion.

Non-infected cells (no infection) were used as control. Cellular extracts were probed in western blot analysis for the presence of all forms of EGFR (EGFR), for a phosphorylated form of the receptor (EGFR-P992), or for ATP-synthase as a marker for the protein load of cellular extracts. Cells were collected just prior to addition of EGF (left panel), or 5 min after EGF stimulation (right panel). Exposure time of western blot was extended until signal was detectable in all lanes. Panel B: cells infected for 2 hours with either Nm604a (PilC1<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC2-) or Nm910f (PilC2<sub>pC1</sub>&#x0002b;/PilC1-) were monitored using time-lapse microscopy for 30 min immediately before and after EGF stimulation (25 ng/ml).

The same experimental protocol was used but cells were additionally stimulated with EGF for 5 min at the end of the 2-hour infection, prior to collection of cellular material and western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g005">Figure 5A, right panel</xref>-). Similarly to non-infected cells, PilC2-mediated infection left ME180 cells permissive for EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. In contrast, EGF stimulation of cells infected with a PilC1&#x0002b; strain resulted in a weak phosphorylation of EGFR. Because the total protein level of EGFR prior to EGF stimulation was low in cells infected through PilC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g005">Figure 5A, left panel</xref>-), the strong reduction in EGFR phosphorylation was probably due to the depletion of the total EGFR pool upon PilC1-mediated infection. RT-PCR analysis detected no notable change in EGFR mRNA expression during the course of the experiment, suggesting that EGFR degradation and recycling pathways are differently involved upon PilC1- or PilC2-mediated adhesion. Similar results were observed for the phosphorylated forms of ErbB2 (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g005">Figure 5-A</xref> also shows that PilC1-mediated adhesion of meningococci to other cell types such as HBMEC or HEC-1-B did not result in the depletion of the EGFR cellular pool and supports previous reports on EGFR clustering under meningococcal microcolonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Merz1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We further analysed the response of ME180 cells to EGF during infection with meningococci expressing constitutively PilC1 (Nm604a) or PilC2 (Nm910f), by monitoring cell motility for 30 minutes just prior to, or just following, addition of EGF to the cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006834-g005">Figure 5-B</xref> shows that non-infected ME180 cells respond to EGF stimulation by increasing motility. Consistent with western blot analysis of EGFR phosphorylation, we found that PilC1-infected cells were poorly responsive to EGF activation. In the case of PilC2-mediated infection, EGFR phosphorylation response to EGF stimulation was slightly lower in comparison to non-infected control cells. We therefore investigated if this difference could be due to fractional susceptibility of ME180 cells by separately analysing ME180 cells susceptible or refractory to PilC2-mediated adhesion. We observed that PilC2-mediated infection did not alter the motility response to EGF, neither for cells associated with bacteria nor for cells devoid of attached meningococci. Thus, our results suggest that PilC1 is specifically responsible for the depletion of the EGFR pool in ME180 cells upon infection.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that both meningococcal PilC1 and PilC2 variants mediate specific adhesion to ME180 cells, but trigger different cellular responses for cellular motility and signalling affecting EGFR pathways. The difference in host cell response is associated with the expression of closely related pilus-associated components that are independently regulated in wild type strains, thus presenting a new and intriguing model for studying the modulation of the eukaryotic response to infection by T4P-expressing pathogens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated how meningococcal infection differentially modulates host cell motility and EGFR signalling pathways through two independently regulated variants of T4P components. Infection of human cells by pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> is a complex process that involves bacterial attachment to the eukaryotic cell and intracellular signalling. In the case of Nme, T4P play a central role since they are the only attributes allowing adhesion of capsulated bacteria to cells and are present in most, if not all, clinical bacterial isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Nassif2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These events are associated with the formation of &#x0201c;cortical plaques&#x0201d; at the site of bacterial attachment, where numerous components of actin microfilaments and signalling molecules are recruited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Merz1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show that both meningococcal variants of the T4P-associated PilC component, PilC1 and PilC2, are capable of mediating adhesion independently. Moreover, these two proteins, which are concomitantly expressed but distinctly regulated in wild type strains of Nme, elicit different structural and signalling responses in the host cell.</p><p>Our observation that the PilC2 variant of the meningococcal FAM20 strain promotes adhesion to ME180 cells differs from previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Rahman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, technical points may account for the differences in phenotype observed here. First, Rahman et al. measured bacterial adhesion by optical evaluation of bacterial counts on 50 cells. In our experiments, optical numeration of cell-associated diplococci appeared poorly reproducible since attaching meningococci form three-dimensional aggregates of various size and shape. Instead, we calculated adhesion ratios comparing the number of CFU recovered from cell-associated bacteria to the total amount of bacteria in the well, at the corresponding time-point. Second, figures in previous report were obtained using non-confluent ME180 cells, whereas adhesion ratios reported here were obtained with cells at higher densities (sub-confluent). Moreover, the fractional susceptibility of ME180 cells to PilC2-mediated adhesion may have artificially lowered the average bacterial count per cell. Third, alteration of phenotype might be due to phase variation in the expression of PilC1 or PilC2 in the FAM20 derivatives, since FAM20.1 and FAM20.2 were obtained by simple cassette-mutagenesis and carry endogenous <italic>pilC</italic> promoters. For this reason, we used Nm2C4.3 derivatives with engineered <italic>pilC</italic> promoters that prevent phase variation and allow identical regulation for both <italic>pilC</italic> variants. Forth, both unrelated Nm2C4.3 and FAM20 strains express strain-specific PilC1 or PilC2 variants with different primary structures. Last, dynamic aspects of meningococcal adhesion might also be involved. The regulation of both <italic>pilC1</italic> and <italic>pilC2</italic> genes was shown to be drastically different in the Nm2C4.3 strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Taha1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> but was not investigated in the FAM20 strain. Taken together, the FAM20.1 and FAM20.2 strains express PilC1 or PilC2 variants with specific primary structures and with uncharacterised promoters. For these reasons, our analysis was focused on the isogenic Nm2C4.3 derivatives, Nm604a and Nm910f, which express either <italic>pilC1</italic> or <italic>pilC2</italic> with identical regulation. The observation that, in live-imaging experiments, unrelated meningococcal strains with endogenous <italic>pilC</italic> promoters (i.e. FAM20.1 and FAM20.2) lead to results similar to those obtained with promoter-engineered strains (i.e. Nm2C4.3 derivatives) strengthens our conclusions on the respective roles of PilC1 and PilC2 in the motility control of infected human cells.</p><p>Among different epithelial (HeLa, HEC-1-B) or endothelial (HUVEC, HBMEC) cell types tested, the endometrium-derived ME180 was the only cell line that was permissive for PilC2-mediated adhesion. The endometrium is unlikely to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Nme, but restriction of Nme PilC2-mediated adhesion to ME-180 cells could indicate a highly specific modulation of meningococcal cellular binding to yet unrecognised cell types of the nasopharynx. Although we did not investigate primary cell types isolated from the nasopharynx for this phenotype, our results show that human cells (i.e. ME180) can express a cellular receptor(s) for PilC2. This suggests that meningococci have evolved a highly discriminative tool for differential adhesion in specific microenvironments where different cell types are present.</p><p>Both meningococcal PilC variants promote cortical actin rearrangements upon adhesion to ME180 cells but we show that only PilC1 induces reductions in EGFR levels and motility, thus suggesting complementary functions for both variants. Based on these results, the meningococcal PilC2 variant should no longer be considered as a defective variant for adhesion, but as a functional variant with specificities for restricted cell types. Therefore, the independent regulation of both PilC variants in wild type bacteria could enable meningococci to sequentially modulate host cell response in a controlled manner, with partially overlapping (i.e. cellular binding) and partially antagonising (i.e. depletion of EGFR pool and motility) effects, depending on the cellular diversity of each ecological niche. The hypothesis of selective PilC-mediated modulation of cellular response is emphasized by the observation that, although being closely related, both gonococcus and meningococcus show highly specific tropism for host tissue. In the genetically related gonococcus, both variants of PilC have been described as mutually replaceable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Scheuerpflug1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Ryll1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> but the differential regulation of both genes was not investigated. Further work is thus needed to decipher (i) if, beside adhesion to host cells, gonococcal PilC1 and PilC2 variants promote qualitatively different host cell responses, and (ii) how the regulation of both <italic>pilC</italic> genes is in control of the cellular response. The future development of experimental models for the ecological niches of Nme and Ngo, involving different cell types as well as the extracellular matrix, will help to shed new light on this central, but poorly investigated, aspect of neisserial interaction with the human host.</p><p>The different responses elicited by meningococcal infection among various cell types can be regarded as a hallmark of neisserial infection.

Only a fraction of ME180 cells are susceptible to PilC2-mediated infection whereas virtually all cells are infected through PilC1. We hypothesised that a particular physiological state of the cell would be responsible for this phenomenon. Although our search for a link with the cell cycle was unconclusive, recent work from other groups has shown that gonococcal infection of epithelial cells, including ME180 cells, is increased for cells in interphase (G1, S or G2) rather than in M or G0 of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006834-Jones1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, we show that, unlike PilC1 that enables meningococcal attachment to many epithelial or endothelial cells, the meningococcal PilC2 protein selectively mediates adhesion to restricted cell types.

Cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator under 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>For adhesion counts, cells were grown in 24-well plastic cell culture dishes to sub-confluency. Monolayers were washed with medium and bacteria were added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, as for other end-point adhesion experiments. Infection was performed in medium without FCS. Infected and non-infected monolayers were centrifuged for 3 min at 120 g to synchronise infection, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5&#x00025; CO2. At the end of incubation time (up to 3 hours depending on experiment), infection was stopped and non-adherent bacteria were removed by washing the cells three times with medium. Cell-associated bacteria were quantified after cell lysis with 1&#x00025; saponin in medium. Colony forming units (CFU) were determined by plating serial dilutions.</p><p>For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips and infected as described for adhesion counts. At the end of infection time, infected cells were rinsed three times with PBS to remove non-adherent bacteria and immediately fixed with 3.7&#x00025; paraformaldehyde (PFA), before immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Live cell-imaging</title><p>Live imaging adhesion assays were performed with ME180 cells grown in 35 mm cell-culture plastic dishes (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA). One day prior to the experiment, cells were seeded at a density of approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (30&#x02013;50&#x00025; confluency). Three hours before infection, culture medium was replaced by warm RPMI medium. Infection was performed with freshly grown bacteria resuspended in RPMI medium with sufficient time given (10&#x02013;30 min) so that piliated bacteria displayed twitching activity. Microscopic detection of twitching activity was deemed an indicator of the establishment of bacteria-cell interaction. Cell monolayers were infected at an MOI of 50 since incubation was carried out for up to 5 hours without washing nor disturbing infection of the monolayer. Time-lapse live imaging was performed with a ZEISS Axiovert 200 microscope, using a 40x objective. Imaging was performed with a time lapse of 30 seconds throughout the experiment, which allowed tracking of individual cells before and throughout infection. Addition of bacteria to the medium interrupted cell monitoring for less than one minute. In order to ensure minimal interference with cellular adhesion and migration processes, ME180 cells were devoid of any plasmid constructs and experiments were all made using the same brand of dishes. For adhesion experiments with strains carrying inducible <italic>pilC</italic> constructs, 1 mM IPTG was added to the bacteria after approximately 2 hours of established bacteria-cell interaction, and maintained until the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed using the ImageJ software and the plug-in &#x0201c;Manual Tracking&#x0201d; from Fabrice Cordeli&#x000e8;res, Institut Curie, Orsay (France).

T4P-associated phenotypes (adhesion to human cells and piliation) were investigated for meningococcal strains upon induction of either PilC1 (strain NmPilC1ind) or PilC2 (strain NmPilC2ind) with IPTG. Control strains are wild-type Nm2C4.3 (WT) and, respectively, non/poorly piliated defective PilE/PilC mutants. A: Adhesion to either ME180 or HeLa cells was measured after 1-hour incubation (MOI 100) in the presence of IPTG concentrations ranging up to 1 mM (representative experiment). Meningococcal adhesion to ME180 cells was dependent on either PilC1 or PilC2 expression. However, as expected, adhesion to HeLa cells was exclusively restricted to PilC1-expressing strains. B: Liquid-grown bacteria were tested for the presence of pili after 1H of induction with IPTG, using a polyclonal anti-pilin antibody. For both NmPilC1ind and NmPilC2ind strains, piliation correlates with IPTG-controlled induction of PilC1 or PilC2.</p><p>(0.45 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006834.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006834.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Clonal permissivity of ME180 cells to PilC1- or PilC2-mediated infection.
