The small molecule Alda-1 was reported to partly restore low acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity of this variant. In the present study we compared the wild type enzyme (ALDH2*1) with the Asian variant (ALDH2*2) regarding GTN bioactivation and the effects of Alda-1. Alda-1 increased acetaldehyde oxidation by ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 approximately 1.5- and 6-fold, respectively, and stimulated the esterase activities of both enzymes to similar extent as the coenzyme NAD. The effect of NAD was biphasic with pronounced inhibition occurring at &#x02265;5 m<sc>m</sc>. In the presence of 1 m<sc>m</sc> NAD, Alda-1 stimulated ALDH2*2-catalyzed ester hydrolysis 73-fold, whereas the NAD-stimulated activity of ALDH2*1 was inhibited because of 20-fold increased inhibitory potency of NAD in the presence of the drug. Although ALDH2*2 exhibited 7-fold lower GTN denitrating activity and GTN affinity than ALDH2*1, the rate of nitric oxide formation was only reduced 2-fold, and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activation was more pronounced than with wild type ALDH2 at saturating GTN. Alda-1 caused slight inhibition of GTN denitration and did not increase GTN-induced sGC activation in the presence of either variant. The present results indicate that Alda-1 stimulates established ALDH2 activities by improving NAD binding but does not improve the GTN binding affinity of the Asian variant. In addition, our data revealed an unexpected discrepancy between GTN reductase activity and sGC activation, suggesting that GTN denitration and bioactivation may reflect independent pathways of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN biotransformation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cyclic GMP (cGMP)</kwd><kwd>Enzyme Catalysis</kwd><kwd>Nitric Oxide</kwd><kwd>Oxidase</kwd><kwd>Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)</kwd><kwd>Superoxide Ion</kwd><kwd>Bioactivation</kwd><kwd>Nitroglycerin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The antianginal drug nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate (GTN))<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> causes vasodilation through NO-mediated activation of vascular sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The mechanism of GTN metabolism resulting in NO formation is still elusive, but mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) has been identified as key enzyme catalyzing GTN bioconversion to 1,2-GDN and inorganic nitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The established function of ALDH2 is the oxidative detoxification of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde and other aliphatic aldehydes. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of various esters. GTN bioconversion has been proposed to be catalyzed through this esterase activity of ALDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Interestingly, organic nitrates must contain at least three nitrate groups to be efficient substrates for ALDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The most compelling evidence for an essential role of ALDH2 in GTN bioactivation was obtained with ALDH2 knock-out mice in which the vascular response to low doses of GTN was completely abolished, whereas the response to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The involvement of ALDH2 in GTN-induced vascular relaxation of rodent and human blood vessels has been confirmed in several subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies (for a recent review see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). At low micromolar GTN concentrations the ALDH2-catalyzed reaction results in highly selective formation of 1,2-GDN, but this selectivity is lost at high substrate concentrations or in the presence of ALDH2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The major nitrogen-containing product of GTN denitration is inorganic nitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), but we found that ALDH2 additionally catalyzes formation of NO, detectable by a Clark-type NO electrode and as activation of purified sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Because inorganic nitrite could be excluded as intermediate, NO formation appears to result from direct enzymatic three-electron reduction of GTN by ALDH2. Detailed comparison of the initial reaction rates suggested that the three-electron reduction pathway normally accounts for &#x0223c;10% of total GTN turnover. However, the fractional contribution of NO formation was increased to up to 50% upon mutation of the general base E268Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), pointing to an independent reaction that is not strictly coupled to (clearance-based) GTN denitration. Although direct formation of NO may explain how ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion is linked to vascular cGMP accumulation, this issue is still unsettled because several laboratories failed to detect NO formation in GTN-exposed blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>A dominant-negative ALDH2 polymorphism resulting in markedly reduced alcohol tolerance has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) that occurs with an incidence of 35&#x02013;57% in different East Asian subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The East Asian variant of the enzyme (ALDH2*2) has a lysine substituted for glutamate at position 487 (E487K), resulting in very low aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) caused by a local structural alteration that is transferred to both the active site and the NAD-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the presence of 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> NAD and 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GTN, the GTN reductase activity of ALDH2*2 was reported to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of wild type ALDH2 (ALDH2*1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This observation is thought to explain the reduced hemodynamic response to GTN of humans carrying the ALDH2*2 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Recently, high throughput screening led to the identification of ALDH2-activating compounds that are protective against cardiac ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The most active compound, <italic>N</italic>-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichlorobenzamide (Alda-1 for <underline>al</underline>dehyde <underline>d</underline>ehydrogenase <underline>a</underline>ctivator-<underline>1</underline>), caused a moderate, &#x0223c;2-fold stimulation of acetaldehyde oxidation by ALDH2*1 but increased the residual aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of ALDH2*2 11-fold. The mode of action of Alda-1 is still unknown.</p><p>In the present study we addressed two major issues. First we intended to compare the established activities of ALDH2*2 with its ability to catalyze GTN denitration and/or bioactivation. The data revealed that the Asian variant catalyzes GTN bioactivation with similar maximal rates as the wild type enzyme, albeit with significantly lower GTN affinity. In light of these surprising results, it was of interest to see whether the bioactivation of pharmacologically relevant low concentrations of GTN could be improved by the ALDH2 activator Alda-1. In the second part of the study, we therefore thoroughly characterized the mode of action of Alda-1 with respect to established ALDH2 activities and GTN bioconversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Bovine lung sGC was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).

The signals obtained with both enzymes were immediately reduced to base line upon addition of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> of the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin (data not shown). The decay of the signals could be fitted to single exponentials with apparent rate constants (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) of 19 &#x000b1; 0.12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 5.6 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for ALDH2*1 and ALDH 2*2, respectively. Because NO inactivation by superoxide was prevented by including a large amount of SOD (1,000 units/ml), these results suggest that ALDH2*2 inactivates more slowly during turnover and forms larger amounts of NO from saturating GTN than the wild type enzyme. A different picture was obtained, however, when NO formation was measured at a pharmacologically more relevant low concentration of GTN (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>).

Thus, limited cofactor availability may be a major cause for the low dehydrogenase and esterase activities of ALDH2*2 measured under our experimental conditions. In addition, the E487K substitution was reported to progressively lower <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of aldehyde oxidation with decreasing substrate size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), presumably explaining our observation that residual activity of ALDH2*2 was highest with propionaldehyde (2.1% of wild type), followed by oxidation of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde (0.83 and 0.12% of wild type, respectively). However, because formaldehyde exhibits low affinity even for wild type ALDH2 (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> &#x0223c;0.6 m<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), decreased substrate affinity may significantly contribute to the extremely low activity of ALDH2*2 with formaldehyde.</p><p>The effect of the E487K substitution on GTN reductase activity decreased with increasing GTN concentration (3 and 15% of wild type with 2 and 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GTN, respectively; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). This may reflect low affinity of ALDH2*2 for GTN rather than for NAD, because GTN reductase activity is only moderately increased by the coenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). At low GTN, the ALDH2-catalyzed reaction results in highly selective formation of 1,2-GDN, but this selectivity is largely lost at increasing GTN concentrations or in the presence of enzyme inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Similarly, inactivation of ALDH2 in nitrate-tolerant blood vessels results in the loss of 1,2-GDN selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Formation of 1,3-GDN appears to occur through a nonspecific side reaction of the enzyme, which does not involve binding of GTN to the catalytic site because it is insensitive to substrate-competitive inhibitors. Interestingly, ALDH2*2 also formed less 1,3-GDN than the wild type enzyme, but the 1,2-/1,3-GDN ratio was markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>), suggesting a loss of specificity upon the E487K substitution.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Alda-1 on Aldehyde Oxidation</title><p>In line with published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we found that Alda-1 only moderately activated wild type ALDH2 (1.5-fold increase in acetaldehyde oxidation), whereas the residual activity of the East Asian variant was increased 6-fold. Similar results were obtained with propionaldehyde, but Alda-1 inhibited formaldehyde oxidation by ALDH2*1 by &#x0223c;90% and caused only 2.3-fold stimulation of the ALDH2*2-catalyzed reaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interference of Alda-1 with substrate binding may explain the aberrant results with formaldehyde, because the relatively high affinities of the longer chain aldehydes may ensure saturation even without Alda-1. In agreement with this hypothesis, hardly any inhibition of ALDH2*1 by Alda-1 was observed when the formaldehyde concentration was increased from 1 to 15 m<sc>m</sc> (90.2% of control; data not shown). Under the assumption that the effect of Alda-1 on <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> was not dependent on the structure of the aldehyde substrate, it can be estimated that the drug decreased the binding affinity of formaldehyde &#x0223c;20-fold. However, this model leaves unexplained the comparably small effect of Alda-1 on oxidation of the longer chain propionaldehyde, pointing at additional as yet unknown factors that may govern the effects of Alda-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Alda-1 on Ester Hydrolysis</title><p>In the absence of NAD, Alda-1 caused 6- and 9-fold increases in the rates of ester hydrolysis catalyzed by ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). Intriguingly, the degree of enzyme stimulation by Alda-1 was virtually identical to that exerted by NAD, as if the drug mimicked the effect of the coenzyme on ester hydrolysis. The seemingly aberrant data obtained in the combined presence of Alda-1 and NAD are explained by a biphasic effect of NAD on esterase activity, resulting in pronounced inhibition at high concentrations of the coenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). Inhibition of ALDH2 by high NAD has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and was suggested to result from competition for <italic>p</italic>-NPA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, a more recent paper reported on monophasic stimulation of both ALDH2 variants by NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It was beyond the scope of the present study to clarify this issue, but obviously the pronounced left shift of NAD-induced inhibition of wild type esterase activity by Alda-1 provides a conclusive explanation for the divergent effects of the drug on the two ALDH2 variants that we observed in the presence of 1 m<sc>m</sc> NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Alda-1 on GTN Denitration</title><p>Surprisingly, Alda-1 did not stimulate but inhibited GTN denitration by both ALDH2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Considering that the yield of GTN-derived products is determined by the balance between the rates of GTN denitration and mechanism-based enzyme inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), it appears that the increased rate of ALDH2 inactivation observed in the presence of Alda-1 counteracts and, in fact, overcompensates the stimulation of the enzyme that would be expected from the esterase data. It was one of the goals of the present study to find out whether Alda-1 might be useful as a lead compound for the development of drugs improving the potency of GTN in subjects carrying the ALDH2*2 allele, but our data clearly argue against this possibility.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that Alda-1 modifies ALDH2 function mainly through increasing the apparent binding affinity for NAD, which is essential for aldehyde oxidation and facilitates ester hydrolysis as well as GTN denitration. This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of the Asian variant, which exhibits very low NAD affinity. Protein crystallography revealed profound structural disorders in the active site of ALDH2*2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Thus, Alda-1 may restore the active site conformation, resulting in increased NAD binding affinity and, as a consequence, increased dehydrogenase and esterase activities. In addition, Alda-1 appears to allosterically reduce the binding affinity of aldehyde substrates, resulting in inhibition of dehydrogenase activity measured at subsaturating aldehyde concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>GTN Bioactivation</title><p>Although the E487K substitution led to &#x0223c;7-fold lower rates of GTN denitration as compared with wild type, the rate of NO formation was reduced only 2-fold. This discrepancy reinforces our recent proposal that GTN denitration and bioactivation reflect two separate pathways of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN biotransformation, both of which involve formation of a thionitrate intermediate at Cys<sup>302</sup> as initial reaction step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The factors governing the fractional contribution of these two putative pathways to overall GTN turnover as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown and are currently being investigated in our laboratory.</p><p>The slower decay of the NO signal observed with ALDH2*2 in the presence of SOD may reflect a lower rate of mechanism-based enzyme inactivation by GTN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by a comparison of the observed inactivation rate constants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and the apparent rate constants for NO decay calculated from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>. As elaborated under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures,&#x0201d; there should be a close relationship between the respective rate constants, with <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> = 0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x000d7; <italic>k</italic><sub>inact</sub> if decay of the NO signal reflects ALDH2 inactivation, although the apparent inactivation rate constant was presumably decreased by DTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and increased by the higher temperature (37 <italic>versus</italic> 25 &#x000b0;C) in the electrochemical measurements of NO formation as compared with the enzyme inactivation studies. Notwithstanding these caveats, the ratio of the rate constants observed with the two variants of the enzyme would be expected to be similar. The rates of ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 inactivation were 8.2 &#x000b1; 0.44 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.24 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), yielding a ratio of 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.36. First order decay of the NO signals obtained with ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 gave values of 3.8 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (assuming <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> = 0.5 &#x000d7; <italic>k</italic><sub>inact</sub>), which yields a ratio of 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.05. This remarkable concordance strongly suggests that the prolonged NO signal obtained with the ALDH2*2 (despite lower initial rates of NO formation) reflects the comparably slow rate of GTN-induced inactivation of the Asian mutant. If inactivation of vascular ALDH2 were indeed a major cause of nitrate tolerance, these results would imply delayed tolerance development in subjects carrying the mutation.</p><p>In the sGC bioactivation assay the E487K mutant was less efficient than wild type at 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>) as expected from the lower apparent affinity for the nitrate observed in the denitration assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, under conditions of high turnover, <italic>i.e.</italic> saturating GTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref><italic>A</italic>) and/or high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>), the Asian variant had the opposite effect, resulting in higher rates of cGMP formation than the wild type enzyme. Because sGC activation by both variants was virtually identical in the presence of the superoxide scavenger SOD (data not shown), the higher efficiency of ALDH2*2 in the absence of SOD appears to reflect reduced superoxide generation and consequently increased NO bioavailability in the course of ALDH2*2-catalyzed GTN turnover. The biological relevance of mechanism-based superoxide formation in the course of GTN bioconversion is unclear. Although high amounts of manganese-SOD present in mitochondria may efficiently prevent superoxide-mediated inactivation of NO, superoxide scavenging was proposed to be compromised in nitrate-tolerant blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of ALDH2-catalyzed superoxide formation, the differences between wild type and the E487K mutant are interesting with respect to enzyme function. In a recent study we characterized an ALDH2 mutant lacking the general base glutamate 268 (E268Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the absence of NAD, the E268Q mutant exhibited similar rates of GTN denitration as the wild type enzyme, but surprisingly generation of superoxide occurring in the course of GTN denitration was reduced, resulting in increased NO bioavailability and enhanced sGC activation in the absence of SOD. Remarkably, one of the structural changes of the E487K substitution in ALDH2*2 involves relocation of the carboxylate group of Glu<sup>268</sup> 5.5 &#x0212b; away from the sulfhydryl group of the essential nucleophilic residue Cys<sup>302</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate about disturbance of the Glu<sup>268</sup>-Cys<sup>302</sup> interaction as a common cause of the increased NO bioavailability that we observed in the course of GTN bioactivation by E268Q-ALDH2 and the Asian variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for GTN Vasoactivity</title><p>Extrapolation of our data obtained with purified enzymes to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation would imply that the vascular response to low doses of GTN should be reduced in subjects carrying the ALDH2*2 allele, whereas the response to high doses should be preserved. Two clinical studies in which this issue has been addressed provide strong evidence for decreased efficacy of intra-arterially infused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and sublingually administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) GTN in subjects carrying the ALDH2*2 allele. In one study, the E487K substitution impaired the change in blood flow of healthy volunteers at all of the GTN infusion rates tested (0.25&#x02013;4.0 &#x003bc;g/min), but comparison with the effect of a high dose of the ALDH2 inhibitor disulfiram suggests that ALDH2 still contributes significantly to vasodilation induced by high GTN in carriers of the ALDH2*2 allele (<italic>cf.</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and 3 in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Another study reported that the efficacious rate of sublingual GTN, measured as reduction of ischemic chest pain of patients having documented coronary artery disease, was reduced from 85.1% in controls to 57.6% in subjects carrying at least one ALDH2*2 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Based on these data and the assumption that ALDH2*2 exhibits very low activity, the authors concluded that factors other than ALDH2 may contribute to GTN efficacy in carriers of the ALDH2*2 allele. The issue may be even more complex because higher rates of protein turnover result in lower protein expression levels of the Asian variant as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Moreover, in a recent study carried out by Dr. John D. Horowitz and co-workers in a blinded fashion with 51 young Chinese adults, the reduction in the hemodynamic response to sublingual GTN was very small and significant only in carriers of the ALDH2*2 allele.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, there is considerable evidence that subjects expressing the E487K mutant are still responsive to GTN. The present results showing that the Asian variant catalyzes significant bioactivation of GTN despite very low denitration activity may at least partially explain the GTN response in these subjects.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Fonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung in Austria W901 DK Molecular Enzymology Grants P20669 and P21693 (to B.
