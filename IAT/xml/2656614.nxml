The transcription factor MyoD controls myogenic stem cell function and differentiation, and seems necessary to maintain the differentiated phenotype of adult fast skeletal muscle fibres. We previously showed that MAFbx mediates MyoD proteolysis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we present evidence that MAFbx targets MyoD for degradation in several models of skeletal muscle atrophy. In cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, MAFbx expression increases, leading to a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of MAFbx and a selective suppression of MyoD. Conversely, transfection of myotubes with sh-RNA-mediated MAFbx gene silencing (shRNAi) inhibited MyoD proteolysis linked to atrophy. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant MyoDK133R lacking MAFbx-mediated ubiquitination prevents atrophy of mouse primary myotubes and skeletal muscle fibres <italic>in vivo</italic>. Regarding the complex role of MyoD in adult skeletal muscle plasticity and homeostasis, its rapid suppression by MAFbx seems to be a major event leading to skeletal muscle wasting. Our results point out MyoD as the second MAFbx skeletal muscle target by which powerful therapies could be developed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by an increase in proteolysis, particularly via the ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Jagoe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, F-box proteins confer SCF specificity by directly interacting with the substrate and there are increasing evidence about MAFbx participation in a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase complex leading to negative regulation of muscle cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Sandri1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-LagirandCantaloube1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which MAFbx contributes to atrophy remain unclear. Recently, we have shown that overexpression of MAFbx in proliferating myoblasts antagonizes differentiation by inducing MyoD degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Tintignac1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. MyoD is a muscle-specific transcription factor that induces both the withdrawal from the cell cycle and the activation of muscle specific genes expression crucial for skeletal muscle differentiation process engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Edmondson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Tintignac2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. MyoD is also essential for myogenic stem cell function in adult skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Megeney1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, MyoD is normally expressed in adult fibres where its protein levels tend to increase with development and remain relatively constant during aging <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Hughes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Brack1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In muscle fibrenuclei, MyoD seems also required to maintain aging muscle homeostasis and plays a role in skeletal muscle plasticity in response to hypertrophic or denervation stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Hughes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Ishido1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Ishido2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in atrophic conditions, MAFbx-dependent proteolysis of MyoD could constitute a major event to suppress muscle homeostasis. To address this problem, in the present work we have used various <italic>in cellulo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> muscle atrophy models to examine the effects on MyoD degradation during the atrophic process. we present evidence that MyoD is targeted by Atrogin1/MAFbx (MAFbx) in skeletal muscle atrophy. In cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the expression of MAFbx increases, leading to a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of MAFbx and degradation of MyoD. Among the four MRFs, MyoD was selectively affected as confirmed by MyoD over-ubiquitination. Conversely, transfection of myotubes undergoing atrophy with shRNA-mediated MAFbx gene silencing (shRNAi) prevented MyoD degradation. Finally, overexpression of a MyoD mutant (K133R) lacking MAFbx-mediated ubiquitination, not only reduced starvation-induced muscle atrophy in mouse primary cultures of myotubes and in mice but lead to a hypertrophy in control muscle. These results suggest that the targeting of MyoD by MAFbx may be a major event to suppress the complex role of MyoD in plasticity and homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the maintain of MyoDK133R in muscle undergoing atrophy has a protective effect against further wasting. MyoD K133R represents a new pharmacological target to limit muscle atrophy, in a profilatic or curative perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MyoD but not the others MRFs interacts with MAFbx</title><p>MAFbx contains two potential nuclear localization signals which both are conserved between human, rat and mouse species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Gomes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Tintignac1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that during muscle atrophy MAFbx might ubiquitinate muscle-specific transcription factors or nuclear proteins involved in muscle growth.

This prompted us to test the interaction of MAFbx with the two other muscle specific transcription factors myogenin and MRF4. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 10T1/2 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged MyoD, myogenin, MRF4 and Flag-MAFbx expression constructs. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-HA antibodies. MyoD but neither myogenin nor MRF4 coimmunoprecipitated with MAFbx (Supplementary data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004973.s001">Fig S1</xref>).

After 6 hours of starvation, myotubes showed a 50&#x02013;60&#x00025; decrease in diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-LagirandCantaloube1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, a loss of myonuclei and a nuclear localization of MAFbx. In these myotubes MyoD levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004973-g001">Fig. 1, f&#x02013;j</xref>). Supplying nutrients and serum for 15 h reversed the process.

These observations suggest that MAFbx nuclear translocation is tightly linked to MyoD degradation in muscle cells undergoing atrophy. This hypothesis was strengthened by the fact that ectopic expression of MAFbx-GFP into C2C12 myotubes revealed myonuclear accumulation of the fusion protein and an atrophic phenotype. MyoD staining was lost in these transfected myotubes while C2C12 myotubes transfected with the empty vector were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004973-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

The changes observed in starving myotubes were reversed by resupplying nutrients and serum for 15 hrs (Supplementary data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004973.s002">Fig. S2</xref> A to D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Sandri1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We determined whether in these experimental conditions MAFbx affected MyoD expression. We first examined by immunofluorescence the presence of MyoD in C2C12 myotubes undergoing atrophy. Addition of DEX, starvation and /or oxidative stress, all suppressed MyoD while expression of myogenin was still observed in C2C12 myotubes undergoing atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004973-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the degradation of MyoD in C2C12 myotubes undergoing atrophy. Loss of MyoD by starvation was completely reversed by supplying serum and nutrients . Western blot data also revealed that food deprivation was more efficient in MyoD degradation than the oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004973-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In differentiated myotubes, the cytokine tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) signalling is required for NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent down regulation of MyoD mRNAs and dysfunction of skeletal myofibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004973-Guttridge1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. To exclude such a mechanism of MyoD regulation, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were undertaken.

Moreover, we used small hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi) in atrophying C2C12 myotubes to assess the role of MAFbx in MyoD suppression.
