Lean people tend to have high daily activity levels, but the source of this increased activity is unknown. We found that leanness cannot be accounted for by increased weight-corrected food intake in two different types of lean rats. As previously reported in lean people, we found that lean rats had higher daily activity levels; lean rats also expended more energy. These lean rats were developed through artificial selection for high aerobic endurance capacity. To test whether our findings extended to a human population, we measured endurance capacity using a VO<sub>2max</sub> treadmill test and daily activity in a group of non-exercising individuals. Similar to lean rats selectively bred for endurance capacity, our study revealed that people with higher VO<sub>2max</sub> also spent more time active throughout the day. Hence, endurance capacity may be the trait that underlies both physical activity levels and leanness. We identified one potential mechanism for the lean, active phenotype in rats, namely high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK. Therefore, the lean phenotype is characterized by high endurance capacity and high activity and may stem from altered skeletal muscle energetics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is thought that the modern increase in obesity is due to the combination of our &#x0201c;thrifty&#x0201d; genes with an obesogenic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Neel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Prentice1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Why, then, do some people seem to have little trouble staying lean? Unlike obesity, the traits of the minority of individuals who remain lean in the face of environmental pressure to gain weight are often ignored. During selective breeding for diet-induced obesity, for example, lean diet-resistant rats, rather than obesity-prone rats, appear to be unusual compared to the founder population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Teske1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, when fed excess calories, some people are less susceptible than others to weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Sims1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. What is different about these rats or people that allows them to resist weight gain? Focusing on the attributes of leanness may lead to fresh insights into the obesity epidemic.</p><p>Weight gain can result from increased energy intake and/or decreased energy expenditure. Though overfeeding increases body weight, do lean individuals necessarily have to eat less than obesity-prone people to remain lean? To answer this question, we first investigated voluntary caloric intake in lean and obese rats.</p><p>When examining the role of energy expenditure of obesity, the two largest components of total daily energy expenditure receive the most attention: (1) resting or basal metabolic rate, and (2) energy expenditure of activity. Whether or not basal metabolic rate (BMR) is lower in obesity-prone people is a subject of some contention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Hambly1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Weinsier2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Even if BMR is diminished in obesity-prone people, this does not fully account for the positive energy balance in these individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Ravussin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We know that daily activity levels are high in lean people compared to obese people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Obese people spend on average over two extra hours sitting compared to lean people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Johannsen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been put forward that physical activity and the associated energy expenditure may be key traits that distinguish individuals who are resistant to obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Sims1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Though increasing daily activity is sure to increase energy expenditure, it could be argued that the low activity seen in obesity is secondary to the heightened body mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Tou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. To examine this question and probe the source of the heightened activity in lean individuals, we measured daily activity and energy expenditure in a rat model of leanness. We know that rats bred for resistance to obesity on a high-fat diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> have high activity levels compared to both diet-induced obese rats and control rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Teske1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Novak1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine if high activity is consistently associated with leanness, we measured activity in another group of rats derived through artificial selection. Rats selectively bred for high intrinsic aerobic endurance capacity are lean, whereas their low-endurance counterparts are overweight and prone to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Noland1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Koch1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that the lean phenotype is characterized by high endurance and high activity levels. Thus, we focused on these two traits when searching for a biological mechanism underlying the lean phenotype.</p><p>It is known that lean people spend more time each day physically active than obese people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Johannsen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The source of this effect is a subject of some debate. It appears that at least some of this difference in daily activity is independent of body mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Johannsen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We used the information gleaned investigating lean rats to extrapolate potential sources that could underlie the differences in daily activity between lean and obese people. Once we identified this source, namely innate running endurance, an interesting potential mechanism presented itself&#x02014;one that may underlie the tendency to be active, innate endurance, and leanness.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lean rats do not eat less</title><p>To investigate the lean phenotype, we measured food intake in different exemplars of leanness. First, in rats that were selectively bred for resistance to obesity on a high-fat diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the lean rats did not eat fewer calories than the obese rats after correction for body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005869-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Thus, the lean phenotype is not characterized by low caloric intake in rats. This is not to say that weight gain in a given obese individual is not due in part to high food intake, just that the positive energy balance would quite possibly persist even if caloric intake were maintained at the level of a lean individual. This should not be surprising given that obesity has increased even in populations where diet quality has improved and fat intake has decreased over several decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Popkin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Heini1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005869-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005869.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Lean rats do not eat less.</title><p>Daily caloric intake, corrected for metabolically-active body mass, was not greater in obese compared to lean rats on a high-fat diet (top).

The lean rats were 25&#x00025; more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005869-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and 25&#x00025; more ambulatory (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005869-t001">Table 1</xref>); minute-by-minute, they were active during an additional 64 minutes of the day compared to the overweight rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005869-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, in the lean phenotype characterized by high intrinsic running endurance, heightened daily physical activity is not a consequence of a small body mass but rather inherent to the individual's physiology.</p><fig id="pone-0005869-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005869.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>High-endurance rats were more active, regardless of body weight.</title><p>Physical activity, in beam breaks/min over 24 hrs (mean&#x000b1;SE), was greater in lean, high-endurance rats compared to overweight, low-endurance rats (A), as was body mass-corrected energy expenditure (B).

As expected, energy expenditure increased with activity throughout the day in rats, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005869-g002">Figure 2D</xref>. Moreover, when resting energy expenditure (REE) and energy expenditure of activity (EEA) were calculated according to body weight for each rat, EEA (the rat correlate of human NEAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Novak2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>) was significantly higher in the high-endurance rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005869-t001">Table 1</xref>). In other words, the lean rats used more calories to move a given mass than the overweight, low-endurance rats. This does not take into account potential differences in fuel economy of activity that can also affect daily EEA and contribute to total daily energy expenditure. Resting energy expenditure was also higher in lean compared to overweight rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005869-t001">Table 1</xref>). Using our calculation, EEA is roughly 12&#x00025; of total daily energy expenditure in both groups of rats. In humans, NEAT comprises a much greater proportion of daily energy expenditure&#x02014;30&#x00025; or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, by logical extension, additional gains in physical activity will result in greater incremental energy expenditure in a human than in a rodent.</p><p>We considered the possibility that whether or not the enhanced physical activity and associated energy expenditure accounted for every extra calorie expended in the lean rats may not be the crucial question. It is possible that high physical activity and high aerobic capacity are key, interrelated features of the lean phenotype. This may allow us to more effectively target the fundamental physiological traits and genetic differences underlying leanness. First, however, it was necessary to establish that this effect generalized to human physiology and behavior and was relevant to human health.</p><p>If endurance capacity, not body size, is a major factor determining daily activity levels, then the effect we identified in rats should generalize: people with high intrinsic running endurance should also have high daily activity levels. Moreover, if endurance and the tendency to be active are linked at the mechanistic level, then we would expect this association to overshadow the association between daily activity and body weight, as it did in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005869-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Like spontaneous activity, inborn exercise capacity varies considerably among people, but why some people have higher inborn endurance than others is complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Joyner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. To test the predictability of our findings from animal studies, we measured VO<sub>2max</sub> and 10-day baseline physical activity in non-exercising people using a validated Physical Activity Monitoring System <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We specifically targeted people who did not engage in regular exercise above the intensity experienced in daily living to rule out the effect of endurance training on VO<sub>2max</sub>.

We considered the possibility that both of these factors&#x02014;aerobic endurance and the tendency to be highly active&#x02014;may stem from a third cause. In our search for why some people are more active than others, we focused on mechanisms underlying aerobic endurance capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Lean rats have high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK</title><p>Our data suggest that high aerobic endurance may underlie leanness and high daily activity levels.

Hakimi et al.

High levels of PEPCK were also found in the muscle of obesity-resistant rats compared to diet-induced obese rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005869-g004">Figure 4C, E</xref>). The presence of elevated skeletal muscle PEPCK in two different sets of lean rats selectively bred for two distinct complex traits&#x02014;diet resistance and high intrinsic running endurance&#x02014;implies that high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK may be a common feature of leanness.

More specifically, we hypothesize that muscle energy capacity is communicated to the brain to modulate physical activity levels. Moreover, we suspect that this muscle energetic capacity may come at the price of decreased metabolic efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Hudson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and potentially decreased economy of activity as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Pate1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Hunter2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In other words, having high endurance capacity is decidedly un-thrifty. During evolution, food scarcity was only one of several challenges to survival and reproduction. It is entirely conceivable that individuals with high running endurance would have a selective advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Calsbeek1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>(e.g., predator avoidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Speakman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Tidhar1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>) and, as our data suggest, these same individuals would have traits favoring resistance to obesity. Our results therefore imply that leanness and high physical activity levels may have resulted as a byproduct during natural selection of high capacity for running endurance. Paradoxically, exploring the mechanisms interconnecting endurance and leanness may be the key to combating obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>1.1 Human study</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent prior to participation in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>1.1a Daily activity</title><p>Eleven non-exercising individuals (6 women and 5 men) completed the 10-day baseline activity measurement using the validated Physical Activity Monitoring System, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005869-Levine4">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.
