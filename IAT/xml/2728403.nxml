Whether any of this machinery functions in membrane traffic is unknown. In this study, we report that mammal Dpy-30 (mDpy-30), a subunit of several histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase (H3K4MT) complexes, resides in the nucleus and at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The TGN targeting of mDpy-30 is mediated by BIG1, a TGN-localized guanine nucleotide exchange factor for adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor GTPases. Altering mDpy-30 levels changes the distribution of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) without affecting that of TGN46 or transferrin receptor. Our experiments also indicate that mDpy-30 functions in the endosome to TGN transport of CIMPR and that its knockdown results in the enrichment of internalized CIMPR and recycling endosomes near cell protrusions. Much like mDpy-30 depletion, the knockdown of Ash2L or RbBP5, two other H3K4MT subunits, leads to a similar redistribution of CIMPR. Collectively, these results suggest that mDpy-30 and probably H3K4MT play a role in the endosomal transport of specific cargo proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Covalent histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and function. Methylation of lysine residues within histones H3 and H4 by histone lysine methyltransferase complexes is one such modification. Depending on the site of the modified lysine residue and the extent of methylation (mono-, di-, or trimethylated), these modifications can lead to either activation or repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ng et al., 2009</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates an intimate link between abnormal histone methylation and human disease. Although histone lysine methyltransferase complexes primarily reside in the nucleus and target histones, their presence in the cytosol has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2005</xref>), and several nonhistone substrates have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang and Berger, 2008</xref>). Based on our knowledge, whether a histone lysine methyltransferase complex or its subunits reside or function in the intracellular vesicular transport pathway is currently unknown. In this regard, an organellar proteomic study has detected arginine dimethylation in several Golgi proteins and revealed two putative Golgi-associated methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, at least five different SET1 family methyltransferase complexes target histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shilatifard, 2008</xref>). Although these complexes contain distinct catalytic subunits, they share common components, including Ash2L, RbBP5, WDR5, and mammal Dpy-30 (mDpy-30). Ash2L, RbBP5, and WDR5 form a stable core complex that confers substrate specificity and controls catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steward et al., 2006</xref>). Dpy-30 was originally identified as an essential component of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> dosage compensation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsu et al., 1995</xref>). However, Dpy-30 mutant males also exhibit growth and development defects, indicating a general function of this protein. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the yeast and mammalian orthologues of Dpy-30, Sdc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roguev et al., 2001</xref>) and mDpy-30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2007</xref>), respectively, are common subunits of several H3K4 methyltransferase (H3K4MT) complexes and that deletion of Sdc1 from yeast leads to a greatly reduced level of H3K4 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). Despite being a conserved H3K4MT subunit, the molecular function of mDpy-30 remains unknown. We originally isolated mDpy-30 from a rat brain cDNA library as a potential binding partner of a potassium channel in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Although we have not been able to confirm the interaction between mDpy-30 and the channel protein, we found that mDpy-30 localized to the Golgi apparatus and proceeded to examine the role of mDpy-30 in vesicular traffic.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>TGN localization of mDpy-30</title><p>Immunofluorescence study in multiple cell types revealed that mDpy-30 displayed an unanticipated dual localization, both nuclear and cytoplasmic (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902146/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link> for antibody characterization), the latter of which was enriched at a perinuclear site (Fig. S1 E). The following observations suggest that the dual localization is an intrinsic property of mDpy-30. First, an HA-tagged mDpy-30 exhibited a similar distribution when stably expressed in CV-1 cells (Fig. S1 G). Second, live cell imaging indicated that a pool of mDpy-30&#x02013;monomeric RFP (monomeric RFP fused to the C terminus of mDpy-30) resided in a perinuclear region in addition to the nucleus (Fig. S1 H). To define the identity of perinuclear mDpy-30 staining, we conducted a comparison between perinuclear mDpy-30 and subcellular markers known to reside in compartments near the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We found little or no colocalization between mDpy-30 and recycling endosomes (labeled by an EGFP fusion of Rab11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ullrich et al., 1996</xref>), late endosomes (EGFP fusion of Rab7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meresse et al., 1995</xref>), and lysosomes (Lamp1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 1985</xref>). When compared with Golgi markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), mDpy-30 displayed little colocalization with p115, a cis-Golgi network/cis-Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 1998</xref>), and GRASP55, a medial-Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shorter et al., 1999</xref>). However, mDpy-30 staining was in close proximity to and partially overlapped with that of TGN46, a TGN marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ponnambalam et al., 1996</xref>). Similar results were obtained using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and JCB DataViewer; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcb-dataviewer.rupress.org/jcb/browse/1505/2600">http://jcb-dataviewer.rupress.org/jcb/browse/1505/2600</ext-link>); Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that there was a significantly higher correlation between the TGN46 and mDpy-30 staining than that of p115 and mDpy-30. Collectively, our data suggest that a pool of mDpy-30 is present at the TGN.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Imaging analyses of perinuclear mDpy-30 in HeLa cells.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, immunostained, and visualized using conventional (A and B) or confocal (C) microscopy.

Although both control and mDpy-30 knockdown cells expressed a similar level of CIMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), depletion of mDpy-30 resulted in a five- to sixfold increase in the fraction of cells displaying an enrichment of CIMPR near cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In contrast, neither TGN46 nor TfnR became concentrated in these compartments. The distribution of CIMPR was also more sensitive to mDpy-30 overexpression (i.e., a reduced perinuclear and an increased dispersed staining compared with control cells) than those of &#x003b2;-GalT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and TGN46 (not depicted). Moreover, the overexpression of mDpy-30 caused a 25% reduction of CIMPR protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), possibly by promoting its lysosomal degradation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular distribution analyses of CIMPR, TGN46, and TfnR in HeLa cells depleted of or overexpressing mDpy-30.</bold> All siRNAs were used at a concentration of 20 nM, and transfected cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection.

At 5 min after internalization, CD8-CIMPR was primarily found in peripheral vesicles (presumably early endosomes) in virtually all control and mDpy-30&#x02013;depleted cells, suggesting that mDpy-30 depletion had no substantial impact on the internalization of CD8-CIMPR. At 15 min after internalization, a pool of CD8-CIMPR had reached a perinuclear site in &#x0223c;75% of the control cells; this perinuclear compartment became the most prominently stained structure in the majority of cells. However, the fraction of cells displaying perinuclear localization of CD8-CIMPR was reduced in mDpy-30 knockdown cells (52% for siRNA1 and 27% for siRNA2). Even in those cells exhibiting a perinuclear CD8-CIMPR staining, a large fraction of fusion proteins remained in peripheral endosomes throughout the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The difference in the perinuclear targeting of CD8-CIMPR persisted after 45 min of internalization. Accompanying this decreased efficiency in targeting internalized CD8-CIMPR to the perinuclear region, there was a time-dependent enrichment (a fourfold increase for siRNA1 or -2) of fusion proteins at a compartment near the protrusions of mDpy-30&#x02013;depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). To confirm that mDpy-30 knockdown exerted a similar effect on endogenous CIMPR, we added the anti-CIMPR antibody to the culture medium of HeLa cells for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The antibody labeling and internalization steps were combined and lengthened to improve the signal strength of internalized endogenous CIMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). As with CD8-CIMPR, a fraction of CIMPR was found near protrusions in mDpy-30&#x02013;depleted cells. Because the endosomal transport of a CD8-furin fusion was altered by mDpy-30 siRNA in a similar way (unpublished data), the effect of mDpy-30 on trafficking was not specific to CIMPR.</p><p>The observation that the level of CD8-CIMPR at the protrusions of mDpy-30 knockdown cells increased within 45 min of internalization implied that mDpy-30 functions at a late endosomal transport step. To test this, we simultaneously compared the endosomal transport of TfnR (via biotinylated transferrin) and CD8-CIMPR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, at 5 min after internalization, CD8-CIMPR and TfnR colocalized at an early endosomal compartment in both control (not depicted) and mDpy-30&#x02013;depleted cells. At 10 or 20 min after internalization, TfnR entered tubular recycling endosomes, but there was little colocalization with CD8-CIMPR, indicating that these proteins had been sorted into different pathways after their transit through the early endosomes. This was in accordance with a lack of EEA1 (a marker of early endosomes) staining in the protrusion regions where internalized CD8-CIMPR became enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest that mDpy-30 regulates the late endosomal trafficking of a subset of cargo proteins such as CIMPR and furin. Given the TGN localization of mDpy-30 as well as the inefficient return of internalized CD8-CIMPR to a perinuclear site, mDpy-30 is probably involved in the endosome to TGN transport of CIMPR. In the absence of mDpy-30, a pool of CIMPR is redirected to endosomes near cell protrusions. However, we cannot exclude a role of mDpy-30 in the transport between endosomes or from the TGN to endosomes. Moreover, because mDpy-30 knockdown also reduced the H3K4 trimethylation (Fig. S2 E), our data do not allow us to distinguish whether mDpy-30 modulates CIMPR trafficking via transcription or posttranscriptional effects or both.</p></sec><sec><title>A role of the H3K4MT complex or complexes in the endosomal transport of CIMPR</title><p>To explore H3K4MT involvement in trafficking, we examined the endosomal transport of CD8-CIMPR after knocking down either Ash2L or RbBP5, two other common H3K4MT subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>). Indeed, cells transfected with either of the two siRNAs against Ash2L or RbBP5 accumulated internalized CD8-CIMPR near cell protrusions. The effect of Ash2L or RbBP5 siRNAs on CIMPR was not caused by their impact on the level of mDpy-30 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 I</xref>). In contrast, treatment of cells with an siRNA against SUV39H1, a component of the H3K9MT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rea et al., 2000</xref>), exerted little effect. Moreover, similar to mDpy-30 overexpression, overexpression of either Ash2L or RbBP5 increased the fraction of cells displaying a dispersed CIMPR distribution without changing that of &#x003b2;-GalT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 J</xref>).

Each Rab protein has a compartment-specific localization and plays an essential role in defining the compartmental function in trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Markgraf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>). For example, Rab4, -5, and -11 all reside in early endosomal compartments with distinct functions. Rab5 modulates endocytosis, and Rab4 and -11 control the endosomal recycling from early and recycling endosomes, respectively. However, Rab7 and -9 primarily function during the late endosomal trafficking, and Rab6 is thought to regulate endosome to TGN transport. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 (C and D)</xref>, knockdown of mDpy-30 induced enrichment of Rab11 and, to an even higher extent, Rab4 at cell protrusions without significantly affecting the distributions of Rab5, -6, -7, and -9. This observation implies that the depletion of mDpy-30 causes a subpopulation of recycling endosomes to be enriched at cell protrusions.</p></sec><sec><title>BIG1-mediated recruitment of mDpy-30 to the TGN</title><p>To gain mechanistic insight into how mDpy-30 modulates endosomal trafficking, we set out to identify proteins interacting with mDpy-30. We generated CV-1 cells stably expressing a GFP fusion of mDpy-30 and used an anti-GFP antibody covalently linked to magnetic microbeads to immunoprecipitate mDpy-30&#x02013;EGFP and its associated proteins. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the immunoprecipitate revealed several known mDpy-30&#x02013;interacting partners, including Ash2L and WDR5 (two H3K4MT components), as well as a novel interacting partner, BIG1 (a TGN-localized ADP ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morinaga et al., 1997</xref>). We confirmed the mDpy-30&#x02013;BIG1 interaction using coimmunoprecipitation between mDpy-30 and a HA-tagged BIG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) as well as between endogenous mDpy-30 and BIG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Furthermore, mDpy-30 and BIG1 colocalized at the perinuclear TGN region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Interestingly, BIG1 depletion greatly reduced the TGN staining of mDpy-30 without affecting &#x003b2;-GalT1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). However, overexpression of BIG1 led to an enhanced staining of perinuclear mDpy-30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Thus, our data show that BIG1 plays a major role in recruiting mDpy-30 to the TGN.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>BIG1-mediated TGN targeting of mDpy-30.</bold> (A) Identification of mDpy-30&#x02013;interacting proteins by immunopurification and tandem mass spectroscopy from CV-1 cells stably expressing an EGFP fusion of mDpy-30 (see Materials and methods).

Our findings raise several intriguing questions for future studies. To begin, the mechanism by which mDpy-30 and H3K4MT regulate the endosomal transport remains unknown. One possibility is that mDpy-30, Ash2L, and RbBP5 are components of a yet to be identified methyltransferase complex at the TGN where they affect endosomal transport by controlling the methylation of a trafficking regulator. However, we have not been able to detect the Golgi localization of either Ash2L or RbBP5 using multiple antibodies or their GFP fusions (unpublished data). Another possibility is that the TGN pool of mDpy-30 coordinates with nuclear H3K4MT to modulate endosomal transport. The identification of BIG1 as an mDpy-30&#x02013;interacting protein may provide clues to the aforementioned question. Both BIG1 and BIG2, a structurally similar ADP ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor also found at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamaji et al., 2000</xref>), are involved in endosome to TGN transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>) and/or TGN maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Manolea et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, the nuclear accumulation of BIG1 in HepG2 cells has been observed under serum starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Padilla et al., 2004</xref>) and PKA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Citterio et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate whether mDpy-30 regulates BIG1 function and whether BIG1 influences H3K4MT activity. Another question regards the physiological significance of our observations. Increasing evidence has implicated CIMPR in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roshy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joyce and Hanahan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wood and Hulett, 2008</xref>). Moreover, Rab4 and -11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>) and VAMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Proux-Gillardeaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tayeb et al., 2005</xref>) all impact integrin trafficking and cell adhesion/migration. The fact that knockdown of mDpy-30 or other H3K4MT components results in an enrichment of Rab4- or Rab11-positive endosomes at cell protrusions suggests that H3K4MT may regulate cell adhesion/migration via modulating endosomal recycling. It is important to see whether the Rab4- and Rab11-positive compartments accumulated at the protrusions of mDpy-30&#x02013;depleted cells indeed have a recycling function and to determine what types of cargo proteins besides CIMPR and furin transit via these compartments. Given a key role of local endocytosis and recycling of integrins at the cell leading edge in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caswell and Norman, 2008</xref>), it will be tempting to examine how the local trafficking of integrins is changed in cells depleted of mDpy-30 and other H3K4MT components and how this change regulates cell adhesion/migration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs and reagents</title><p>mDpy-30 was cloned from a yeast two-hybrid rat brain cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.).
