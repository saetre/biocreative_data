In humans, the two protein heterodimers hMutS&#x003b1; (hMSH2-hMSH6) and hMutL&#x003b1; (hMLH1-hPMS2) constitute the centre of the repair reaction. After recognising a DNA replication error, hMutS&#x003b1; recruits hMutL&#x003b1;, which then is thought to transduce the repair signal to the excision machinery. We have expressed an ATPase mutant of hMutL&#x003b1; as well as its individual subunits hMLH1 and hPMS2 and fragments of hMLH1, followed by examination of their interaction properties with hMutS&#x003b1; using a novel interaction assay. We show that, although the interaction requires ATP, hMutL&#x003b1; does not need to hydrolyse this nucleotide to join hMutS&#x003b1; on DNA, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; happens downstream of complex formation. The analysis of the individual subunits of hMutL&#x003b1; demonstrated that the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL&#x003b1; interaction is predominantly conferred by hMLH1. Further experiments revealed that only the N-terminus of hMLH1 confers this interaction. In contrast, only the C-terminus stabilised and co-immunoprecipitated hPMS2 when both proteins were co-expressed in 293T cells, indicating that dimerisation and stabilisation are mediated by the C-terminal part of hMLH1. We also examined another human homologue of bacterial MutL, hMutL&#x003b2; (hMLH1&#x02013;hPMS1). We show that hMutL&#x003b2; interacts as efficiently with hMutS&#x003b1; as hMutL&#x003b1;, and that it predominantly binds to hMutS&#x003b1; via hMLH1 as well.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved system which corrects base&#x02013;base mismatches and insertion&#x02013;deletion loops arising during DNA replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c3">3</xref>). In bacteria, the two protein dimers MutS and MutL constitute the main components of the repair machinery, exerting mismatch recognition and signalling repair initiation. Several eukary otic heterodimers have developed from these prokaryotic homodimers. In humans, hMutS&#x003b1; (hMSH2-hMSH6), hMutS&#x003b2; (hMSH2-hMSH3), hMutL&#x003b1; (hMLH1-hPMS2) and hMutL&#x003b2; (hMLH1-hPMS1) were identified, and mutations in their genes (predominantly <italic>hMLH1</italic> and <italic>hMSH2</italic>) segregate with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), a cancer predisposition syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Although the repair reaction can be exerted <italic>in vitro</italic> with protein extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c9">9</xref>), its exact mechanism is still unknown. While MutS and its eukaryotic counterparts are responsible for mismatch recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c13">13</xref>), the function of MutL proteins is more difficult to characterise. They seem to couple mismatch recognition to incision and removal of the nascent DNA strand, followed by resynthesis, which completes the repair reaction.</p><p>A major barrier for understanding the initiation of MMR is the seemingly paradoxical interplay of mismatch binding and ATP processing by MutS proteins. While ATP hydrolysis is enforced in the presence of heteroduplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c15">15</xref>), ATP binding induces dissociation of MutS proteins from the mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c20">20</xref>). This raises the question of how repair can be accomplished when ATP hydrolysis, which is likely to signal repair initiation, occurs after ATP binding has induced MutS to leave the mismatched site. Two repair models resolve this conflict by assuming that MutS proteins need to leave the mismatched site in order to search for a strand discrimination signal and to alert the excision machinery. Of these two models, the translocation model assumes that the movement is driven by ATP hydrolysis and serves to loop the faulty DNA duplex prior to strand incision at the base of the arising loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c17">17</xref>). In contrast, the molecular switch model proposes that MutS forms a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp on DNA after ATP uptake, signalling the finding of a mismatch to repair enzymes located elsewhere on the DNA duplex in a manner similar to G-protein signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c22">22</xref>). Another model suggests that MutS proteins do not lose, but only reduce affinity to DNA after ATP binding, thereby verifying the actual presence of the mismatch. This implies that binding to the mismatch is maintained during repair initiation. Since this model requires a bent DNA to enable MutS to contact the mismatch as well as other proteins bound elsewhere on the DNA duplex, it was referred to as the DNA bending model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c24">24</xref>).</p><p>MutL and its homologues can also hydrolyse ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c26">26</xref>) and bind DNA. Single-stranded DNA is preferred in short substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c28">28</xref>), while yeast MutL&#x003b1; has been found to bind double-stranded DNA efficiently in a cooperative manner when longer substrates are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c29">29</xref>). We and others have shown that hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; interact with hMutS&#x003b1; in an ATP-dependent manner, and that this interaction is DNA dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>). While ATP hydrolysis by MutL proteins is essential for MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c34">34</xref>), its role within the repair reaction is still unclear. MutL and its eukaryotic counterparts seem to signal mismatch recognition from MutS to downstream proteins &#x0005b;e.g. MutH and UvrD in bacterial MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c37">37</xref>)&#x0005d;. Therefore, MutL proteins have been suggested to be molecular matchmakers, coupling mismatch recognition by MutS to repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c38">38</xref>). The interaction of hMutS and hMutL proteins therefore plays a key role in the initiation of the human repair reaction. However, little is known about the precise contribution of the different ATPases or the protein domains involved in this interaction.</p><p>We have previously established an assay using DNA-coupled magnetic beads suitable to produce a specific, ATP- and DNA-length-dependent complex between hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL heterodimers in protein extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). It was the aim of this study to extend this assay to allow investigation of the protein properties contributing to this interaction. More specifically, we assessed the role of ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; in complex formation and evaluated the contribution of the hMutL subunits hMLH1, hPMS1 and hPMS2 to the interaction. For this aim, we over-expressed hMutL&#x003b1;, hMutL&#x003b2;, the hMutL subunits hMLH1, hPMS1 and hPMS2, as well as mutants of hMutL&#x003b1; and fragments of hMLH1 in 293T cells. We demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; is not necessary for complex formation, and that the interaction is conferred by the N-terminus of hMLH1, while the C-terminus is responsible for hMutL heterodimerisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies, reagents and cell lines</title><p>Poly(dI&#x000b7;dC) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), and ATP from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI were from NEB (Beverly, MA).

Briefly, 293T cells were spread in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks to 70&#x00025; confluency in 10 ml of medium 24 h prior to transfection. The medium was replaced 1 h before transfection. The suspension containing the calcium phosphate&#x02013;DNA precipitate (1 ml) was added to the cell medium. After 5 h, the transfection medium was replaced by fresh medium. Cells were harvested after 24 h and whole cell extracts were prepared.</p><p>Similar to nuclear extraction, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in four times the packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer &#x0005b;10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT&#x0005d;. The suspension was frozen at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C and thawed on ice for lysis. This suspension containing both nuclei and cytoplasmatic extract was supplemented with an identical volume of hypertonic buffer &#x0005b;10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 830 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, 34&#x00025; glycerol&#x0005d;.

Expression of the desired protein was verified by western blotting in comparison to extracts of untransfected 293T cells (negative control) and extracts of 293 or TK6 cells (expressing wild-type levels of MMR proteins) as a positive control. Nuclear extracts were prepared from untransfected 293, HeLa, TK6 and HCT-116 cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>).</p><p>Immunoprecipitations were carried out in a total volume of 500 &#x000b5;l containing protein extract, 50 mM TE pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1&#x00025; Triton-X, 5 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT and 1 &#x000b5;g of anti-hMLH1 G168-728 (Pharmingen). The incubation was kept at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h under agitation. Protein G agarose was added and the suspension kept at 4&#x000b0;C for 3 h under agitation. Supernatant was taken off and the agarose was washed three times with 500 &#x000b5;l of washing buffer (50 mM TE pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1&#x00025; Triton-X, 5 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT). Precipitated proteins were detached by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min and analysed by western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA substrates and preparation of DNA-coupled magnetic beads</title><p>The 81mer DNA substrates were produced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, a 200 bp homoduplex substrate was used for this work. This substrate was generated by amplification of a 200 bp fragment of the human hPMS2 cDNA. One of the primers was 5&#x02032;-labelled with biotin to allow binding to streptavidin-coupled beads. The following primers were used: biotin-5&#x02032;-gcgagctgagagctcgagtac-3&#x02032; (sense) and 5&#x02032;-gaaacttcaataagatccactccatagtcc-3&#x02032; (antisense). The amplificate was purified and coupled to Dynabeads streptavidin as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>).

Briefly, cell extract (150 &#x000b5;g protein) was incubated in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT and 1 &#x000b5;g of poly(dI&#x000b7;dC) in a total volume of 300 &#x000b5;l for 5 min at room temperature. For investigation of hMutL constructs expressed in 293T cells, 5 &#x000b5;g of this extract was diluted with 145 &#x000b5;g of HCT-116 nuclear extract. For each experiment, two identical samples from one master mix were prepared. Both samples were added to an aliquot of DNA-coupled beads and placed on ice. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. After 20 min incubation, ATP was added to one sample to produce a final concentration of 250 &#x000b5;M. After a further 5 min, the beads were collected with a magnet and the supernatant was taken off. To ensure complete removal of the supernatant, the cup was briefly centrifuged, the beads were again collected and residual buffer was taken off. The beads were then resuspended in 20 &#x000b5;l of elution buffer (700 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF and 0.5 mM DTT) and incubated for 5 min. The beads were collected and the supernatant stored for analysis. A second elution step was performed with 20 &#x000b5;l of elution buffer as above, only with 1000 mM NaCl. This elution was also analysed by western blotting and verified that ATP had taken effect, since it abolished hMutS&#x003b1; signals in this elution fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). Although this elution was always performed as a control, these data have been omitted in most figures. This assay produced a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in binding of hMutL heterodimers after ATP addition as evaluated by densitometric analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>The proteins were separated on 10 or 12.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels, followed by western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes and antibody detection using standard procedures. hMLH1 was detected with Pharmingen G168-728 except for the blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f8">8</xref> (top), which was detected with Oncogene Ab-1. Densitometric evaluation of the western blots was performed with GelScan 5.0 Software (BioSciTec, Frankfurt, Germany).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>200mer homoduplex DNA improves detection of the specific complex of hMutL&#x003b1; with hMutS&#x003b1;</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; bind to DNA substrates coupled to magnetic beads in an ATP-dependent manner only when hMutS&#x003b1; is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). This binding therefore represents a specific complex of hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; with hMutS&#x003b1; on DNA. This interaction is improved when substrate length is increased from the previously used 81mer DNA substrate to 200mer DNA. The longer DNA substrate is more efficient in retaining hMutS&#x003b1; in the presence of ATP and also recruits hMLH1 more efficiently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f1">1</xref>). The 200mer homoduplex therefore supports complex formation of hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL proteins better than the 81mer homoduplex, which is in agreement with previous findings showing that the interaction depends on DNA length and improves on longer substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>).</p><p>The hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL interaction does not depend on mismatched base pairs in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). Therefore, homoduplex DNA is suitable for the measurement of this interaction, though it is not the substrate of the repair reaction (see Discussion). Since homoduplexes are more easily generated and produced identical results as heteroduplexes in this assay whenever tested, we used the 200mer homoduplex in most of the following experiments. In cases when a contribution of mismatched base pairs to complex formation was possible, we performed additional experiments with heteroduplex substrates in parallel (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of hMutL&#x003b1; expressed in 293T cells with hMutS&#x003b1; can be assessed with HCT-116 nuclear extract</title><p>293T cells are deficient in heteroduplex repair because of the lack of hMutL&#x003b1;, which is not expressed due to <italic>hMLH1</italic> promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c42">42</xref>). Transfection of hMutL&#x003b1; restores MMR activity of 293T extracts, which has been utilised to study the effect of HNPCC-associated genetic changes of <italic>hMLH1</italic> on the MMR status <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c42">42</xref>). Since the concentration of hMutL&#x003b1; in extracts of transfected 293T cells drastically exceeds the biological concentration of this heterodimer observable in HeLa or TK6 extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f2">2</xref>), we diluted them with HCT-116 nuclear extract to reduce the hMutL&#x003b1; concentration to biological levels. HCT-116 cells are also deficient in hMutL proteins, and the interaction assay works well with this extract when hMutL&#x003b1; is supplemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). This procedure produced a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in binding of recominant hMutL&#x003b1;, which is comparable to the recruitment of endogenous hMutL&#x003b1; in HeLa extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f3">3</xref>). This approach therefore allows expression of any desired hMutL construct in 293T cells with subsequent examination of its interaction properties with hMutS&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; is not necessary for interaction</title><p>The presence of ATP is necessary for recruitment of hMutL&#x003b1; by hMutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c43">43</xref>). Both hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutS&#x003b1; are ATPases. This raises the question of which protein needs to bind or process ATP to start the interaction. The ATP concentration effecting hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL complex formation is identical to the ATP concentration altering DNA binding of hMutS&#x003b1; &#x0005b;1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>)&#x0005d;, suggesting a concerted process. It cannot be excluded, however, that the hMutL ATPase may also contribute to complex formation. To investigate whether hMutL&#x003b1; needs to hydrolyse ATP to join hMutS&#x003b1;, we generated a hMutL&#x003b1; mutant (designated hMutL&#x003b1;-mpEA) with one amino acid exchange in the ATPase domains of each of its subunits hMLH1 and hPMS2. Both exchanges (hMLH1 E34A and hPMS2 E41A) alter a conserved glutamate, which is homologous to <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL E29, to alanine. This glutamate positions a water molecule for a nucleophile attack on the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP, thus catalysing ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c44">44</xref>). The mutation to alanine abolishes ATP hydrolysis of MutL proteins and MMR in bacteria, yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c33">33</xref>).

The ATPase mutant interacted as efficiently with hMutS&#x003b1; as wild-type hMutL&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f4">4</xref>B), confirming that ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; is not necessary for ternary complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>hMutS&#x003b1; can recruit both hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; independently</title><p>Both hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; are recruited to the DNA by hMutS&#x003b1; after addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). To assess whether both heterodimers can be recruited only together or also bind individually, we transfected them separately into 293T cells. Both were strongly expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f2">2</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). No hPMS2 was detectable in hMutL&#x003b2;-transfected cells, while no hPMS1 was detectable in hMutL&#x003b1;-transfected cells, excluding contaminations with the respective hPMS partners.

To assess which hMutL subunits establish the interaction, we expressed and examined hMLH1, hPMS1 and hPMS2 individually. hMLH1 was as strongly expressed as when transfected with its heterodimeric partners (hMutL&#x003b1; or hMutL&#x003b2;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f2">2</xref>). While no hPMS2 was detectable in the extract of hMLH1-transfected cells, a weak co-expression of hPMS1 was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f2">2</xref>, lane 4, middle).

Neither extract contained hMLH1.</p><p>Performance of the interaction assay with these three individual hMutL subunits revealed that hMLH1 interacted efficiently with hMutS&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, hPMS1 and hPMS2 showed much weaker basic binding and a significantly attenuated ATP-promoted complex formation with hMutS&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8). Furthermore, supplementation of hMLH1 restored hPMS2 binding activity as well as its full ATP reactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>A, bottom, lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and 4). To exclude that the use of homoduplex DNA instead of a mismatched substrate caused the weak reaction of hPMS2, we compared its interaction with hMutS&#x003b1; on 81mer homoduplex versus heteroduplex DNA. hMutS&#x003b1; showed improved binding to the heteroduplex in the absence of ATP in the 1000 mM elution fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>B, bottom) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). Although hMutS&#x003b1; therefore clearly reacted to the presence of the mismatch, no difference in hPMS2 recruitment between homo- and heteroduplex substrates was detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>B, middle).</p></sec><sec><title>Only the N-terminus of hMLH1 confers interaction with hMutS&#x003b1;</title><p>Based on the finding that the interaction of hMutL proteins with hMutS&#x003b1; is predominantly conferred by hMLH1, we generated three fragments of hMLH1 to broadly determine which protein domains are essential for interaction.

This mutant has been described to be associated with HNPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c50">50</xref>), but has also been found as a common splicing variant in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c52">52</xref>), which raised the question of its pathogenicity. We have recently shown that this mutant is deficient in strand-specific MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c42">42</xref>). Expression resulted in an hMLH1 protein of the expected lower molecular mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f10">10</xref>A). This deletion mutant showed only very weak basic binding in the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL interaction assay, and did not react to ATP addition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f10">10</xref>B). Analogous to the experiment shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f6">6</xref>B, we verified that interaction of hMutL&#x003b1; &#x00394;9&#x0002f;10 indeed failed on heteroduplex substrates as well as homoduplex substrates (data not shown). This finding demonstrates that MMR fails at the early step of complex formation with hMutL&#x003b1; &#x00394;9&#x0002f;10.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The experimental investigation of the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL interaction is challenging since it only occurs under certain conditions (in the presence of ATP and a DNA duplex substrate of sufficient length). This restricts the use of classical approaches for protein interaction measurement like co-immunoprecipitation or GST fusion protein pulldown assays. For detailed characterisation of the interaction, it is most promising to capture hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL complexes on the matrix on which they form, the DNA. This has been attempted in several systems with bacterial, yeast and human proteins using either gel retardation assays or surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c55">55</xref>). In the present work, we show that a novel DNA binding assay we recently used for proving that hMutS&#x003b1; interacts with hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>) can be extended to investigate the interaction properties of diverse hMutL constructs expressed in 293T cells, providing a flexible tool for detailed characterisation of this interaction.</p><p>Both homoduplex and heteroduplex substrates efficiently support interaction in this assay, therefore binding to a mismatch was not a precondition for complex formation under the applied experimental conditions. The complexes arising on homoduplex DNA should not be competent to initiate repair since they have not detected a mismatched site. However, since no difference could be detected between complex formation on faulty and correct DNA substrates, interaction between hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL proteins may either be possible independently of the type of DNA substrate or hMutS&#x003b1; is (under the experimental conditions used) transferred artificially into a mode it can biologically only assume after encountering a mismatch. Either way, the use of homoduplex substrates does not flaw the general applicability of the assay for the examination of complex formation.</p><p>ATP hydrolysis is necessary for the processing of faulty DNA by MMR proteins, and MutL ATPase mutants deficient in ATP hydrolysis are defective in strand-specific MMR of bacteria, yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c34">34</xref>). However, the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL&#x003b1; interaction occurred under conditions which do not favour ATP hydrolysis (incubations on ice and at relatively low concentration of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). Furthermore, the interaction is not attenuated by the well characterised point mutation of hMutL&#x003b1;-mpEA, which blocks ATP hydrolysis of hMutL&#x003b1;. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis by hMutL&#x003b1; occurs downstream of the assembly of hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; on DNA. This finding supports previous experiments performed with purified proteins and gel-shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>). The possibility that binding of ATP by hMutL&#x003b1; (without hydrolysis) is a precondition of complex formation, however, cannot be excluded by these experiments.</p><p>Extensive evidence proves that neither hMSH6&#x0002f;hMSH3 nor hPMS1&#x0002f;hPMS2 are stable in the absence of their respective smaller heterodimeric partners hMSH2 and hMLH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c47">47</xref>). This is also illustrated by the observation that cell lines lacking hMSH2 or hMLH1 do not show significant protein levels of hMSH6&#x0002f;hMSH3 or hPMS1&#x0002f;hPMS2 either, even if their genes do not carry mutations. Consequently, we did not expect that transfection of hPMS1 or hPMS2 would yield sufficient protein for further investigations. To our surprise, a high expression of both subunits was achieved in our experiments. This was not attributable to a general stability of hPMS1 and hPMS2 in 293T cells, since this cell line also lacks endogenous hPMS proteins due to the absence of hMLH1. Rather, we assume that the degradation of hPMS proteins was not efficient enough to compete with the strong expression of the subunits in 293T cells after transfection. Nevertheless, hMLH1 exerted a stabilising effect, which became obvious when hPMS2 protein levels were compared in extracts of cells cotransfected either with the N-terminal or the C-terminal part of hMLH1. LC49 exhibited a stabilising effect and could co-precipitate hPMS2, which was not possible with LN56. The results demonstrate that the dimerisation domain of hMLH1 is located within its C-terminus, and that dimerisation with hMLH1 confers stability to hPMS2, confirming previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c57">57</xref>).</p><p>The individual expression of all hMutL subunits further enabled the investigation of their contributions to interaction with hMutS&#x003b1;. Since hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; interact not only in cell extracts, but also when used purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>), it can be concluded that the interaction is accomplished through a direct contact between both heterodimers. Only hMLH1 efficiently joined hMutS&#x003b1; on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, demonstrating that hMLH1 predominantly confers this interaction. Although our hMLH1 preparation contained a small amount of hPMS1, it was not hMutL&#x003b2; that produced this result, since hPMS1-free preparations of the N-terminal hMLH1-fragment LN56 also interacted (see below).</p><p>One caveat must be considered in the interpretation of these results: since both hPMS proteins were expressed in the absence of their stabilising partner hMLH1, misfolding may underlie the failure to accomplish interaction with hMutS&#x003b1;. Two important observations, however, disfavour this possibility. First, we expressed hPMS2 in the presence LC49, which conferred stabilisation of hPMS2. Although hPMS2 should therefore be correctly folded in LC49-hPMS2, this heterodimer was unable to interact efficiently with hMutS&#x003b1; either. Secondly, when hPMS2 was complemented with hMLH1, the reactivity of hPMS2 was fully restored: hPMS2 was folded correctly enough to re-establish an interacting hMutL&#x003b1; heterodimer with hMLH1. One can therefore state that the interaction of hMutS&#x003b1; with hMutL heterodimers is predominantly conferred by hMLH1. Nevertheless, the finding that the hPMS subunits have a very weak interacting ability suggests that PMS1 and PMS2 contact hMutS&#x003b1; once the complex has been established by hMLH1.</p><p>The examination of hMLH1 fragments revealed that its N-terminus is sufficient for interaction with hMutS&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f11">11</xref>). Based on considerations of crystal structures of MutL, the area between the loops L45 has been suggested to serve as interaction interface for MutS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg420f11">11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c44">44</xref>). The finding that hMLH1&#x00394;9&#x0002f;10 fails to interact suggests that exons 9 and 10 may incorporate a domain essential for complex formation. Although this deletion is distant from the loops that are homologous to L45, it does not disqualify this area as interaction transmitter, since it was also observed that formation of this interface depends on both nucleotide binding and N-terminal dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c44">44</xref>). Both functions are likely abolished in hMLH1&#x00394;9&#x0002f;10.</p><p>Since the N-terminus incorporates the ATPase domain as well as the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL&#x003b1; interaction domain, it is possible that the interaction may alter ATP processing by hMutL&#x003b1;, thus accomplishing signal transduction from hMutS&#x003b1; over hMutL&#x003b1; to downstream proteins.</p><p>If it is true that interaction and ATP processing of hMutL&#x003b1; are closely coupled, deletions in the ATPase domain may abolish interaction even while a putative interaction interface still is present. Another aspect complicates the precise localisation of the interacting region: as recently shown, the hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL interaction is DNA length dependent and fails on short DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c31">31</xref>). Additionally, MutL proteins bind single- and double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c58">58</xref>) and contain putative DNA binding domains within their N-terminal halves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c44">44</xref>). This is supported by our finding that LC49 did not show even basic binding to the DNA substrate. These observations strongly suggest that hMutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;hMutL&#x003b1; interaction depends on DNA binding by hMutL&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c30">30</xref>). Assuming that DNA binding by hMutL&#x003b1; is a precondition for complex formation, mutational inactivation of either the interaction interface or the DNA binding activity may result in an interaction failure. Further studies will be necessary to disentangle the mutual influences of hMLH1 domains concerned with DNA binding, ATP processing and hMutS&#x003b1; interaction.</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that both hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; interact with hMutS&#x003b1; on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c27">27</xref>). hMutL&#x003b2; could not be attributed with a role in <italic>in vitro</italic> MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c39">39</xref>), and its putative contribution to HNPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c59">59</xref>) has recently been refuted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg420c60">60</xref>). The findings of the present study show that hMutS&#x003b1; nonetheless strongly recruits hMutL&#x003b2; in the absence of hMutL&#x003b1;. Furthermore, hPMS1 has an intrinsic ability to bind hMutS&#x003b1; (which is, although being much weaker than that of hMLH1, stronger than that of hPMS2), suggesting a biological significance of this interaction. When both hMutL heterodimers are present, they may either together form quaternary complexes with hMutS&#x003b1; and DNA or distinct ternary complexes. Since both hMutL heterodimers bind predominantly by their hMLH1 subunit, it is likely that both heterodimers compete for binding to hMutS&#x003b1;. Further studies need to examine how many hMLH1 binding sites the hMutS&#x003b1; heterodimer has.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg420f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Complex formation of hMutL&#x003b1; with hMutS&#x003b1; on 200mer and 81mer DNA substrates.
