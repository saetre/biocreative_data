The methionyl-tRNA synthetases from Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli, for example, are shown to reject misactivated homocysteine rapidly by the pre-transfer route. A novel feature of this reaction is that homocysteine thiolactone is formed by the facile cyclisation of the homocysteinyl adenylate. Valyl-tRNA synthetases, on the other hand, reject the more readily activated non-cognate amino acids by primarily the post-transfer route. The features governing the choice of pathway are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3105"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3106"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3107"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3108"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3109"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3110"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3111"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3112"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3113"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3114"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3115"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3116"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00406-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3117"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
