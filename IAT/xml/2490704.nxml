Alternative splicing of CEACAM1 generates 11 different splice variants, which include 1&#x02013;4 ectodomains with either short or long cytoplasmic domain generated by the exclusion (CEACAM1-S) or inclusion (CEACAM1-L) of exon 7.

Furthermore, we have identified two regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements required for the alternative splicing of CEACAM1. Replacement of these regulatory elements by human &#x003b2;-globin exon sequences resulted in exon 7-skipped mRNA as the predominant product. Interestingly, while insertion of exon 7 in a &#x003b2;-globin reporter gene resulted in its skipping, exon 7 along with the flanking intron sequences recapitulated the alternative splicing of CEACAM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that a network of regulatory elements control the alternative splicing of CEACAM1. These findings may have important implications in therapeutic modalities of CEACAM1 linked human diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Alternative splicing is a process by which a single pre-mRNA can generate multiple mRNA isoforms by differential joining of 5' and 3' splice sites (ss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mapping of the human genome suggests that more than 70% of genes encode for transcripts that undergo alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and most alternative splicing events affect coding capacity of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Given the importance of mRNA splicing in gene expression, it is not surprising that ~50% of human genetic diseases may be caused by mutations of the splice junctions or auxiliary regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, sequencing of many cancer specific alternatively spliced genes has indicated that genomic mutations are not the only cause of aberrant splicing. In fact, deregulated expression of splicing factors has been shown to affect alternative splicing, which is often accompanied by a shift in the ratio of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, molecular strategies that modulate alternative splicing have been the focus of attention over last several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), also known as biliary glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or CD66a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It consists of N-terminal ectodomain, either two or four extracellular Ig-like domains, a conserved transmembrane domain, and either a short (12&#x02013;14 amino acids, CEACAM1-S) or long cytoplasmic domain (72&#x02013;74 amino acids, CEACAM1-L) generated due to the alternative splicing of CEACAM1 pre-mRNA. The inclusion of exon 7 in CEACAM1-L mRNA shifts the open reading frame resulting in the use of a distant stop codon and expression of a long cytoplasmic domain (72&#x02013;74 amino acids). On the other hand, exclusion of exon 7 produces a proximal stop codon thereby generating a shorter mRNA that translates into a short cytoplasmic domain (12&#x02013;14 amino acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The long cytoplasmic domain encodes two ITIMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) that bind SHP-1 when phosphorylated and convey inhibitory activities to CEACAM1-L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The short cytoplasmic domain has been shown to bind actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, and annexin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and is involved in lumen formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of human <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>gene and its alternative splicing into long and short cytoplasmic domain isoforms.</bold> Open boxes or lines represent exons and introns, respectively.

It is downregulated in various types of tumors such as colorectal carcinomas, hepatomas, breast carcinomas, and prostate carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], suggesting a tumor suppressive role for CEACAM1. Indeed, CEACAM1-L has been shown to possess tumor growth inhibitory activity when its gene is transfected and expressed in prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, CEACAM1-L decreases cell growth in response to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, tumor suppressive role of CEACAM1-L has been questioned by other findings. For example, the expression of CEACAM1-L is upregulated in primary lung carcinomas when compared with adjacent normal lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similarly, CEACAM1-L is expressed abundantly in several human colon and thyroid carcinoma cell lines (this study and see ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). Importantly, in contrast to previously held notion that the long cytoplasmic domain isoform of CEACAM1 possesses tumor suppressive properties, we recently showed that forced expression of CEACAM1-S revert the malignant mammary epithelial cell line MCF7, which expresses low levels of CEACAM1-L, to a normal acinar morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Together, these studies raise the possibility that an optimal ratio of CEACAM1 S:L splice variants may be important for maintaining normal cell function. This is consistent with a study in rodents where optimal ratios of CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain splice variants have been found to be essential for inhibiting colonic tumor cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we set out to answer three important questions: 1) Do CEACAM1 transcripts undergo alternative splicing in a tissue specific manner? 2) Is splicing of CEACAM1 altered in breast cancer? and 3) What are the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element(s) in exon 7 that regulate CEACAM1 alternative splicing in two different cytoplasmic domain isoforms? Here we show that the ratios of CEACAM1 splice variants vary significantly among a variety of normal human tissues and cell lines derived from human tumors. We further demonstrate that compared to normal tissues, the ratios of CEACAM1 short to long cytoplasmic domain splice variants vary significantly in breast cancer specimens. Finally, we report the identification of two regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that control the alternative splicing of CEACAM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CEACAM1 long and short cytoplasmic domain splice variants are expressed differentially in normal human tissues</title><p>Alternative splicing of CEACAM1 generates two cytoplasmic domain splice variants that differ by the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As a first step towards understanding the relationship between altered splicing of CEACAM1 transcripts and neoplasia, we decided to examine the expression of CEACAM1 long and short cytoplasmic domain splice variants in a variety of human tissues. Total RNAs from normal human tissues (brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung and prostate) were subjected to RT-PCR with primers that were designed to specifically co-amplify CEACAM1-L (408-bp) and CEACAM1-S (355-bp) mRNA splice variants.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> demonstrates that colon, liver, lung and prostate co-expressed CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S splice variants. While liver and prostate expressed higher levels of CEACAM1-S splice variant, colon and lung expressed more of the CEACAM1-L splice variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, compare lanes 2, 5, 6 and 7). In contrast, brain, heart and kidney almost exclusively expressed the CEACAM1-L splice variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, cf. lanes 1, 3 and 4). Even more striking are the differences between the ratios of CEACAM1-S and CEACAM1-L splice variants. For example, although colon, liver, lung and prostate expressed both cytoplasmic domain isoforms of CEACAM1, the S:L ratio in liver is significantly higher than other tissues. Quantitation of the data shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> indicate that the ratio of S:L splice variants in liver is 2, 5 and 8-fold higher than in prostate, colon and lung, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CEACAM1 is differentially expressed in normal human tissues.</bold> (A) Schematic diagram of RT-PCR strategy for the identification of CEACAM1 long and short cytoplasmic domain splice variants.

The rationale for choosing these cell lines was based on the fact that CEACAM1 has been extensively studied in colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, cell lines derived from these tissues should serve as model system for assessing whether altered CEACAM1 splicing is associated with cancer. Since very little is known about the role of CEACAM1 in brain cancer, we also examined the expression of CEACAM1 in three human malignant glioma cell lines, U87MG, U251T and T98G. Glioma is a rapidly fatal cancer in which the search for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important.</p><p>The results of the RT-PCR assay shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> demonstrate marked differences in the expression of CEACAM1 long and short cytoplasmic domain splice variants. Human malignant glioma cell lines T98G and U87MG mainly expressed the CEACAM1-L splice variant. Although U251T cells expressed relatively lower levels of CEACAM1-L, the S:L ratio in these cells (0.24) is significantly higher compared to T98G (0.06) and U87MG (0.05) cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> cf. lanes 1&#x02013;3 and see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Colon cancer cell lines, with the exception of HT29 and S1, expressed for the most part short cytoplasmic domain splice variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> cf. lanes 8&#x02013;12). The results with breast and prostate cancer cell lines were somewhat mixed. While breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB468 and ZR75 expressed both splice variants, BT474 cells expressed only the short splice variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> cf. lanes 4&#x02013;7). The observation that MCF7 cells barely expressed CEACAM1 is consistent with our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Among the prostate cancer cell lines examined, PC3 and DU-145 expressed both the short and long cytoplasmic domain splice variants of CEACAM1: DU-145 cells expressed more of the short splice variant, PC3 cells largely expressed the long splice variant, and LNCaP cells expressed only the short splice variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> cf. lanes 13&#x02013;15).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The expression profile of CEACAM1 in human cancer cell lines. </bold>(A) Total RNAs from the indicated cell lines were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR as described in Figure 2.

For example, normal colon co-expressed both splice variants with S:L ratio of 0.67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, colon cancer cell lines expressed elevated levels of short splice variant with S:L ratios ranging between ~1.6&#x02013;21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The observed S:L splice variant ratio in PC3 (0.2) and DU-145 (2.3) cells was different compared to normal prostate (1.7). Since LNCaP cells expressed only the short splice variant, a direct comparison of the S:L ratio between normal prostate and this cell line was not possible. Unlike normal brain tissue that exhibited only CEACAM1-L splice variant, malignant glioma cell lines expressed both splice variants with significant differences between S:L ratios (compare lane 1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> with lanes 1&#x02013;3 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These data indicate that S:L splice variant ratio in U251T cells is 3.6 and 4.1-fold higher than T98G and U87MG cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Altered splicing of CEACAM1 exon 7 and breast cancer</title><p>The results presented in the previous section suggest that CEACAM1 is differentially expressed in various human tissues and apparently alteration in the splicing pattern of CEACAM1 is linked to tumorigenesis. To extend this study further and to ascertain that altered splicing of CEACAM1 mRNA is linked to tumorigenesis, we isolated total RNAs from a number of breast cancer tissues that were deposited in the City of Hope tissue bank. These tissues were surgically removed from patients who were between the ages of 31&#x02013;64 and had not undergone chemotherapy or radiation treatment prior to surgery.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, CEACAM1 mRNA splice variants in which exon 7 was excluded accounted for most of the spliced transcripts in normal tissues (see lanes N1 and N2). Quantitation of these data demonstrate that the ratios of S:L cytoplasmic domain splice variants range between ~15&#x02013;17. In contrast, breast cancer specimens displayed expression of both short and the long cytoplasmic domain splice variants of CEACAM1 with a marked decrease in the ratio of S:L. Unlike normal tissues, the S:L splice variant ratios in breast cancer specimens varied from 1.0 to 7.8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The combined results from normal human tissues, cancer cell lines and breast cancer specimens suggest that alteration of CEACAM1 splicing could be a common feature of breast cancer and an optimal ratio between the short and the long cytoplasmic domain splice variants might be required for normal tissue function.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>CEACAM1 pre-mRNA splicing is altered in breast cancer.</bold> (A) CEACAM1 splicing pattern in ten breast cancer specimens (1&#x02013;10) and two normal-appearing (N1 and N2) breast tissues is shown.

To test whether a CEACAM1 minigene could recapitulate exon 7 alternative splicing, we PCR amplified a CEACAM1 cassette comprising exons 6, 7 and 8, along with the entire intervening intronic sequences from human genomic DNA.

After 24 h, total RNAs were extracted and the relative abundances of CEACAM1-S and L splice variant mRNAs were estimated by RT-PCR with primers that were designed to amplify specifically the transcripts derived from minigene. We found that CAM 6-7-8 minigene mimics the splicing profile of endogenous CEACAM1 transcripts in both cell lines, albeit with some differences in the ratios of short and long splice variants (compare lane 4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> with lanes 5 and 7 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Splicing profile of CAM 6-&#x003b2;g-8 transcripts in MDA-MB468 and ZR75 cell lines gave rise to spliced mRNAs lacking middle exon, suggesting that exon 7 contains regulatory element(s) that are required for its splicing (see lane 5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the exon 7 sequences that contribute to its splicing, we constructed two minigenes in which first (E7.1 region) or the last 20 nucleotides (E7.2 region) were replaced by sequences of human &#x003b2;-globin exon 2 to yield CAM 6-E7.1&#x003b2;g-8 and CAM 6-E7.2&#x003b2;g-8, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

In contrast, CAM 6-E7.2&#x003b2;g-8 pre-mRNA gave rise to small but reproducible inclusion of middle exon in MDA-MB468 cell line, but only exon skipped mRNA in ZR75 (see lane 7 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These data imply that exonic sequences in the immediate vicinity of the 5' and 3' ss play an important role in the splicing of exon 7.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulatory elements in exon 7 and flanking intronic sequences are important for controlling CEACAM1 alternative splicing</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism of exon 7 splicing regulation we tested the splicing of CEACAM1 exon 7 in a heterologous context in complete absence of flanking exons, but either lacking or containing majority of the flanking intron sequences. To this end, we cloned CEACAM1 exon 7 without (&#x003b2;g-&#x00394;iE7-&#x003b2;g) or with (&#x003b2;g-E7-&#x003b2;g) the flanking intron sequences between two constitutive &#x003b2;-globin exons of the pDUP5-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Minigene &#x003b2;g-&#x00394;iE7-&#x003b2;g consists entirely of &#x003b2;-globin-derived sequences, with the exception of 53 nucleotides of exon 7 that replaced the central exon. On the other hand, minigene &#x003b2;g-E7-&#x003b2;g contains entire exon 7 and the flanking intron sequences with the exception of 5' and 3' ss of exon 6 and 8, respectively. These reporters were transiently expressed in MDA-MB468 and ZR75 cells and after 24 h total RNA was isolated followed by RT-PCR with vector specific primers. Consistent with a previously published report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], DUP5-1 generated transcripts gave rise to constitutively spliced mRNA in both cell lines as evident by the formation of ~600 bp product (see lane 4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The splicing of &#x003b2;g-&#x00394;iE7-&#x003b2;g transcripts also produced a single mRNA species with a molecular size of ~500 bp. Since the expected size of exon 7 included mRNAs is ~600 bp, the observed ~500 bp product is indicative of exon 7 skipping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, cf. lane 5). To verify that the splicing of &#x003b2;g-&#x00394;iE7-&#x003b2;g pre-mRNA resulted in exon 7 skipped mRNA, ~500 bp band was excised and subjected to DNA sequencing. Examination of sequencing results (data not shown) confirmed that &#x003b2;g-&#x00394;iE7-&#x003b2;g pre-mRNA gave rise to exon 7-skipped mRNA in both cell lines. Interestingly, in both cell lines the splicing of &#x003b2;g-E7-&#x003b2;g transcripts gave rise to mRNAs with or without exon 7, suggesting that the flanking intron sequences play a vital role in the regulation of CEACAM 1 alternative splicing (see lane 6, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). To confirm that these mRNAs were not generated due to cryptic splice site activation, the identity of each mRNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). We conclude that sequences residing in exon 7 as well as flanking introns are required for the regulation of CEACAM1 alternative splicing.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Regulatory elements in Exon 7 and flanking intronic sequences are important for controlling CEACAM1 alternative splicing.</bold> (A) The DUP5-1 minigene shown here contains three exons and two introns derived from human &#x003b2;-globin gene and is essentially identical to previously described version [46] except that vector backbone is pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His(-) C.

Although the role of CEACAM1 as a tumor suppressor gene in colon and prostate has been investigated in great detail, its exact role in breast cancer is less well defined. For example, while downregulation of CEACAM1 gene has been suggested to contribute to the development of &#x0003e;90% of colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the lack of CEACAM1 expression account for ~30% of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In fact, we have recently shown that forced expression of CEACAM1-S in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF7, which only expresses a small amount of the long splice variant, reverts the growth of these cells to a normal acinar morphology in 3D culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, it appears that restoration of expression of the short splice variant is important for the normal function of breast epithelial cells. This idea is supported by the analysis of short and long splice variants in normal breast tissue where the ratio of S:L was ~15&#x02013;16. In the case of breast cancers, the ratio of S:L was between 1.0 to 7.8, but never reached the level found in normal breast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, the increased expression of the long splice variant may be a prognostic indicator for breast cancer. However, it should be noted that this study was performed at the mRNA level and requires further examination of the protein level, an analysis that requires the use of isoform-specific antibodies.</p><p>The importance of the expression of the short cytoplasmic domain splice variant in normal breast requires some thought, since it is the long splice variant that contains two ITIMs which are expected to convey inhibitory functions. Indeed, this is the case for T-cells, where the long isoform is exclusively expressed and its presence inhibits T-cell proliferation and release of IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The absence of inhibitory motifs or association with inhibitory molecules would seem to predict that the short splice variant would not act as a tumor suppressor, but instead, it appears that the opposite is true. For example, CEACAM1 is a negative prognosticator in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and we have found that only the long cytoplasmic domain splice variant is expressed in this cancer (unpublished results). Thus, CEACAM1 splice variants may act in a tissue specific manner where the context of cell signaling may be very different from one cell or tissue to another. Furthermore, the association of the short splice variant with the cytoskeleton may be a key factor, since abnormalities in the cytoskeleton are a common defect in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>In consideration of a role for different ratios of the short and long cytoplasmic domain splice variants, a recent study has shown in hepatocytes and polarized kidney cells that the long isoforms are shuttled to cell-cell boundaries and the short isoforms to the luminal surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the two types of isoforms have distinct roles in tissue organization. Indeed, we find that forced expression of the short isoform in MCF7 cells grown in 3D culture leads to expression at the luminal surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It can be speculated that alteration of physiologically important ratios of S:L isoforms would disrupt epithelial cell polarization, which is a hallmark of epithelial cell cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon that expands the size of human proteome and generates proteins with functionally diverse properties. A number of human genes employ alternative splicing to express physiologically important levels of mRNA isoforms that play a crucial role in cell homeostasis. In fact, several recent studies have indicated that a slight change in the delicate balance of mRNA splice variants is associated with human genetic diseases and various forms of cancer (reviewed in Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the alternative splicing of genes associated with human diseases are not fully understood.</p><p>Previous studies aimed at understanding the function of human CEACAM1 for most part examined the expression of CEACAM1-L mRNA or protein without taking into account the potential contribution of short cytoplasmic domain splice variant or effect of the ratios between the long and short cytoplasmic domain splice variants. Here in this study, we find that the pattern of CEACAM1 splicing and the ratios of S:L splice variants vary in a variety of normal human tissues. Importantly, compared to normal tissues, alterations in the ratios of CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain isoforms are observed in cancer cell lines and breast cancer specimens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In an effort to identify <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements that control the alternative splicing of CEACAM1, we constructed a series of minigenes and examined their splicing by transiently transfecting two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB468 and ZR75. We observed that substitution of &#x003b2;-globin exon 2 sequences for exon 7 (without changing the size of the exon) resulted in the skipping of middle exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, cf lane 5). Likewise, replacement of the first or the last 20 residues in exon 7 by the corresponding &#x003b2;-globin exon 2 sequences failed to prevent exon skipping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, see lanes 6&#x02013;7). These data suggest the presence of regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that promote exon 7 splicing. However, skipping of exon 7 in the context of a &#x003b2;-globin reporter construct indicate that additional regulatory elements within the flanking introns contribute to the splicing of exon 7 (see lane 5 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Support to this interpretation comes from the observation that &#x003b2;-globin reporter (&#x003b2;g-E7-&#x003b2;g) comprising of exon 7 and flanking intron sequences recapitulate the alternative splicing of CEACAM1 in both breast cancer cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lane 6). Together these data strongly suggest that a complex regulatory network involving interactions between sequence elements in exon 7 and the flanking introns may be required for the splicing of exon 7. Clearly, a detailed experimental analysis will be required to map the regulatory elements necessary for the splicing of CEACAM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study was undertaken to better understand the relationship between CEACAM1 expression and neoplasia. Our results show that CEACAM1 is expressed in a tissue dependent manner with significant differences in the ratios of its short (CEACAM1-S) and long (CEACAM1-L) cytoplasmic domain splice variants. Our data in human breast cancer show a higher ratio of S:L in normal versus malignant tissues, raising the possibility that tumor suppressive role of CEACAM1 may actually depend on which isoform is dominant. In addition, we have identified two <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements required for the regulation of CEACAM1 splicing into long or the short cytoplasmic domain isoforms. These sequences could serve as a target to modulate CEACAM1 alternative splicing, which may have important therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>All DNA constructs were generated by standard cloning procedures and confirmed by sequencing. The minigene-splicing cassette CAM 6-7-8 was constructed by amplifying human genomic sequences from exon 6 to exon 8 with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers #40563 (5'-AAAAAAAA<underline>GCTAGC</underline>CTCGAGATAATGCTCTACCACAAGAAAATGG-3') and #41658 (5'-AACTGCAG<underline>AAGCTT</underline>CCTTGTTAGGTG-3'). The underline sequences represent NheI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. The PCR amplified DNA was digested with NheI and HindIII (New England Biolabs) and cloned into pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His(-) C (Invitrogen). The CAM 6-&#x003b2;g-8 minigene was engineered by two-step overlapping PCR approach using CAM 6-7-8 minigene as template. In the first step, the upstream and the downstream portions of the minigene were generated by using primers # 40563 and #45361 (5'-AAAGAACCTCTGGGTCCAAGGGTAGACCACCAGCAGCCTAAATAAATATCAGAAACTGTG-3') and primers #41658 and #45360 (5'-TTGGACCCAGAGGTTCTTTGAGTCCTTTGGGGATCGTAAGTAAAGCCACTTACCC-3'), respectively. The first step PCR products were used as template for the overlapping PCR with primers #40563 and #41658. The amplified fragment was digested with NheI and HindIII, gel purified, and ligated to pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His(-) C linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes.

The glioma cell lines U251T, T98G and U87MG and colon cancer cell lines HT29, HCT116 (-/+ p53), S1 and HCC2998 were kind gifts from Drs. John Shively and Y. Yen (City of Hope). The breast cancer cell lines, with the exception of MDA-MB468, are ER positive, express HER2/neu, and were derived from metastatic sites. The prostate cancer cell lines used in this study are metastatic. While LNCaP is hormone sensitive, PC3 and DU-145 lines are hormone-refractory. The human glioma cell lines U251T is the tumorigenic strain of U251. The line U87MG is derived from malignant gliomas and unlike T98G it is considered to be tumorigeneic. The human colon cancer cell lines HT29, HCT116 and HCC2998 are tumorigenic. The S1 is a human colon cancer cell line derived from the S1 clone of tumorigenic LS-180 colon carcinoma cell line. These cell lines were culture in ATCC recommended cultured conditions using following growth mediums (RPMI 1640, MEM containing 2% glutamine, DMEM with high glucose or McCoy's medium) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific Inc., CA) at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified air containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection, RNA isolation and RT-PCR</title><p>A day prior to transfection, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>MDA-MB468 or ZR75 cells were seeded on a 6 well plate.

The breast tumors of all of the treated patients were removed by complete surgical resection at City of Hope and a written consent was received from patients or family members. The institutional review board approved the research protocol. The clinical history of breast cancer specimens is detailed below. The specimen no. 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 are invasive ductal adenocarcinoma; 2 and 8 ductal carcinoma; and remainder designated as breast carcinoma. All of the ten patients showed lymph node metastases of breast cancer and tumors were moderate-to-poorly differentiated.
