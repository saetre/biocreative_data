These rhythms are generated by a self-sustained molecular clock, which is largely conserved between fruit flies and mammals and synchronizes to the day/night cycle. This synchronization is achieved in most organisms by a daily resetting caused by light and/or temperature fluctuations. The molecular mechanisms underlying light synchronization are reasonably well understood, but an understanding of how temperature affects the circadian clock is lacking. This study demonstrates a striking and unanticipated relationship between light and temperature resetting mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. An interaction between the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) and a complex composed of the key circadian regulators PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) are critical for circadian temperature responses as well a circadian light responses. Moreover, the data not only indicate that light and temperature reset the clock through similar mechanisms but also that these two inputs can act synergistically. An interaction between light and temperature may fine-tune the dawn and dusk response of the clock and even contribute to seasonal adaptation of clock function, an emerging area of research in circadian biology.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Temperature-dependent changes in circadian rhythms are mediated by interactions between the photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) and the proteins period (PER) and timeless (TIM).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kaushik R, Nawathean P, Busza A, Murad A, Emery P, et al.

An admittedly simplified view of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central clock posits a core system of four interacting regulatory proteins. A circadian cycle begins when a CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) heterodimer activates the expression of two other proteins, PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM). PER and TIM levels slowly accumulate over time, and these two proteins also heterodimerize. At some point, PER-TIM complexes enter the nucleus and inactivate CLOCK-CYCLE activity, slowing their own production and signaling the end of a cycle. Importantly, kinases and phosphatases modify PER, TIM, and CLK and play critical roles in circadian rhythms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Endogenous periods are usually different from the precise 24-h rotation of Earth. Nonetheless, circadian clocks keep precise 24-h time under normal conditions and are reset every day by environmental signals like light and temperature, which are the dominant entraining cues in nature. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> circadian light perception is well-understood, and a major fraction of it is mediated by the circadian photoreceptor molecule cryptochrome (CRY) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

The heat-induced phase delays that take place in a wild-type strain are paralleled by a physical interaction between CRY and PER-TIM.

Heat-induced phase delays take place in a wild-type strain, and they are severely reduced in the <italic>cry</italic> loss-of-function mutant <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic>. Moreover, there is a physical interaction between CRY and PER-TIM at circadian times that correspond to phase delays. More robust heat-mediated phase delays and even phase advances occur in <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> mutant flies. The <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> behavioral results are mirrored by CRY:PERL-TIM interactions, which occur in the advance zone and also in response to 30 &#x000b0;C temperature pulses. <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> phase shifts like wild-type phase shifts are severely reduced by the addition of <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> to the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> background. These <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic>; <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> double mutant flies also have largely restored temperature compensation, indicating that an interaction between CRY and PER-TIM is responsible for the loss of temperature compensation in the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> strain as well as for heat-mediated phase shifts of wild-type as well as <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> flies. The similarity between heat-mediated and light-mediated phase shifts suggests that light and temperature can synergize to cause phase shifts, and an experiment in wild-type flies supports this notion.</p><p>The temperature-induced complex formation between CRY and PER-TIM parallels the substantial evidence that a similar interaction is critical for light-mediated phase shifts. Biochemical as well as genetic data indicate that complex formation between light-activated CRY and TIM, or between light-activated CRY and PER-TIM, leads to TIM degradation, which is believed to advance or delay the clock (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;). Although some data indicate a physical interaction between CRY and PER, most observations indicate that physical contact is predominantly between CRY and TIM; for example, PER usually requires the presence of TIM to interact with CRY, but a TIM:CRY interaction can take place without PER (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). Because much of TIM is in complex with PER, especially in the early night &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, a CRY-TIM interaction is effectively a CRY:PER-TIM interaction. All of this begins with CRY photon capture, which activates CRY by causing a conformational change and a subsequent interaction with PER-TIM. Indeed, experimental studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY as well on other related proteins provide a coherent view of a CRY-centric light-initiation event &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although a connection between light pulse&#x02013; and heat pulse&#x02013;initiated interactions appeared enigmatic, previous studies in wild-type flies suggested that heat phase shifts are like light pulses and are due to posttranscriptional events that influence PER and/or TIM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The failure to elicit a phase shift with a 34 &#x000b0;C pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g001">Figure 1</xref>) indicates that a heat shock may be required &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. This is accompanied by numerous changes in cell physiology and gene expression, which could perturb the dynamics of an oscillatory system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. However, <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> flies show robust phase shifts and CRY:PER-TIM complex formation after a 30 &#x000b0;C heat pulse, making it unlikely that a heat-shock response is generally required for heat pulse&#x02013;mediated phase shifts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Extrapolation to wild-type flies makes two assumptions: (i) <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> flies do not have an unprecedented heat-shock response triggered at much lower temperatures and (ii) the failure to observe 30 &#x000b0;C behavioral phase shifts and biochemical interactions in wild-type reflects quantitative rather than a qualitative differences between 30 &#x000b0;C and 37 &#x000b0;C and between wild-type and <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> genotypes. Indeed, the convergence of light and temperature on wild-type fly behavior at physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) suggests that these CRY:PER-TIM interactions are normally difficult to detect at lower temperatures, because they are quantitatively minor.</p><p>The <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> behavioral and biochemical results indicate that the missense mutation causes a large increase in the fraction of PERL-TIM interacting with CRY at normal temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This suggests that the PERL-TIM structure is temperature sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), an interpretation consistent with the period of the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic>; <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> double mutant strain being somewhat temperature sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; see below).

These experiments cannot definitively rule out CRY as the temperature-sensitive component; in this case, the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> mutation would only cause an increased interaction between PER-TIM and CRY. In either case, the close correspondence between the 37 &#x000b0;C <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> heat and light PRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) indicates that the CRY photocycle is inessential for CRY:PER-TIM interactions and behavioral phase shifts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We speculate that heat activation of PER-TIM causes the same CRY conformational change as does light&#x02014;albeit indirectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>The heat-induced interactions between PERL-TIM and CRY as well as the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic>; <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> phenotype make a strong link between the circadian response to temperature pulses and incubations at constant temperatures, analogous to nonparametric and parametric light entrainment, respectively. This is because a persistent CRY:PERL-TIM interaction affects the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> period like the enhanced phase-shift response of <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> to a heat pulse. This recalls the hypersensitivity of <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> to incubation at constant low light intensities, which lengthen the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> period more severely and at lower intensities than is required to lengthen wild-type periods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050146-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results explain this observation and suggest that the more CRY-interactive PERL-TIM requires less CRY light activation than does wild-type PER-TIM. Moreover, the similarities between light and heat inspired the experiment suggesting that light and temperature function together, even on wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050146-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).
