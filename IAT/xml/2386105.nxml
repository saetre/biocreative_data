Subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with the endolysosomal network leads to hydrolytic degradation of the sequestered material. This process provides eukaryotic cells with a mechanism for cytoplasmic renewal by which they can rid themselves of defective organelles and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2005</xref>). In addition, nonselective autophagy can be induced to high levels by starvation, providing an internal source of nutrients on which cells can survive extended periods of nutrient deprivation. Conversely, under some circumstances autophagy may be used as a killing mechanism, acting as an alternative or augmentation to apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neufeld and Baehrecke, 2008</xref>). As autophagy has been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration, tumorigenesis, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang and Klionsky, 2007</xref>), better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling autophagy and identification of pharmacological regulators of this process are important goals.</p><p>Wortmannin and 3-methyladenine are well established inhibitors of autophagy. These compounds are broad-spectrum phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI(3))&#x02013;kinase inhibitors that disrupt autophagy by inhibiting Vps34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petiot et al., 2000</xref>), the enzymatic component of a multiprotein complex which also includes Vps15, Beclin1/Atg6, UVRAG, and Bif-1 in mammals and Vps15, Atg6, and Atg14 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mari and Reggiori, 2007</xref>). Localized production of PI(3) phosphate (PI(3)P) by Vps34 can act to recruit proteins containing FYVE and PX domains to specific membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindmo and Stenmark, 2006</xref>). In yeast, this Vps34 complex is critical for recruiting autophagy-related (Atg) proteins to the preautophagosomal structure, the yeast-specific site of autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>). The role of PI(3)P in autophagosome biogenesis is less well understood in higher eukaryotes, and whether it functions at the autophagosomal, the donor, or another membrane has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pattingre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Vps34 is also required more broadly for several vesicular trafficking processes that may have indirect impacts on autophagy. These include sorting of hydrolytic enzymes to the lysosome/vacuole and early steps in the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindmo and Stenmark, 2006</xref>). In mammalian cells, autophagosomes have been shown to fuse with early or late endosomes before fusion with lysosomes, resulting in intermediate structures known as amphisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eskelinen, 2005</xref>). Recently, mutations in components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex, which is required for the transition from early to late (multivesicular) endosomes, have been shown to block autophagy by inhibiting autophagosome-endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rusten et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the effect of PI(3)-kinase inhibitors on autophagy may be due, in part, to these more general trafficking functions of Vps34.</p><p>Recent work has shown that Vps34 can also function in a nutrient-sensing pathway upstream of the target of rapamycin (TOR) in several mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Byfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nobukuni et al., 2005</xref>). Disruption of Vps34 activity with blocking antibodies or siRNA was found to inhibit activation of TOR by insulin, amino acids, and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Byfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nobukuni et al., 2005</xref>). As TOR signaling inhibits autophagy, these findings are at odds with the conserved role of Vps34 in promoting autophagy under starvation conditions, suggesting that distinct complexes or pools of Vps34 may be subject to different modes of regulation.</p><p>In this paper, we address how these multiple potential roles of Vps34 are coordinated to regulate autophagy in an intact organism, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Our findings suggest that despite a critical role for Vps34 in endocytic uptake and recycling, its primary function in autophagy in vivo is limited to its direct role at the nascent autophagosome. We further show that Vps34 is not required for TOR activity in this system and that starvation results in a TOR/Atg1-dependent recruitment of Vps34 activity to the autophagosomal membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of null and hypomorphic <italic>Vps34</italic> mutants</title><p>A single representative of each of the three classes of PI(3)-kinase is present in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The class III PI(3)-kinase orthologue (referred to previously as Pi3K_59F and herein as Vps34) shows greatest similarity to human Vps34 (hVps34) in the kinase domain, with an overall identity of 37 and 57% to Vps34 proteins in yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Linassier et al., 1997</xref>). Previous work has shown that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Vps34 displays substrate specificity for PtdIns, with high sensitivity to wortmannin and nonionic detergent as is characteristic of this class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Linassier et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Vps34</italic> transcripts are expressed widely during development and in adult flies, with expression in the larval fat body and relative enrichment in neuronal and gut tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To generate loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>Vps34</italic> gene, we established isogenic homozygous-viable stocks of the <italic>P</italic> element line NP1626 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>) inserted in the <italic>Vps34</italic> 5&#x02032; untranslated region. Transposase-mediated excision of this element generated several lines that displayed hemizygous larval lethality in trans to a deficiency for this region, Df(2R)bw5. By PCR analysis, we identified an excision line that contains a deletion extending 3,349 bases downstream of the <italic>P</italic> element insertion site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In this line, <italic>&#x00394;m22</italic>, the entire <italic>Vps34</italic> coding region is eliminated, thus resulting in a presumptive null allele. In addition, other lines displaying full or partially penetrant lethality were found to contain partial remnants of the excised <italic>P</italic> element (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and likely represent hypomorphic <italic>Vps34</italic> alleles, as in the case of <italic>ex32</italic>. As expected, <italic>Vps34</italic> transcripts were undetectable by RT-PCR in <italic>&#x00394;m22</italic> mutants and were reduced in <italic>ex32</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To confirm that these lesions specifically affect the <italic>Vps34</italic> locus, we used the GAL4&#x02013;UAS system to ubiquitously express a wild-type <italic>Vps34</italic> transgene in mutant animals, resulting in a complete rescue of lethality (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Reagents to disrupt and monitor Vps34 function in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</bold> (A) Map of the <italic>Vps34</italic> locus, showing the location and extent of the <italic>&#x00394;m22</italic> deletion.

To assay Vps34 function in mutant cells, we used a transgenic UAS line expressing EGFP fused to two tandem copies of the FYVE domain from the early endosomal protein Hrs (GFP-2xFYVE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</xref>). For these experiments, we assayed GFP-2xFYVE distribution in FLP-FRT&#x02013;generated clones of <italic>Vps34</italic> mutant cells, which are marked by the loss of a UAS-driven dsRed marker. This system allows side-by-side comparison of mutant and wild-type cells within the same animal. In wild-type fat body cells, GFP-2xFYVE localized primarily to vesicular structures in the perinuclear region, with additional punctate staining occurring at low levels throughout the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). In contrast, GFP-2xFYVE staining was diffuse in <italic>&#x00394;m</italic>22 mutant cells, with no perinuclear localization and few or no apparent punctate structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the <italic>&#x00394;m22</italic> deletion specifically eliminates <italic>Vps34</italic> expression, resulting in a cell-autonomous loss of function.</p><p>As a complement to these mutations in the endogenous <italic>Vps34</italic> gene, we also generated UAS-regulated transgenic lines that express <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Vps34 containing point mutations in conserved residues of the kinase domain (referred to as Vps34<sup>KD</sup>). Analogous mutations in yeast and mammalian Vps34 result in a kinase-defective protein with dominant-inhibitory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Row et al., 2001</xref>). Coexpression of Vps34<sup>KD</sup> with GFP-2xFYVE in FLP-FRT&#x02013;generated fat body clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Britton et al., 2002</xref>) resulted in diffuse GFP-2xFYVE localization similar to the deletion mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), which is consistent with a disruption of Vps34 activity in Vps34<sup>KD</sup>-expressing cells. Incubation of dissected fat body with the PI(3)K inhibitor 3-methyladenine also caused a similar defect in GFP-2xFYVE localization (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712051/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712051/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Although Vps34 has been localized to several distinct subcellular compartments in different cell types and experimental systems, its highest levels of activity are typically found in the early endosome, and GFP-2xFYVE is commonly used as an early endosomal marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>). To test whether the perinuclear localization of GFP-2xFYVE in the fat body reflects the early endosomal compartment in this cell type, we examined the localization of other early endosomal markers. Both Hrs and Rab5-GFP displayed a similar perinuclear pattern which overlapped with GFP-2xFYVE or myc-2xFYVE and which was disrupted in <italic>&#x00394;m22</italic> mutant cells and in cells expressing Vps34<sup>KD</sup> (Fig. S1). We also found that the GFP-2xFYVE&#x02013;labeled compartment was readily accessible to the endocytic tracer Texas Red (TR) avidin (see subsequent sections). In contrast, no colocalization was observed between GFP-2xFYVE and the Golgi marker p120 nor the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Lamp1 (Fig. S2). We conclude that Vps34 activity is concentrated in a perinuclear endosomal compartment in larval fat body cells. Disruption of GFP-2xFYVE, Hrs, and Rab5 localization in <italic>Vps34</italic> mutant cells indicates either that Vps34 activity is necessary for the recruitment or stable association of these markers or that the perinuclear endosomal compartment itself is disrupted in the mutant cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Vps34 is required for early steps of autophagosome formation</title><p>The fat body is specialized for a robust autophagic response to starvation, acting as a reserve source of nutrients for other critical tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Neufeld, 2004</xref>). Starvation results in an autophagy-dependent expansion and acidification of the lysosomal system, and thus the fluorescent Lysotracker dyes can be used to assay progression to late stages of autophagy in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rusten et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). Starvation-induced formation of Lysotracker-positive structures was severely inhibited in clones of <italic>Vps34</italic> mutant cells and in cells expressing Vps34<sup>KD</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), which is consistent with a requirement for <italic>Vps34</italic> in autophagy induction or progression. Overexpression of wild-type Vps34 was not sufficient to induce Lysotracker-positive structures under fed conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) but did result in a more robust response to starvation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). To examine earlier stages of autophagy, we determined the localization of the autophagosomal marker GFP-Atg8/LC3 in wild-type and <italic>Vps34</italic> mutant cells. Starvation-induced accumulation of GFP-Atg8 punctae was strongly curtailed in both <italic>Vps34</italic> mutant and Vps34<sup>KD</sup>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E&#x02013;G</xref>), indicating an essential cell-autonomous role for Vps34 in autophagosome biogenesis. Expression of Vps34<sup>KD</sup> also blocked the starvation-induced accumulation of preautophagosomal membranes labeled with GFP-Atg5 (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712051/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712051/DC1</ext-link>).

To determine whether Vps34 functions in a complex containing these proteins, we first tested for physical association between epitope-tagged versions of Vps34, Vps15, and Atg6.

Interestingly, the accumulation of autophagosomes in ESCRT/<italic>Vps34</italic> double mutants indicates that loss of Vps34 does not completely prevent autophagosome formation. Similarly, the lack of autophagosome accumulation in <italic>Vps34</italic> single mutants indicates that ESCRT complexes are at least partially functional in the absence of Vps34. Thus, PI(3)P may not be absolutely essential for these processes, or perhaps sufficient levels of PI(3)P are generated independently of Vps34 by the class II PI(3) kinase or by PI(3,4)P or PI(3,5)P phosphatases. As ESCRT components are required for multivesicular body formation but not autophagy in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reggiori et al., 2004</xref>), it will be interesting to determine whether the requirement for ESCRT complexes in autophagy in higher eukaryotes reflects their role in multivesicular body formation or an alternate function.</p><p>The cellular compartment in which Vps34 acts to promote autophagy and the mechanisms by which it is regulated by nutrient signals have remained unresolved. In mammalian cells, Beclin1/Atg6 has been reported to localize to the trans-Golgi network, ER, and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>). It was recently shown that Beclin1&#x02013;Vps34 complexes can be inhibited by the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 in a nutrient-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>). Bcl-2 mutants that are targeted to the ER, but not to mitochondria, retain their capacity to inhibit starvation-induced autophagy, suggesting that the ER is an important site of Beclin1-Vps34 regulation. However, it is unknown how these organelles contribute to the formation of autophagosomes, and recent studies suggest that rather than budding off a preexisting compartment, the autophagosomal membrane is likely to form de novo from small lipid transport vesicles or lipoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juhasz and Neufeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovacs et al., 2007</xref>). Our finding that myc-2xFYVE is recruited to GFP-Atg8a&#x02013;positive structures under starvation conditions indicates that Vps34 activity is targeted directly to autophagosomes in a TOR/Atg1-dependent manner. Although these results do not distinguish between a role for TOR/Atg1 signaling in regulating Vps34 activity versus providing a platform on which Vps34 complexes can assemble, together with these previous studies they indicate that Vps34 is likely to promote autophagy by different mechanisms from multiple cellular locations.</p><p>How the TOR signaling pathway senses intracellular levels of nutrients, such as amino acids, has been poorly understood despite considerable work in yeast, mammalian, and other model systems. The recent identification of Vps34 as a transducer of this signal in mammalian cells thus represents a significant new insight into this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Byfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nobukuni et al., 2005</xref>). However, further work is necessary to determine the extent to which this mechanism is generally conserved, as starvation appears to have opposing effects on Vps34 activity in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tassa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nobukuni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). The results presented here fail to support this model in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, as mutation of <italic>Vps34</italic> did not appear to influence TOR-dependent phenotypes nor to disrupt TOR-dependent signaling. This may reflect a fundamental difference in signaling mechanisms between the fly and mammalian systems. The makeup of Vps34 complexes has diverged significantly between yeast and metazoans, and perhaps components of this complex, such as Ambra1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fimia et al., 2007</xref>), that appear to be unique to vertebrates may confer functions not found in flies. It is also possible that production of PI(3)P by Vps34-independent mechanisms is more efficient in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> than in mammalian cells and, thus, a role for Vps34 in TOR signaling may be obscured by these other sources. The continued ESCRT function and basal level of autophagy in <italic>Vps34</italic> null mutants are consistent with this possibility. Alternatively, our findings may reflect important differences between the roles of TOR and Vps34 in vivo versus in cultured cells as well as the experimental paradigms of these systems. For example, although complete starvation is commonly used to inactivate TOR in cell culture studies, such experiments may not accurately mimic physiologically relevant events, given the inherent capacity of intact organisms to buffer changes in nutrient levels. Additional studies in an in vivo mammalian system will be helpful to clarify these issues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks and culture</title><p>Flies were raised at 25&#x000b0;C on standard cornmeal/molasses/agar media.
