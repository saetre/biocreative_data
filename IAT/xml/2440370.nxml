The nucleolus, the site of ribosome biogenesis, is a highly organized, non-membrane-bound sub-compartment where proteins with a high affinity for nucleolar components are found. While it is well known that Tat accumulates in the nucleolus via a specific nucleolar targeting sequence, its function in this compartment it still unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To clarify the significance of the Tat nucleolar localization, we induced the expression of the protein during oogenesis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>strain transgenic for HIV-<italic>tat </italic>gene. Here we show that Tat localizes in the nucleoli of <italic>Drosophila </italic>oocyte nurse cells, where it specifically co-localizes with fibrillarin. Tat expression is accompanied by a significant decrease of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which is apparently related to an impairment of ribosomal rRNA precursor processing. Such an event is accounted for by the interaction of Tat with fibrillarin and U3 snoRNA, which are both required for pre-rRNA maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data contribute to understanding the function of Tat in the nucleolus, where ribosomal RNA synthesis and cell cycle control take place. The impairment of nucleolar pre-rRNA maturation through the interaction of Tat with fibrillarin-U3snoRNA complex suggests a process by which the virus modulates host response, thus contributing to apoptosis and protein shut-off in HIV-uninfected cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The HIV-1 Tat protein is an RNA binding protein essential for viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which regulates productive and processive transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by binding to the transactivation response (TAR) element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Tat also affects several cellular functions by inducing angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], cell proliferation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, Tat regulates cytokine gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], immune cell activation and may be secreted by HIV-1 infected cells, and thus act on neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, by interacting with tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Tat affects mitosis and induces aneuploidies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that in both infected and uninfected cells, Tat also localizes in the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and that the nucleolar accumulation of Tat occurs via the highly conserved stretch of basic amino acids that acts as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The nucleolus is a highly structured and dynamic organelle involved in the transcription and maturation of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis as well as in apoptosis and in cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, various studies have suggested that the nucleolus plays a role in HIV-1 infections. First, lymphocytes isolated from infected patients show abnormal nucleolar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Secondly, nucleolar localization of TAR impairs virus progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>A number of proteins encoded by RNA viruses, such as protein V of adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], protein N of porcine virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and HIV-1-Rev protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], are known to enter the nucleolus and to colocalize with nucleolar components suggesting that nucleolar localization is an important step in promoting viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. While it is known that Rev multimerizes in the nucleolus and appears to play a role in the nucleoplasmic transport of viral unspliced RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; the function of Tat in this nuclear structure is still unknown.</p><p>To gain insight into the functional significance of Tat nucleolar localization, we used a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>Tat transgenic strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and analysed the effect of this protein on ribosome biogenesis by expressing it (under the control of hsp70 promoter) during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis. <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis is, in fact, the period of highest ribosome biosynthesis, and the genetic and molecular events (highly conserved from yeast to human) of this process have been extensively studied and described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, recent data indicate that <italic>Drosophila </italic>is a useful complementary system for studying HIV-1-related genes and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Here we show that Tat localizes with fibrillarin in nurse cell nucleoli, causes death and delayed development of the progeny and decreases the level of the 80S ribosome particles. This decrease appears to result from a Tat induced inhibition of pre-rRNA processing caused by the interaction of Tat with U3 snoRNA and fibrillarin, nucleolar components that are essential for the early steps of pre-rRNA processing. The results reported in this paper, provide the first evidence of the action of Tat on nucleolar functions and further our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying Tat-mediated pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tat expressed by heat shock treatment, colocalizes with fibrillarin in the nucleolus of Drosophila cells</title><p>Nucleolar localization of the HIV Tat protein has been extensively shown using several cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To shed light on the effects of the nucleolar localization of Tat, we determined whether it localizes in the nucleolus of <italic>tat </italic>transgenic <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>cells, where its expressions is driven under the control of the heat shock promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since it is known that heat shock affects ribosome biogenesis and its effects terminate four hours later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we first investigated the time conditions that allow high expression of Tat in the absence of heat shock treatment effects (see Materials and Methods). To this end, we analyzed the expression of both Hsp70 and Tat proteins by Western blot analysis. Results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> show that the levels of Tat protein rise soon after heat shock treatment and continue for six hours during the ensuing treatment. In contrast, an increased level of Hsp70 protein appears between 30 minutes and two hours after treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Based on these results, all analyses were carried out by subjecting <italic>Drosophila </italic>flies to three heat shocks and by starting experiments six hours thereafter. Further to focusing on Tat nucleolar localization, <italic>Drosophila </italic>nurse cells were used since they are relatively large (due to polyploidy) and each contains several nucleoli. The images in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> show that Tat expressed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>transgenic flies localizes, as expected, both in the nucleoplasm and in the nucleolus, where it colocalizes with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin. This result supports the idea that the nucleolar localization signal works in <italic>Drosophila </italic>as well as mammalian cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Tat and its colocalization with fibrillarin in <italic>Drosophila </italic>nurse cell nucleoli from Tat transgenic strain after heat shock treatment</bold>.

Therefore, to test whether the expression of Tat gives rise to similar phenotypes, we expressed this protein during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis and checked the progeny for mortality and developmental time. The data show that the expression of Tat causes significant increased mortality at embryonic and larval stages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Moreover, developmental stages were delayed (4 days) compared with the control strain.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, processing of the rRNA primary transcript (pre-rRNA) proceeds by two alternative (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) cleavage pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the &#x003b1; processing pathway (shared by all Eucarya) the initial cleavage step removes the ETS, leaving a large molecule encompassing both the 18S and 28S rRNA sequences (intermediate a) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In the alternative &#x003b2; pathway, the primary transcript is cleaved inside the ITS region, at site 3, generating two processing intermediates; the first containing the 18S rRNA precursor (intermediate d), and the second containing the 28S rRNA precursor (intermediate b) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The effect of Tat on pre-rRNA processing was investigated by Northern blot analysis using total RNA extracted from <italic>Drosophila </italic>females of both transgenic and control strains subjected and not to heat shock treatment. The presence of unprocessed rRNA precursors in Tat-expressing cells was investigated using a DNA probe (probe I) which specifically hybridizes with the ITS1 5' region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), thus allowing the identification of unprocessed pre-rRNA and both the a and d precursors. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> shows, hybridization of total RNA from Tat-expressing and control flies with the ITS1-specific probe clearly reveals accumulation of type d precursor only in Tat-expressing flies. Therefore, Tat expression in <italic>Drosophila </italic>seems to affect at least cleavage site 1. With the &#x003b1; pathway blocked, pre-rRNA processing should proceed mainly through pathway &#x003b2;, generating increasing amounts of intermediate d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Indeed, hybridization with probe II shows higher levels of both b and d intermediate forms in the Tat expressing strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), suggesting that both pathways may be affected. The observation that Tat mainly interferes with site 1 cleavage was further confirmed by Northern blot experiments using a DNA probe (probe III) that specifically hybridizes with the 5' ETS region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), thus allowing detection of accumulated intermediate d forms. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> shows, a significant increase of d form RNA occurs only in transgenic flies expressing Tat, which confirms that Tat affects at least cleavage site 1 impairing pre-rRNA maturation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Tat affects rRNA processing</bold>.

In contrast to samples from non-Tat expressing flies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), incubation with extracts from Tat expressing flies resulted in considerable retardation of probe electrophoretic mobility (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). The shift was abolished after incubation the extracts with anti-Tat antibody (lanes 8 and 9) before adding the probe.

The specific signal was detected in the Tat-expressing strain (lane 2), whereas, as expected, no signal was observed in the control strain (lane 1). Similarly, when nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tat antibodies and then challenged with anti-fibrillarin antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), the immunoreactive band was detected only in precipitates from the Tat-expressing strain (lane 2). Interestingly the detection was abolished when samples were preincubated with RNase before proceeding with the immunoprecipitation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, bottom lanes). Since fibrillarin is known to participate in RNA cleavage in association with U3 snoRNA, we tested whether Tat forms immunoprecipitates with U3 snoRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Accordingly, we incubated nuclear extracts with Tat-polyclonal antibodies and then monitored the presence of a Tat-U3 complex by Northern blotting using a U3 specific oligonucleotide as a probe. Results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> (lanes 1 and 2), clearly show that U3 is associated with Tat in immunoprecipitates from a transgenic strain expressing Tat.

The processing and modification of ribosomal pre-RNA in the nucleoli of eukaryotic cells, is accomplished by a large number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) complexed with proteins in ribonucleoproteic particles (snoRNPs) that are essential for rRNA chemical modifications, such as methylation and pseudouridylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Defects in some of these components have been associated with defects in pre-rRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, Tat can inhibit or delay the processing of the pre-rRNA by subtracting fibrillarin-snoU3 complex from the initial cleavage site. Alternatively Tat could interact: i) with specific RNAs and drag along fibrillarin and other core components of the snoRNP (such as Nop56, Nop58, 15.5 K); ii) with proteins that interact with snoRNPs (such as Nopp140 or nucleolin); iii) or directly with the rRNA. This should affect fibrillarin functions in cells harbouring Tat. Interestingly, a similar mechanism has been suggested for Nidoviruses, which are able to traslocate the nucleocapside (N) protein into the nucleolus, where it interacts with fibrillarin, by an RNA mediated mechanism and possibly affects pre-RNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is known that in mammalian cells, cell cycle regulation is related to ribosome biogenesis at nucleolar level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and that inhibition of pre-rRNA processing directs the cells toward apoptosis. Data report that mutation in nucleolar components results in pre-rRNA maturation defects and apoptosis. It is the case of mutation of <italic>minifly </italic>gene (which encodes an ubiquitous nucleolar protein (Mfl) in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), and mutation in the gene encoding ribosomal RPS19 protein in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, one of the molecular mechanisms by which both HIV infected and uninfected cells undergo apoptosis may depend on the pre-rRNA processing inhibition mediated by Tat.</p><p>Modulating cellular protein synthesis and host cell metabolism is a strategy common in many viruses to induce cellular shut-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A mechanism by which HIV-1 induces cellular shut-off seems to depend on the binding of the second coding exon of Tat to the translation elongation factor 1-delta (EF-1&#x003b4;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. As we observed, the inhibition of pre-rRNA processing mediated by Tat leads to a decreased amount of 80S ribosome particles. The decrease of the cytoplasmic ribosomes should result in reduced protein synthesis of the host cell. Therefore, the inhibition of pre-rRNA processing caused by Tat delineates a novel mechanism for HIV-1 mediated cellular shut-off.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present work we show for the first time that Tat, in the nucleolus, affects ribosome rRNA maturation. This suggests that Tat manipulates basic cellular processes in order to control ribosomal biogenesis.</p><p>An intriguing hypothesis is that Tat, secreted by HIV-1 infected cells, acts on the nucleolar compartment of neighbouring uninfected cells, inducing apoptosis and consequent loss of immune competence, which is the main cause of AIDS pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drosophila stock and transgenic line</title><p>Fly stocks: <italic>w</italic><sup>67</sup><italic>c</italic><sup>23 </sup>used as control (named WG) and WG hsp:Tat transgenic line (named Tat-strain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of HIV-Tat protein by heat shock treatment</title><p>In all experiments, Tat expression (under the control of hsp70 promoter) was induced by subjecting <italic>Drosophila </italic>females to heat-shock treatment for 30' at 37&#x000b0;C for three days.
