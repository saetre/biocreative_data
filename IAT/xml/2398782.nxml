Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs <italic>per se</italic>, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Coronaviruses are the causative agents of many respiratory and enteric infections in humans and animals. As with all viruses, virtually all of the steps of their infection cycle depend on host cellular factors. As the first and most crucial step after their entry into cells, coronaviruses assemble their replication complexes (RCs) in association with characteristic, newly induced membranous structures. The cellular pathways hijacked by these plus-strand RNA viruses to create these &#x0201c;factories&#x0201d; have not been elucidated. Here, we study the involvement of the secretory pathway in mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication by using the drug brefeldin A (BFA), which is known to interfere with ER&#x02013;Golgi membrane traffic by inhibiting the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases. Our observations show that MHV RNA replication is sensitive to BFA. In agreement herewith we demonstrate, by using various techniques, that the BFA-sensitive guanidine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 and its downstream effector ARF1 are of critical importance for coronavirus replication. From our results we conclude that MHV RNA replication depends on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation. Our study provides new insights into the close connection between MHV replication and the early secretory pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses rely on cellular host factors for virtually all steps of their infection cycle.

To this end, a similar experiment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> was performed, in which the amount of intracellular genomic viral RNA was determined by real-time Taqman PCR.

Very similar results were obtained when targeting the Taqman PCR to a different region of the viral genome (data not shown). To more directly check for an effect of BFA on the translation of viral mRNAs, we performed an additional experiment. LR7 cells were infected at high multiplicity with the recombinant virus MHV-2aFLS, which expresses the firefly luciferase, and subsequently transfected with a synthetic mRNA encoding <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. This synthetic mRNA mimics viral mRNAs as it contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions identical to those found in the viral genome.

Thus LR7 cells infected with MHV-EFLM were treated with BFA for overlapping 2 h periods. At the end of each incubation period the intracellular luciferase expression levels were determined and compared to those in mock-treated cells. The results showed that replication was affected throughout the course of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>); however, the effects were most pronounced during the early phases of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ARF1-T31N inhibits MHV replication</title><p>To confirm our observation that BFA inhibits MHV replication but also to prove that the effects of this drug are due to the inhibition of GEF activities, we next analyzed to what extent the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1 (T31N) would affect MHV infection.

First, the specific knockdown of the respective mRNAs after siRNA transfection was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. At 72 h after transfection of the siRNAs, the corresponding mRNA levels for BIG1, BIG2, GBF1 and ARF1 were found to be reduced by 73&#x00025;, 74&#x00025;, 75&#x00025;, and 94&#x00025;, respectively. The mRNA levels were not affected after transfection of non-corresponding siRNAs, demonstrating the specificity of the mRNA depletion (data not shown). Second, the functional knock-down of GBF1 and ARF1 at the protein level was demonstrated by co-transfection of plasmids encoding GBF1-YFP and ARF1-YFP together with either the GBF1- or ARF1-specific siRNAs, respectively. This approach was chosen because of the unavailability of specific anti-antibodies. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were fixed and YFP-positive cells were counted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> demonstrates that GBF1 and ARF1 expression are prohibited in the presence of their specific siRNAs.</p><p>Next, we analyzed whether inhibition of MHV replication after depletion of ARF1 coincided with a collapse of the Golgi complex as observed after BFA treatment. Again, HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ARF1 and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence at 72 h post transfection using the GM130 antibody. In the ARF1 siRNA-transfected cells, the GM130 staining was indistinguishable from that in mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) indicating that loss of ARF1 did not lead to the collapse of the Golgi into the ER.

To this end, we performed a similar knock down experiment in which we transfected siRNAs targeting either ARF1 or GBF1 and subsequently infected the cells with a recombinant MHV, which expressed an additional copy of nsp2, now fused to GFP. The nsp2-GFP fusion protein co-localizes with nsp8 and provides an additional marker for the RCs (data not shown). Six hours after infection the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence with the nsp8 antibody. In mock transfected cells, many GFP and nsp8 positive foci were observed, which largely co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). In agreement with the relative luciferase expression values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, both in ARF1- and GBF1-depleted cells, the number and intensity of the nsp8 positive foci was reduced, similar to what had been observed in BFA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Apparently, the number of MHV RCs is reduced in these cells. Strikingly, however, it appeared that the nsp2-GFP expression was much more affected than that of nsp8 by the depletion of either ARF1 or GBF1, as hardly any GFP fluorescence could be detected. While nsp8 is expressed directly from the viral genome, the nsp2-GFP fusion protein is expressed from a subgenomic mRNA and hence replication and transcription is required for its expression. These results therefore indicate that not only fewer RCs are formed in the absence of either GBF1 or ARF1, but that these RCs are also impaired in their RNA synthesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that depletion of GBF1 and ARF1 reduces MHV replication as well as the number of RCs. Furthermore, our results indicate that the RCs formed in the absence of either GBF1 or Arf1 are less active.

Third, we showed that the specific siRNA-based knockdown of the BFA-sensitive GEF GBF1, but not BIG1 and BIG2, strongly affects MHV infection. Fourth, also ARF1, a downstream effector of GBF1, appeared to be required for efficient MHV replication, as shown by the inhibition of MHV-driven reporter gene expression during siRNA-mediated down regulation of ARF1 as well as during expression of an inactive ARF1 mutant.</p><p>The inhibition of coronavirus RNA replication in the presence of BFA is either caused by direct inhibition of RC formation, resulting in reduced RNA replication, or by inhibition of RNA replication via another mechanism, resulting in reduced de novo formation of RCs. Though it is difficult to distinguish between these two scenarios, our results indicate the latter option to be most plausible. Although BFA reduced the number of RCs, their formation was not completely blocked as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of the RCs using the nsp8 antibody and by quantitative electron microscopy. Apparently, BFA did not prevent the formation of RCs after translation of the incoming genomic RNA. In addition, MHV replication was inhibited by BFA throughout the infection. Early in infection the inhibition was more profound than at later time points, when many transcriptionally active RCs have already been formed. Furthermore, while the inhibition of reporter gene expression in the presence of BFA, or after depletion of either GBF1 or ARF1, is in complete agreement with the reduced numbers of RCs, our results also indicate that the few RCs that are formed in the absence of GBF1 or ARF1 are less active. Therefore, we hypothesize that BFA inhibits MHV RNA replication by affecting RC maturation or functioning rather than RC formation <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000088-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000088.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model of MHV RCs and their links to the early secretory pathway.</title><p>Two major steps in the anterograde protein secretion route (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-LippincottSchwartz2">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>) are linked to MHV RC formation and/or RNA replication.

We therefore hypothesize that downstream effectors of GBF1-ARF1 are involved in MHV replication. To date, more than 20 downstream effectors of ARF1 have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Donaldson2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-DSouzaSchorey2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Kawasaki1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Nie1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, and each one of these might thus be somehow implicated in the functioning of the MHV RCs. The most well known effector of ARF1 is COPI. For picornaviruses, BFA sensitivity was suggested to correlate with the recruitment of COPI to these sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Gazina1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no co-localization between COPI and the MHV RCs could be observed. This is in agreement with the almost complete absence of ARF1 at these sites. In addition, coronavirus RCs did not co-localize with PLD1 nor was coronavirus replication affected by inhibition of phospholipase D, a lipid-metabolizing enzyme involved in membrane dynamics and vesicular transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Jenkins1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Roth1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. It might be that the GBF1-ARF1 pathway simply functions to deliver lipids to the RCs. In agreement herewith, cerulenin, an inhibitor of phospholipid biosynthesis, severely inhibits MHV replication (C.A.M. de Haan, unpublished results). Nonetheless, the observed inhibition of MHV infection after BFA treatment is probably not an indirect consequence of the collapse of the Golgi complex as, unlike BFA treatment, ARF1 depletion did not affect the morphology of the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000088-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Consistent herewith, another recent study showed that ARF1 depletion did not affect the Golgi morphology or protein transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-VolpicelliDaley1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have indicated that coronavirus replication and the ER are closely connected.

In addition, coronavirus replication was inhibited when the ER export machinery was blocked by the use of the kinase inhibitor H89 or by expression of dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Oostra1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We now show by using several approaches that MHV RNA replication also depends on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation.

Clearly, further investigations are needed to unravel the precise mechanism by which the secretory pathway contributes to the biogenesis of functional coronavirus RCs and to RNA replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>HeLa-CEACAM1a cells were generated by transfecting HeLa cells (obtained from the MPI-CBG High-Throughput Technology Development Studio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Pelkmans1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>) with the expression plasmid pMHVR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Dveksler1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref> as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000088-Wurdinger1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>.
