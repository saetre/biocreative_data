However, there is no general explanation why apparently similar variations may have either no effect on splicing or cause significant splicing alterations. In this work we have examined the structural architecture of pseudoexons previously described in <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>CFTR</italic> patients. The ATM case derives from the deletion of a repressor element and is characterized by an aberrant 5&#x02032;ss selection despite the presence of better alternatives. The CFTR pseudoexon instead derives from the creation of a new 5&#x02032;ss that is used while a nearby pre-existing donor-like sequence is never selected. Our results indicate that RNA structure is a major splicing regulatory factor in both cases. Furthermore, manipulation of the original RNA structures can lead to pseudoexon inclusion following the exposure of unused 5&#x02032;ss already present in their wild-type intronic sequences and prevented to be recognized because of their location in RNA stem structures. Our data show that intrinsic structural features of introns must be taken into account to understand the mechanism of pseudoexon activation in genetic diseases. Our observations may help to improve diagnostics prediction programmes and eventual therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA secondary structure is increasingly recognized as a powerful modifier of splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). At the local level, RNA conformations have been shown to regulate the splicing process by affecting the basic identifying features of an exon. Numerous examples of such a regulatory role have been recently reported to occur for the donor site of Tau exon 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), SMN2 exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the branch/acceptor sites in <italic>Drosophila Adh</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), the internal splicing enhancer region in the fibronectin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or to silencer regions in the <italic>presenilin 2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In addition, RNA secondary structures have been shown to involve interactions between very distant regions of the pre-mRNA such as in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Recently, complementary intron sequence motifs have also been proposed to mediate the peculiar phenomenon of exon repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Finally, RNA secondary structures are increasingly shown to play a part in other facets of mRNA biology such as in mantaining its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), regulating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Taken together, these examples are consistent with the indications provided by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses which predict the existence of a vast array of conserved structural features both in selected human protein coding RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and in the human genome in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). From the latter has emerged the recent small RNAs revolution of functional non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, RNA secondary structures have also been proposed to play a role in helping the splicing machinery to distinguish between real exons and pseudoexon sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Pseudoexon sequences are loosely defined as intronic sequences between 50 and 200&#x02009;nt in length that are flanked by apparently good-to-consensus acceptor and donor-site signals. These sequences, however, are apparently never recognized by the splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) although this definition may contain many exceptions. In fact, it has recently been proposed that many members of this class may indeed be used to regulate the relative abundance of different pre-mRNA isoforms by selective Nonsense-Mediated Decay of alternatively spliced exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In addition, a distinct class of pseudoexon sequences derived from transposable elements known as <italic>Alu</italic> sequences has been recently established as a major source of &#x02018;real&#x02019; coding exonic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, estimates regarding pseudoexon sequence abundance in a typical pre-mRNA molecule has shown they may outnumber &#x02018;real&#x02019; exons by an entire order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It is therefore clear that, no matter how many exceptions to the exclusion rule there may be, avoiding the insertion of these sequences during the normal splicing process would be essential for correct pre-mRNA processing. To achieve this, recent research has proposed that their exclusion may be achieved by a combination of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), including an enrichment within their sequence of inhibitory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) or through the <italic>in silico</italic> indication that pseudoexons flanking regions have a distinct tendency to form double-stranded structures that include the pseudo exon itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Regarding human diseases, pseudoexon inclusion events have increasingly been described to occur as a result of a single-point mutation deep within intronic regions. In general, these mutations have the effect of creating either a very good acceptor or donor splice site followed by the selection of &#x02018;opportunistic&#x02019; complementary sites. A few exceptions that are worth noting have been described elsewhere where the intronic mutation affects a regulatory element within the pseudoexon itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>). For a general review of this topic see Buratti <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and Supplemetary Table 1 for an updated list of pathological pseudoexon inclusion events.</p><p>This kind of aberrant insertional events have never had any coding potential, as they all originate from the chance occurrence of a triggering mutation. Therefore, no selection pressure may have been applied during evolution to regulate their inclusion as far as codon usage/regulatory sequences are concerned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Interestingly, one characteristic feature of these pseudoexons is their reduced length with respect to the normal length spread of exons which is reported to exist in the human and mouse genomes (Supplementary Figure S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This reduced length, intriguingly similar to the previous estimates of the &#x02018;window&#x02019; of naked RNA available for folding after transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suggests that intrinsic structural features of these RNAs could represent a major determinant in their &#x02018;exonization&#x02019; process. In this work, we have used representative examples of these pseudoexon inclusion events to test the importance of RNA secondary structures in their splicing regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids carrying the <italic>ATM</italic> pseudoexon wild-type and mutant sequences</title><p>The PY7 plasmid has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). For our purposes, we have inserted two SmaI and NdeI unique cloning sites at positions 44 and 50, respectively, in its 111-nt long intron. Both the wild-type (wt) and gtaa-deleted (&#x00394;) ATM sequences were amplified from the pATM plasmids used in the original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and inserted in the SmaI site of PY7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The oligos used for this task were the following: 5&#x02032;-ttgctcaagctcttaactgcaacagtggt-3&#x02032; (s) and 5&#x02032;-gtcaaacagaaaattcaaatcccag-3&#x02032; (as). In order to obtain the ATM 46-48T &#x00394; mutant a two-step PCR method was used with the following primers 5&#x02032;-tgagggtacgtatgccctagatg-3&#x02032; (s) and 5&#x02032;-catctagggcatacgtaccctca-3&#x02032; (as).

The activation event consisted of a 4&#x02009;nt deletion (GTAA) that occurred within a high-affinity U1snRNP-binding site that surprisingly was not a masked 5&#x02032;ss but an internal splicing repressor. This region was termed ISPE, for Intron-Splicing Processing Element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A shows the nucleotide sequence of the pseudoexon (in bold), together with the ISPE sequence (underlined, the GTAA sequence is in italic) and its intron flanking regions.</p><p>The major peculiarity of this event is represented by the observation that although the ISPE itself is an excellent 5&#x02032;ss it is never used by the splicing machinery. The reason for this probably resides in its vicinity to the well-defined 3&#x02032;ss sequence of the ATM pseudoexon (3&#x02032;pe) that possesses a score of 0.93 according to the NNSplice program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In fact, recent experiments using modified U1snRNA molecules binding to consecutive positions along this pseudoexon have suggested that the U1snRNP molecule has to be placed 40&#x02009;nt away from the 3&#x02032;ss before pseudoexon inclusion can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Even more surprisingly, the only donor site (5&#x02032;pe) used <italic>in vivo</italic> is represented by a AAG<underline>gc</underline>aagt non-consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The GC dinucleotide is a fairly rare donor-site sequence which accounts for only 0.56% of all donor-site junctions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Moreover, in this specific context this choice is made even more peculiar due to the presence inside the pseudoexon itself of another reasonable potential donor-site sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, the AGG<underline>GT</underline>ACGA sequence, designated throughout this work as 5&#x02032;int) in addition to the ISPE itself.

This difference in predicted strengths in favour of 5&#x02032;int is also reflected by several other donor-site scoring methods such as MaxEntScan (ME, MDD, MM and WMM scores for 5&#x02032;int are 7.38/10.38/7.61/6.10, respectively compared to the scores of 3.24/7.72/4.43/4.95 obtained for 5&#x02032;pe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) or Spliceview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) where 5&#x02032;int has a predicted score of 81 whereas 5&#x02032;pe is not detected at all.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting up an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing system to analyse <italic>ATM</italic> pseudoexon inclusion</title><p>In order to clarify this peculiar mechanism of donor-site usage it was decided to clone part of this sequence in the PY7 splicing system for <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

As shown in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B panels the ATM &#x00394; RNA could successfully induce pseudoexon inclusion whilst, as expected, no pseudoexon inclusion could be detected during the processing of the ATM WT RNA. It should also be noted that there is a strong similarity between the results obtained using the radioactively labelled RNAs and the RT-PCR products. Subcloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR reaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B lower panel, lane 4 confirmed that only the 5&#x02032;pe sequence was used in the pseudoexon inclusion event and failed to detect any use of the 5&#x02032;int donor site (data not shown). The <italic>in vitro</italic> data, therefore, wholly confirmed the previous results obtained using minigenes and patient's transcript analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Investigating donor-site choice in the ATM pseudoexon</title><p>It was then decided to investigate the eventual activation of the 5&#x02032;int donor site by introducing two single nucleotide substitutions in position 46 and 48 (ATM 46-48T &#x00394; mutant). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, this had the effect of improving the predicted NNSplice donor-site score from 0.79 to 0.99. The ATM 46-48T &#x00394; mutant was then spliced <italic>in vitro</italic> and the results showed that this improvement caused the almost complete switching from normal pseudoexon donor-site usage to this internal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 4). Interestingly, inactivating this improved cryptic 5&#x02032;gt sequence in the presence of the 46&#x02013;48 substitutions by mutating it to a 5&#x02032;at sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, ATM 46-48T 41A &#x00394; mutant) restored splicing to the ATM &#x00394; RNA pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 6). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D lane 8 shows that a mutation (ATM &#x00394; G41) which strongly improves the predicted donor-site score in the 5&#x02032;int position from 0.79 to 0.97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) did not result in preferential usage of this splice site (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D lane 4 and lane 8). It was therefore evident that additional factors besides predicted scores were playing a role in defining donor-site usage within the ATM pseudoexon. In consideration that RNA secondary structure represents a potentially very powerful modifier of splice-site usage it was then decided to investigate the potential folding of this sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>The ATM pseudoexon can efficiently fold upon itself to mask splice-site usage</title><p>Preliminary <italic>in silico</italic> analyses obtained using the mFold program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) suggested that the ATM &#x00394; pseudoexon sequence could fold upon itself to form a very compact, double-stranded structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Its existence was thus tested experimentally by partial RNA digestion using single and double-strand-specific RNAses such as V1 (which cleaves double-stranded RNA and stacked RNA regions), T1 (which cleaves single-stranded guanosines) and S1 nuclease (which cleaves single-stranded RNA without sequence specificity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The overall position of the different cleavages shows that the ATM &#x00394; pseudoexon sequence does indeed display a structure that is consistent with the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B. In addition, it is interesting to note that two particularly strong RT stops (indicated by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) seem to enclose the pseudoexon sequence, possibly reflecting the difficulty of the RT to travel across a compact structure. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed ATM &#x00394; RNA enzymatically digested with S1 nuclease, T1 and V1 RNases (<bold>A</bold>: lanes S1, T1 and V1). No enzyme was added to the RNA in a control reaction mixture (A: lane C). The RNA substrate on which this analysis was perfomed consisted of the entire RNA transcript from the ATM &#x00394; RNA plasmid (&#x0223c;700&#x02009;nt). By providing an extensive background of flanking RNA molecule we have aimed to minimize any folding bias that may have derived from analysing the pseudoexon sequence alone. The cleaved fragments were detected by performing a RT reaction using a labelled <sup>32</sup>P-end labelled antisense oligo and separating them in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. A sequencing reaction performed with the same RT primer was run in parallel to the cleavages in order to determine the cleavage sites (A: lanes G, A, T, C). Squares, circles and triangles indicate S1, T1 and V1 cleavage sites. Black and white symbols indicate high and low cleavage intensity, respectively. RT stops are indicated by arrows. The positions of the 3&#x02032;pe, 5&#x02032;int and 5&#x02032;pe splice sites are indicated on the right. The observed cleavages were then compared with the ATM folding predictions by mFold (<bold>B</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm447f2"/></fig></p><p>Finally, V1 cleavages can be observed to cluster in the exact position of the 5&#x02032;int cryptic donor site, suggesting that the double-stranded structure in this region may inhibit use of this donor site. It is also interesting to note that a prominent S1 cleavage (black square) is also present in this region but on the opposite strand to the 5&#x02032;int splice site, and this may represent a tendency for the U of the wobble U&#x02013;G base pair to remain outside the stem region. Alternatively, the V1 sensitivity of the G in this wobble U&#x02013;G base pair may be owing to the fact that it is stacked in a run of five purines, making a small internal bulge in this predicted stem structure. It should be noted, however, that the overall way in which cleavages are distributed also provides a general indication regarding how any approaching molecule will see that particular RNA region. In this case, the much greater number of V1 cleavages that occur on both sides of the stem in correspondence to 5&#x02032;int would suggest that this whole region predominantly looks like a compact, double-stranded structure to any approaching molecule.</p><p>Taken together, these results allow us to propose a working model of splice-site usage in this pseudoexon. In this model, once the repression provided the ISPE sequence is removed the 5&#x02032;pe sequence is chosen as donor site because the RNA secondary structure hides the internal 5&#x02032;int sequence. This is consistent with previous data which showed that short artificial hairpins have been long known to be able to inhibit usage of a donor site embedded in their stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Moreover, the stem configuration may also provide a competitive advantage by approximating the 3&#x02032;pe to the 5&#x02032;pe sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the role played by the ATM RNA secondary structure on 5&#x02032;int/5&#x02032;pe usage</title><p>The importance of internal 5&#x02032;ss availability was then tested experimentally by engineering a mutant ATM sequence (ATM 5&#x02032;-new &#x00394;) that carried a 5&#x02032;ss sequence designed to remain in an open structure/internal bulge conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). It should be noted that these sequence changes also abolish the original 5&#x02032;int donor like sequence according to the NNsplice prediction program although not according to the MaxEntScan program (data not shown). The fact that the ATM 5&#x02032;-new &#x00394; mutant has a more open structure also in the mutated 5&#x02032;int donor site is suggested by the increase of S1 single-strand cleavages in this region of the ATM 5&#x02032;-new mutant &#x00394; when compared with the ATM &#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). The structural probing of this mutant shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A displays a marked reduction in the number of V1 cleavages (double-strand specific) and an increase in the S1 single-stranded cleavages around the central bulge region carrying the new donor site. Therefore, with respect to the structural analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A for the ATM &#x00394; mutant, the overall picture of the ATM 5&#x02032;-new &#x00394; mutant shows a predominantly open configuration (and thus presumably becomes more accessible for splicing factors). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The structural analysis of the ATM 5&#x02032;new &#x00394; mutant.

Interestingly, direct sequencing of the amplified product has showed that although most fragments (&#x0223c;75%) derive from the use of the 5&#x02032;-new donor site whilst the remaining are derived from 5&#x02032;int donor-site usage (data not shown). This result further highlights the importance of an &#x02018;open&#x02019; structure on donor-site sequence availability. In addition, because the efficiency of pseudoexon recognition when transfected in eukaryotic cells using minigene systems was significantly higher than <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) the behaviour of this mutant was also tested following its introduction in pcDNA3 and transfection in Hep3B cells. Also in this case the ATM 5&#x02032;-new &#x00394; mutant was shown to splice predominantly to the internal donor sites when transfected in Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, compare lanes 1 and 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of secondary structure stability on 5&#x02032;int site usage in the ATM pseuodexon</title><p>The functional importance of RNA secondary structure was also tested experimentally by performing a more subtle mutational analysis based on the proposed RNA secondary structure of the ATM pseudoexon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B. According to this model, it should be possible to reduce 5&#x02032;int activation in the ATM 46-48T &#x00394; mutant by &#x02018;tightening&#x02019; the upper stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In order to do this, the thymidines in position 21 and 23 were replaced by cytosine both in the original ATM &#x00394; context as control (mutant ATM 21-23C &#x00394;) and in the ATM 46-48T &#x00394; context (mutant ATM 21-23C 46-48T &#x00394;). The rationale of this change was to replace the natural UG &#x02018;wobble&#x02019; base-pairings in these positions with two more canonical CG base pairs. This change, according to secondary structure predictions, would have the effect of raising the free energy of the ATM pseudoexon structure from &#x02013;20.9 to &#x02013;26.2&#x02009;kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B shows that the introduction of the 21&#x02013;23C substitutions had no effect in donor-site usage of the ATM &#x00394; context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 4).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, an interesting feature of this pseudoexon is represented by the fact that near to the newly created donor site (5&#x02032;pe) there is a second, not optimal, but viable donor-site sequence (/guuacu, 5&#x02032;ss) detected by the NNSplice prediction program. This was an interesting finding, as other likely donor-site sequences had already been identified in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Indeed, an interesting feature of this CFTR sequence is represented by its containing several downstrean donor-like sequences after the activating mutation (/guaa/guaag/guuacu). However, at the time no indication could be obtained that any of these additional donor-site sequences besides the one created by the A &#x0003e; G mutation were ever used in normal CFTR pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Using our PY7 <italic>in vitro</italic> system we have confirmed this data. In fact, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B the CFTR WT sequence that lacks the A &#x0003e; G substitution does not give rise to any pseudoexon insertion event originating from the 5&#x02032;ss natural sequence (lane 2). In addition, when the A &#x0003e; G substitution was inserted in the sequence (mutant CFTR MUT) only one pseudoexon inclusion event could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4) that originated from this newly created 5&#x02032;pe donor site as determined by sequencing of the upper band (data not shown). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The sequence of the <italic>CFTR</italic> intronic region inserted in the SmaI site of PY7 that contains the A &#x0003e; G mutation responsible for creating a high score donor site (5&#x02032;pe) (highlighted in bold).

An alternative explanation for the lack of 5&#x02032;ss usage may also reside in the peculiar arrangement of the CFTR sequence (see earlier) where tandem donor-like sequences (/guaag/guuacu) are closely grouped together, an event that may lead to splicing inhibition probably at the level of the A and B complexes due to sterical hindrance of closely binding U1snRNP molecules, as proposed by Nelson and Green in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In this CFTR system, however, this possibility is unlikely as U1snRNP cannot be detected as binding to this position in the normal CFTR WT context, at least as determined by super-shift analysis using a anti-U1A monoclonal antibody (data not shown).</p><p>Therefore, in order to confirm the structural hypothesis we first performed RNAse digestion analysis on the PY7 MUT transcript. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, the cleavages were consistent with the secondary structure depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and in particular the inactive 5&#x02032;ss donor site appears to be embedded in a tightly folded structure, as highlighted by the two strong V1 cleavages that immediately flank the two T1 cuts in correspondence to the GG nucleotides. Although this would seemingly make an energetically very unfavourable, 2&#x02009;nt loop configuration, it should be noted that in order to cleave the V1 RNAse does not necessarily require a bonded interaction but only a sufficiently close distance between two nucleotides. On the other hand, the newly created 5&#x02032;pe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D) is localized in the apparently more open region joining two stem-loop structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigating repression of 5&#x02032;ss usage in the CFTR WT context</title><p>In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms that repress 5&#x02032;ss usage in the CFTR WT transcript it was then decided to test the importance of predicted donor-site strengths on CFTR WT pseudoexon inclusion efficiency. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, three mutants (WT2, WT3 and WT4) were created in which we substantially improved the predicted donor-site scores (0.98, 1.00 and 1.00, respectively) according to NNSplice without changing the structure and base-composition of the lower stem. The improvement in predicted strengths for these mutants was very evident using also other <italic>in silico</italic> prediction programs such as MaxEnt scan that focus only on the 9&#x02009;nt consensus stretch itself. In this case, the predicted 5&#x02032;ss donor-site strengths according to the ME, MDD, MM and WMM scoring models were 1.25/6.68/2.34/3.92 for WT, 6.43/10.08/5.09/7.20 for WT2, 8.54/13.58/7.21/7.76 for WT3 and 9.66/13.68/9.96/11.04 for WT4. <italic>In vitro</italic> splicing analysis of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8) clearly showed that only WT3 and WT4 were capable of promoting pseudoexon inclusion from their mutated 5&#x02032;ss sequences. This difference between the splicing behaviour of the WT2 and WT3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 4 and 6) prompted us to focus on the importance of the +5 position. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of the three CFTR WT mutants (WT2, WT3 and WT4).

The results of this experiment showed that CFTR WT could not display pseudoexon inclusion even when cotransfected with the C &#x0003e; G U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4) whilst only a very small amount of pseudoexon inclusion could be observed when the CFTR WT2 mutant was cotransfected with this C &#x0003e; G U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lane 6). Interestingly, addition of the C &#x0003e; G U1 to the CFTR WT 5&#x02032;ss donor site gives a complementarity pattern that was identical to the one obtained by the CFTR WT3 mutant with wild-type U1 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, compare boxes 2 and 3). However, in the first case no pseudoexon inclusion was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lane 4) whilst the CFTR WT3 mutant could naturally promote inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 6). This finding suggests that the critical importance of the +5 position might be unrelated to U1snRNP binding and the most likely possibility is represented by the interaction with U6snRNP, that would remain impaired in the CFTR WT+ C &#x0003e; G U1 system whilst it would be unimpeded in the CFTR WT3 mutant. This hypothesis cannot, however, explain the recovery of CFTR WT2 pseudoexon recognition (although at very low levels) in the presence of C &#x0003e; G U1. However, in this case it may well be found that the very extended complementarity between the CFTR WT2 sequence and the C &#x0003e; G U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, lower right schematic diagram) may still promote donor-site usage. It should also be noted that the level of splicing recovery is considerably less than the one obtained for the NF-1 exon 3 donor site in the presence of C &#x0003e; G U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, compare lanes 2 and 6) although there is an even greater complementarity between CFTR WT2 with the C &#x0003e; G U1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, compare boxes 1 and 4). Taken together, all these differences suggest that the secondary structure may represent an additional constraint to the use of this splicing system.</p><p>Further investigating the relationship between secondary structure and this 5&#x02032;ss donor-site usage would nonetheless represent a very difficult task as modifications introduced to change the folding of the stem structure involved would also affect donor-site strength and possibly activate the nearby donor consensus elements.

Even more strikingly, pseudoexon inclusion is almost completely abolished in the CFTR Del1 mutant when transfected in Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, right panel, lane 2). It should also be noted that the Del1 deletion changes only slightly the predicted strength of the 3&#x02032;splice site of the CFTR pseudoexon (from a score of 0.96 to 0.91 according to the NNSplice program), ruling out the possibility that this deletion may have simply affected the quality of this site. On the other hand, no effect on splicing efficiency with respect to the CFTR MUT could be observed for the Del2 mutant in transfected Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, right panel, lane 3) whilst a small increase (to 68% inclusion) was observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, left panel, lane 6). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of the two deletion mutants (CFTR Del1 and CFTR Del2) inserted in the PY7 system starting from the CFTR MUT plasmid.

In fact, pseudoexon inclusion in the CFTR Dis mutant fell to 30% in the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assay (from a 50% starting value of CFTR MUT <italic>in vitro</italic>) and to 64% inclusion in Hep3B cells (from a starting value of 93% inclusion for CFTR MUT in Hep3B cells). On the other hand, in keeping with the structural predictions, the CFTR Rep mutant fully recovered splicing efficiency with respect to the CFTR MUT construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, left panel lane 6 and right panel lane 3). These results were thus in keeping with the proposed regulatory role of RNA structure on CFTR pseudoexon inclusion. Furthermore, they demonstrated that conservation of the primary nucleotide sequences was not required.</p><p>Nonetheless, on the basis of secondary structure considerations alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) we also would have expected the Del1 and Del2 mutants to have similar effects on splicing efficiency. It was therefore of interest to check whether the splicing changes detected could be correlated with unforeseeable differential structural rearrangements introduced by these two mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural analysis of the CFTR Del1-Del2 mutants</title><p>The results of the structural analysis performed on the Del1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) showed that this RNA displayed a markedly different RNAse profile with respect to the CFTR MUT profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) and CFTR Del2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). In particular, with the exception of the 5&#x02032;ss region, there is very little conservation in cleavage pattern profiles between the CFTR Del1 mutant and the CFTR MUT, CFTR Del2 mutants. As shown in the schematic diagrams below, these results are in keeping with the predicted Del1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E) that includes the 5&#x02032;pe, 5&#x02032;ss, and 3&#x02032;pe in a stem configuration, presumably making them less available to the splicing machinery. On the other hand, the cleavage pattern obtained for the Del2 mutant is very similar to that obtained for the MUT sequence (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and C), up to the conservation of several RT stops indicated by arrows. Finally, in support of the structural changes detected in the Del1/Del2 mutants it has to be noted that the cleavages in correspondence to the 5&#x02032;ss position are mostly conserved in all three structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, B and C, 5&#x02032;ss region), demonstrating that the differences in cleavage efficiencies for the different mutants do not represent an artifactual occurrence owing to different RNAse activities/efficiencies in the three analyses. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) The enzymatic structure determination profiles of the CFTR MUT, CFTR Del1 and CFTR Del2 RNAs using RNAse digestion with the S1, V1 and T1 enzymes.

In addition, these results also highlight the &#x02018;unpredictability&#x02019; of mutations aimed to modify RNA structural elements. In fact, based just on the 2D structural predictions the Del1 and Del2 mutations should have resulted in similar effects. The fact that limited RNAse digestion analysis showed this not to be the case underscores the need for direct experimental testing of secondary structures whenever evaluating the potential effects of introduced mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Pre-mRNA secondary structure is increasingly recognized as a general modifier of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, evaluating its influence on the processing of individual exons is often a very difficult task and any research on RNA structures within coding regions is complicated by the need to rule out additional sources of bias. These include conservation of coding potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52">50&#x02013;52</xref>), the vast array of positive and negative cis-acting sequences that are now known to be present in most coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), and that the RNA structure itself can be heavily influenced by RNA&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Indeed, to this date very few examples exist regarding the existence of splicing-regulatory secondary structures residing entirely within exonic coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It is difficult to assess if this scant representation of secondary structure is a feature of exons or the fact that they have never been extensively searched for, particularly in view of the laborious task of confirming unreliable computer predictions in naked RNA and the almost impossibility up to now of probing structure <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hopefully, the recent increase in sequencing data from many different organisms coupled with ever more refined folding algorithms and new technologies for gene expression visualization will allow researchers to identify additional likely examples of regulatory structural elements within mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It is also very possible that the often highly intricate network of regulatory processes embedded in exons/introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55 B56 B57 B58">55&#x02013;58</xref>) and the need for the processed mRNA molecule to be translated, have all contributed to keep the 5&#x02032;ss and 3&#x02032;ss of real exons in regions of limited RNA structure.</p><p>Many of these limitations, of course, do not apply to intronic or non-coding sequences. Indeed, conserved stem-loop regions within introns have been recently shown to play a role in the pre-mRNA splicing processes of human <italic>SMN</italic> exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), human <italic>COL2A1</italic> exon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), in the highly conserved insect <italic>homeothorax</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) and in the yeast <italic>YRA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). In addition, the structure-forming ability of introns has been very useful to explain a whole range of splicing phenomena that would otherwise be difficult to explain if the pre-mRNA molecule was considered as existing in a predominantly linear form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>).</p><p>In this work we have studied the importance of RNA secondary structure in pseudoexon inclusion events that are involved in human disease. These pseudoexons originate from the inclusion of apparently random intronic sequences following the introduction of an activating mutation, in general the creation of a novel acceptor or donor splice site although new observations also include modifications within splicing regulatory elements (see Supplementary Table 1 for a comprehensive list of these events). Our investigation of an event that concerns the deletion of a splicing suppressing element in the <italic>ATM</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) or of a splice-site creation event in the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) has shown that in both cases RNA secondary structure plays a major role on donor-site usage and splicing efficiency.</p><p>Moreover, our results concerning the reasons that underlie the lack of use of an apparently viable 5&#x02032;ss splice site in the CFTR genomic sequence has suggested that the RNA secondary structure may play a role of inhibiting post U1snRNP interactions, such as that with U6snRNP, by providing an additional inhibitory influence on the suboptimal +5 position. In this respect, therefore, our observations confirm previous suggestions that RNA secondary structures may have a general inhibitory effect on pseudoexon sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In fact, the presence of potentially fully functional splice-site sequences within the intronic sequences of most genes clearly shows that at least some of these sequences would not really be expected to wait for an activating mutation in order to be partially included in the final mRNA molecule. However, if these splice-site sequences find themselves bracketing sequences containing binding sites for splicing inhibitor molecules or, like in our cases, embedded into unfavourable RNA structures, then an explanation can be offered regarding why additional requirements have to be satisfied in order to obtain their &#x02018;upgrade&#x02019; to exon status (for example, their presence in an &#x02018;open&#x02019; structural configuration). The difficulty in evaluating these events on the basis of the primary sequence alone can also be appreciated from the performance of 5&#x02032;ss scoring programs used in this work. In fact, beside the MaxEnt Scan evaluation methods that consider the MAG|GURAGU (M is A or C; R is purine) consensus sequence even methods such as NNsplice that consider in their evaluation sequences beyond the strict consensus fail to accurately predict the exact donor-site usage observed in our experimental systems. Our results will hopefully provide further information to facilitate the fine tuning of these splice-site prediction algorithms.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that RNA secondary structure may not represent the only determining factor in the ATM or CFTR pseudoexons, as highlighted by some of our experiments (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) where the structure-affecting mutations also cause a drop in overall splicing efficiency of the pseudoexon. These results raise the possibility that splicing controlling elements may also be affected by these changes. In the future, it will be interesting to study in selected examples the potential interplay between RNA structural features and potential enhancer and silencer splicing controlling regions present in the pseudoexon of the type already demonstrated in the fibronectin EDA exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Indeed, the role played by splicing factors in pseudoexon inclusion is a promising issue that remains to be fully investigated in the splicing field. In fact, in at least a minority of cases pseudoexon inclusion has been strongly correlated with creation of splicing regulatory enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>). A similar situation may be present for nucleotide variations that remove the binding site for splicing inhibitory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, our work suggests that taking into account structural features may represent a useful strategy to understand the functional mechanisms that underlie the activation of pseudoexon sequences in other genes causing human genetic diseases. This may be important also for attempting novel molecular therapy approaches to modify the regulation of pseudoexon inclusion events and for refining computer algorithms for the prediction of the splicing effect of any genomic variation. In fact, from a molecular therapy point of view the mapping of pseudoexon RNA secondary structures may provide useful indications regarding the development of inhibitory molecules such as antisense nucleotide that have already been suggested to possess increased working efficiency when targeted against open structural regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm447_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm447_nar-00764-a-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank C.W.
