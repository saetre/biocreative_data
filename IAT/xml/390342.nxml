In humans, mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene are the major cause of Rett syndrome. By searching expressed sequence tag (EST) databases we have found a novel MeCP2 splice isoform (MeCP2&#x003b1;) which encodes a distinct N-terminus. We demonstrate that the MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA splice variant is more abundant than the previously annotated MeCP2 mRNA (MeCP2&#x003b2;) in mouse tissues and human brain. Furthermore, MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA has an upstream open reading frame that inhibits its translation. As a result of these differences, &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of MeCP2 in mouse brain is MeCP2&#x003b1;. Both protein isoforms are nuclear and colocalize with densely methylated heterochromatic foci in mouse cells. The presence of a previously unknown MeCP2 isoform has implications for the genetic screening of Rett syndrome patients and for studies of the functional significance of MeCP2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In vertebrate genomes, 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) accounts for &#x0223c;1&#x00025; of all DNA bases. The minor base arises by post-synthetic modification of cytosine, usually in the context of a CpG dinucleotide that is symmetrically methylated on both strands of DNA. A family of proteins that specifically bind to a methylated CpG pair share a conserved methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c1">1</xref>). MeCP2 is the founder member of the MBD protein family and is present in all tested vertebrates. Currently two conserved functional domains have been mapped in MeCP2: the MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c2">2</xref>), which specifically targets MeCP2 to methylated DNA sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c5">5</xref>), and the transcription repression domain (TRD), which is the minimal domain required to repress transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c10">10</xref>). MeCP2 repression is sensitive to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA, indicating that deacetylation may contribute to repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c12">12</xref>). GST pulldowns and partial multiprotein complex purification from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes suggest that the TRD interacts with the mSin3A/HDAC co-repressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c12">12</xref>). As TSA partially alleviates repression, HDAC-independent mechanisms of repression are likely to exist. For example, MeCP2 has been shown to associate with histone methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c13">13</xref>). Other HDAC-independent transcriptional repression mechanisms, involving interactions of the TRD with basal transcriptional repression machinery, have also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene are the primary cause of Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c15">15</xref>), a neurological disorder that occurs in one in 10&#x000a0;000&#x02013;22&#x000a0;000 female births. After an initial window of normal development, girls acquire a variety of symptoms including microcephaly, autism, ataxia, stereotypic hand movements, seizures and hyperventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c16">16</xref>). A wide spectrum of mutations have been mapped throughout the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene, including sites outside the MBD and TRD regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c17">17</xref>). MeCP2 is also essential in mice, as <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null animals have a period of normal postnatal development followed by hindlimb clasping, irregular breathing, reduced mobility and death at around 8 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c19">19</xref>). Mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutations phenotypically mimic several features of Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Initially, MeCP2 protein was purified from rat brain as a single 84 kDa protein based on its binding to methylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c21">21</xref>). The results of Edman degradation allowed the design of a degenerate probe which was then used to screen a cDNA library and isolate full-length MeCP2 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c21">21</xref>). Later, the mouse <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene was mapped to Xq28 and shown to be subject to X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c22">22</xref>). Further analysis of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcript identified alternative polyadenylation sites that give rise to two main mRNA variants with different 3&#x02032;UTRs (10 kb and 2 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c23">23</xref>). At this time <italic>Mecp2</italic> was annotated as a three-exon gene, with all exons contributing to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c23">23</xref>). Sequencing of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> genomic locus in mouse and human combined with more detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed an additional upstream non-coding exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c24">24</xref>). <italic>Mecp2</italic> is therefore currently recognized as a four-exon gene. Here we report the additional complication that MeCP2 is subject to alternative splicing generating two different N-termini, one of which is significantly more abundant than the other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Different isoforms encoding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found using the NCBI BLAST program.

Prior to cDNA synthesis RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega). cDNA was synthesized by annealing 5 &#x000b5;g of total RNA and 5 &#x000b5;g random hexanucleotides (Amersham) at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Then RT mix &#x0005b;final 1&#x000d7; reaction buffer, 40 U RNAasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 1 mM dNTP&#x0005d; was added and the solution was incubated for 5 min at 25&#x000b0;C. After addition of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RNase H Minus, Promega) the 25 &#x000b5;l reaction mix was incubated for 10 min at 25&#x000b0;C and 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubating for 10 min at 70&#x000b0;C. The reaction mixture was diluted to 500 &#x000b5;l, and 2.5 &#x000b5;l was used for PCRs.

In brief, mouse ES cells were plated on non-adhesive plates without LIF. In these conditions ES cells form embryoid bodies which contain different cell lineage progenitors. Later, embryoid bodies were cultured in the presence of retinoic acid, which was shown to increase the efficiency of neuronal differentiation. In the final stage embryoid bodies were dissociated and cells were plated on serum-free N2 medium which promotes final differentiation and survival of neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis used the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; recommendations.

Alignments revealed that ESTs can be grouped into two categories depending on the presence (BY107013, BI409371) or absence (CA980031, BY244111) of exon 2. Human MECP2 cDNAs with (BC11612, BM923600) and without (BG706068, BI458175) exon 2 also exist in human EST databases. As exon 2 contains the ATG for the initiation of translation, we considered the possibility that the transcript lacking exon 2 is a non-coding RNA. However exon 1 contains an ATG that in the absence of exon 2 initiates a potential open reading frame (ORF) of 501 amino acids (aa) in mice and 498 aa in humans (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh349tb1">1</xref>). We designate the new exon 2-minus isoform as MeCP2&#x003b1; and the previously described isoform containing exon 2 as MeCP2&#x003b2;. Alignment of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; predicted protein sequences demonstrates identity except at the extreme N-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f1">1</xref>a and b). The MeCP2&#x003b1; N-terminus contains polyalanine and polyglycine repeat tracts encoded by GCC and GGA trinucleotides. Comparison of these isoforms with other vertebrate MeCP2 sequences showed that MeCP2&#x003b1; shares a polyalanine tract, serine-glycine residues and EERL motifs with <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish MeCP2 sequences, whereas MeCP2&#x003b2; lacks these features. The alignment suggested that MeCP2&#x003b1; more closely resembles the ancestral form of MeCP2 than does MeCP2&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f1">1</xref>c). We have searched the non-mammalian EST databases and failed to find any &#x003b2;-isoform-like EST. Furthermore, examination of zebrafish and <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> genomic sequences surrounding the MeCP2 gene revealed exon 1 (&#x003b1;), but no potential exon 2 (&#x003b2;). We conclude that the &#x003b2; isoform is either absent or highly diverged compared with the mammalian &#x003b2; sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>MeCP2&#x003b1; is the major mRNA splice variant <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To confirm <italic>in silico</italic> evidence and assess the relative abundance of the different MeCP2 isoforms <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of cDNA derived from different mouse tissues. The two primers were designed to anneal to exon 1 and exon 3, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f2">2</xref>a). Control amplification of mixed MeCP2&#x003b1; and MeCP2&#x003b2; encoding plasmids showed no significant amplification bias towards the shorter product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f2">2</xref>a). RT&#x02013;PCR analysis demonstrated that MeCP2&#x003b1; is more abundant than MeCP2&#x003b2; in most tissues. Relative abundance of MeCP2&#x003b1; was highest in the brain, thymus and lung, whereas an approximately 1:1 isoform ratio was seen in testis and liver. The RT&#x02013;PCRs (32 cycles) were not saturating and therefore were responsive to template concentration. This was verified for each tissue sample by showing that fewer (30) or more (34) cycles generated less or more product, respectively (data not shown). Similar semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCRs provided evidence that both splice variants also exist in human brain; again, the predominant form of mRNA encodes MECP2&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f2">2</xref>b).</p><p>To analyse the abundance of the two isoforms during cellular differentiation, we differentiated mouse ES cells into neurons. Samples from stages of differentiation were assayed for the different isoforms. Semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR showed that MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA is more abundant than MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA in ES cells and the proportion of &#x003b1; mRNA appeared to increase during neuronal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f2">2</xref>c).</p></sec><sec><title>The MeCP2&#x003b1; splice variant is more efficiently translated <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Having established that the MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA splice isoform is abundant in mouse tissues and human brain, we next asked whether MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA is translated <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this, we transfected tail fibroblasts from <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c18">18</xref>) with plasmid constructs containing &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-isoform cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>a). Western blotting with a C-terminal MeCP2 antibody showed that MeCP2&#x003b1; is successfully translated, but we consistently observed only very low amounts of MeCP2&#x003b2; in independent transfections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>b). As a potential explanation, we noted a short ORF (39 aa) within the 5&#x02032;UTR region of MeCP2&#x003b2; that could potentially interfere with its translation. The short ORF starts from the AUG that initiates translation of the MeCP2&#x003b1; isoform, but in MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA this ORF terminates due to alternative splicing 55 nt (in mouse) upstream of the bona fide MeCP2&#x003b2; translation start site. To test for interference of the upstream ORF, we introduced a point mutation that changed the upstream ATG to AAG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>a) and expressed the wild-type and mutant versions of MeCP2&#x003b2; in fibroblasts. Northern blots probed with MeCP2 cDNA showed that similar amounts of mRNA were produced from transfected wild-type MeCP2&#x003b1;, MeCP2&#x003b2; and mutant MeCP2&#x003b2; plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>c, lanes 1&#x02013;3). As before, MeCP2&#x003b1; was efficiently synthesized, but a negligible amount of MeCP2&#x003b2; protein was translated from the wild-type cDNA construct. Mutation of the upstream ATG, however, led to a dramatic increase in the amount of translated MeCP2&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>c, lanes 1&#x02013;3).</p><p>Our results indicate that the MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA is more abundant than MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA, but also that MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA is inefficiently translated. Together, these findings suggest that MeCP2&#x003b1; protein will be much more abundant than MeCP2&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this prediction, we took advantage of the different sizes of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; protein isoforms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh349tb1">1</xref>). A high-resolution SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel of <italic>in vivo</italic> translated &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; forms confirmed that they migrate differently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>c). Cotransfection of equal amounts of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-isoform expression constructs showed that MeCP2&#x003b1; is greatly over- represented among the translation products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>c, lanes 4 and 5). To investigate whether native MeCP2 also contains predominantly MeCP2&#x003b1;, we loaded different amounts of mouse brain nuclear extract on the same gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f3">3</xref>c, lanes 8&#x02013;10). MeCP2&#x003b2; protein could be detected only with higher amounts of nuclear extract loaded. We estimate conservatively that the MeCP2&#x003b1; protein is at least 10-fold more abundant than MeCP2&#x003b2; in mouse brain extracts. An alternative hypothetical explanation for the difference might be that MeCP2&#x003b2; is poorly extracted from brain nuclei compared with MeCP2&#x003b1;. Given our evidence that MeCP2&#x003b2; mRNA is not only less abundant in brain, but also much less well translated than MeCP2&#x003b1; mRNA, we consider it likely that the data accurately reflect the rarity of the &#x003b2; isoform <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of different MeCP2 isoforms in mouse cells</title><p>The majority of methylated DNA in mouse cell nuclei is in repeated major satellite sequences, which exhibit punctate staining with DAPI. In mouse cells MeCP2&#x003b2; has previously been shown to colocalize with DAPI bright spots in a DNA methylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c4">4</xref>). To compare localization of the different MeCP2 isoforms in mouse cells, we transfected <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null tail fibroblasts with plasmids expressing the &#x003b1; or &#x003b2; isoforms and stained with an MeCP2 antibody that recognizes the invariant C-terminal domain. Both isoforms were nuclear and colocalized with DAPI bright spots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f4">4</xref>). The construct encoding the &#x003b2; isoform included the upstream ORF that inhibits translation. Accordingly the number of cells that expressed detectable protein was very low. By comparison, parallel transfections with the &#x003b1; construct gave a much higher percentage of nuclei with easily detectable punctate expression of MeCP2. A few &#x003b1; transfected cells expressed very high protein levels that resulted in saturating fluorescence throughout the nucleus. We suspect that these cells and the few &#x003b2; cells expressing detectable &#x003b2;MeCP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh349f4">4</xref>, top panel) received by chance a large dose of the transfected expression construct. These experiments reveal no functional difference between &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; MeCP2 isoforms at the level of cellular localization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report a new splice variant of the MeCP2 gene which we designate MeCP2&#x003b1;. MeCP2&#x003b1; is more similar to frog and zebrafish MeCP2 sequences than the currently known isoform MeCP2&#x003b2;. These findings suggest that MeCP2&#x003b1; is more closely related to the ancestral form of MeCP2 and that the appearance of exon 2 may be a relatively recent event in the evolution of the mammalian gene. The differing size and charge of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms permits their separation by gel electrophoresis. This allowed us to demonstrate that both isoforms exist in mouse brain, but that MeCP2&#x003b1; is by far the dominant form. The predominance of MeCP2&#x003b1; can be partly accounted for by the greater abundance of its transcript. In addition, we demonstrate translational interference by an upstream ORF in mRNA of the &#x003b2; isoform. Translational interference by upstream ORFs is well established and has been shown to depend on the distance between the upstream ORF and the AUG of the downstream ORF and also on the structure of 5&#x02032;UTR RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c29">29</xref>). It is not known whether translational interference of this kind can be modulated in vertebrates as a means of regulating protein synthesis.</p><p>The existence of the new isoform has implications for the study of Rett syndrome. Exon 1 was previously thought to be non-coding and has therefore been excluded from many mutational screening programmes. Our finding emphasizes the need for routine inclusion of exon 1 in these screens. Because MeCP2&#x003b1; is the predominant isoform, introduction of a nonsense or frameshift mutation would remove &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of total MeCP2. This may result in classical Rett syndrome, a milder variant form of Rett syndrome or a related condition such as autism or X-linked mental retardation. We note that the MeCP2&#x003b1; N-terminus contains polyalanine and polyglycine sequences that are encoded by repeated GCC and GGA codons respectively. Expansion of a GCC trinucleotide sequence in the FMR2 gene is reported to cause FRAXE mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c30">30</xref>) and an equivalent expansion may in theory contribute to Rett syndrome. It is noteworthy that no Rett syndrome mutations in exon 2 have been described. It is possible that exon 2 mutations, which would only affect MeCP2&#x003b2;, are compensated by the more abundant MeCP2&#x003b1; isoform and would therefore have a much less severe phenotypic consequence.</p><p>Most previous research on MeCP2 function has utilized the MeCP2&#x003b2; isoform, which we now report to be a minor form <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that MeCP2 localization in mouse cells is the same for both isoforms, at least in cultured cells. Also, the alternative N-terminus is located outside the previously described functional domains MBD and TRD. It is therefore unlikely that either MBD or TRD function is affected by the N-terminus. Indeed, human MECP2&#x003b2; alone was able to successfully rescue MeCP2 deficiency in frog embryos, whose endogenous protein more closely resembles MeCP2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c31">31</xref>). Consequently, we expect that the functions of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms may overlap significantly. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that the two isoforms exert somewhat distinct functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, the MeCP2&#x003b1; N-terminus contains a conserved serine residue that is absent in MeCP2&#x003b2; and which could be a target of phosphorylation. Recently, MeCP2 phosphorylation has been shown to accompany induction of <italic>bdnf</italic> transcription in cultured mouse neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh349c33">33</xref>). It may be of future interest to determine the functional significance of differing MeCP2 N-termini by the creation of isoform-specific gene disruptions in mice.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh349f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alternative splicing of MeCP2 mRNA.

An SV-40 promoter and artificial intron is followed by the MeCP2 5&#x02032;UTR, coding sequence, 3&#x02032;UTR, MeCP2 polyadenylation signal and SV40 polyadenylation signal. MeCP2 exons are numbered below each map. The start codon of the wild-type upstream ORF in MeCP2&#x003b2; is labeled as ATG (middle diagram) and is mutated to AAG in the MeCP2&#x003b2; ATG-AAG construct (bottom diagram).

Two independent plasmid preparations were used for each type of transfection (MeCP2&#x003b1;, lanes 1 and 2; MeCP2&#x003b2;, lanes 3 and 4).

MeCP2&#x003b1; is the predominant isoform in mouse brain nuclear extract (lanes 8, 9 and 10). The northern blot (lower panel) showed that different levels of translated MeCP2 protein are not due to differential transcription of the constructs, as similar amounts of MeCP2 mRNA were seen in lanes 1&#x02013;3.
