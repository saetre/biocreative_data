We have identified a novel effector-binding site from crystal structures of the <italic>apo</italic> protein, complexes with a variety of amino acid effectors, X-ray based ligand screening and qualitative fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. The new effector site is in addition to the structural characterization of another distinct site in the protein conserved in the related AsnC-family of regulators. The structures reveal that the ligand-binding loops of two crystallographically independent subunits adopt different conformations to generate two distinct effector-binding sites. A change in the conformation of the binding site loop 100&#x02013;106 in the B subunit is apparently necessary for octameric association and also allows the loop to interact with a bound ligand in the newly identified effector-binding site. There are four sites of each kind in the octamer and the protein preferentially binds to aromatic amino acids. While amino acids like <italic>Phe, Tyr</italic> and <italic>Trp</italic> exhibit binding to only one site, <italic>His</italic> exhibits binding to both sites. Binding of <italic>Phe</italic> is accompanied by a conformational change of 3.7 &#x000c5; in the 75&#x02013;83 loop, which is advantageously positioned to control formation of higher oligomers. Taken together, the present studies suggest an elegant control mechanism for global transcription regulation involving binding of ligands to the two sites, individually or collectively.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is a successful pathogen mainly because of its ability to persist in the human host for several years while evading the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The <italic>rv3291c</italic> gene codes for an Lrp/AsnC (leucine responsive regulatory protein/regulator of asparigine synthase C gene product) type global transcriptional regulator (MtbLrp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and belongs to the large family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. It has been suggested that Lrp/AsnC type proteins should more appropriately be called feast/famine regulatory proteins because of their involvement in regulation of metabolic pathways in response to the availability of amino acids and nitrogen bases in the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These proteins are also involved in DNA bending, condensation of DNA into globular nucleo-protein structures, chromosome structure and organization, among other roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Individual subunits of these proteins have a molecular weight of &#x0223c;17 kDa and are divided into two domains namely DNA and effector-binding domains which occur at the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The DNA-binding domain contains the helix-turn-helix motif while the effector-binding domain is also involved in oligomeric interactions. Higher order assemblies usually exist as multiples of dimers and include formation of tetramers, octamers, dodecamers and chromatin-like cylinders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">5&#x02013;9</xref>). How these proteins translate the effector-binding event to the protein&#x02013;DNA-binding site is unclear. Some global regulators like the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Lrp, which reportedly controls over 10% of all genes, are known to bind to a variety of amino acids including leucine, alanine, valine, proline and lysine, whose binding can effect a positive/negative regulation of the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). On the other hand, local regulation involving proteins like AsnC, is controlled by the binding of a specific effector molecule like asparigine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It has been suggested that binding of appropriate ligands, primarily amino acids, can effect functionally relevant tertiary structure conformational changes or to oligomeric association. Thus a small number of such regulators found in archaea and bacteria can regulate a large number of genes in response to the environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this, rv3291c has a molecular weight of &#x0223c;18 kDa and has been found to be up-regulated 15-fold in nutrition starved tuberculosis models designed to mimic the latent/persistent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Our earlier sequence analysis and initial characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) suggested that it belongs to the Lrp-family of regulators. It lies in the genomic region upstream of <italic>sigF</italic> involved in mycobacterial stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and its expression has also been observed on inhibition of septum formation and is inversely proportional to bacterial growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). More recently, in <italic>Mycobacterium fortuitum</italic>, the homologous gene was been found to be highly conserved and <italic>in vivo</italic> screening involving a murine infection model of persistence using this pathogen led to the identification of a mutant where this gene was disrupted. It was found that the mutation affected the ability of the pathogen to persist in the kidney in the model (personal communication, Dr R. Srivastava, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India). The above data suggest that the protein is important for maintenance/adaptation to long-term persistence although it is not essential for growth under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Rv3291c therefore has the potential to be an important therapeutic target for developing strategies to counter persistence of the disease.</p><p>Structurally characterized examples of the Lrp/AsnC-family of transcription regulators includes the <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC complexed to asparigine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), <italic>Neisseria Meningitides</italic> Lrp complexed to leucine and methionine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> LrpC and related archaeal regulators LrpA from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> and <italic>P. sp OT3 FL11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). A comparison of the changes that occur upon effector binding could not be addressed in the AsnC structure due to the absence of the <italic>apo</italic> structure. The complexes with the <italic>N. meningitides</italic> regulator did not reveal significant changes to tertiary structure on amino acid binding. A sequence analysis of Lrp and AsnC type regulators show that the protein sub-families exhibit larger differences in the C-terminal/effector binding domain with an overall sequence identity of &#x0223c;25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) reflecting differences in effector binding between the protein sub-families.</p><p>Many aspects of structure and function-like variations in individual regulation mechanism are currently unclear; as also how ligand binding affects interactions with DNA and whether ligand binding effects significant changes to the tertiary structure. In the initial part of this work we report the X-ray structure of the <italic>apo</italic> MtbLrp solved through MIRAS methods. The protein associates as a tetramer of dimers to form an octamer. Fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray co-crystal structures show that MtbLrp binds to a variety of amino acids. We used X-ray screening-based approaches to determine that the protein preferentially binds to aromatic amino acids and also were able to rank their order of preference. In the present structures we have identified a new small molecule-binding site at the dimer interface (called &#x02018;type II&#x02019;) in addition to the previously reported effector-binding site in the related <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC and <italic>N. meningitides</italic> Lrp complexes (called &#x02018;type I&#x02019;). Both sites apparently have different preferences for ligand molecules. While amino acids like <italic>Phe, Leu</italic> and <italic>Trp</italic> bind to the site previously reported in the <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC regulator, <italic>His</italic> binds to both sites in MtbLrp. The ligands occupy only 4 out of 8 possible sites of type I in contrast to full occupancy in the earlier reported complexes. There is a change in the binding site loop conformation in the unoccupied type I sites which lets the same loop interact with the bound histidine in type II binding sites while preventing ligand binding at site I. Taken together, the present studies suggest an elegant control mechanism for global transcription regulation involving binding of ligands to the two sites, individually or collectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Overexpression and purification</title><p>Rv3291c was cloned, expressed and purified as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Briefly the PCR-amplified construct was ligated into pET21d (M/s Novagen) vector between the NcoI and HindIII sites. <italic>His</italic>-tagged protein, with the tag at the C-terminal end, was purified by standard procedures after transforming the plasmid into BL21 (DE3) cells. The protein was concentrated to &#x0223c;20 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA after size exclusion chromatography using Superdex-200 HR 10/30 (M/s Amersham). Protein concentrations were determined as per the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization, data collection and structure determination</title><p>The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop technique by equilibrating protein drops against reservoirs containing 100 mM MES pH 6.0, 0.75 M lithium acetate at 22&#x000b0;C. Heavy atoms were screened by band shift assays on a native gel. Crystals were soaked in appropriate heavy atom solutions for varying times and concentrations. Data were collected using a Rigaku RU300 X-ray generator coupled with MAR345 detector or alternatively with MAR345-DTB detector on crystals mounted in quartz capillaries at room temperature. Data were processed using MOSFLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) implemented in the CCP4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and collection parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. While crystals of the <italic>apo</italic> protein diffract to 2.5 &#x000c5; resolutions, the crystals of the <italic>Phe</italic> complex diffract to 2.2 &#x000c5;.</p><p>Extensive molecular replacement calculations using available archaeal and bacterial Lrp structures were inconclusive. Phases were therefore calculated by MIRAS methods using the SOLVE/RESOLVE package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>) using three derivatives; the first one being silver nitrate, (crystals soaked in 80 mM solution for 2 days) and the latter two data sets from potassium tetra-chloro-platinate (2.0 mM, overnight soak) and cadmium iodide (1.7 mM, 1 h soak) derivatives. The solution output by SOLVE had a figure of merit 0.28 before solvent flattening and this went up to 0.68 after density modification and phase extension using RESOLVE. The structure solution parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 1a. RESOLVE could trace &#x0223c;15% of the residues. The map quality was sufficient to trace the remaining chains manually using TURBO&#x02013;FRODO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Refinements were carried out using REFMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) after setting aside &#x0223c;10% of the reflections for monitoring the free R-factor. Structures of the complexes were solved using difference Fourier techniques. Omit maps were examined to avoid bias. Quality of the structures was checked using PROCHECK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and the geometric parameters as also the Ramachandran plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) falls into acceptable ranges.</p></sec><sec><title>X-ray screening for ligands</title><p>Crystals were grown under above conditions, except that an amino acid mixture corresponding to 2 mM each of the following amino acids namely <italic>Phe, His, Leu, Trp, Met</italic> and <italic>Tyr</italic>, were added to the crystallization drop.

The next rounds of crystallization were carried out serially using only the remaining compounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative fluorescence spectroscopy studies</title><p>A qualitative analysis of the amino acid binding was carried out using competitive displacement of ANS (1-Anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate) from the protein by the respective ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). A Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences LS 50B fluorescence spectrophotometer was used in the experiments at 25&#x000b0;C. The excitation wavelength used was 380 nM and the emission was monitored between 400 and 600 nM, respectively. Excitation and emission slit widths were kept at 7 nM, respectively. All samples were incubated for 2 h under specified conditions before recording the spectra. Initially the protein (1 &#x000b5;M) was titrated against 0&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;M ANS to determine its optimal concentration for subsequent experiments. In the displacement experiments 1 &#x000b5;M of protein incubated with 10 &#x000b5;M ANS was titrated with 0&#x02013;25 mM of respective ligands. An inhibitor namely cyclohexylmethyl amine derivative, of Lysine &#x003b5;-aminotransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), a totally unrelated protein, was used as a control compound which should not exhibit any binding to the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Analysis of the inter-subunit contacts and ligand&#x02013;protein interactions, accessible surface area, etc. were carried out using CONTACTS and other tools implemented in the CCP4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

The size of the protein was consistent with a stable octameric association in size exclusion chromatography experiments. Extensive molecular replacement calculations using the coordinates of previously reported archaeal Lrp structures were unsuccessful. We consequently used MIRAS approaches to solve the structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). Structure solution and data collection statistics are given in Supplementary Table 1a. There are two independent subunits in the asymmetric unit, which form a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). This dimer subsequently forms an octamer through crystal symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). Each subunit of rv3291c (MtbLrp) folds into two distinct domains joined by a rather long linker as observed in other structural examples of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain which initially forms a helix (residues 6&#x02013;17) and subsequently folds into an helix-turn-helix motif (residues 24&#x02013;48) observed earlier also in other structures from this protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) (A structure-based sequence alignment is in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A rather long linker (residues 48&#x02013;60) consisting of a &#x003b2;-strand and a helical stretch then brings the chain to the effector-binding domain. This latter domain is involved extensively in oligomeric interactions and contains four &#x003b2;-strands and two &#x003b1;-helices arranged in a &#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; topology (between residues 66 and 137). The chain ends in a &#x003b2;-strand (residues 139&#x02013;143), which interacts with the &#x003b2;2 strand of the dimeric counterpart to form a five-stranded curved sheet in the dimer. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Crystal structure of MtbLrp.

The maximum displacements of 3.4 and 1.7 &#x000c5; are centered at <italic>Ser</italic>79 and <italic>Glu</italic>103, respectively. When the subunits were superposed onto each other in the oligomer it became clear that the conformational changes are necessary for octamer association as otherwise it would lead to unacceptable steric contacts. The respective DNA-binding domains of each subunit of the octamer face the outside of the tightly packed oligomeric structure. This is in line with its observed role in formation of nucleo-protein structures and packaging of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).

The ligand-binding site is partially formed by residues 100&#x02013;106 of subunit A containing a conserved <italic>Gly</italic> (<italic>Gly</italic> 102 in MtbLrp) and also residues from symmetry related subunits in the octamer. This <italic>Gly</italic> is a conserved sequence feature in the respective binding sites of ACT/RAM domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a shows a close-up of the interactions of <italic>Phe</italic> in its complex which is also tabulated (Supplementary Table 2a).

In contrast to earlier complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), only 4 sites out of 8 possible ligand-binding sites were occupied and binding to the other sites was precluded due to the conformational changes discussed above. The side chain of the ligand is stabilized mainly by &#x02018;van der Waals&#x02019; interactions including those with <italic>Arg</italic>126, <italic>Tyr</italic>106, <italic>Asp</italic>82, <italic>Ser</italic>105 and <italic>Ser</italic>99.

The main chain O and N atoms of <italic>Gly</italic>102, the conserved binding site residue mentioned above, interacts with the main chain N and carboxylate atoms of the ligand. Main chain N of the bound ligand also forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain O of <italic>Val</italic>100 and <italic>Glu</italic>104, respectively.

In the latter structure also a change in the conformation of the loop 75&#x02013;83, albeit to a lesser extent than in the <italic>Phe</italic> complex was observed.

The side chain is quite flexible as shown by the lack of clear density for it beyond the C&#x003b2; atom and exhibits only non-bonded interactions with the protein. A similar situation was observed in the complexes with <italic>Arg, Pro, Thr</italic> and <italic>Gln</italic> with which co-crystals could be obtained and the electron density maps reveal weak density at the position of the main chain atoms seen in the earlier structures (data not shown). It was therefore concluded that these amino acids exhibit weak binding to the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>X-ray based ligand screening</title><p>In an effort to identify the amino acids for which the protein has a natural affinity, we used X-ray based ligand screening as a tool where small molecules, which have the highest affinity for the protein are competitively selected from the crystallization solution. These screening techniques are sensitive in detecting and differentiating between even weakly binding small molecule fragments to a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). We used this technique to characterize relative binding affinities of different amino acids to MtbLrp. Accordingly we crystallized the protein from a solution containing amino acids which showed well-defined density for at least the main chain and C&#x003b2; atoms in their respective co-crystal structures. The solution initially contained <italic>Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Met</italic> and <italic>His</italic>. Crystals from the first round of experiments had unambiguous density for <italic>Phe</italic>, which was additionally confirmed by observing the displacement of the 75&#x02013;83 loop observed in its complex. In the next round of screening, <italic>Phe</italic> was removed from the crystallization solution and this time <italic>His</italic> was identified from the electron density maps. This was aided by the fact that <italic>His</italic> is the only amino acid in this set that binds to type II sites also. <italic>Tyr</italic> and <italic>Trp</italic> formed co-crystals in subsequent screening experiments followed by <italic>Met</italic>. Identification of the respective ligands from the electron density maps was straightforward as we could also compare the densities with those obtained earlier from single co-crystallization experiments. Thus the relative binding affinities were identified to be <italic>Phe</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>His</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>Tyr</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>Trp</italic>&#x0003e; <italic>Met</italic>&#x0003e;(<italic>Leu</italic>, others). MtbLrp was therefore deduced as having a preference for aromatic amino acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative fluorescence spectroscopy</title><p>We used competitive displacement of ANS by compounds being tested to qualitatively check the binding of the amino acids to MtbLrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Binding of the amino acids led to reduction in the observed fluorescence of bound ANS. An inhibitor, namely a cyclohexylmethyl amine derivative, of a completely unrelated protein, lysine &#x003b5;-amino transferase whose structure was reported by us recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) was used as a control compound, which should not bind to MtbLrp. As mentioned above, the binding exhibited by leucine can be rationalized by its co-crystal structure where only the main chain atoms are involved in binding to the protein. The spectroscopy results clearly support binding by a variety of amino acids. Taken in conjunction with the X-ray screening experiments, the results clearly demonstrate that MtbLrp preferentially binds aromatic amino acids. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Competitive displacement of ANS by (<bold>a</bold>) Phenylalanine, (<bold>b</bold>) histidine, (<bold>c</bold>) tryptophan and (<bold>d</bold>) cyclohexylmethylamine derivative compound used as a non-binding control.

The smallest functional unit of the protein is the dimer and we have modeled its mode of DNA interactions analogous to that reported earlier in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> LrpC and <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It can be conceptualized that multiple binding sites separated by non-binding regions in the DNA stretch can be threaded around the oligomer to form chromatin-like structures which have been observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The stable octameric association observed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC&#x02013;asparigine complex and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> LrpC structures, differences in the diameters of the octamers of the bacterial and archaeal LrpA, along with an analysis of reported binding sites in the promoter region led the authors to suggest a model where adjacent Lrp octamers could wrap DNA into a solenoid-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). When we map the change in the conformation of the loop 75&#x02013;83 in the presence of bound phenylalanine at site I, we find that the loop has an advantageous spatial disposition in the octamer to disrupt interactions with adjacent oligomers in the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b and c). This role for bound ligands at site I agree with earlier co-crystal structures with <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC and <italic>N. meningitides</italic> Lrp where binding of ligands to the site did not disrupt the octameric assembly. It also agrees with solution studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp, in which leucine-induced dissociation of hexadecamers into leucine-bound octamers by binding to a second distinct site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). On the other hand, interactions of a ligand with the newly identified site II can lead to a breakdown in octamer symmetry as detailed in the &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Model of DNA binding to MtbLrp dimer.

The crystal structures of the complexes and X-ray based ligand-screening techniques, supported by the fluorescence spectroscopy results demonstrate that rv3291c has a strong preference for aromatic amino acids and suggests an important role in the metabolism of the latter. It is interesting that the MtbLrp preferentially binds aromatic amino acids while other characterized Lrp proteins prefer effectors like <italic>Val, Leu, Ala</italic>, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Aromatic amino acids are known to be important for the viability of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In fact the enzymes in the Shikimate pathway, which is important for aromatic amino acid metabolism, have been recognized as important targets for anti-bacterial therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the present structures have led to the identification of a novel small molecule-binding site II at the protein intra-dimer interface. There are four possible sites of this kind in the octamer (a tetramer of dimers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a and b) and all sites are occupied in the structure with L-histidine. It is quite possible that other small molecules can also bind to the site. In fact histidine exhibits extensive water-mediated interactions with the protein and this structural water can be displaced to accommodate a bigger ligand also. It seems unlikely that effector molecules will disrupt the dimeric association; on the other hand a bound ligand at this site might effect small changes to the relative spatial disposition of the DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>e). These changes will be amplified in the octamer and can lead to either strengthening/weakening of interaction with DNA. It may also be recalled that the binding site loop 100&#x02013;106 of the B subunit interacts with the main chain atoms of <italic>His</italic> in its complex both directly and through water-mediated interactions. The conformation change observed in this loop is essential for octameric association in MtbLrp. It is therefore conceivable that a bound ligand can &#x02018;push&#x02019; this loop and lead to a breakdown in octamer symmetry. Binding of a ligand to all four type II sites would then lead to disassociation of the octamer into lower oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However, binding of a ligand to only two sites on adjacent dimers will break the octamer symmetry analogous to that observed in the recent <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp-DNA co-crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) where the octamer opens up in the presence of DNA into an open array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c). Such a change in oligomeric symmetry could also form the starting point for the transition from octameric disks to a helical cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>d) observed in the <italic>pyrococcus OT3</italic> Lrp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Binding of ligands at site II in MtbLrp.

Bound ligand in type I sites are depicted in &#x02018;green&#x02019; sticks (indicated by a &#x02018;golden&#x02019; arrow) while those bound to type II sites are in &#x02018;black&#x02019; sticks (indicated by a &#x02018;black&#x02019; arrow). A &#x02018;blue&#x02019; arrow indicates the binding site loop, which can be &#x02018;pushed&#x02019; out to distort the oligomeric association. Binding of ligand to only two sites can lead to the &#x02018;open&#x02019; octamer arrangement seen in (<bold>c</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp structure (PDB 2GQQ) or also be the basis for a transformation into (<bold>d</bold>) a helical cylinder-like arrangement seen in <italic>P. furiosus sp OT3</italic> Lrp (PDB 1RI7). Binding of ligands to this site are also advantageously situated to disturb (<bold>e</bold>) the spatial disposition of the DNA-binding domains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm850f7"/></fig></p><p>The other effector-binding site (I) occurs at the inter-dimer interfaces in the octamer. There are therefore eight such possible binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b), out of which only four are accessible to a ligand. It is possible that these other sites may be occupied under different quaternary structural states observed in the class of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B23 B24">19&#x02013;21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In contrast, bound ligands were observed in all eight type I sites in the <italic>E. coli</italic> AsnC and <italic>N. meningitides</italic> Lrp structures. In fact in the latter structure, it was found that binding of leucine and methionine led to further stabilization of the octamer. In the present <italic>Phe</italic> complex a maximal conformational displacement of 3.7 &#x000c5; was observed in the 75&#x02013;83 loop and to a smaller extent in some of the other complexes. An important role for ligands bound at this site could therefore be in controlling higher oligomeric associations like the one suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c.</p><p>It is interesting that residues of the binding site loop 100&#x02013;106 of the unoccupied type I sites interact with bound <italic>His</italic> in type II sites in its complex. This strategy presumably allows for additional control of the oligomeric state of the protein through effector binding or fine-tuning of individual regulatory functions. Solution studies involving <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp and a couple of its mutants (<italic>Asp</italic>113<italic>Glu</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Leu</italic>135<italic>Arg</italic>), which prevent octamer&#x02013;hexadecamer transition, also revealed two kinds of sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Binding of leucine to a low affinity site induced dissociation of hexadecamers in the unmutated protein to octamers; on the other hand, the octameric form and the mutants retained high affinity for leucine. Structural mapping of the mutations onto the subsequently reported <italic>E. coli</italic> Lrp structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) suggests that the second weak-binding site is in a different inter-subunit interface compared to the type I and type II sites discussed in this work. The <italic>Asp</italic>113<italic>Glu</italic> mutation maps onto the 100&#x02013;106 loop of MtbLrp and along with symmetry related <italic>E. coli Leu</italic>135 residue apparently generates a new site. On the other hand, it is likely that the high affinity site in <italic>E. coli Lrp</italic> corresponds to type I sites discussed here as binding of <italic>Leu</italic> to this site does not affect the octamer assembly. The above discussion suggests an unanticipated important role for the binding site loop (100&#x02013;106 in MtbLrp) residues where they are involved in interacting with ligands in the three types of sites.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has revealed a novel effector-binding site in the MtbLrp regulator. The large change in the disposition of the 75&#x02013;83 loop by 3.7 &#x000c5; is also the first seen in this regulator family upon ligand binding. The octameric association observed in MtbLrp is possible because of the change in the binding loop conformation in subunit B and this has probably evolved in order to interact with ligands in site II. We are only now beginning to understand the immense complexity of the regulation mechanisms employed by feast/famine regulatory proteins. Broad structural similarities and DNA recognition modes are apparently further fine-tuned by individual proteins by incorporating novel effector-binding sites, (the present study) and smaller changes in structure, as seen in the MtbLrp&#x02013;<italic>Phe</italic> complex, to perform their regulatory roles.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>Co-ordinates and structure factors of the <italic>apo</italic> protein have been deposited in the protein data bank with code 2IVM while those of the complexes have codes 2VBW, 2VBX, 2VBY, 2VBZ, 2VC0 and 2VC1, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm850_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm850_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm850_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm850_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm850_4.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The work was funded by intramural grant MLP007 and Department of Biotechnology grant GAP0018.
