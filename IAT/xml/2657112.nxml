FinTRIMs are formed of nearly identical RING/B-box regions and C-termini of variable length; the long variants include a B30.2 domain. The zebrafish genome harbors a striking diversity of finTRIMs, with 84 genes distributed in clusters on different chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed different subsets suggesting lineage-specific diversification events. Accordingly, the number of <italic>fintrim </italic>genes varies greatly among fish species. Conserved syntenies were observed only for the oldest <italic>fintrims</italic>. The closest mammalian relatives are <italic>trim16 </italic>and <italic>trim25</italic>, but they are not true orthologs. The B30.2 domain of zebrafish finTRIMs evolved under strong positive selection. The positions under positive selection are remarkably congruent in finTRIMs and in mammalian antiviral TRIM5&#x003b1;, concentrated within a viral recognition motif in mammals. The B30.2 domains most closely related to finTRIM are found among NOD-like receptors (NLR), indicating that the evolution of TRIMs and NLRs was intertwined by exon shuffling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The diversity, evolution, and features of finTRIMs suggest an important role in fish innate immunity; this would make them the first TRIMs involved in immunity identified outside mammals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Newly discovered players in the antiviral immunity field are the proteins belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM proteins are characterized by a tripartite motif that comprises from the N- to C-terminus, a RING zinc finger domain, one or two B-boxes and a coiled-coil domain. They are therefore also known as RBCC proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The RING finger and B-box are cysteine-rich domains and both domains bind zinc atoms, suggesting interaction with other proteins, RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. They are usually encoded as a single exon, and together form the 'RBB' region. In addition, the RING finger has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The coiled-coil region seems to be predominantly necessary for multimerization, resulting in the formation of high-molecular weight complexes. In many TRIM proteins an additional domain is present at the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], with the B30.2 domain being the most frequent one (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). The B30.2 domain is encoded by one exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The domain is also found in butyrophilin and stonustoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and has evolved by a relatively recent juxtaposition of the PRY domain and the SPRY domain; it is therefore also known as the PRY/SPRY domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The B30.2 domain has been shown to be essential for ligand binding in several TRIM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its tertiary structure has recently been elucidated for TRIM21, revealing two binding pockets formed by six variable loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since the order and spacing of the domains are highly conserved, a TRIM protein presumably acts as an integrated structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TRIM proteins are evolutionarily old proteins that can be found in primitive metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Currently, 68 TRIM-encoding genes have been described in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Most TRIM genes code for at least two isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing, resulting in full-length and partial transcripts that lack the C-terminal encoding sequence.</p><p>The TRIM proteins play multiple roles in various cellular processes, which include cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis in mammals. Many TRIM genes are proto-oncogenes and severe diseases such as Opitz syndrome and acute promyelocytic leukemia are caused by mutations in <italic>trim18 </italic>and <italic>trim19</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An antiviral activity has also been described for several TRIM proteins: TRIM1, -5&#x003b1;, -11, -15, -19, -22, -25, -28 -32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These TRIM proteins can block viral infection by different mechanisms, as revealed by the functional characterization of TRIM5&#x003b1;, TRIM19 and TRIM25. A virus-specific interaction has been described for TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIM19. TRIM5&#x003b1; was initially identified in rhesus macaques as the protein responsible for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in this species, while its human ortholog could not block HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1; forms trimers that bind the nucleocapsid of incoming viral particles through a C-terminal B30.2 domain, which accelerates the uncoating of the viral core and thereby interferes with the reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Among primates, this domain contains four hypervariable regions that have been subjected to a virus-driven diversification and account for the species-dependent retrovirus restriction of TRIM5&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The RING and B-box domains of TRIM5&#x003b1; are essential for localizing TRIM5&#x003b1; in specific cytoplasmic 'bodies' and may also be involved in inhibiting the assembly of progeny virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The antiviral restriction activity of TRIM19, or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been demonstrated for retroviruses (HFV, HIV, MLV), but also for an arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), a rhabdovirus (VSV) and an orthomyxovirus (influenza A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For example, TRIM19/PML binds the HFV Tas protein, a transactivator for HFV transcription, preventing binding of Tas protein to the viral genome and thereby transcription of viral open-reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As expected for proteins involved in antiviral defenses, several TRIM proteins are induced by interferon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but they can also participate in the induction of interferon synthesis. Thus, TRIM25 is involved in the production of IFN-&#x003b2; through the RIG1-pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Here, we characterize a new subset of <italic>trim </italic>genes that were originally discovered in a screen for virus-induced genes expressed by fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and named them <italic>fintrim </italic>for <underline>fi</underline>sh <underline>n</underline>ovel <italic>Trim</italic>. The <italic>fintrim </italic>genes constitute a unique expansion of <italic>trim </italic>genes in different teleost species, with up to 84 genes identified in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). In the zebrafish, these genes are located on several chromosomes, with three main clusters on the chromosome 2. The ORFs of this multigene family are highly similar in sequence, but variable in length. The most extended proteins contain a RING finger, two B-boxes, a coiled-coil region and a B30.2 domain. Interestingly, the finTRIM B30.2 domains have evolved under diversifying selection, and are closely related to B30.2 domains present in a NOD-like receptor (NLR) subfamily unique to teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The characterization of the finTRIM subset highlights the evolutionary dynamics of the TRIM family and strongly advocates a role in the innate antiviral response of fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>finTRIM</italic>, a new group of <italic>TRIM </italic>proteins induced by viruses in rainbow trout</title><p>In order to identify virus-induced transcripts in fish leukocytes, we previously used the method of subtractive suppressive hybridization on rainbow trout leukocytes that were either incubated with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) or mock-infected. This approach identified 24 virus-induced sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. One of them (clone [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF483536">AF483536</ext-link>]) contained a 200 aa ORF with a RING finger and two B-box motifs, resulting in a RBB domain typical of TRIM proteins. No coiled-coil region could be found in this sequence. A naive trout spleen cDNA library was then screened to confirm the structure of this TRIM cDNA and we identified two other full-length sequences (clones [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AM887799">AM887799</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AM887838">AM887838</ext-link>]). These sequences contained a RBB region almost identical to that of the <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF483536">AF483536</ext-link> clone (96% identity over 200 residues), associated with a coiled-coil region. In addition, the clone <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AM887799">AM887799</ext-link> contained a C-terminal B30.2 domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A multiple alignment of these sequences suggested that they did not result from alternative splicing of the same gene. Taken together, these results already suggested that these <italic>trims </italic>belong to a multigenic family with a modular structure. We could not find any obvious counterpart of these <italic>trims </italic>in sequence databases from mammals or other tetrapods. We thus assumed that they may belong to a new subfamily, and named them <italic>fintrims</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Variants of rainbow trout finTRIM ORFs</bold>.

(B) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of finTRIM induction in trout leukocytes (Leuk.) incubated with the virus (VHSV) or LPS for 40 h or in RTG-2 fibroblasts (Fibr.) incubated with poly(I:C) for 24 h, respectively. Normalized values for finTRIM expression were determined by dividing the average finTRIM value by the average &#x003b2;-actin value. Then, normalized finTRIM values were subjected to a calibration relative to the basic expression in control (Ctrl) leukocytes or RTG2 cells. The error bars represent standard deviation.

The induction ratio measured by this real-time PCR therefore corresponded to an average value, and may conceal disparities of the induction level for different genes. An induction ratio higher than 10 was measured after the viral infection in leukocytes or poly(I:C) treatment in fibroblasts, while no induction was noted in leukocytes after incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from <italic>E. coli</italic>. In LPS-treated leukocytes, IFN&#x003b3; transcript was induced 7-fold (range 5.8 to 8.4), demonstrating an effective stimulation. These experiments established that at least some finTRIMs are induced by viral infection.</p><p>To characterize further the diversity of the finTRIMs, we performed a 3'RACE PCR on VHSV-induced leukocyte cDNA using a universal primer specific for trout finTRIM localized in the highly conserved region in the vicinity of the start codon. These experiments on infected leukocytes revealed a rich profile of amplified bands, which suggested that finTRIM sequences are highly diverse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A diverse profile was also observed in the absence of infection, but the signal appeared weaker and the profile less complex. To investigate finTRIM expression in a non-lymphoid cell type, similar 3'RACE PCR experiments were performed on the fibroblast cell line RTG2. Poly(I:C) was used to mimic viral infection, since VHSV replicates in these cells and kills them quickly, in contrast to leukocytes. Almost no expression of finTRIMs could be detected in untreated fibroblasts, while a number of bands appeared after poly(I:C) stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This profile was less diverse than in leukocytes, with a bias towards long transcripts. This observation indicated that different arrays of finTRIMs are expressed in different cells, and corroborated the notion that some forms are inducible by viral infection.</p></sec><sec><title>The rainbow trout <italic>finTRIM </italic>transcripts are highly diverse</title><p>To further characterize the finTRIM diversity and to assess the specificity of the 3'RACE PCR amplification, we cloned the PCR products and sequenced clones picked at random. Fifty-four clones from leukocytes and 16 clones from RTG2 cells were completely sequenced. All clones contained a finTRIM sequence, confirming the high specificity of the amplification. The size of finTRIM transcripts was highly diverse, as expected from the 3'RACE profile. Different C-terminal regions of variable length were associated with the N-terminal RBB region shared by all sequences. For some clones, the C-terminus was encoded by short unique sequences unrelated to the longer ones. Based on their length or on the motifs present in the C-terminus, we classified the deduced finTRIM proteins into five different groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In fact, although the N-terminal RING/B-box regions of the different finTRIM sequences were highly similar to each other, they were not identical due to single nucleotide substitutions. These substitutions were more frequent than the error frequency due to PCR and sequencing (2 to 5%), and most of them were restricted to a number of conserved sites, which indicates that they did not correspond to artifacts. Therefore, the finTRIM diversity could not be due to alternative splicing of a unique RBB exon to multiple and diverse C-terminal exons. Moreover, the different sequences from leukocyte cDNAs were derived from a homozygous rainbow trout (see Methods), and therefore represent many different genes and not allelic diversity. Taken together, these observations suggest that rainbow trout finTRIMs are encoded by a large number of different genes.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>fintrim </italic>genes are highly diverse in zebrafish where they constitute a multigenic family</title><p>In order to extend the generality of our findings, we searched for <italic>fintrim </italic>genes in another teleost, the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>. Tblastn searches were made on the most recent zebrafish genome assembly (zv7), using as query the trout protein sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF483536">AF483536</ext-link> containing a RING and two B-box motifs. A set of more than 100 significant hits was obtained. More than half of them, associated with the most significant <italic>E </italic>values, were more similar to the trout <italic>fintrims </italic>than to any other described <italic>trim </italic>gene. Unexpectedly, among low-ranking hits, we also found many genes with sequences most similar to <italic>bloodthirsty (bty)</italic>, a known zebrafish <italic>trim </italic>gene with a B30.2 domain, involved in erythrocyte differentiation and closely related to human <italic>trim39 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This observation was in accordance with a recent survey of vertebrate TRIM sequences reporting a high diversity of TRIM sequences in the fish genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>As a consequence of our search criteria, all these hits corresponded to N-terminal RBB exons (truncated in three of them). We extended our search by looking for B30.2 domain-encoding exons in the downstream genomic sequence and found one in most cases (&#x0003e;80%). Several genes appeared to be likely pseudogenes, either because of early frameshifts (allelic in some cases, see below), or absence of an identifiable start or stop codon. However, in several instances this may be due to a genome assembly defect or to unusual gene structure with extra undetected exon(s) upstream of the RBB or downstream of the B30.2. The deduced protein sequences were aligned and similarity trees were established (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1). The trees obtained with the RBB domains and with the B30.2 domains were highly congruent and allowed us to define two families: one that contained 84 <italic>fintrim </italic>genes (hereafter named <italic>ftr01 </italic>to <italic>ftr84</italic>) and one that contained 33 <italic>bloodthirsty</italic>-related genes (named <italic>btr01 </italic>to <italic>btr33</italic>). Three subgroups, based on apparent phylogenetic age, were defined among the <italic>fintrim </italic>family. The major subgroup (Group A), which includes 65 genes (<italic>ftr01 </italic>to <italic>ftr65</italic>), represents the 'crown group', which appears to have evolved most recently. Group B, including 17 genes (<italic>ftr66 </italic>to <italic>ftr81</italic>) is not monophyletic, and contains genes that appear to have diverged at around the time that the clade that now includes the zebrafish separated from the main teleost lineage. Finally, group C consists of only three genes (<italic>ftr82</italic>, <italic>ftr83</italic>, and <italic>ftr84</italic>), which seem to be the most ancient ones. Within each subgroup, genes were named according to their genomic position. Because the zebrafish genome assembly Zv7 is still imperfect, a few difficulties appeared with the annotation. For instance, the <italic>bty </italic>gene itself was not found in zv7 (<italic>bty </italic>has been mapped to a relatively telomeric position on chromosome 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and therefore may reside within the same cluster as <italic>btr18</italic>, its closest relative among our dataset). An inverted duplication on chromosome 23 results in the presence of twins (in coding as well as in intronic sequences) for the closely linked <italic>ftr58 </italic>and <italic>ftr59 </italic>genes, which we named <italic>ftr58dupli </italic>and <italic>ftr59dupli</italic>. An assembly gap just downstream of the <italic>ftr20 </italic>gene is probably responsible for its lack of a B30.2-containing exon. Finally, contigs containing four genes (<italic>ftr64</italic>, <italic>ftr65</italic>, <italic>ftr80</italic>, and <italic>ftr81</italic>) are not yet assigned to a given chromosome.</p><p>The genomic distribution of all <italic>ftr </italic>and <italic>btr </italic>genes is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: detailed positions are given in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Table S1. As can be readily observed, most of these genes are arranged in clusters of genes in the same orientation. Half of the <italic>ftr </italic>genes are localized on chromosome 2, with three major clusters. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that genes within a cluster are more related to each other than to genes in other clusters.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic location of zebrafish <italic>fintrims </italic>and related genes, based on the zv7 assembly</bold>.

For <italic>ftr </italic>genes, organization was very well conserved, with a first RBB-encoding exon of 555 to 594 (coding) bp, two 96 and 234-bp long exons encoding the coiled-coils, two 154 and 60-bp long exons with no clear domain associated, and a final ~545 coding bp exon encoding the B30.2 domain.</p><p>To gain an insight into the expression pattern of zebrafish <italic>fintrim </italic>genes, we designed consensus primers to perform 3'RACE-PCR simultaneously on all members of group A, the largest but also most homogeneous group. RACE-PCR products from zebrafish larvae were cloned and more than 70 clones were sequenced to obtain an approximate image of the relative <italic>fintrim </italic>expression in different settings of virus-induced activation. We tested three different stimuli: IFN1 over-expression, and experimental infection with either Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV) or a heat-adapted variant of Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV). Results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Given the very high number of zebrafish <italic>ftr </italic>genes in group A, it would be difficult to get a statistically significant picture of the expression of any single gene, but the aggregated data reveal interesting trends. At the developmental stage examined (72 to 96 hours post fertilization), expression was restricted, or at least highly skewed, towards a subset of genes, most of them on chromosome 2. Genes frequently found in control samples were also expressed in stimulated samples. Some genes, such as <italic>ftr02</italic>, <italic>ftr23 </italic>and <italic>ftr64</italic>, were detected only in stimulated samples. Short and long finTRIM proteins were expressed with or without B30.2 domain, in a striking parallel to what we have found in the trout. Viral or IFN-stimulation did not affect the overall pattern of length distribution, perhaps because RNA was extracted from whole larvae, which may dilute the specific response. Remarkably, alternative splicing did not account for all the diversity in protein size; allelic variation also played a prominent role (note that standard laboratory zebrafish are not inbred, and that pools of larvae were used). For instance, two different groups of <italic>ftr39 </italic>transcripts were found, some coding for canonical, full-length finTRIM proteins, while others, similar in this respect to the allele of the zv7 genome assembly, contain a 2 bp-deletion in the first exon, resulting in a transcript coding for a truncated protein with only a RING domain, irrespective of subsequent splicing.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Variants of zebrafish finTRIM ORFs</bold>.

We investigated whether the zebrafish <italic>fintrim </italic>genes have also evolved under diversifying selection. We used a test that is based on the estimation of synonymous (<italic>dS</italic>, silent mutations) and non-synonymous (<italic>dN</italic>, amino acid-altering) substitution rates of all codons among a set of sequences. The ratio &#x003c9; = <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS </italic>is an indication for negative selection (&#x003c9; &#x0003c; 1), neutral evolution (&#x003c9; = 1), or positive selection (&#x003c9; &#x0003e;1). If an amino acid change is neutral, it will be fixed at the same rate as a synonymous mutation, and &#x003c9; = 1. If the amino acid change is deleterious, purifying (negative) selection will reduce its fixation rate, thus &#x003c9; &#x0003c; 1. An amino acid change is fixed at a higher rate than a synonymous mutation (&#x003c9; &#x0003e;1) only when it offers a selective advantage. The site-specific model within the Phylogeny Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) software package allows heterogeneity in evolutionary pressure along a protein encoding sequence and can identify the specific sites that are under positive selection. Two models of substitution distribution, M2a and M8, can be used to test the positive selection hypothesis against the nested null models: M2a against M1a and M8 against M7.</p><p>We took the complete sequences of zebrafish finTRIM group A B30.2 domains and analyzed them with the PAML models M1a, M2a, M7 and M8. A value of &#x003c9; &#x0003e;1 was detected for 15.6% of sites under M2a and 17.6% of sites under M8 (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The likelihood-ratio test (LRT) was significant with <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 for both models (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The estimation of substitution rates by PAML is based on branch lengths of sequences in the phylogenetic tree. As a result of recombination, sites within one sequence are no longer similar in branch length and this can interfere with the results of PAML since this model assumes that all sites within a sequence are similar in branch length. To investigate whether the detection of positive selection was not perturbed by recombination, we implemented the algorithm PARRIS on our dataset. With the PARRIS program, a partitioning approach is used and site-to-site variation in both synonymous and non-synonymous rates is integrated in the M1a and M2a models. We analyzed the zebrafish finTRIM group A B30.2 sequences with PARRIS and could still detect positive selection by the LTR with <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, indicating that whether or not recombination did occur, the B30.2 has evolved under positive selection. To search for recombination sites, we employed the program GARD. The algorithm subdivides the sequence alignment in putative non-recombinant fragments, phylogenies are inferred for each fragment and the goodness of fit is assessed by Akaike's information criterium (c-AIC), predicting whether or not the fragments are derived from two different ancestor sequences due to recombination.

The specific sites under positive selection according to the models 2a and 8 were identified by a Bayesian approach. For the B30.2 domain we were able to identify 16 sites under both model 2a and 17 under model 8. Fourteen sites were located in regions corresponding to the predicted variable loops of TRIM21. In addition, the majority of the sites were located within the regions corresponding with the four hypervariable regions described for TRIM5&#x003b1;, with six sites falling in the hypervariable region 1, one in region 2 and six in region 3. (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> for positions of sites and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> &#x02013; Table S4 for posterior probabilities).</p><p>We used a similar approach to detect positive selective sites in the RING and two B-box domains. First we analyzed with PAML the complete dataset from all RING-B-box sequences from zebrafish finTRIM group A. Positive selection was detected for 6.3% of sites under M2a and 7.1% of sites under M8 with <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 in the LTR of both M1a-M2a and M7&#x02013;M8. With PARRIS we confirmed that the RBB has evolved under positive selection with <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 in the LTR of M1a-M2a. We used GARD to search for recombination and we also identified a breakage point, with a significant value of &#x00394;c-AIC = 254.63 under the two-breakage-point model and &#x00394;c-AIC = 263.22 under the 20-breakage-point model. We therefore divided the RBB multiple alignment into two segments and re-analyzed the sequences located before and after the breakage site using PAML. For the sequences located before the predicted breakage point we found three sites under positive selection under M2a and under M8, with <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 in the LTR under both nested models. These sites are located just upstream of the RING motif. For the region after the breakage point, the test for positive selection was no longer significant, with <italic>p </italic>= 0.155 in the LTR of M1a-M2a and <italic>p </italic>= 0.455 in the LRT of M7&#x02013;M8, (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results firmly establish that the loops of the zebrafish Group A finTRIM B30.2 domains have been diversified under positive selection, as previously described for the sites determining virus specificity in TRIM5&#x003b1;, suggesting a selective pressure on this domain for binding to diverse ligands. A few positions located close to the RING motif are also subjected to diversification.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon shuffling of B30.2 domain occurred between <italic>finTRIMs </italic>and NLR</title><p>Since finTRIM B30.2 features suggest that they may be involved in interactions with diverse ligands, similar B30.2 domains may be used in other TRIM subfamilies for comparable purposes. We therefore searched the zebrafish genome for sequences closely related to typical finTRIM B30.2 domains. Unexpectedly, the closest counterparts of finTRIM B30.2 sequences were not found in other TRIM, but were associated with NACHT and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs)-ribonuclease inhibitor (RI)-like motifs in NLR proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). These proteins, which possess a B30.2 and a NACHT domain and are very likely involved in innate immunity, have been identified very recently; such a combination is not found in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. While the protein sequences of B30.2 from Group A ftrs were about 40% similar to B30.2 domains from close TRIM relatives such as bloodthirsty or TRIM25, they were 55 to 65% similar to B30.2 from these NLR proteins, and about 50 to 55% similar to those of the Group B or C ftr sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis showed that B30.2 sequences of group A finTRIM and a subgroup of NLR (named here group 1) are joined as a cluster supported by a high bootstrap value (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This cluster is quite distinct from that of other TRIMs, including group B or group C <italic>ftr </italic>and <italic>btr</italic>, or even from the rest of B30.2-bearing NLRs (group 2), suggesting an exon shuffling event between group A <italic>fintrims </italic>and group1 <italic>NLRs</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Distance tree of finTRIM B30.2 domains and related sequences</bold>.

Their close relatedness allowed us to group these sequences in one multigene family, the finTRIMs. The <italic>fintrim </italic>genes were identified in all teleost fish species for which a genome database is available. In addition, we characterized a number of transcripts in rainbow trout and zebrafish, confirming that these genes are actively transcribed. Although the gene numbers vary among the different teleost species, the wide distribution of the <italic>fintrim </italic>genes suggests an important role, one in which diversity offers a selective advantage to the host. Since finTRIMs are specifically induced by viruses and poly(I:C), they probably play a role in antiviral immunity, as several other TRIMs do in mammals.</p><sec><title><italic>FinTRIM </italic>diversity suggests that they recognize multiple ligands</title><p>The highly diverse finTRIMs are encoded by a large number of genes. This TRIM subset is a teleost-specific group, well distinct from other TRIMs shared by fish and mammals as TRIM16, TRIM25, TRIM39 and others. Next to the variety generated by the large number of genes, we demonstrate here that the B30.2 domain of <italic>fintrim </italic>genes has evolved under diversifying selective forces. This indicates that these proteins bind a diverse range of ligands, making an immune function very plausible. Consistent with a role in immune recognition, our current data suggest that there is a high allelic polymorphism among zebrafish <italic>fintrim </italic>genes. There are numerous examples of large polymorphic multigene families that are involved in innate immunity. The proteins they encode either recognize a variety of microbial patterns, or bind diverse receptors of the host immune system and participate in the tuning of complex activation pathways. Such receptors include some mammalian TRIMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], but also the mammalian killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and Ly-49 related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], chicken Ig-like receptor (CHIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], fish novel immune-type receptors (NITR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], fish leukocyte immune-type receptors (LITR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and sea urchin toll-like receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>If finTRIMs are specifically involved in virus recognition or act as virus-restricting molecules, the high number of <italic>fintrim </italic>genes opens the possibility for parallel and simultaneous selection by different viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Signatures of positively selected residues in <italic>finTRIM </italic>B30.2 equate with canonical motifs of the virus-binding sites in TRIM5&#x003b1;</title><p>The finTRIM B30.2 domain contributes dominantly to finTRIM diversity, and seems to be generally similar in structure to the B30.2 domain of TRIM21. Among the sequences of the multiple finTRIMs described in both trout and zebrafish, the variable sites are predominantly located in the variable loops of the domain, in a way that strongly suggests that the B30.2 domains interacts with their ligands as TRIM5&#x003b1; does for viral proteins. In particular, the sites identified in zebrafish as subjected to significant diversifying ('positive') selection were concentrated in the variable loop 1, between the &#x003b2;-strands 2 and 3. This loop was earlier designated as a 'hotspot' region, since sites within this region determine the lentivirus restriction-specificity of TRIM5&#x003b1; and mutations in this region are correlated with the disease susceptibility associated with TRIM20 (familial Mediterranean fever) and TRIM21 (an autoantigen in multiple diseases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Such a distribution of sites diversified under positive selection in the loop 1 (loop &#x003b2;2&#x02013;3) of the B30.2 domain strongly supports both the reality of a diversifying selection and the diversity of <italic>ftr </italic>B30.2 ligands.</p><p>In addition, we also found several sites under diversifying selection within the RBB domain, suggesting that additional sites may also be involved in binding of a(nother) ligand. A few sites were earlier shown to have evolved under diversifying selection in the coiled-coil region of proteins TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIM22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], but positive selection of RING and B-box domains was not reported. Besides, the roles of the RING and B-box domains in TRIM function are still not fully understood, although deletion or mutations can abrogate the activity of TRIM5&#x003b1;, and the significance of the positively selected RBB residues in <italic>ftrs </italic>remains therefore elusive. In this context, one may also question the function of the <italic>finTRIM </italic>genes that do not contain a B30.2 domain (one out of five in the zebrafish, but probably more in trout). It is tempting to consider them as potential inhibitors/regulators of an antiviral response triggered by B30.2-containing genes.</p></sec><sec><title>The evolutionary affinities of <italic>finTRIM </italic>B30.2 domains suggest a domain shuffling between NLR and TRIM molecules</title><p>An interesting finding was the close relationship of finTRIM B30.2 domains with the B30.2 domains present in a subset of NLR proteins recently described in the zebrafish. NLR proteins, also known as CATERPILLER, NACHT or NOD-LRR proteins, are large cytoplasmic proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis. They are characterized by a NACHT domain and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region at the C-terminus and vary in their N-terminal effector domain, which is a CARD, pyrin or TIR domain. As for TRIM proteins, the physiological functions of NLRs are diverse, and several NLRs are inhibitors/activators of the inflammatory and immune responses. For example, NALP3/cryopyrin is a key component of the inflammasome and inhibits TNF- and TRAF6- induced NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], while NOD2 plays a role in NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Large groups of novel, fish-specific NLR proteins have been recently described in fish and appear to be highly related within each species, indicating recent species-specific expansions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Some of these teleost NLR proteins contain the NACHT and LRR domains at the C-terminus in combination with a B30.2 domains, as the NLR-C described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The close relatedness of these B30.2 domains to the group A finTRIM B30.2 domain suggests that the corresponding exon(s) have been subjected to shuffling between NLR and group A finTRIM, that is, during <italic>ftr </italic>evolution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The exchange of a ligand-recognition module evolving under positive selection with another protein family mainly involved in inflammation, immune regulation and possibly pathogen sensing constitutes another argument supporting an immune function for group A finTRIMs.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Tentative evolutionary pathway of <italic>fintrims </italic>and their relatives in vertebrates</bold>.

Both teleosts and mammals possess single orthologous <italic>trim25 </italic>and <italic>trim16</italic>, as evidenced by phylogenetic analysis and conserved synteny. Sequences coding for partial <italic>trim16 </italic>and <italic>trim25 </italic>were also identified in the elephant shark genome, confirming that these genes were already present in the early vertebrates. In contrast, <italic>fintrims </italic>seem to be unique to teleost fish and could not be found in any other group of animals. Since they were present in all fish for which a significant amount of genomic data was available, <italic>fintrims </italic>most probably appeared during the early evolution of teleosts. While they are represented by large gene sets in zebrafish, salmonids and medaka, several fish species such as fugu or stickleback only possess a few copies of <italic>fintrim </italic>genes. Thus, <italic>fintrim </italic>genes have been probably subjected to parallel &#x02013; and independent &#x02013; duplication events in the different branches of teleosts. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that zebrafish <italic>ftr </italic>genes were generally most similar to their immediate neighbors, suggesting tandem duplication within clusters rather than <italic>en bloc </italic>duplication as the main gene amplification mechanism.</p><p>This view is supported by the absence of obvious synteny between the regions encoding almost all finTRIMs in different teleosts. Also, diverse mechanisms of gene spreading appear to have been used in different species, since many medaka <italic>fintrims </italic>are intronless in contrast to zebrafish <italic>ftr</italic>, suggesting that one or more retro-transposition events have been involved in the multiplication of these sequences. This observation is a good argument for a fast expansion in this species, and reinforces the idea of strong selection pressures towards finTRIM diversification. Such selection pressures exerted by species- or family-specific viruses are expected to be highly variable between different fish taxa. Whether another TRIM set constrains or balances the evolution of finTRIMs, as described for anti-retroviral TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIM22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], remains to be established. Also, the B30.2 exon shuffling has complicated the <italic>fintrim </italic>evolutionary pathway.</p><p>finTRIM Group C is closest to other TRIMs in the phylogenetic trees, suggesting that they appeared during the early evolution of teleosts. They are present in the different fish investigated so far but no counterpart was found in other vertebrates. Interestingly, a conserved synteny of <italic>ftr82/83 </italic>and a few neighboring markers was established in zebrafish, stickleback and medaka, indicating that they were kept in a more stable genomic context than other <italic>fintrims</italic>; it is also worth noting that in the medaka, these genes have retained the six-exon structure. Also, several markers located close to <italic>ftr82/83 </italic>in fish possess counterparts on the human chromosome 17, where both <italic>trim16 </italic>and <italic>trim25 </italic>are located together with the markers defining their own conserved syntenies among vertebrates. This loose association is unlikely to have occurred by chance, and may suggest that certain group C <italic>fintrims </italic>could constitute an intermediate between the main <italic>fintrim </italic>family and the older <italic>trim </italic>genes (presumably <italic>trim25</italic>; <italic>trim16 </italic>is an unlikely candidate since its RBB domain is truncated) from which they appeared by duplication. This hypothesis fits well with the whole-genome duplication that occurred in the beginning of teleost evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Along the same line, <italic>ftr82 </italic>and <italic>ftr83</italic>, together with <italic>ftr84</italic>, are the most similar to <italic>trim25 </italic>among the <italic>fintrim </italic>relatives (see <italic>ftr/btr </italic>tree in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). TRIM25 is involved in IFN signaling, but interacts with endogenous RIG-I and not with viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that <italic>ftr82 </italic>and <italic>ftr83 </italic>have been restrained from duplications and diversifying selection by such a functional specialization. Such a contrasted evolutionary history has been observed for example for the CytP450 superfamily: enzymes with endogenous substrates are phylogenetically stable, while xenobiotic detoxifiers are encoded in unstable gene islands that appeared by tandem duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It could be argued that the quick radiation of group A <italic>fintrims </italic>was triggered when a <italic>trim25</italic>-like <italic>ftr </italic>acquired a B30.2 exon maybe derived from a NLR gene, allowing the newly created finTRIM to directly detect a pathogen motif. Such an event would have occurred after the teleost-tetrapod split, and perhaps even after the divergence of main teleost lineages, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. It has to be underlined here that the phylogenetic analysis does not support a monophyletic origin of group B <italic>fintrims</italic>, which therefore probably constitute the tracks of several duplication/differentiation events in the finTRIM group. Such duplication events have been suggested to explain the expansion of TRIM genes in fish and other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A recent extensive survey of TRIMs divided these proteins into two large groups: an evolutionary conserved group I comprising TRIM with various C-terminal domains, and a more recent group II that groups sequences containing a B30.2 domain and showing species-specific diversification. The presence of two B-box motifs &#x02013; although the B-box-1 is rather degenerated &#x02013; and the sequence similarity to TRIM16 and TRIM25 suggest that finTRIMs may be closer to group I. However, the finTRIM evolutionary pathway described here fits better the properties of the group II. Our observations seem to reflect a fish-specific evolutionary pathway of a TRIM subset derived from ancestral group I members by an ancient duplication.</p><p>The evolutionary pathways of <italic>trim39 </italic>is rather different since it was retrieved as a single gene in mammals but as a multigene set in several teleosts. TRIM39 is a member of the group II as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the diversification observed in the zebrafish is well in accordance with the evolutionary properties of this group. Thus, there are more than 30 orthologs of <italic>trim39 </italic>in zebrafish. We named these genes <italic>btrs </italic>for 'bloodthirsty-like TRIMs', as one of them is known as <italic>bloodthirsty</italic>, a gene involved in erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These observations indicate that <italic>trim39 </italic>was already present in the common ancestor to fish and mammals, but was subjected to a successful expansion by duplication in at least some lineages of teleosts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that the finTRIM family has been subjected to a quick, extensive diversification by duplication and specialization under positive selection exerted on positions concentrated in the B30.2 domain. The sharing of B30.2 domains with NLR emphasizes the shuffling of a putative target-binding module between two major protein families involved in immune recognition of pathogen specific motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. While the targets of finTRIMs have yet to be identified, this first survey suggests that finTRIMs are involved the antiviral innate immune system. Our future work will be aimed at a further understanding of the biological functions of the finTRIMs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trout leukocyte preparation</title><p>Rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) were raised in the Jouy-en-Josas experimental fish facility.

At 24 hpf (hours post-fertilization) they were sorted under a fluorescence stereomicroscope to retain only mCherry-expressing animals; abnormally developing embryos were also discarded. At 72 hpf, the larvae were euthanized with 2-PE and homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. For viral infections, non-manipulated larvae that had been left to develop for 3 days at 24&#x000b0;C were dechorionated, anesthetized with Tricaine (Sigma-aldrich), and microinjected with 1 nl of viral suspension in the venous plexus located just posterior to the cloaca.

Systematic searches for finTRIM were done using the tblastn program with rainbow trout or zebrafish sequences as a query, on available EST and genome databases. Searches in EST databases were mainly performed at the NCBI and Dana Farber Institute websites. Blast queries on complete genomes were sent to Ensembl and NCBI. The last assembly of the zebrafish genome (zv7) was searched at the Ensembl site. When relevant genomic regions were identified, potential exons were manually identified by comparison with known sequences, notably RACE clones, with the help of predictions made by Genscan <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of positive selection</title><p>The dataset for positive selection analysis was prepared from the zebrafish group A finTRIM (ftr) sequences that were found on the Ensembl zebrafish Zv7 assembly. Three datasets were prepared, corresponding to sequences coding for the RING and B-box 1 and 2 (RBB) domains (55 sequences) and the B30.2 domain (38 sequences). Domains were identified by the web-based tool Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/"/>.

The final datasets consisted of 155 codons for the RING and B-box domains and 145 codons for the B30.2 domain. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using M<italic>EGA</italic>4.</p><p>The Codeml program of the Phylogeny Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html"/>, was used for the detection of positive selection. The models M0, M1a, M2a, M7 and M8 were employed. The ratio of synonymous (<italic>dS</italic>) to non-synonymous (<italic>dN</italic>) substitution rates, &#x003c9; = <italic>dS</italic>/<italic>dN</italic>, is determined by the program. A value of &#x003c9; &#x0003c; 1 indicates negative, purifying selection, &#x003c9; = 1 indicates neutral evolution and &#x003c9; &#x0003e;1 indicates the occurrence of diversifying, positive selection. We used the site-specific model that allows &#x003c9; to vary among sites. The null models M0, M1a and M7 do not allow the existence of positively selected sites (&#x003c9; &#x0003e;1), while the alternate models M2a and M8 allow &#x003c9; &#x0003e;1. M8 follows a beta(<italic>p</italic>, <italic>q</italic>)-distribution and is less stringent than M2a. Within the models, a Maximum Likelihood algorithm is used, whereby the sites are allocated under classes of different &#x003c9; probabilities. Sites allocated under the class with &#x003c9; &#x0003e;1 are considered as being under positive selection and were identified by a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis. Significance of outcome was confirmed by a likelihood ratio test (LRT). In the LTR we took twice the difference in log likelihood (2&#x00394;lnL) between the nested models and used the chi-square test with the degrees of freedom (df) being the difference in free parameters between the two models (M1a vs. M2a and M7 vs. M8).
