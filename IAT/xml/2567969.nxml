All mammalian IKKs studied so far have roles in immune responses, but operate on different targets. IKKs are multi-subunit complexes consisting of two catalytic subunits (IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;) and a structural component (IKK&#x003b3;/NEMO). IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; were identified in a protein complex that phosphorylates I&#x003ba;B and targets it for degradation, thereby allowing the nuclear localization and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The isoforms IKK&#x003b5; and TANK binding kinase 1 are required to for phosphrylation and activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 in response to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Two members of the IKK family are known in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, namely <italic>DmIKK&#x003b2; </italic>and <italic>Ik2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>DmIKK&#x003b2; </italic>performs similarly to the mammalian IKK&#x003b1; and participates in antibacterial innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>ik2 </italic>(also known as <italic>DmIKK&#x003b5;</italic>) was shown to control actin and microtubule (MT) organization in an NF-&#x003ba;B-independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Recently it was reported that Ik2 binds to <italic>Drosophila </italic>inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1) and accelerates its degradation in a kinase-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One of the nonapoptotic processes that Ik2 regulates through the DIAP1/caspase pathway is assembly of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>ik2 </italic>loss-of-function mutants, tracheal terminal cells, bristles, and the antenna arista laterals, all of which require accurate F-actin assembly for their polarized elongation, exhibited aberrantly branched morphology. These phenotypes were sensitive to a change in the dosage of <italic>DIAP1 </italic>and the caspase <italic>DRONC </italic>without apparent change in cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, over-expression of Ik2 destabilized F-actin based structures. These results suggest that Ik2 may act as a negative regulator of F-actin assembly, maintaining the fidelity of polarized elongation during cell morphogenesis by modulating the level of DIAP1.</p><p>A different aspect of the <italic>ik2 </italic>role in cytoskeleton related processes is revealed through oogenesis studies. During oogenesis, <italic>ik2 </italic>is required in an NF-&#x003ba;B-independent process for localization of <italic>oskar </italic>and <italic>gurken </italic>mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As a result, females that lack <italic>ik2 </italic>in the germline produce embryos that are bicaudal, ranging from headless embryos to embryos with a duplicated abdomen in place of the head and thorax. They also exhibit a ventralized phenotype. Abnormal mRNA localization in <italic>ik2 </italic>mutant oocytes could be attributed to defects in the organization of MT minus-ends. In addition, <italic>ik2 </italic>mutant oocytes and mutant escaper adults have abnormalities in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the regulatory target for <italic>ik2 </italic>in controlling the oocyte cytoskeleton is still unknown.</p><p>In a global two-hybrid screen, Ik2 was found to interact with Spindle-F (Spn-F) (CG12114) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our previous work has shown that this newly discovered protein, Spn-F is part of a yet uncharacterized pathway leading to the organization of a distinct subset of MTs in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>spn-F </italic>was first identified as a maternal effect mutation that affects the dorsal-ventral polarity of the eggshell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The asymmetric distribution of maternal determinants (<italic>gurken</italic>, <italic>bicoid </italic>and <italic>oskar </italic>mRNAs) in the oocyte was analyzed, and it was found that <italic>spn-F</italic>, like <italic>ik2</italic>, is required for proper localization of <italic>gurken </italic>during oogenesis. In addition to the maternal effect, <italic>spn-F</italic>, like <italic>ik2</italic>, also affects the bristle morphology of the adult fly. Moreover, in <italic>spn-F </italic>mutants, &#x003b1;-tubulin is abnormally associated with the oocyte nuclear periphery, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Tau fusion protein accumulates abnormally around the oocyte nucleus. <italic>spn-F </italic>was cloned and found to encode a novel coiled-coil protein, which co-localizes specifically to oocyte cortex regions, where the minus ends of MTs reside, and also occurs in a punctate granular pattern in the nurse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, earlier work show that <italic>spn-F </italic>affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of a subset of MTs during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis.</p><p>Since <italic>ik2 </italic>mutants share many phenotypes with <italic>spn-F</italic>, including a very similar bristle phenotype, ventralized eggshells, and specific effects on MT organization in oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we decided to study the nature of the interaction between these two proteins. We show that Ik2 directly interacts with Spn-F and that the C-terminus of Spn-F is crucial for this interaction. We also demonstrate that Ik2 is capable of phosphorylating Spn-F, but that such phosphorylation is not essential for their interaction and also does not lead to Spn-F degradation. We find that Ik2 and Spn-F co-localize to the anterior ring of the oocyte and in a punctate structure in the nurse cells. Furthermore, we show that Spn-F and Ik2 are mutually required for this localization. We therefore conclude that Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex that regulates cytoskeleton organization during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis. Our finding that phosphorylation of Spn-F by Ik2 has no effect on Spn-F protein degradation, contrary to the degradation seen in the case of DIAP1, demonstrates a new mode of action for Ik2 in the germline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Spn-F interacts physically with Ik2</title><p>In a yeast two-hybrid-based protein-interaction map of the fly proteome, several proteins were found to interact with Spn-F, among them Ik2 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To further verify the yeast two-hybrid interaction, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in Schneider (S2) cells. Extracts from S2 cells co-expressing GFP-tagged Ik2 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Spn-F were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against GFP and immunoblotted with antibodies against HA. Our results demonstrated that it is possible to co-precipitate Ik2 together with Spn-F (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), indicating that Spn-F interacts with Ik2, in agreement with the findings of the yeast two-hybrid assay. Next we sought to establish whether Spn-F and Ik2 also interact physically in the germline. For that purpose we expressed HA::Spn-F along GFP::Ik2 in the germline using the UAS/Gal4 system. GFP::Ik2 was immunoprecipitated from ovarian extract, and the presence of Spn-F was studied by western blot with antibodies against HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Similarly to our results in S2 cells, we were able to show that Spn-F is found in a complex with Ik2 in the oocyte as well (Fig, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Spn-F interacts physically with Ik2 and the C-terminus of Spn-F is crucial for this interaction</bold>.

The first domain extends from amino acid 32 to amino acid 114 and the second from amino acid 210 to amino acid 243 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In order to determine which domain is important for the interaction with Ik2, we fused the N-terminal part of Spn-F (1&#x02013;162 aa) and the C-terminal (165&#x02013;364 aa) of Spn-F to GFP. We co-expressed Myc-tagged Ik2 with each of the GFP-tagged truncated proteins in S2 cells. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP, and immunoblotting was done using anti-Myc. Myc tagged Ik2 was co-precipitated with the C-terminus of spn-F but not with the N-terminus of Spn-F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).

This method allowed us to collect kinetic data for six different concentrations of analyte at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows representative sensorgrams for binding of Spn-F in six concentrations to Ik2. The results revealed dose-dependent formation of this complex. In order to verify specific binding of Spn-F to Ik2 as opposed to binding to maltose binding protein (MBP), we examined the binding of Spn-F to a different MBP-fused protein, namely Sec13-MBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results show that there is no binding of Spn-F to Sec13-MBP, indicating that the Spn-F binding to Ik2 is specific. The data were globally fitted to the simple 1:1 interaction model with &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>of 1.63.

The KD equilibrium dissociation constant, which is derived from KD = kd/ka, was found to be 407.2 nM.

S2 cells were co-transfected with Ik2 and Spn-F or Spn-F alone. Extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and Spn-F protein migration on gel was analyzed by western blot with an anti-Spn-F antibody. In cells co-expressing Spn-F and Ik2, we found a reduction in the mobility of Spn-F protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 3) as compared with its migration when expressed alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 1). This reduced mobility of Spn-F could be mitigated by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 4), strongly suggesting that Ik2 phosphorylates Spn-F. To confirm these results, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation kinase assay. GFP-tagged Ik2 was immunoprecipitated from S2 cells. We studied the ability of this immunoprecipitate to phosphorylate purified His-tagged Spn-F protein. We found that besides the autophosphorylation of GFP-Ik2 protein, there was another <sup>32</sup>P-labeled protein band at ~50 kD, which corresponds to the mass of His-tagged Spn-F (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 2).

Although Spn-F was not phosphorylated by Ik2 K41A, a specific interaction between the proteins did take place (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), indicating that the interaction between Ik2 and Spn-F proteins does not depend on phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ik2 does not promote Spn-F degradation</title><p>It was recently reported that Ik2 promotes degradation of DIAP1 through direct phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since Ik2 phosphorylates Spn-F in S<sub>2</sub>R+ cells, we examined whether such phosphorylation of Spn-F leads to its degradation. S<sub>2</sub>R+ cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged Spn-F and increasing amounts of GFP-tagged Ik2. Cell extracts were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-GFP. We found that while expression of different levels of GFP-Ik2 did lead to Spn-F phosphorylation, as revealed by the change in Spn-F mobility, this phosphorylation did not lead to its degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). To determine whether Ik2 influences the stability of Spn-F in flies, we tested the stability of Spn-F in the germline while over-expressing GFP::Ik2. For that purpose we generated transgenic flies expressing GFP::Spn-F together with GFP::Ik2, then tested the level of Spn-F protein relative to transgenic flies expressing GFP::Spn-F or GFP alone. We demonstrated that expression of Ik2 had no effect on Spn-F protein stability in the germline (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), thus supporting our finding that Ik2 does not promote Spn-F degradation.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Ik2 does not promote Spn-F degradation</bold>.

Next, we decided to test whether the GFP-tagged Ik2 co-localizes with endogenous Spn-F protein. For that purpose, ovaries expressing GFP-tagged Ik2 were immunostained with Spn-F antibody.

It was shown that <italic>ik2 </italic>modulates caspases for a nonapoptotic function and controls both actin and MT cytoskeletons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and also that it regulates the actin cytoskeleton through phosphorylation and degradation of DIAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that, in <italic>ik2 </italic>mutant oocytes, abnormal mRNA localization can be attributed to defects in organization of MT minus-ends, giving rise to ventralized and bicaudal phenotypes of mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Whereas the control of actin polymerization appears to be mediated by a nonapoptotic function of DIAP1, the regulatory target of Ik2 in controlling cytoskeleton organization in the oocyte is still unknown. In this study we examined whether <italic>spn-F</italic>, which showed precisely the same ovarian and bristle phenotypes as <italic>ik2 </italic>mutants, might be an Ik2 target. In previous work we reported that <italic>spn-F </italic>encodes a novel protein that affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of MTs during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this work we show that Ik2 physically interacts with Spn-F and forms a relatively stable complex. In addition, we show that Ik2 phosphorylates Spn-F but that the interaction between these two proteins is independent of phosphorylation. Thus, our results suggest that Spn-F is a putative regulatory substrate of Ik2. Moreover, our results indicate that the nature of the interaction between Spn-F and Ik2 is different from that attributed to Ik2 and DIAP1. We showed that Spn-F phosphorylation by Ik2 had no effect on its stability in S2 cells. Supporting this conclusion is the finding that over-expression of Ik2 in the ovaries had no effect on Spn-F stability or development [10; present study], indicating that over-expression of <italic>ik2 </italic>does not lead to Spn-F degradation. Furthermore, the ovarian phenotype of <italic>spn-F </italic>mutant is similar to the ovarian phenotype of <italic>ik2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, whereas Ik2 regulates organization of the actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation and degradation of DIAP1, in the oocyte, rather than affecting Spn-F degradation, Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex that regulates the oocyte cytoskeleton.</p><p>How does the IK2/Spn-F complex function in the germline? In this study, we showed that Ik2 and Spn-F are co-localized both to the anterior ring during mid-oogenesis and to punctate structures in the nurse cells. Additionally, Ik2 and Spn-F are mutually required for correct localization in the germline. In <italic>ik2 </italic>germline clones, Spn-F protein localization along the anterior cortex is significantly reduced relative to the wild-type egg chamber and Spn-F aggregates in the oocyte; also, there is a higher accumulation of the punctate structures containing Spn-F protein in the nurse cells as compared with the wild type. Furthermore, we found that Ik2 localization to the anterior end of the oocyte and to the punctate structure in the nurse cells depends on <italic>spn-F</italic>. Thus, we suggest that the correct localization of Spn-F and Ik2 complex to special compartment within the oocyte is an essential requirement for organization of oocyte cytoskeleton. The defects observed in <italic>ik2 </italic>and <italic>spn-F </italic>mutants oocyte are most likely due to misslocalization of the Ik2/Spn-F complex.</p><p>Immunostaining has shown that Spn-F protein localizes to the minus end of the MT network in the oocyte and also to granules in the nurse cells. In our previous work we found that depolymerization of MT and mutations in <italic>Dynein heavy chain </italic>cause a significant loss of Spn-F localization at the oocyte anterior cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, these treatments results in substantial increase in both the number and the size of Spn-F granules in the nurse cells. These observations suggest that Spn-F is transported from the nurse cells to the oocyte and that this transport could be mediated by Dynein. In the present study we found that when Ik2 was expressed alone in S2R+ cells, it was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm whereas Spn-F localized to cytoplasmic punctate structures. When both proteins were co-expressed in S2R+, Ik2 was co-localized to the cytoplasmic punctate structures along with Spn-F. Moreover, we found a higher accumulation of punctate structures containing Spn-F protein in the nurse cells in <italic>ik2 </italic>mutants as compared with the wild type, similarly to our observation in <italic>Dynein heavy chain </italic>mutant. Taking all of our results into account, we would like to propose that Spn-F is required for localization of Ik2 to cytoplasmic transport vesicles while Ik2 is required for correct transport of the complex from nurse cells to oocyte. Once the complexes are in the oocyte, they may accumulate at certain cortical sites where they promote the interaction of MTs and the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Ik2 and Spn-F form a complex which regulates cytoskeleton organization during <italic>Drosophila </italic>oogenesis and in which Spn-F is the direct regulatory target for Ik2.

Three channels (GLC sensor chip) were activated for 5 min with a mixture of 0.2 M EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodimide hydrochloride) and 0.05 M sulfo-NHS (solfo-<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide). Immediately after activation of the surfaces, Ik2-MBPHis (1 &#x003bc;g in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5) and Sec13-MBP (1 &#x003bc;g in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5) were injected across channel 2 and 3, respectively. This resulted in Ik2-MBPHis coupled at response levels of 1400 RU and Sec13-MBP coupled at response levels of 5500 RU. Channel 1 served as reference. Finally, all 3 channels were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5). Spn-F was then injected perpendicular to ligands, at six different concentrations, using a twofold dilution series within a range of 0.1625 to 5 &#x003bc;M. The six concentrations were injected simultaneously at a flow rate of 65 ul/min for 2.5 min of association phase followed by 10 min of dissociation phase at 25&#x000b0;C. The GLC sensor chip was regenerated with short injection of 50 mM NaOH between consecutive measurements. Results are expressed in arbitrary resonance units (RU) with subtraction of RU values from channel 1. Data were analyzed with ProteOn managerTM software, using the Langmuir model (A + B &#x02194; AB) for fitting kinetic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IKK: I&#x003ba;B kinase; DIAP1: <italic>Drosophila </italic>inhibitor of apoptosis 1; GFP: green fluorescent protein; MT: microtubule; MBP: maltose binding protein; co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation, HA: hemagglutinin; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ACC1: rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DDB and AB performed cell culture assays, confocal microscopy analysis, and transgenic flies work.
