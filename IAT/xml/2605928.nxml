The <italic>PHO</italic> system is a well-studied case in the transcriptional regulation responding to nutritional changes in which a set of genes (<italic>PHO</italic> genes) is expressed to activate inorganic phosphate (Pi) metabolism for adaptation to Pi starvation. Pi starvation triggers an inhibition of Pho85 kinase, leading to migration of unphosphorylated Pho4 transcriptional activator into the nucleus and enabling expression of <italic>PHO</italic> genes. When Pi is sufficient, the Pho85 kinase phosphorylates Pho4, thereby excluding it from the nucleus and resulting in repression (i.e., lack of transcription) of <italic>PHO</italic> genes. The Pho85 kinase has a role in various cellular functions other than regulation of the <italic>PHO</italic> system in that Pho85 monitors whether environmental conditions are adequate for cell growth and represses inadequate (untimely) responses in these cellular processes. In contrast, Pho4 appears to activate some genes involved in stress response and is required for G<sub>1</sub> arrest caused by DNA damage. These facts suggest the antagonistic function of these two players on a more general scale when yeast cells must cope with stress conditions. To explore general involvement of Pho4 in stress response, we tried to identify Pho4-dependent genes by a genome-wide mapping of Pho4 and Rpo21 binding (Rpo21 being the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II) using a yeast tiling array. In the course of this study, we found Pi- and Pho4-regulated intragenic and antisense RNAs that could modulate the Pi signal transduction pathway. Low-Pi signal is transmitted via certain inositol polyphosphate (IP) species (IP<sub>7</sub>) that are synthesized by Vip1 IP<sub>6</sub> kinase. We have shown that Pho4 activates the transcription of antisense and intragenic RNAs in the <italic>KCS1</italic> locus to down-regulate the Kcs1 activity, another IP<sub>6</sub> kinase, by producing truncated Kcs1 protein via hybrid formation with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA and translation of the intragenic RNA, thereby enabling Vip1 to utilize more IP<sub>6</sub> to synthesize IP<sub>7</sub> functioning in low-Pi signaling. Because Kcs1 also can phosphorylate these IP<sub>7</sub> species to synthesize IP<sub>8</sub>, reduction in Kcs1 activity can ensure accumulation of the IP<sub>7</sub> species, leading to further stimulation of low-Pi signaling (i.e., forming a positive feedback loop). We also report that genes apparently not involved in the <italic>PHO</italic> system are regulated by Pho4 either dependent upon or independent of the Pi conditions, and many of the latter genes are involved in stress response. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, a large-scale cDNA analysis and mapping of RNA polymerase II binding using a high-resolution tiling array have identified a large number of antisense RNA species whose functions are yet to be clarified. Here we have shown that nutrient-regulated antisense and intragenic RNAs as well as direct regulation of structural gene transcription function in the response to nutrient availability. Our findings also imply that Pho4 is present in the nucleus even under high-Pi conditions to activate or repress transcription, which challenges our current understanding of Pho4 regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>How does a microorganism adapt to changes in its environment? Phosphate metabolism in the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> serves as a model for investigating mechanisms involved in physiological adaptation. The nutrient inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for building nucleic acids and phospholipids; when yeast cells are deprived of Pi, genes required for scavenging the nutrient are activated. This activation is mediated by the Pho4 transcription factor through its migration into or out of nucleus. The Pi-starvation (low-Pi) signal is transmitted by a class of inositol polyphosphate (IP) species, IP<sub>7</sub>, which is synthesized by one of two IP<sub>6</sub> kinases, Vip1 or Kcs1. However, the IP<sub>7</sub> made primarily by Vip1 is key in the signaling pathway. Here we report that under Pi starvation Pho4 binds within the coding sequence of <italic>KCS1</italic> to activate transcription of both intragenic and antisense RNAs, resulting in the production of a truncated Kcs1 protein and the likely down-regulation of Kcs1 activity. Consequently Vip1 can produce more IP<sub>7</sub> to enhance the low-Pi signaling and thus form a positive feedback loop. We have also demonstrated that Pho4 regulates, both positively and negatively, transcription of genes apparently uninvolved in cellular response to Pi starvation and that it sometimes does so independently of Pi conditions. These findings reveal mechanisms that go beyond the currently held model of Pho4 regulation.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>During nutritional adaptation, transcriptional activation in yeast produces noncoding RNAs that allow the formation of a positive-feedback regulatory loop.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Nishizawa M, Komai T, Katou Y, Shirahige K, Ito T, et al.

Although the binding profiles of Rpo21 in the wild-type (wt) or &#x00394;<italic>pho4</italic> mutant exhibited some inconsistency with those expected from Pho4 binding profiles, northern analysis demonstrated Pi-independent but Pho4-dependent expression, either a decrease (<italic>ILV3</italic> and <italic>ASN1</italic>) or an increase (<italic>CIS3</italic> and <italic>YPS3</italic>) in the absence of Pho4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Gene-specific PCR demonstrated that Pho4 bound to the upstream region of these genes in vivo irrespective of Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These results raise possibilities that Pho4 can bind to a promoter under high-Pi conditions and that Pho4 binding can lead to transcriptional activation (<italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>ILV3</italic>) or repression (<italic>CIS3</italic> and <italic>YPS3</italic>). The former hypothesis challenges the current model of Pho4 regulation in which, under high-Pi conditions, Pho4 is excluded from the nucleus through phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, we further analyzed whether the activity of the <italic>ASN1</italic> promoter was dependent on Pho4 under high-Pi conditions by measuring reporter activity in cells grown in a high-Pi medium. The wt promoter was active under high-Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), and its activity level decreased to almost 50&#x00025; when a prospective Pho4 binding site (at &#x02212;451 with A of ATG as &#x0002b;1) in the promoter was mutated (<italic>ASN1</italic>mut). In the absence of Pho85 where Pho4 became active, the activity of the wt promoter was stimulated by 1.3-fold compared to that in the wt strain, but the <italic>ASN1</italic>mut promoter showed a level of the activity similar to that observed in the wt strain. In the absence of Pho4 (&#x00394;<italic>pho4</italic>), the activity of the wt <italic>ASN1</italic> promoter decreased to 50&#x00025; whereas that of the mutant promoter showed a similar level of the activity in the wt cells.

These results further demonstrated that Pho4 can activate <italic>ASN1</italic> regardless of Pi conditions, which requires the Pho4 binding sequences in its promoter.</p><fig id="pbio-0060326-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Phosphate-Independent Localization of Pho4 to the Intergenic Region or ORF of Yeast Genes</title><p>(A) Localization of Pho4 around the <italic>ILV3</italic>, <italic>ASN1</italic>, <italic>CIS3</italic>, and <italic>YPS3</italic> loci.

In the absence of Pho85 where Pho4 became active, Pho4 binding to the ORF was detected under both high- and low-Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, bottom panel) whereas that to the upstream region was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, second panel from the bottom). These results demonstrated that Pho4 binding within the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF depends on Pi conditions. We also analyzed Rpo21 binding by ChIP-on-chip and found that Rpo21 was localized to the <italic>KCS1</italic> locus in Pi- and Pho4-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, bottom two panels). This result indicated the presence of Pi- and Pho4-dependent transcription in the <italic>KCS1</italic> locus. To examine whether binding of Pho4 within the ORF could direct <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA transcription, initiation of transcription within the ORF (intragenic RNA), or synthesis of AS RNA, we carried out northern analysis using RNA probes specific to the sense or antisense strands of <italic>KCS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). With an RNA probe hybridizing with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), a transcript of ca. 3,200 nucleotides (nt), approximately the size of the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF (3,150 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), was detected, which was not dependent on either Pho4 or Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, top panel, lanes 1 to 4, designated by upper arrow). Judging from its size, this RNA species is highly likely to be the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA, because this band was not detected in &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> cells (unpublished data). In the absence of Pho85, a transcript with a smaller size (ca. 2,600 nt) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, top panel, lanes 5 and 6, designated by lower arrow), together with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA and short transcripts ranging from 2,300 to 1,800 nt in length (lanes 2, 5, and 6, designated by a vertical bar). These short sense transcripts were also detected in the wt cells under low-Pi conditions, though weakly (lane 2), but not observed in a &#x00394;<italic>pho4</italic> (lanes 3 and 4) or &#x00394;<italic>pho4</italic> &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> double mutant (lane 7). These results indicated that Pho4 binding within the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF can activate the transcription of RNAs shorter than the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA in both Pi- and Pho4-dependent manners. It should be noted that the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA level appeared reduced when these short RNA species were abundant in &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> cells (lanes 5 and 6).

Because both the AS and truncated sense RNAs were produced in &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> cells, the AS RNA hybridizing to the 5&#x02032; region of the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA might inhibit normal translation initiation or the truncated sense RNA might be translated, either of which could use the in-frame initiation codon at &#x0002b;676 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>E) to produce truncated Kcs1 protein composed of 825 amino acids plus 93 amino acids from the c-<italic>myc</italic> tag. To examine whether the AS RNA could act in <italic>trans</italic>, for example, by hybridizing to the 5&#x02032; region of the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA, we constructed a plasmid in which the AS RNA was produced from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter by placing a <italic>KCS1</italic> fragment covering &#x0002b;295 to &#x02212;950 downstream of the promoter and introduced it into a &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> strain harboring the <italic>KCS1</italic>mut gene, so that the AS RNA was provided only <italic>in trans</italic> and the short sense transcripts including the 2,600 nt intragenic RNA were not produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, top panel, lane 7). The truncated Kcs1 protein was observed only when transcription of the AS RNA was induced from the plasmid in galactose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, second panel from the bottom, lanes 9 and 10). As expected, the short sense transcripts were not detected when the AS RNA was overproduced in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, top panel). These results indicated that the AS RNA can act <italic>in trans</italic> (i.e., inhibition of the normal translation initiation, possibly by hybrid formation with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA). To test hybrid formation, we tried to detect the presence of the double-stranded (ds) RNA in the total RNA sample by RNase protection analysis using single-stranded RNA-specific RNase, followed by reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification of the protected fragments. Reverse transcription was carried out using either sense- or antisense-strand-specific primers, hybridizing to from &#x0002b;243 to &#x0002b;223 and from &#x02212;16 to &#x0002b;5 (sense and AS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, respectively). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, dsRNA of ca. 250 bp in length protected from RNase digestion was detected in &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> cells in which both sense and AS RNAs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, second panel from the top, lanes 13, 14, 17, and 18). When the RNA sample was not digested with RNase, the sense strand was successfully amplified, whereas the AS strand was not (lanes 16 and 20), indicating that the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA was present but the AS RNA was not in the RNA sample tested. In &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> cells in which both sense and AS RNAs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lane 14), dsRNA of ca. 260 bp in length protected from RNase digestion was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, second panel from the top, lanes 13, 14, 17, and 18). The &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> mutant cells do not produce the <italic>KCS1</italic> sense or AS RNAs, and accordingly the sense or AS primer failed to synthesize cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, bottom panel). When <italic>KCS1</italic>mut was expressed in &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> cells under low-Pi conditions, the sense RNA was produced but not the AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, the middle panel, lanes 16 and 20), and therefore dsRNA was not detected (lanes 13, 14, 17, and 18). Reciprocally, when the AS RNA was expressed in &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> cells, only the AS was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, second panel from the bottom, lanes 16 and 20), and the protected dsRNA fragments were, if any, below the detectable level (lanes 13, 14, 17, and 18). To confirm that the protected dsRNA was specifically amplified, we carried out the RT reaction using primers hybridizing upstream of the transcription start points of the sense or AS RNAs (at &#x02212;14 and &#x0002b;235, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>E, and those designated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The RNA samples prepared from the strains producing the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA (wt, &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic>, and &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>KCS1</italic>mut) could generate cDNA of ca. 430 bp in length when amplified with the sense&#x0002a;/AS primer pair only in the absence of RNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 21 and 23). Similarly, the AS&#x0002a;/sense primer pair could synthesize cDNA when the RNA samples containing the AS RNA were not digested by RNase (lanes 24 and 26). These results indicated that the protected dsRNA fragment was specifically transcribed and amplified by the RT-PCR reaction and therefore strongly suggested that the AS RNA can form a hybrid with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA in vivo. Such a hybrid may inhibit normal translation initiation, leading to the generation of the truncated Kcs1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intragenic RNA Can Produce the Truncated Kcs1 Protein</title><p>Although we demonstrated that the truncated Kcs1 protein could be generated independently of the short sense RNAs, it is still possible that the truncated protein is translated from the 2,600 nt intragenic RNA. To test this possibility, we constructed plasmids harboring N-terminally truncated <italic>KCS1</italic> or <italic>KCS1</italic>mut ORF fragments (&#x0002b;105 to &#x0002b;3150) and introduced them into &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>pho4</italic> mutants. Because these <italic>KCS1</italic> fragments lack the <italic>KCS1</italic> promoter, the plasmids are unable to produce the full-length <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA. With a strand-specific RNA probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), we could detect Pi- and Pho4-dependent transcripts of ca. 2,600 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, lanes 27, 28, 31, and 32). This transcript was not observed in the <italic>KCS1</italic>mut (lanes 29, 30, 33, and 34), indicating that the presence of the Pho4 binding sites is required for the production of this RNA species. Thus Pho4 could activate transcription from downstream of its binding site in the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF. Although this downstream transcription was plasmid-borne, the observed similarity in the size of transcript and its regulation strongly indicate that the 2,600 nt transcript is actually transcribed in the chromosomal <italic>KCS1</italic> locus in a Pho4-dependent fashion and not a processing (or limited degradation) product. This plasmid-derived transcript could produce protein that had a size similar to that of the truncated Kcs1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>E, lanes 36 and 39), indicating that the 2,600 nt intragenic RNA can encode the truncated Kcs1 protein. Taken together, these results indicated that Pho4 binding within the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF provokes transcription of both of the AS and the 2,600 nt intragenic RNAs, which may lead to production of the truncated Kcs1 protein by alteration of translation initiation through the formation of a hybrid with the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA and by translation of the 2,600 nt intragenic transcript.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Pho4 Modulates Phosphate-Signaling Pathway via Antisense and Intragenic RNAs</title><p>What is the biological relevance of Pi- and Pho4-dependent production of the AS and intragenic RNAs and consequently of the truncated Kcs1 protein? <italic>KCS1</italic> codes for inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) kinase synthesizing 5-diphospho myoinositol pentaphosphate (5-PP-IP<sub>5</sub>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore, it is conceivable that a decrease in the Kcs1 activity can supply more substrate for Vip1, thereby enhancing Pi signaling. The fact that overproduction of Kcs1 reduces the extent of <italic>PHO5</italic> derepression whereas a deletion of <italic>KCS1</italic> derepresses <italic>PHO5</italic> under high-Pi conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; supports this model. Although the levels of normal Kcs1 protein did not appear to be altered significantly in the presence of the AS RNA and 2,600 nt intragenic transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), the formation of a hybrid RNA could affect the normal level of the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA, which may cause a slight difference in the level of the Kcs1 protein not detectable by western analysis. In addition, the presence of the truncated Kcs1 may perturb normal function of Kcs1. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the effects of the AS RNA and the intragenic sense transcript on <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> expression by northern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g005">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>PHO84</italic> responds more quickly to a change in Pi conditions than <italic>PHO5</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In the wt cells, <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> were expressed only under low-Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g005">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 1 and 2) but not in the absence of Pho4 (lanes 5 and 6). The two genes were expressed under high-Pi conditions in &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g005">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 7 and 8) as reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, which was suppressed by the wt <italic>KCS1</italic> in a YCp plasmid (lanes 9 and 10). This result indicated that the plasmid-borne Kcs1 is functional. <italic>KCS1</italic>mut that produced neither the AS RNA nor the intragenic transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) showed a decreased expression level of the two genes under low-Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060326-g005">Figure 5</xref>, lane 12), suggesting that the low-Pi signal was not transmitted sufficiently to activate Pho4. On the other hand, overexpression of the AS RNA in the wt cells resulted in a significant derepression of the two genes under high-Pi conditions (lanes 1 and 13), suggesting that the low-Pi signal was transmitted to activate Pho4 under high-Pi conditions in this case. This stimulatory function of the AS RNA was dependent on the presence of Vip1 IP<sub>6</sub> kinase (lane 19) that functions in low-Pi signal transmission &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. This result further supported the conclusion that the AS RNA functions in the low-Pi signal transduction pathway. We also overproduced a truncated Kcs1 protein (dKcs1, &#x0002b;670 to &#x0002b;3150) in the wt cells, which caused derepression of <italic>PHO84</italic>, albeit weakly, and barely detectable expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> under high-Pi conditions (lane 15). The different expression levels of <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> can be attributed to different responsiveness of the two genes against the change in the environmental Pi level &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. We also assayed the activity of acid phosphatase encoded by <italic>PHO5</italic> in the strains with a combination of various plasmids as tested in northern analysis and found that the levels of the enzyme activities correlated with the mRNA level (unpublished data). These results indicated that the presence or absence of the AS RNA and the 2,600 nt intragenic RNA cause altered regulation of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>PHO84</italic> responding to Pi conditions, and therefore it is likely that the Kcs1 activity was modulated by the RNAs, the truncated Kcs1 protein, or both. The apparently weak effect on Pi signaling of dKcs1 compared to that of the AS RNA suggests that the truncated protein is not solely responsible for the stimulation of the low-Pi signaling. The AS RNA could play a certain role in this stimulation process, possibly through modulation of the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA and protein levels. Thus, Pho4 appears to enhance low-Pi signaling by expressing the AS and the intragenic RNAs from within the <italic>KCS1</italic> ORF, thereby constituting the positive feedback loop in the Pi signaling pathway.</p><fig id="pbio-0060326-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Effect of <italic>KCS1</italic> and <italic>VIP1</italic> on <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>PHO5</italic> Expression Analyzed by Northern Blotting</title><p>The wt, various mutants, or those harboring plasmids expressing <italic>KCS1</italic>, <italic>KCS1</italic>mut, AS RNA, or a truncated Kcs1 protein (dKcs1) were incubated for 5 h in high (H)- or low (L)-Pi media before isolation of total RNA as described in Methods. <italic>ACT1</italic> is the loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060326.g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we reported three novel findings derived from the ChIP-on-chip analyses of Pho4 and Rpo21 binding throughout the entire yeast genome: (i) the finding of novel <italic>PHO</italic>-type genes, (ii) the ability of Pho4 either to activate or to repress transcription independently of environmental Pi conditions, and (iii) the presence of Pi-regulated AS and intragenic RNAs that modulate Pi signal transmission.

If the current model were correct, then Pho4 should somehow avoid phosphorylation by Pho85, or if phosphorylated, then the modified Pho4 should have much less affinity to the Msn5 exportin to remain in the nucleus. Recently, Zappacosta et al reported Pi-dependent phosphorylation of Pho4 at Ser242 and Ser243 by a kinase other than Pho85 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Phosphorylation of these two sites, however, appears less dependent on Pi than that at those sites modified by Pho85 (i.e., Ser at 100, 114, 128, 152, and 223) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. We could imagine that, under high-Pi conditions, prior phosphorylation of the Ser242, Ser243, or both by this unknown kinase could prevent phosphorylation of the other Ser residues by Pho85, thereby decreasing the affinity of Pho4 for Msn5 while increasing the affinity to the target promoter, including <italic>ASN1</italic>. Alternatively, Pho4 modified at Ser242, Ser243, or both might have more affinity to a yet unknown factor than to the exportin, and the resulting complex might be recruited to the target promoter regardless of phosphorylation by Pho85.</p><p>The Pho4 transcription factor appeared to repress <italic>CIS3</italic> and <italic>YPS3</italic>, both cell wall constituents.

However, the scenario may not be so simple, because the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA transcription itself can interfere with Pho4 binding, as reported in the <italic>SER3</italic>/<italic>SRG1</italic> case &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, the AS RNA could cause transcriptional collision with the mRNA, and hybrid formation of the AS RNA with the mRNA could lead to degradation of the mRNA. Both of these events could lead to a reduction in the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA level.</p><p>The stimulation of low-Pi signaling by Pho4-dependent intragenic and AS RNA represents an autoregulation (induction) or positive feedback loop responding to Pi limitation that can be envisioned as follows. Upon Pi limitation, the low-Pi signal is transmitted to Pho81, leading to inhibition of Pho85-Pho80 and thereby stimulating Pho4 migration into the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Pho4 then activates transcription of the AS and intragenic RNAs in the <italic>KCS1</italic> locus: the AS RNA could reduce the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA level by hybrid formation and possible transcriptional collision, which can lead to stabilization of Pho4 binding, resulting in the production of more AS and intragenic RNAs and consequently of more truncated Kcs1 protein using the downstream ATG codon at &#x0002b;676. These events could lead to down-regulation of Kcs1 activity, enabling Vip1 IP<sub>6</sub> kinase to utilize more IP<sub>6</sub> to synthesize 4- or 6-PP-IP<sub>5</sub> functioning in low-Pi signaling. Because Kcs1 also can phosphorylate these IP<sub>7</sub> species to synthesize 4,5- or 5,6-PP<sub>2</sub>-IP<sub>5</sub> (IP<sub>8</sub>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, reduction of the Kcs1 level can ensure accumulation of the IP<sub>7</sub> species to further stimulate low-Pi signaling, leading to complete inhibition of Pho85-Pho80. When Pi becomes sufficient, this loop runs in an opposite way for efficient inactivation of Pho4 and consequent repression of <italic>PHO</italic> genes. Though putative Pho4 binding sequences are present at &#x02212;464 and &#x02212;154 in its promoter, <italic>VIP1</italic> expression was dependent on neither Pi condition nor Pho4 (unpublished data), as in the case of the <italic>KCS1</italic> mRNA. Inositol polyphosphate (IP) plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction as second messengers. The absence of Kcs1 and Vip1 causes abnormal vacuolar function and cell morphology, respectively, suggesting that they bear important cellular function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is reasonable that the genes involved in IP synthesis are not regulated directly by individual nutrients (in this case, Pi) but indirectly by AS and intragenic RNAs responding to the nutrient, so that signal transduction and normal cellular function are not easily perturbed by fluctuation in the status of an individual nutrient.</p><p>Positive feedback in the <italic>PHO</italic> system is also suggested to function in switching of Pi transporters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, in which Spl2, activated by Pho4, down-regulates low-affinity Pi transporters, Pho87 and Pho90, whereas high-affinity Pi transporter Pho84 is activated by Pho4. When the intracellular Pi level increases via the high-affinity transporter, Pho4 is inactivated to switch the transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title><italic>PHO</italic> System To Explore Intimately Wired Transcriptional Regulation System</title><p>Our finding expands the role of the Pho4 transcription factor beyond the regulation of the <italic>PHO</italic> system. The current consensus view is that it is the master regulator of the genes involved in the system, in that Pho4 activates transcription of the structural genes composing the <italic>PHO</italic> system to coordinate cellular response to Pi starvation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Our findings indicate that Pho4 can modulate the activity levels of the products of apparently non-<italic>PHO</italic> genes by activating antisense and intragenic RNA expression to stimulate low-Pi signal transduction. A &#x00394;<italic>pho85</italic> deletion causes pleiotropic mutant phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, some of which could be based on otherwise dormant transcriptional initiation, either intergenic or intragenic, or on the AS strand, caused by hyperactive Pho4. In fact, we have also found Pi- and Pho4-regulated AS RNA in the <italic>GTO3</italic> locus and intragenic sense transcript in the <italic>SHE9</italic> locus (unpublished data). <italic>GTO3</italic> encodes an omega class glutathione-S-transferase having glutaredoxin activity, which is suggested to maintain an adequate redox state of specific target proteins, not in the general defense against oxidative stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>SHE9</italic>, also known as <italic>MDM33</italic>, encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein functioning to maintain mitochondrial morphology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Although, at present, we are unable to elucidate whether the <italic>GTO3</italic> AS RNA or the <italic>SHE9</italic> intragenic transcript can affect the annotated function of the respective gene product, this line of work will lead us to uncover yet unknown protein functions in the cellular response to Pi starvation.</p><p>Regulation of gene expression and function by these nonconventional RNA species that are regulated by nutrient signals need not be restricted to the <italic>PHO</italic> system. Other inducible systems including <italic>GAL</italic>, glucose repression, and various stresses may well have these RNA species regulated by corresponding signals. High-throughput cDNA sequencing by Miura et al. and other works using microarrays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; have revealed the presence of many intergenic, intragenic, and antisense RNAs in the yeast transcriptome. The finding of nutrient-regulated RNAs that are not coding annotated proteins adds more complexity to the intimately wired transcriptional regulation system by which yeast cells adapt to alterations in environmental conditions. High-resolution mapping of transcription factor and RNA polymerase II binding and very recent development of DNA&#x02013;RNA hybridization techniques &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; will help to identify these regulatory RNAs. The yeast system, which can be manipulated by an array of genetic tools and for which there exists a substantial body of genetic information, will be the best resource to explore the complexity of the genetic network, including ncRNA species that function in responding to external signals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains and molecular biology.</title><p>Standard yeast genetics and media were used as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060326-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.
