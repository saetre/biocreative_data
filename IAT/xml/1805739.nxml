In chicken embryos, migrating neural crest cells express catecholamines at Hamburger/Hamilton Stage (St.) 19, and these cells form the primary sympathetic chain dorsolateral to the aorta at St. 22 (E3.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Between St. 23 (E4) and St. 28 (E6), these cells disperse and undergo a secondary migration to form the paravertebral sympathetic chain that resides ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. After ganglia coalesce, sympathoblasts express markers of neuronal differentiation, such as Q211 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), at a time when they also incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Time lapse photography has shown that cultured E15.5&#x02013;E16.5 sympathetic neurons from rat embryos extend axons while they divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although proliferation appears to be an important process to expand the sympathetic neuron population during differentiation, the mechanisms that guide sympathoblast proliferation have not been identified.</p><p>The development of sympathetic neurons is guided by neurotrophins. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) binds to its receptor, TrkC, to promote the survival of cultured sympathoblasts from early lumbar paravertebral ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nerve growth factor (NGF) signals through its receptor, TrkA, to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons upon target innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There are severe sympathetic defects in the superior cervical ganglion of individual NT-3 and NGF knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no additional cell death in the superior cervical ganglion of NT-3 and NGF double knockout mouse embryos, suggesting that all of the neurons are dependent on both neurotrophins for survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is also an increase in sympathetic neuron cell death in TrkA knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, in TrkB and BDNF knockout mice, there is no apparent phenotype in the superior cervical ganglion, and there is little evidence that TrkB or BDNF is expressed in sympathetic ganglia. Thus, it is generally thought that TrkB and BDNF have little or no roles in guiding the development of sympathetic neurons.</p><p>In addition to their developmental functions, neurotrophin receptors regulate cell behavior in neuroblastoma, a tumor found in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. Tumors that express TrkA often spontaneously regress, while those that express TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), grow aggressively, are invasive, and fail to respond to chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The presence of TrkA in neuroblastoma tumors is consistent with its expression in developing sympathetic neurons, and suggests that regressive neuroblastoma tumors arise from early sympathetic neurons that express TrkA. The function of TrkB in early sympathetic development is unknown, which makes understanding the etiology of aggressive neuroblastoma tumors difficult. Based on its function in neuroblastoma tumors, we hypothesize that BDNF and TrkB expression in differentiating sympathoblasts is responsible for expanding the neuronal population through proliferation.</p><p>We sought to determine whether BDNF and TrkB are involved in sympathetic development. We report that during early embryonic development, TrkB is expressed in a subset of differentiating sympathoblasts in both avian and murine embryos. We also find that BDNF promotes the proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in cell culture. However, the majority of TrkB positive cells in vivo fail to take up bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) over a 24 hr period, suggesting that endogenous BDNF concentrations do not reach a threshold necessary to stimulate proliferation of sympathoblasts. Shortly after all of the TrkB positive cells commence neuronal differentiation, TrkB immunoreactivity is lost. These results suggest that prolonged expression and/or activation of TrkB signaling at these early stages may be an early event triggering the formation of neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TrkB is expressed during migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia</title><p>We first determined whether TrkB is expressed in neural crest-derived cells in the region ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia where sympathetic ganglia coalesce between Hamburger/Hamilton Stages (St.) 25&#x02013;28/29. To identify cells that have commenced neuronal differentiation, transverse sections of the lumbar spinal column region were stained with antibodies against Hu C/D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein, or Islet-1, a transcription factor found in sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We found that Hu C/D and Islet-1 are expressed in the same cells both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>throughout sympathetic development. In experiments done between St. 25 and 28, Islet-1 staining appeared weaker than Hu C/D staining, and thus we used Hu C/D to identify differentiating neurons at these stages. At later stages, Islet-1 was used to facilitate the identification of neurons because of the nuclear location of its immunoreactivity.</p><p>Cells expressing Hu C/D are first detected at St. 25 ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and lateral to the dorsal aorta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref>). By St. 26, the number of cells that express Hu C/D in this region increases dramatically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). TrkB-expressing cells first appear at St. 27 in the same region and are adjacent to Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2H</xref>). TrkB-positive cells co-localize with a neural crest marker, HNK-1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, 2C, 2D</xref>). The Hu C/D-positive cells in this region are likely to be sympathetic neurons, since they appear in the region where sympathetic ganglia form and express tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, 2F, 2G</xref>). At St. 28/29, the cells begin to coalesce ventral to the dorsal root ganglion and the Hu C/D-positive cells and TrkB-positive cells remain as two separate cell populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>); however, shortly afterwards, all of the TrkB-positive cells begin to express Islet-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and Hu C/D (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TrkB-expressing cells surround neurons during sympathetic gangliogenesis</bold>.

We find that approximately 30% of the Islet-1-positive cells express TrkA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), while 50% express TrkB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and 100% express TrkC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) at St. 29/30 (E6.5). Thus, all developing neurons express TrkC in combination with either TrkA or TrkB. By St. 31 (E7), the number of TrkA-positive, Islet-1-positive cells increases to 100% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) and immunoreactivities for both TrkB and TrkC appear dispersed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, 3F</xref>).

We also examined the early development of murine sympathetic ganglia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

For these experiments, we identified differentiating neurons with the transcription factor Islet-1 because this marker labels nuclei, thus it co localizes with any BrdU that has been incorporated into the DNA, allowing us to determine whether the cell had undergone S-phase of the cell cycle. After 12 hrs in BrdU, 59% of Islet-1-positive nuclei stain for BrdU immunoreactivity. Thus, cultures of St. 29/30 sympathetic ganglia contain many cells that proliferate while exhibiting markers of neuronal differentiation, confirming previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

We monitored cultures over a three day period after plating and counted the number of phase bright cells with neurites, a morphological feature of both neurons and sympathoblasts. In the absence of trophic factors, more than 2/3 of the cells die by 24 hours in culture and BDNF, NT-3, or NGF alone is not sufficient to promote survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, NGF together with NT-3 supports the survival of a significantly larger number of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

If BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing a non-neuronal cell to express Hu C/D, then we expected that the total cell number would remain the same and that there would be a decrease in the number of non-neuronal cells as well as a corresponding increase in the number of neurons. After 24 hours, BDNF significantly increases the number of p75NTR-positive cells as well as the number of Hu C/D-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). However, there was no statistically significant change in the number of non-neuronal cells. Thus, it is unlikely that BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing differentiation of non-neuronal cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>BDNF increases the total number of differentiating neurons by inducing proliferation</bold>.

Even in the control condition, a number of cells in the culture are dividing, giving a high baseline of BrdU incorporation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). When BDNF is added, the total number of BrdU positive cells increases approximately 1.6-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). This BDNF-induced increase in the total number of BrdU positive cells occurs in sympathoblasts because the number of Islet-1-positive nuclei from control cultures that label with BrdU is 268 &#x000b1; 59 and BDNF treatment raises this number to 424 &#x000b1; 80, which corresponds to an increase of 1.6-fold. This accounts for the 1.6-fold increase in total neuron number and total BrdU-positive cells described above. We then confirmed that BDNF acts on TrkB-positive cells: BDNF increases the number of TrkB-expressing cells that incorporate BrdU 2.6 &#x02013; 4-fold over control (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and it also increases the overall number of TrkB-positive cells 2 &#x02013; 2.5-fold over control (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). BDNF does not increase the number of BrdU-positive, TrkB-negative cells or the overall number of TrkB-negative cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In further support that BDNF acts directly on TrkB-expressing cells, an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of TrkB completely prevents the effect of BDNF in promoting proliferation of TrkB-positive, but not TrkB-negative cells (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Thus, the effect of BDNF is restricted to the population that expresses TrkB, which are developing sympathoblasts.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Effects of BDNF on BrdU Incorporation in TrkB-Expressing Cells from St. 29/30 (E6.5) Sympathetic Cultures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">BDNF</td><td align="center">Fold Increase</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Experiment 1:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">BrdU+/TrkB+</td><td align="center">219 &#x000b1; 34</td><td align="center">845* &#x000b1; 95</td><td align="center">4&#x000d7;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">TrkB+</td><td align="center">438 &#x000b1; 55</td><td align="center">1111* &#x000b1; 153</td><td align="center">2.5&#x000d7;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">BrdU+/TrkB-</td><td align="center">258 &#x000b1; 36</td><td align="center">187 &#x000b1; 14</td><td align="center">No change</td></tr><tr><td align="center">TrkB-</td><td align="center">962 &#x000b1; 42</td><td align="center">900 &#x000b1; 109</td><td align="center">No change</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Experiment 2:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">BrdU+/TrkB+</td><td align="center">258 &#x000b1; 54</td><td align="center">673* &#x000b1; 64</td><td align="center">2.6&#x000d7;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">TrkB+</td><td align="center">508 &#x000b1; 77</td><td align="center">947* &#x000b1; 126</td><td align="center">2&#x000d7;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">BrdU+/TrkB-</td><td align="center">211 &#x000b1; 14</td><td align="center">180 &#x000b1; 48</td><td align="center">No change</td></tr><tr><td align="center">TrkB-</td><td align="center">892 &#x000b1; 75</td><td align="center">834 &#x000b1; 105</td><td align="center">No change</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Cultures of St 29/30 (E6.5) lumbar sympathetic ganglia were exposed to 10 &#x003bc;M BrdU for 12 hrs, followed by complete medium lacking BrdU.

In the chicken, TrkB expression is transient, and completely lost by St 34 (E8). Since BDNF induces the proliferation of sympathoblasts in cell culture, yet <italic>in vivo </italic>there is little proliferation observed in TrkB-positive cells in nascent ganglia, we propose that if TrkB activation becomes unregulated by excess BDNF or constitutive phosphorylation of TrkB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], this transient population of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts may trigger the genesis of neuroblastoma, a childhood tumor found in the paravertebral chain and adrenal medulla.</p><p>The two populations of sympathoblasts that we observe support previous findings of heterogeneity among developing sympathetic neurons and neural crest cells. Early sympathetic ganglia contain at least two subpopulations: early differentiating neurons that lack TrkB expression and express TrkA and TrkC, and late differentiating sympathoblasts that express TrkB. Explant cultures of sympathetic ganglia from E16 chick embryos give rise to two neuronal populations: one that remains close to the explant, and one that migrates away from the explant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, early neuronal subpopulations have been observed in cultures of neural crest cells from St. 13/14 quail embryos as evidenced by the expression of neuronal cell type-specific gangliosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Perhaps these different subpopulations will ultimately give rise to the two neurochemically distinct populations found in lumbar sympathetic ganglia: the noradrenergic, NPY-containing neurons that innervate internal organs and enteric ganglia and the cholinergic, VIP-containing neurons that innervate vasculature in the hind limbs.</p><p>The effects of BDNF and TrkB deletion and over expression have been studied on superior cervical ganglion and preganglionic neurons in thoracic segments of the spinal column, but not on paravertebral sympathetic neurons. In the superior cervical ganglion, an increase in the number of neurons of BDNF null mice is likely due to apoptosis induced by BDNF via p75NTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, the responses of paravertebral sympathetic neurons to BDNF are complex and subtype dependent. Over expression of BDNF leads to an increase in the number of noradrenergic fibers innervating the erector pilli muscles of hair follicles, while noradrenergic fibers innervating blood vessels were unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. If our results indicating that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in the chicken embryo can be extrapolated to the subset of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in murine ganglia, then these TrkB-positive cells may be neurons destined to innervate the erector pilli. In other studies, TrkB null mice showed no changes in morphology or cell number in superior cervical ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or in the intermediolateral column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; but this may not be predictive of a phenotype in the lumbar paravertebral chain. It is thus possible that BDNF/TrkB signaling could play a specific role in other regions of the paravertebral sympathetic chain, such as the lumbar region. However, if TrkB-positive cells are not normally actively proliferating <italic>in vivo</italic>, then it would not be surprising that the development of the paravertebral sympathetic chain is not disrupted in TrkB or BDNF null mice. It may be more informative to examine mice that over express BDNF on a promoter that targets expression to embryonic lumbar ganglia. Unfortunately, such mice do not exist.</p><p>Our findings that the St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts are dependent on both NT-3 and NGF for survival in culture are consistent with previous work on mouse sympathoblasts from the superior cervical ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In these studies, NT-3 and NGF deletion separately led to a decrease in the number of sympathetic neurons at E17.5 compared to control. Deletion of both NT-3 and NGF together did not enhance cell death. In contrast, cultured rat superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons respond to NT-3 at E14.5 and then to NGF at E19.5, although time points in between were not analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to promoting survival, NT-3, NGF, and BDNF also induce proliferation of various neuronal precursors at different stages of development. NT-3 can promote the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine into cultured quail neural crest cells from the trunk region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Later in rat sympathetic development, NT-3 supports survival of neurons, but does not promote proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which is consistent with our results. NGF promotes an increase in BrdU incorporation from 25% to 35% in the DRG cervical segment 2 in the chick embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In chicken embryos that are treated with NGF <italic>in ovo </italic>at St. 18 and 21, there is an increase in BrdU uptake after formation of the primary sympathetic chain at St. 23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Since NGF does not appear to affect proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) chick sympathoblasts, NGF may only promote proliferation in primary, but not secondary chain sympathoblasts. Motor neuron progenitors in the ventral neural tube from the chick embryo express TrkB and when ventral neural tube explants are treated with BDNF, there is an increase in the number of motor neurons produced and BrdU incorporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. BDNF also promotes the proliferation of cultured neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Taken together, these results are consistent with our findings that NT-3 and NGF do not promote proliferation of St. 29/30 (E6.5) sympathoblasts, and support the assertion that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB-positive sympathoblasts in culture.</p><p>Our observations suggest a transient function of TrkB during early sympathetic development in supporting proliferation of this early subpopulation of sympathoblasts. However, the <italic>in vivo </italic>labeling suggests that only a minority (10&#x02013;20%) of this population is dividing during the window that TrkB is expressed. In light of the very strong proliferative effect produced in cell culture, these TrkB expressing cells could respond more strongly if endogenous BDNF rises to higher levels, or if the mechanism that down regulates TrkB expression becomes nonfunctional. Such events could trigger an early proliferative event that leads to a cascade of changes that initiates transformation of cells to neuroblastoma. Thus, these early TrkB expressing cells help solve the puzzle as to why TrkB is expressed in aggressive and invasive forms of neuroblastoma, particularly because BDNF induces cultured neuroblastoma cells to become more proliferative, invasive, angiogenic, and resistant to chemotherapeutic reagents than untreated cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Future studies will determine whether constitutive expression of BDNF and TrkB in the chick embryo sustains proliferation of differentiating sympathoblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified a time point during development when differentiating lumbar sympathetic neurons transiently express TrkB and proliferate in response to high concentrations of BDNF in culture. These studies suggest that elevated BDNF expression above basal levels and signaling through TrkB may be a mechanism that contributes to the onset of neuroblastoma. A further understanding of the two populations of sympathetic neurons and the fate of the TrkB-positive cells will provide additional insight into the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and the genesis of neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of tissue for immunohistochemistry</title><p>The lumbar spinal column and surrounding tissues were dissected from chicken embryos at the indicated stages and placed in Zamboni's fixative (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 15% (v/v) picric acid in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for two hours at room temperature.
