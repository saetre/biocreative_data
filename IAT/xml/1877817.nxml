Two experiments were performed to address this issue.

Second, clonal analysis of dividing &#x003b2; cells was completed; all clones were of comparable size. These results support the conclusion that the &#x003b2; cell pool is homogeneous with respect to replicative capacity and suggest that all &#x003b2; cells are candidates for in vitro expansion.

Together, these results demonstrate that &#x003b2; cell mass is predominately, if not exclusively, sustained through the replication of &#x003b2; cells.</p><p>It remains unclear whether all &#x003b2; cells contribute equally to growth and maintenance. Two possible models might explain the expansion of &#x003b2; cells. The &#x003b2; cell population may be heterogeneous, comprised of both highly replicative cells and very slowly dividing, possibly postmitotic, cells. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that a subpopulation of insulin-expressing cells may maintain the entire pool, perhaps as unipotent adult stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; or by reversible dedifferentiation to a replicative state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternately, the &#x003b2; cell population may be homogeneous, with all &#x003b2; cells contributing equally to growth.</p><p>Two approaches were used to address this issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g001">Figure 1</xref>). First, a broad survey of the replicative potential of the entire &#x003b2; cell pool was performed by monitoring the dilution or disappearance of a fluorescent marker accompanying cell division. &#x003b2; cells were pulse labeled with a tetracycline-inducible histone 2B&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (H2BGFP) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and, following a chase period, the level of fluorescence detectable within &#x003b2; cells was measured. Second, the clonal descendents of individual &#x003b2; cells were examined using a reporter system developed for mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Both assays are designed to assess whether &#x003b2; cells are a heterogeneous population. If &#x003b2; cells are heterogeneous, highly replicative &#x003b2; cells will lose the H2BGFP label quickly as they replicate and generate large clones, while slowly dividing &#x003b2; cells will retain the H2BGFP label and generate small clones. Alternately, if &#x003b2; cells are a homogenous population, all &#x003b2; cells would be expected to lose the H2BGFP label at similar rates, and all clones should be of comparable size. We observed uniform loss of the H2BGFP label with time, and detected only similarly sized clones in the chase population. The tetracycline-inducible H2BGFP and MADM systems are complementary approaches, both supporting the conclusion that all &#x003b2; cells contribute equally to &#x003b2; cell growth and maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>H2BGFP Is Diluted with Cell Division In Vitro</title><p>Tumbar et al. engineered transgenic mice expressing H2BGFP from a tetracycline-responsive promoter (tetracycline-inducible promoter &#x0005b;tetO&#x0005d;&#x02013;H2BGFP) to mark cells and assess their rates of division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. To verify that H2BGFP is diluted with cell division and distributed equally between daughter cells, we characterized the tetO-H2BGFP system in vitro. Rosa26 and CAGGs (constitutive promoters containing the CMV enhancer and the chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter) are commonly used in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) and mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. We used these promoters to drive expression of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) in the presence of doxycycline. Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP mEFs and CAGGs-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP mES cells express H2BGFP within 12 h of doxycycline application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">2</xref>C). Doxycycline was removed from the media, and the progressive dilution of H2BGFP protein resulting from cell division was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and data not shown). A uniform loss of label was observed and the median GFP intensity of GFP-positive cells decreased with time. Given that mEFs divide every 24 h (unpublished data), and that H2BGFP fluorescence can no longer be detected after 5 d, H2BGFP fluorescence is no longer detectable above background in vitro by FACS after a population has undergone approximately five cell divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The standard deviation of fluorescent intensity within the labeled pulse population is too large to precisely measure the number of cell divisions within the chase population.</p><p>To verify that H2BGFP is segregated equally between daughter cells, CAGGs-rtTA: tetO-H2BGFP mES cells were cultured on the stage of a confocal microscope and imaged every 12 min. After the first division, total GFP fluorescence in the two daughter cells, measured as integrated pixel inten-sity, added up to the fluorescence of the original cell, and H2BGFP was split equally between daughter cells in the first and second divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). In both dividing and nondividing cells, minimal bleaching was observed, despite imaging every 12 min over 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and unpublished data). Detection of H2BGFP fluorescence is dependent on the laser settings used. In this case, H2BGFP fluorescence was no longer detectable after three rounds of cell replication, though lower laser intensities were used than typically employed for fixed tissue sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>H2BGFP Incorporation Is Replication Independent</title><p>Because &#x003b2; cells divide slowly, and some may be postmitotic, it was important to determine whether all cells, regardless of replicative activity, can be labeled by the inducible H2BGFP system. We found that H2BGFP labeling occurs independent of cell division in cultured Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP mEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050163-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Cells treated with mitomycin C are irreversibly arrested in S phase, but still express H2BGFP, which incorporates into the nucleus within 12 h of the administration of doxycycline. Furthermore, cells reversibly arrested with either aphidicolin (G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> block) or nocadozole (G<sub>2</sub>/M block) express H2BGFP upon treatment with doxycycline. At 3 h after release from nocadozole, cells develop labeled mitotic spindles, indicating that the H2BGFP has been integrated into chromatin and not just added to a nuclear histone pool (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>In Postmitotic Cell Populations, H2BGFP Is Stable for at Least Six Months</title><p>The Rosa26 locus is active in most cells of the mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that in the presence of doxycycline, Rosa26-rtTA should drive tetO-H2BGFP expression and label most mouse cells. Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP labeled diverse cell types, including but not limited to pancreas, intestine, fat, bone marrow, muscle, skin, and retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">4</xref>, and unpublished data), but not cortical neurons, olfactory bulb, or spinal cord, possibly due to the inability of doxycycline to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (unpublished data). Under repressive conditions (without doxycycline), no expression was observed in these organs (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">4</xref>).</p><p>The stability of H2BGFP can be most easily assessed in postmitotic cells, where any loss of fluorescence with time can only be explained by degradation of the H2BGFP protein. Mammalian photoreceptor cells are postmitotic and are not replaced over the lifespan of the animal; they are identified by their position within the outer nuclear layer of the retina and by expression of the calcium-binding protein recoverin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Photoreceptor cells can be labeled by Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Following a chase of 6 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), H2BGFP was detected in whole eyes and sectioned retinas at the same imaging settings used to collect pulse data. Staining with recoverin verified that label retention is restricted to the photoreceptor layer of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, the H2BGFP label is stable and retained in postmitotic cells. It is formally possible that the H2BGFP protein has a shorter half-life in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells than in postmitotic photoreceptor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>LRCs Can Be Identified in Known Stem Cell Populations Using H2BGFP</title><p>As a further validation that the tetO-H2BGFP system can identify heterogeneity in cell populations, we confirmed that we could detect nonuniform loss of H2BGFP in tissues where slow-cycling cells are known to exist. Stem cells are often proliferatively quiescent compared with neighboring transit-amplifying cells. Because of their slow-dividing nature, stem cells tend to remain labeled in experiments that use DNA synthesis labels such as tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine. Label-retaining cells (LRCs) in Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP mice are clearly visible in the hair follicle bulge cells after a 2 mo chase, as previously shown by Tumbar et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Furthermore, GFP-positive intestinal crypt cells can be identified up to 1 mo following the pulse, though the vast majority of the labeled cells in chase intestines seem to be slowly dividing mesenchymal cells and intestinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Finally, Lin<sup>low</sup>kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>sca<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> sorted hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow also retain GFP fluorescence to a much greater extent than whole bone marrow (unpublished data). Because pulse&#x02013;chase experiments using tetO-H2BGFP can identify tissue heterogeneity in the form of slowly dividing stem cell populations, it should also be able to identify a subpopulation of slowly dividing &#x003b2; cells, should it exist.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>No LRCs Are Detected in the &#x003b2; Cell Population</title><p>To determine whether all &#x003b2; cells divide at the same rate, we used the tetO-H2BGFP strategy in combination with promoters that express either tetracycline transactivator (tTA) or rtTA within the pancreas. Pdx1 expression in the postnatal pancreas is enriched in &#x003b2; cells, where it regulates insulin expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In tetO-H2BGFP animals, expression of tTA from the native Pdx1 locus (Pdx1-tTA) should label &#x003b2; cells in the absence of doxycycline, while the transgenic rat insulin promoter (RIP)&#x02013;rtTA should label &#x003b2; cells in the presence of doxycycline. However, RIP-rtTA, but not Pdx1-tTA, labeled &#x003b2; cells even in unpulsed animals (unpublished data and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that the RIP-rtTA transgene system is leaky. Therefore, Pdx1-tTA is the only &#x003b2; cell&#x02013;specific driver suitable for these experiments. It should be noted that Pdx1-tTA animals are haploinsufficient; however, mice with one inactivated Pdx1 allele can be maintained in the heterozygous state and have normal pancreatic development and &#x003b2; cell maintenance, though they show modestly impaired glucose tolerance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Pulsing Pdx1-tTA; tetO-H2BGFP animals for 6 wk after birth labeled 80&#x00025; of &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition to labeling &#x003b2; cells, some labeled nuclei occurred outside the &#x003b2; cell pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050163-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide&#x02013;expressing cells were frequently labeled in Pdx1-tTA; tetO-H2BGFP animals, consistent with the fact that Pdx1 was originally cloned from somatostatin-producing islet cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and that Pdx1 expression can be detected in these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Rare glucagon cells were labeled, while exocrine cells (amylase-positive) were consistently weakly labeled, and no H2BGFP expression was observed in the ducts (CK19-positive; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050163-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These observations are also consistent with the findings of Oster et al., who observed rare Pdx1-immunoreactive nuclei in all pancreatic cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The entire &#x003b2; cell pool was assayed for LRCs. A group of 38 Pdx1-tTA; tetO-H2BGFP animals (19 female, 19 male) were pulsed from birth until 6 wk of age by ceasing doxycycline administration at postpartum day 0 (P0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Six of these animals (three male, three female) were euthanized following a 6-wk postnatal pulse. All animals collected in the pulse group showed 80&#x00025; of &#x003b2; cells labeled with H2BGFP; labeling was consistent throughout the pancreas and between animals (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6). The remaining mice were again administered doxycycline water to repress transcription of H2BGFP, and were euthanized after chase periods of 1 wk (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), 2 wk (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), 1 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), 2 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), 3 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), and 6 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6). Sections of the pancreati were stained with insulin to identify &#x003b2; cells. We observed a uniform loss of label in &#x003b2; cells with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To confirm this finding, the experiment was repeated with Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP animals. A group of 40 animals (18 female, 22 male) were pulsed from conception until 6 wk of age by administration of doxycycline water. Eight animals (four male, four female) were euthanized at 6 wk of age. Pulse expression in these mice was more variable between animals than for Pdx1-tTA; tetO-H2BGFP mice, so all experiments were performed on sibling cohorts. The remaining mice were removed from doxycycline and were euthanized after chase periods of 1 wk (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), 2 wk (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), 1 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), 2 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), 3 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), and 6 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6). Sections of the pancreati were stained with insulin to identify &#x003b2; cells. Again, we observed uniform loss of label in &#x003b2; cells with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To measure the relative intensity of GFP-positive cells, we used FACS analysis of dissociated islet cells. For these experiments, littermates were pulsed for at least 6 wk, and chases were structured so that all animals could be euthanized and analyzed by FACS on the same day. Importantly, comparisons of animals pulsed for 6 or 14 wk showed no significant increase in the median intensity of the GFP-positive population (unpublished data). By analyzing all timepoints in parallel, we were able to compare the relative GFP intensity between the pulse and chase populations.

The MADM system is a unique tool that allows low-frequency labeling of cells, a prerequisite for clonal analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050163-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). It contains two alleles at the Rosa26 locus, <italic>Rosa26<sup>GR</sup></italic> and <italic>Rosa26<sup>RG</sup>,</italic> each containing reciprocal parts of chimeric marker genes (<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>RFP</italic>) interrupted by a loxP site. Neither allele generates an active fluorescent protein until Cre-mediated interchromosomal recombination restores functional expression of <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>RFP.</italic> Cells are labeled differently depending on when recombination occurs during the cell cycle. Recombination at G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> results in double-colored cells (expressing both <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>RFP</italic>). Alternately, recombination at G<sub>2</sub> results in two outcomes at equal frequency: either one red and one green daughter cell (single-colored cells), or one colorless and one double-colored daughter cell.</p><p>As expected, no labeling was observed in RIP-CreER; Rosa26<sup>GR</sup>/Rosa26<sup>RG</sup> mice in the absence of tamoxifen. We injected tamoxifen over 3 d into 23 RIP-CreER; Rosa26<sup>GR</sup>/Rosa26<sup>RG</sup> mice between 4 and 8 wk of age. Two animals were euthanized within 4 d of tamoxifen injection (the pulse group), and we found that 0.1&#x00025;&#x02013;0.5&#x00025; of &#x003b2; cells were labeled. All clones observed were insulin positive, and 90&#x00025; were single-cell clones (the remainder were composed of two cells).</p><p>In pulse and chase animals, all labeled cells expressed both <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>RFP</italic> (<italic>RFP</italic> expression required antibody staining for detection; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050163-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). The existence of only double-colored clones indicates that recombination occurred during G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>0</sub>, which is expected for a slow-dividing cell population that spends little time in G<sub>2</sub>. Conversely, in experiments performed using Pdx1-Cre; Rosa26<sup>GR</sup>/Rosa26<sup>RG</sup> mice, where Cre recombinase was expressed in the rapidly dividing embryonic pancreas, single-colored clones were detected occasionally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050163-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). These observations are consistent with those of Zong et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, who found that single-colored cells are a minority, though their proportion to double-colored cells increases when Cre recombinase is expressed in a rapidly dividing population. Given that all &#x003b2; cell clones are double-colored, all clones are shown only in green to allow for ease of presentation, and insulin staining is shown in red.</p><p>For the purpose of this experiment, clones are defined as clusters of labeled cells within a single islet; all cells within a clone are assumed to be derived from a single &#x003b2; cell. Tamoxifen-treated mice were euthanized 1 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12) or 2 mo (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) following the pulse. A total of 175 clones from 1-mo chase animals and 122 clones from 2-mo chase animals were sampled using single random sections, and no large clones were detected. The absence of large clones qualitatively suggests an absence of fast-dividing &#x003b2; cells. To estimate the expansion of &#x003b2; cells, we analyzed serial sections. After 1 mo of chase, the average size of a clone was 5.1 &#x000b1; 5.4 cells (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 45 clones), whereas after 2 mo of chase, the average size of a clone was 8.2 &#x000b1; 6.9 cells (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 40 clones). In addition, the experiment was repeated using CAGGs-CreER; Rosa26<sup>GR</sup>/Rosa26<sup>RG</sup> mice, and again, no large &#x003b2; cell clones were detected (unpublished data). Labeled cells found within a single islet are of clonal origin: the probability that three or more labeled cells found within the same islet are not clonal is 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (based on Poisson distribution analysis assuming labeling frequency of 0.1&#x00025; and islet size of 500&#x02013;1,000 cells). This clonal analysis supports the model that the growth and maintenance of &#x003b2; cell mass in the adult pancreas is achieved by the replication of individual &#x003b2; cells that have similar replicative capacities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experiments were designed to address the mechanism of growth and maintenance of mature &#x003b2; cells. To determine whether all &#x003b2; cells divide at the same rate in the adult mouse, two experiments were undertaken. The tetracycline-inducible H2BGFP and MADM systems are complementary approaches: whereas tetO-H2BGFP labels most &#x003b2; cells and provides a broad view of the population dynamic, MADM labels single cells and provides an accurate clonal analysis of the progeny of individual cells within the &#x003b2; cell pool. Both the uniform loss of the H2BGFP label with time in the &#x003b2; cell population and the comparable &#x003b2; cell clone sizes generated through MADM analysis indicate homogeneity exists within the &#x003b2; cell pool. Stated otherwise, all &#x003b2; cells appear to contribute equally to growth and maintenance.</p><p>The &#x003b2; cell mass is dynamic and can respond to environmental cues such insulin and glucose &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

While the mechanism regulating &#x003b2; cell expansion remains unclear, our findings indicate that all &#x003b2; cells are capable of replication and are therefore viable targets for in vitro or in vivo expansion.</p><p>Seaberg et al. recently reported that single-cell clones derived from adult islets generated colonies of 2,000&#x02013;10,000 cells that expressed markers of neural, glial, pancreatic endocrine, exocrine, and duct identities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. These clones were generated from ~0.02&#x00025; of islet cells, though their identity and relationship to in vivo growth is yet to be determined. We cannot rule out the possibility that a rare type of &#x003b2; cell was missed in our examination of individual clones using the MADM marking experiments. However, because the rate of clonal expansion is sufficient to account for the growth of the &#x003b2; cell population during the chase period, a rare highly proliferative &#x003b2; cell did not contribute significantly to the expansion of &#x003b2; cell mass.</p><p>Published rates for &#x003b2; cell replication in adult mice (12 wk old) are highly variable, from 2&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; to 15&#x00025; per day &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Assuming 5&#x00025; of &#x003b2; cells replicate per day, and that all &#x003b2; cells are equivalent, &#x003b2; cells should divide approximately every 20 d. This would dilute the H2BGFP label beyond detection (by completing up to five rounds of replication) within 100 d. In addition, clone size at 2 mo should be approximately eight cells. These straightforward calculations predict results that are entirely consistent with our findings. These estimates, of course, assume no &#x003b2; cell death over the duration of our experiments.</p><p>&#x003b2; cells have a finite lifespan, but the absolute &#x003b2; cell death rate is unknown. Based on &#x003b2; cell mass measurements and an estimate of &#x003b2; cell proliferation of 2&#x00025; per day throughout adulthood, Finegood et al. calculated the &#x003b2; cell lifespan to be 52 d &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Regardless of the true rate of &#x003b2; cell turnover, our findings of a uniform loss of label and a consistent clone size indicate that all &#x003b2; cells have equivalent replicative capacity.</p><p>Pancreatic &#x003b2; cells are not the only differentiated cell type capable of growth and maintenance without the support of an adult stem cell population. Hepatocytes are highly replicative and not thought to be supported by a facultative stem cell under normal conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050163-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Pulse&#x02013;chase analysis with the tetracycline-inducible H2BGFP label shows that all hepatocytes lose their label at the same rate. Therefore, like the &#x003b2; cell population, the hepatocyte population seems to be homogeneous. We do not know of an example of a mature differentiated cell type that has two populations (one replicative and the other not). We speculate that when tissues are without an adult stem cell, they are replenished by equal replication of all differentiated cells.</p><p>The demonstration that all &#x003b2; cells are equivalent, contributing equally to the growth and maintenance of the &#x003b2; cell population, has clinical implications if we assume that rodents and man use the same mechanism for pancreatic homeostasis. The destruction of &#x003b2; cells that causes type I diabetes has been counteracted by the transplantation of &#x003b2; cells.

Pulse&#x02013;chase analysis follows the loss of the H2BGFP label (green) with &#x003b2; cell division, while clonal analysis follows the generation of (yellow) clones from individual &#x003b2; cells. Model 1: the &#x003b2; cell population is heterogeneous, composed of fast- and slow-dividing subpopulations. This model predicts that highly replicative &#x003b2; cells will lose the H2BGFP label quickly and generate large clones, while slowly dividing &#x003b2; cells will fail to dilute the H2BGFP label and generate small clones. Model 2: the &#x003b2; cell population is homogeneous, and all &#x003b2; cells divide at the same rate. This model predicts that all &#x003b2; cells will lose the H2BGFP label uniformly, and that all clones identified through clonal analysis will be of comparable size.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050163.g001"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0050163-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>In Vitro Characterization of Dilution of Tetracycline-Inducible H2BGFP with Cell Division</title><p>(A) Fluorescent images of Rosa26-rtTA; tetO-H2BGFP mEFs pulsed with doxycycline and cultured in the absence of doxycycline.
