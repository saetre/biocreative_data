There is evidence that S4 tightly regulates all of these genes, except rpoA, by repressing translation of the polycistronic mRNA. Binding of S4 to the S13 start-site is thought to regulate the first three genes. We have extended the 'rpsD-rpoA' sequences previously determined by others, to include all of rpoA and rplQ. The rpoA-rplQ intercistronic region shows strong primary, and potential secondary structural homologies with the S4-binding sites on 16S rRNA and S13 mRNA. We suggest that S4 represses L17 translation directly.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5813"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0270.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5814"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5820"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00332-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5821"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
