Although dUTP is a normal intermediate in DNA synthesis, its accumulation and misincorporation into DNA is lethal. Importantly, uracil misincorporation is a mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by fluoropyrimidine chemotherapeutic agents including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and elevated expression of dUTPase is negatively correlated with clinical response to 5-FU-therapy. In this study we performed the first functional characterization of the dUTPase promoter and demonstrate a role for E2F-1 and Sp1 in driving dUTPase expression. We establish a direct role for both mutant and wild-type forms of p53 in modulating dUTPase promoter activity. Treatment of HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells with the DNA-damaging agent oxaliplatin induced a p53-dependent transcriptional downregulation of dUTPase not observed in the isogenic null cell line. Oxaliplatin treatment induced enrichment of p53 at the dUTPase promoter with a concomitant reduction in Sp1. The suppression of dUTPase by oxaliplatin promoted increased levels of dUTP that was enhanced by subsequent addition of fluoropyrimidines. The novel observation that oxaliplatin downregulates dUTPase expression may provide a mechanistic basis contributing to the synergy observed between 5-FU and oxaliplatin in the clinic. Furthermore, these studies provide the first evidence of a direct transcriptional link between the essential enzyme dUTPase and the tumor suppressor p53.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) is the sole enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate simultaneously providing substrate for thymidylate synthase (TS) and eliminating dUTP from the DNA biosynthetic pathway. Although dUTP is a normal intermediate in DNA synthesis, its extensive accumulation and misincorporation into DNA is lethal in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms as evidenced from knockout models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Importantly, uracil misincorporation also represents a major mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by the TS-inhibitor class of chemotherapeutic agents including the fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) and capecitabine which are broadly used in the treatment of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, breast and head and neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Inhibition of TS induces a metabolic blockade, depleting thymidylate pools and in some instances promoting the accumulation of intracellular dUTP pools and subsequent misincorporation of uracil into DNA resulting in DNA damage and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Expression of dUTPase is reported to be an important mediator of resistance to therapeutic agents that target TS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We previously demonstrated that diminished dUTPase expression greatly enhanced dUTP pool expansion following TS-inhibition, sensitizing yeast cells to the effects of uracil misincorporation while cells overexpressing dUTPase were significantly protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In colon cancer cells, depletion of dUTPase by siRNA resulted in dUTP accumulation and growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Overexpression of dUTPase was also demonstrated to confer resistance to FUdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), while we previously reported that depletion of dUTPase by siRNA sensitized both breast and colon cell lines to FUdR through misincorporation of dUTP and enhanced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Moreover, we also reported the results of a retrospective clinical study negatively correlating elevated nuclear expression of dUTPase with response to 5-FU-therapy in colorectal cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These studies bolster the concept that dUTPase represents an attractive drug target and we recently reported the identification of novel small molecules with dUTPase inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>While detailed analyses of dUTPase structure and catalytic activity have been described, the mechanisms that govern human dUTPase gene regulation and expression remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Previous studies have reported that expression of the nuclear isoform of dUTPase (DUT-N) is primarily cell cycle and proliferation-dependent, whereas the mitochondrial isoform (DUT-M) is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of normal tissues demonstrated that high DUT-N expression is exclusively observed in replicating cell types whereas cytoplasmic expression is observed in mitochondria-rich tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, both colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and tumor specimens demonstrate dramatic variation, both in magnitude of dUTPase expression and intracellular localization. Furthermore, the correlation between replication status and DUT-N expression was not observed in colon adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Importantly, dysregulation of dUTPase expression is observed in tumor types which are frequently treated with agents that target TS, therefore elucidating the molecular basis driving dUTPase expression is important from both a basic science and clinical standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Functional analyses of various S-phase-specific genes including TS and thymidine kinase (TK) identified several transcriptional elements that are commonly present in their promoter regions including E2F and Sp1 consensus sites. These genes are also characterized by a lack of TATA or CAAT box initiation sites, but are rich in GC boxes. Promoter sequence analysis of the <italic>DUT</italic> gene reveals putative regulatory motifs including potential binding sites for NF-&#x003ba;B, E2F and Sp1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Recently, a genome-wide ChIP-on-chip identified dUTPase in a subset of 127 genes bound by E2F family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Despite the presence of these putative S-phase-specific binding sites in the DUT-N promoter region, functional analysis of this gene has not been previously reported.</p><p>Several studies have also reported downregulation of dUTPase during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and that dUTPase expression may be modulated by the tumor suppressor gene p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In response to stress stimuli such as DNA damage, p53 can initiate cell cycle arrest through transcriptional induction of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21<sup>cip1/waf1</sup>, mediate DNA repair or induce apoptotic cell death. These mechanisms are designed to prevent proliferation of cells containing damaged DNA and reduce the likelihood of tumor formation. Interestingly, mutations in p53 are one of the most common genetic aberrations detected in malignant disease with &#x0003e;50% of colon tumors exhibiting mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>In prostate cancer cells, dUTPase was one of many genes identified by microarray analysis as significantly repressed following introduction of wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) breast cancer cells, microarray analysis also identified dUTPase mRNA within an extensive panel of genes repressed following 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the precise mechanism of the downregulation of dUTPase has not been determined and it is unknown as to whether this phenomenon is the result of indirect downstream events induced by p53 itself or its transactivation and repressive gene targets. Furthermore, dUTPase was one of a number of genes identified as upregulated in p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts following introduction of the human tumor-derived p53 R175H by subtraction hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>As dUTPase is an essential enzyme in maintaining genomic stability, and demonstrates both aberrant intratumoral expression and an association with resistance to 5-FU, we sought to perform the first functional characterization of the promoter and elucidate the mechanisms involved in regulating dUTPase expression. In addition, p53 mutations are widely observed in many cancers and as the fluoropyrimidines remain the mainstay chemotherapeutics in gastrointestinal cancer treatment, characterizing a role for p53 in regulating dUTPase gene expression in tumor cells may be of major clinical significance and may lead to more targeted therapeutic options. In this study, we demonstrate direct roles for Sp1 and E2F-1 in driving basal DUT-N expression and report a direct role for wild type and mutant p53 in repressing and inducing dUTPase promoter activity respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of oxaliplatin, an important chemotherapeutic agent primarily used in combination with 5-FU in the treatment of colorectal cancer, to acutely suppress the dUTPase promoter, mRNA and protein expression and enzymatic activity in a p53-dependent manner. We also present evidence that p53 is associated with the endogenous dUTPase promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, and propose that interference with transcription machinery at the dUTPase promoter by wild-type p53 represents a plausible mechanism for this transcriptional repression. Finally, suppression of dUTPase by oxaliplatin resulted in the expansion of intracellular dUTP pools and subsequently enhanced the downstream effects of TS-inhibition. This interaction may contribute to the clinical synergy observed between 5-FU and oxaliplatin in the treatment of colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Compounds and reagents</title><p>5-FU, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), paclitaxel, doxycycline (DOX), G418 and mithramycin A were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO).

We previously performed a computational sequence analysis of the 5&#x02032; region of the human dUTPase gene and identified putative binding sites for NF&#x003ba;-B, Sp1 and E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn910/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1A</ext-link>). The presence of Sp1- and E2F-binding sites is consistent with the hypothesis that the dUTPase promoter is regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, to date there have been no studies investigating the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of human dUTPase at the promoter level. To address this, we first sought to determine the basal DNA regulatory elements of the dUTPase promoter that are required for expression. We utilized a luciferase-based system employing the pGL3-Basic promoterless vector and sub-cloned deletion mutant fragments targeting the putative E2F- and Sp1-binding sites reported to be critical for S-phase gene expression. We generated a series of four dUTPase promoter truncations ranging from the designated &#x02018;full length&#x02019; (pGL3:FL) which incorporates the 1.231 kb proximal promoter upstream of the DUT-N transcriptional start site, to the extensive truncation mutant pGL3:65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and analyzed luciferase expression in the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> colon cancer cell line model. Truncation of the pGL3:FL to the pGL3:608 resulted in an insignificant decrease of 1.22-fold in promoter activity, suggesting that the 5&#x02032; region of the proximal dUTPase promoter may contain relatively minor positive regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). A significant reduction in promoter activity of 2-fold was observed between the pGL3:608 and the pGL3:162 which differ by the consensus NF&#x003ba;-B-binding site. A 2.9-fold reduction was observed when the pGL3:162 was truncated to the pGL3:65 to exclude the triple Sp1 sites. The pGL3:65 that contains only the E2F site demonstrated a significant 7.2-fold reduction in luciferase activity compared to the pGL3:FL. Of note, the activity of pGL3:65 remained 3.4-fold higher than the pGL3-Basic promoterless vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). These data suggest that consensus sequences for NF&#x003ba;-B, E2F and to a greater extent Sp1 may positively contribute to dUTPase promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of transcription factors involved in dUTPase gene expression</title><p>Sp1 and E2F family members are known to be key regulators of S-phase gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Having identified the region of the <italic>DUT</italic> gene promoter containing the Sp1 and E2F transcription sites to be associated with positive regulation, we sought to determine the relative contributions of both Sp1 and E2F consensus sequences to dUTPase promoter activity. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis of the pGL3:FL to disrupt the triple Sp1 (pGL3:Sp1&#x00394;) and E2F sites (pGL3:E2F&#x00394;) by double nucleotide substitution within each respective site to generate mutant dUTPase luciferase constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn910/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1B</ext-link>). We transiently transfected the pGL3:FL, pGL3:Sp1&#x00394; and the pGL3:E2F&#x00394; into the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells and analyzed their basal promoter activity.

This data further establish and confirms the role of Sp1 and E2F sites as positive regulators of dUTPase promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of Sp1 in dUTPase gene expression</title><p>Elevated intratumoral expression of Sp1 is reported to increase expression of genes that promote tumor processes including progression and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). It is therefore plausible that dysregulation of Sp1 may contribute to increased expression of dUTPase that is observed in tumor tissues. In order to accurately determine the contribution of Sp1 to basal promoter activity, we utilized the well-characterized Sp1-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells as a useful model for analyzing the influence of Sp1-driven promoters in an Sp1-deficient background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The pGL3-Basic promoterless vector was subsequently co-transfected with the EV and pPac-Sp1 expression construct, both resulting in minimal luciferase activity. Co-transfection of the pGL3:FL with pPac0 resulted in no significant promoter activity when compared to the co-transfection with pGL3-Basic. However, co-transfection of pGL3:FL and pPac-Sp1 resulted in a 45-fold increase in luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These data demonstrate that the dUTPase promoter requires Sp1 for basal activity and is also highly responsive to Sp1-mediated transcription in an Sp1-deficient model. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The role of Sp1 in dUTPase gene expression.

Importantly, Sp1 overexpression did not induce the pGL3-Basic control discounting any possible non-specific effects. Co-transfection of the pGL3:FL with the pN3-Sp1 construct resulted in a 5.6-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the pN3-EV. We also tested the Sp1-responsiveness of the promoter truncations and demonstrate that the pGL3:608 truncation is significantly less responsive to Sp1-mediated activation than the pGL3:FL (3.9-fold compared to 5.6-fold respectively), further suggesting that the 5&#x02032; region from &#x02013;608 to &#x02013;1231 may contain some Sp1-responsive elements. In addition, the pGL3:65 containing only the E2F site was induced 1.8-fold by overexpression of Sp1 suggesting that Sp1 may also mediate dUTPase promoter activation indirectly through E2F consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). However, Sp1 overexpression resulted in only a modest increase in luciferase activity of the pGL3:Sp1&#x00394; which did not reach statistical significance (data not shown).

Acetyl-H3 (Ac-H3), an indicator of active gene transcription was employed as a positive control and demonstrated a highly significant 200-fold enrichment at the dUTPase promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).

Significant evidence exists suggesting that tumor p53 status has direct impact on gene expression, tumor progression and response to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Given the critical nature of dUTPase expression in modulating response to the TS-inhibitor class of chemotherapeutics, we sought to test whether dUTPase expression is modulated by ectopic expression of both wild-type p53 (p53<sup>WT</sup>) and the hotspot R175H p53 mutant (p53<sup>MUT</sup>). This is one of the most common human tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins, harboring an Arg&#x02192;His amino-acid substitution resulting in a dominant gain-of-function and has been reported to induce dUTPase in p53 null mouse fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).

Mithramycin A was used as a positive control and significantly suppressed the pGL3:FL promoter activity 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). To further establish a direct mechanism of transcriptional repression of dUTPase in the absence of p21, we utilized the Plexor<sup>TM</sup> multiplex qPCR and analyzed dUTPase and TS mRNA expression following treatment with oxaliplatin. Treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M oxaliplatin for 24 h resulted in a &#x0003e;2-fold reduction in dUTPase mRNA.

These data suggest that the oxaliplatin-induced transcriptional repression of dUTPase is independent of the p53-transactivation target p21 and is more likely a direct transcriptional effect of p53 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxaliplatin-induced repression of the dUTPase promoter requires functional Sp1 sites</title><p>Reports suggested that the transcriptional repression of p53 can be exerted either through direct binding of p53 protein or via its sequestering of transcription factors required for promoter activity. To investigate the downregulation of dUTPase in response to oxaliplatin treatment, we utilized ChIP in conjunction with qPCR to analyze changes at the dUTPase promoter. This approach allows for quantitative analysis of the target region of the dUTPase promoter by normalizing DNA immunoprecipated (IP) with the antibody of interest directly to control IgG IP DNA with a subsequent calibration against &#x02018;input&#x02019; DNA. This method accounts for non-specific antibody binding and variations in input DNA concentration and allows for sensitive quantification of alterations at the dUTPase promoter in response to drug treatment. Following treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M oxaliplatin and 100 nM mithramycin A for 12 h, we performed ChIP analysis using antibodies against Sp1, E2F-1, Ac-H3 and p53 in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells and compared to untreated controls. We successfully detected basal Ac-H3, E2F-1, Sp1 and p53 enrichment at the dUTPase promoter compared to the IgG control in the region containing the Sp1 and E2F consensus sequences (&#x02212;39 to &#x02212;260).</p><p>Following treatment with 100 nM mithramycin A, Ac-H3 enrichment was reduced 2-fold consistent with decreased gene transcription whereas Sp1 enrichment was decreased 2.4-fold consistent with mithramycin A displacing Sp1 at the GC-rich dUTPase promoter. E2F-1 enrichment was not modulated in response to mithramycin A. Significantly, enrichment of the tumor suppressor p53 remained unchanged in mithramycin A treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Treatment with oxaliplatin resulted in a significant 2-fold reduction in Sp1 accompanied by a modest decrease in E2F-1 and Ac-H3 enrichment at the dUTPase promoter. Significantly, enrichment of p53 was increased 2.3-fold at the dUTPase promoter following treatment with oxaliplatin, when compared to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). In an attempt to identify the p53-responsive element in the dUTPase promoter, we subsequently transfected the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells with the dUTPase Sp1 and E2F site-mutant promoter constructs and compared the repression by oxaliplatin to the full&#x02013;length construct. Importantly, these site mutant constructs retained significant transcriptional activity in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The full-length promoter was repressed 5-fold by oxaliplatin. The E2F site-mutant was repressed by oxaliplatin 3-fold. However, mutation of the triple Sp1 sites completely abrogated the oxaliplatin-induced promoter repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) suggesting that p53 is acting on the region of the promoter containing the Sp1 sites. To confirm that the mutations within the pGL3:Sp1&#x00394; construct efficiently impair Sp1 binding, we performed EMSA analysis. Using a dUTPase <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe encompassing the triple Sp1-binding sites (&#x02013;64 to &#x02013;91), we demonstrate binding of recombinant Sp1 (rhSp1) to both this sequence and a control Sp1 consensus oligo. However, a mutant probe corresponding to the Sp1 site mutations within the pGL3:Sp1&#x00394; construct failed to compete for binding with rhSp1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn910/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>).

Given the novel observation that a clinically relevant concentration of oxaliplatin (0.5 &#x000b5;M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) can acutely downregulate dUTPase protein in a p53-dependent manner in a colon cancer model, we sought to test the possible clinical implications of this by measuring the accumulation of dUTP, a downstream cytotoxic event induced by chemotherapeutics that inhibit TS. We utilized 5-FU whose effects include TS-inhibition, and incorporation of fluorinated nucleotides into DNA and RNA and the more specific TS-inhibitor FUdR which induces only DNA-directed effects. First, we confirmed that the treatment of HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells with oxaliplatin and either 5-FU or FUdR for 72 h resulted in enhanced growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C) and resulted in downregulation of dUTPase protein and enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). To verify that the effects on dUTP accumulation with drug combinations were a specific effect of TS-inhibition, we included the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel as a non-TS-directed control agent. Intracellular dUTP was measured using a polymerase-based nucleotide pool assay which detects both TTP and dUTP from cell extracts, with subsequent incubation with recombinant dUTPase indicating the contribution of dUTP as a percentage of the total dUTP/TTP detected. No dUTP was detected in untreated control cells or following treatment with the sub-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.1 &#x000b5;M FUdR and 0.5 &#x000b5;M 5-FU at 24 h. Following treatment with 0.5 &#x000b5;M oxaliplatin alone for 24 h, there was no detectable dUTP in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). However, treatment with 0.5 &#x000b5;M oxaliplatin alone for 48 h resulted in the significant accumulation of dUTP. Specifically, within the total dUTP/TTP pool, 15.4% was dUTP, correlating with the acute reduction in dUTPase expression and activity previously noted. When cells were treated with oxaliplatin for 24 h followed by 0.1 &#x000b5;M FUdR or 0.5 &#x000b5;M 5-FU for a further 24 h, dUTP accumulation was significantly increased to 28% and 25% respectively of the total dUTP/TTP pool. To confirm that this effect was a direct result of downregulation of dUTPase followed by subsequent TS inhibition, we used the control combination of 0.5 &#x000b5;M oxaliplatin for 24 h followed by the non-TS-directed microtubule stabilizing drug paclitaxel (20 nM) for 24 h. This resulted in the detection of &#x0003c;3% of dUTP in the total dUTP/TTP, and would suggest that the increase in dUTP accumulation observed with 5-FU/FUdR and oxaliplatin combinations was a direct result of the TS metabolic blockade in the absence of an active dUTPase enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). These data suggest that suppression of dUTPase by oxaliplatin may enhance the fluoropyrimidine-induced accumulation of dUTP and may contribute to the synergistic interaction between these agents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Expression of dUTPase in malignant cells demonstrates significant variation, both in total expression and subcellular localization which may account for differences in clinical response to the TS-inhibiting class of chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis for variable dUTPase expression is of interest from both a basic science and clinical perspective. Using promoter analysis in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> colon cancer cells, the region containing the E2F and triple Sp1 site was found to be sufficient for driving DUT-N promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Site-directed mutagenesis of the E2F and Sp1 sites clearly demonstrated that both transcription factors positively contribute to basal promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). We also report that the dUTPase promoter is highly responsive to Sp1 overexpression in HCT116 colon cells and silent in the absence of Sp1 and responsive to Sp1 expression in Sp1-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, knockdown of Sp1 resulted in the downregulation of dUTPase protein expression and significantly attenuated dUTPase promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Finally we confirmed the presence of both Sp1 and E2F-1 transcription factors at the proximal dUTPase promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> using ChIP and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Interestingly, dysregulation of both Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and E2F-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45 B46 B47">44&#x02013;47</xref>) are widely observed following neoplastic transformation and are reported to contribute to a variety of tumor processes including progression, drug resistance, angiogenesis and metastasis. It is therefore likely that dysregulation of E2F-1 and Sp1 expression may contribute to the wide variation in dUTPase expression levels observed in tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Initial reports identified dUTPase mRNA as modulated by both mutant and wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, the precise mechanism by which wild-type p53 exerts its repressive effects on dUTPase has not been described. To our knowledge, this report provides the first evidence demonstrating that dUTPase is directly modulated at the transcriptional level by an <italic>in vivo</italic> promoter association with p53. Introduction of p53<sup>WT</sup> resulted in significant repression of the dUTPase promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and E). Interestingly, the level of repression in the HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells was significantly greater following introduction of p53<sup>WT</sup> when compared to the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells, suggesting that expression of p53<sup>WT</sup> already exerts a regulatory influence on the dUTPase promoter in the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells. This is further supported by the observation that when the p53<sup>MUT</sup> is introduced into the p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells, the promoter activity is induced to a much greater extent than the p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells. This phenomenon may be exacerbated due to the artificial nature of the luciferase system, but would indicate the disruption of an unknown mediator involved in dUTPase promoter regulation by the dysregulated interactions of p53<sup>MUT</sup>. This observation has previously been noted in the TSP50 gene which is negatively regulated by p53, where the authors reported that introduction of mutant p53 significantly increased the TSP50 promoter activity in the three cell lines containing p53<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). These data would further suggest that tumoral p53 status and mutation may be important regulators of dUTPase expression and thus may influence chemotherapeutic response.</p><p>It is important to consider that ectopic p53 expression is unlikely to accurately simulate p53 activation in response to DNA damage which involves complex post-translation modifications. We therefore utilized chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of colorectal cancer which are known to activate p53 including the DNA-damaging agent oxaliplatin and the TS-inhibitors 5-FU and FUdR. Both 5-FU and FUdR resulted in a modest downregulation of dUTPase protein consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, for the first time, we identified oxaliplatin as a potent downregulator of dUTPase at the promoter, mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4 F5">Figure 4</xref>B and 5A). Treatment of the HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells with the same clinically relevant doses of oxaliplatin failed to modulate the dUTPase promoter or downregulate mRNA and protein expression, indicating a direct role for p53 or a p53-target in the repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4 F5">Figure 4</xref>B, 5A and B). Moreover, our findings indicate that this acute downregulation preceded complete cell cycle arrest with rapid repression of the dUTPase promoter and downregulation of the mRNA within 24 h. Although both 5-FU and FUdR result in similar levels of p53 induction, the cytotoxicity induced by these agents is of a significantly different nature than oxaliplatin. Specifically, 5-FU and FUdR are reported to initiate rapid S-phase arrest which is associated with thymidylate depletion as a result of TS-inhibition and is independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). The induction of p53 in response to 5-FU is reported to be a later event, possibly due to aberrant detection of uracil and fluoronucleotides in synthesized DNA. Oxaliplatin binds with high affinity to GC-rich DNA forming bulky platinum adducts which block DNA replication, activate p53 and stimulate the nucleotide excision repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Importantly, oxaliplatin treatment in HCT116 cells was previously reported to initiate a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, indicating an immediate role for p53 in mediating the cellular response to oxaliplatin in the HCT116 colon cancer model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). A recent report directly compared the p53 response in colon cancer cells treated with 5-FU compared to the direct DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin. The authors noted that 5-FU treatment did not accumulate p53 or result in p53 phosphorylation until 24 h post-treatment. However, doxorubicin treatment resulted in rapid p53 induction through protein stabilization and noted that p53 protein was both rapidly phosphorylated and acetylated within 4 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Furthermore, p53 signaling is a complex pathway involving multiple post-translational modifications which are specific to its subsequent functions which vary markedly from cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Considering that oxaliplatin is also a direct DNA-damaging agent, it is possible that the mechanism of resultant p53 activation and associated post-translational modifications are markedly different than those observed following treatment with 5-FU and FUdR and this may account for the difference in the ability of these agents to repress dUTPase gene expression. We also note that ectopic dUTPase protein expression from an exogenous CMV-driven promoter was unaffected by oxaliplatin, discounting protein stability or atypical turnover and supporting a direct transcriptional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Simultaneous analysis of TS, another classical S-phase gene revealed only a moderate downregulation following oxaliplatin treatment independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), supporting the idea that the presence of a p53 responsive element is a key difference between the regulation of TS and dUTPase.</p><p>Previous reports suggested that p53-mediated transactivation of p21 was sufficient and necessary to exert the negative gene regulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). By using a p21 HCT116 null isogenic cell line, we demonstrate that p21 is not required for the transcriptional repression of dUTPase in response to oxaliplatin, further suggesting a direct role for p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). We subsequently confirmed the presence and enrichment of p53 at the dUTPase proximal promoter following treatment with oxaliplatin. Importantly, this was accompanied by reductions in Sp1 and Ac-H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Although the exact mechanism by which p53 represses the dUTPase promoter is not clear, these observations suggest that p53 interacts with the dUTPase promoter transcriptional machinery in the absence of a p53-specific <italic>cis</italic> element to suppress gene expression. In support of our observations, additional reports demonstrated p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the protective antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and the anti-apoptotic molecule MCL-1 in the absence of a p53 consensus site and demonstrated this to be mediated through disruption of normal transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Furthermore, the DNA repair enzyme AP-endonuclease is repressed by p53, in the absence of a <italic>cis</italic> element through interfering with Sp1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). This model is supported by our findings which demonstrated increased p53 and reduced Sp1 at the dUTPase promoter following oxaliplatin treatment. Interestingly, treatment with mithramycin A, which directly reduced Sp1 enrichment, did not show enrichment for p53, suggesting that displacing Sp1 or additional Sp-family members at the dUTPase promoter or inhibiting additional Sp1-driven gene expression can abrogate the promoter enrichment of p53. In support of this, our observation that the triple Sp1 site-mutant construct, which importantly still retained 50% transcriptional activity of the full-length construct, was not repressed by oxaliplatin and would further indicate that p53 is exerting its repressive effects through the region of the promoter known to bind Sp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 can directly associate with transcription factors <italic>in vivo</italic> including Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and with histone deacetylase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and repress transcription from specific promoters. Importantly, it has also been demonstrated that mutant p53 lacks the capacity to interact with HDAC1 and repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), representing another possible mechanism for the p53-mutant induction of dUTPase previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and our observations in this report showing p53-mutant induction of the dUTPase promoter. Furthermore, the inability of mutant forms of p53 to repress gene transcription may contribute to associated chemoresistance by abrogating apoptosis induced through repression of protective genes.</p><p>As a single agent, oxaliplatin has limited clinical activity in colorectal cancer and is primarily used in combination with 5-FU or capecitabine resulting in synergistic anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Attempts to define the molecular basis for this synergistic interaction have demonstrated that oxaliplatin induces modest suppression of both TS mRNA and activity of the 5-FU catabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). In the present study, we confirmed that oxaliplatin induced a modest downregulation of TS mRNA independent of p53 and p21. In addition, we provide the first evidence of a p53-dependent acute downregulation of dUTPase in the HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> colon cell line following treatment with a clinically relevant dose of oxaliplatin. When oxaliplatin was combined with a TS-inhibitor, there was a significant increase in the accumulation of dUTP consistent with downregulation of dUTPase and increased effects of TS-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). Targeted use of oxaliplatin in tumors with elevated levels of dUTPase and wild-type p53 may represent a novel strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy of TS-directed agents and warrants further investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Working model of p53-mediated repression of dUTPase transcription and subsequent enhancement of 5-FU-mediated downstream effects. Schematic diagram illustrating the downstream effects of p53-mediated transcriptional repression of dUTPase following treatment with a clinically relevant dose of oxaliplatin. The model proposes that p53 induction following DNA damage may inhibit dUTPase transcription via interaction with or inhibition of transcription machinery. Subsequent treatment with 5-FU results in TS-inhibition and, in the absence of an active dUTPase enzyme, promotes the accumulation of dUTP within cells, promoting increased DNA damage through uracil misincorporation in the presence of a TS-inhibiting agent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn910f8"/></fig></p><p>Additional genes with critical roles in cytoprotection and survival including anti-apoptotic, oxidative stress elimination and DNA repair genes have previously been demonstrated to be repressed by p53, promoting the hypothesis that the pro-apoptotic function of p53 is mediated in part through transcriptional repression of cytoprotective genes. It is therefore plausible that the p53-mediated repression of dUTPase may enhance DNA damage and represent one component in the commitment to irreversible cell death and contribute to the tumor suppressing functions governed by p53.</p><p>In conclusion, p53 plays a critical role in the transformation and progression of many human malignancies, thus, the effect of p53 on uracil&#x02013;DNA metabolism may increase our understanding of the complex regulatory pathways governed by p53 and may assist in providing more targeted chemotherapy. Our results have identified and characterized a novel mechanism of p53-dependent transcriptional regulation of an evolutionary conserved and essential enzyme involved in regulating intracellular uracil pools and maintaining genomic stability.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn910/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The <grant-sponsor>National Institute of Health</grant-sponsor> R21 (<grant-num>5R21CA104796-3</grant-num>, 5P30CA14089-33).
