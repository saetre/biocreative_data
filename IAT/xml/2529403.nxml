In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, C(3)G protein forms the transverse filaments (TFs) of the SC. The N termini of C(3)G homodimers localize to the Central Element (CE) of the SC, while the C-termini of C(3)G connect the TFs to the chromosomes via associations with the axial elements/lateral elements (AEs/LEs) of the SC. Here, we show that the Drosophila protein Corona (CONA) co-localizes with C(3)G in a mutually dependent fashion and is required for the polymerization of C(3)G into mature thread-like structures, in the context both of paired homologous chromosomes and of C(3)G polycomplexes that lack AEs/LEs. Although AEs assemble in <italic>cona</italic> oocytes, they exhibit defects that are characteristic of <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutant oocytes, including failure of AE alignment and synapsis. These results demonstrate that CONA, which does not contain a coiled coil domain, is required for the stable &#x02018;zippering&#x02019; of TFs to form the central region of the Drosophila SC. We speculate that CONA's role in SC formation may be similar to that of the mammalian CE proteins SYCE2 and TEX12. However, the observation that AE alignment and pairing occurs in <italic>Tex12</italic> and <italic>Syce2</italic> mutant meiocytes but not in <italic>cona</italic> oocytes suggests that the SC plays a more critical role in the stable association of homologs in Drosophila than it does in mammalian cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that is needed to produce sperm and egg cells, which carry only half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. Meiosis is required for reproduction, but abnormalities in chromosome number caused by errors in the process of meiosis are responsible for many birth defects and mental retardation syndromes in humans. The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is an excellent organism in which to study meiosis because of the powerful genetic and microscopic techniques that can be implemented with it. Early in meiosis, homologous chromosomes are joined together by an elaborate protein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) that plays a critical role in both holding homologous chromosomes together and in facilitating a process known as meiotic recombination. In this study, we have found a protein called Corona that is required for the formation of the SC. Our data show that Corona is required for the proper localization of the SC protein C(3)G. In the absence of Corona, C(3)G fails to polymerize and form the central region of the SC. Increasing our understanding of SC assembly and function will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During meiosis, the diploid genome is segregated to form haploid nuclei through processes that include the close juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes and recombination between them. In most organisms, a proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) forms between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. The SC is required for synapsis, the intimate association of homologs along their entire length. The SC and its components are thought to play roles in regulating recombination and generally promoting the establishment of crossovers between the chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Zickler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Examination of SCs by electron microscopy (EM) has defined distinct structures present in the SCs of most organisms. During early prophase, axial elements (AEs) form along the longitudinal axis of each pair of sister chromatids using a cohesin-based chromosome core as a scaffold for assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Revenkova1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. As prophase progresses, the AEs of homologous chromosomes become physically connected by perpendicular transverse filaments (TFs) that span the SC central region (CR), which occupies the &#x0223c;100 nm space between the two homologous AEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Zickler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. AEs within the mature SC are referred to as lateral elements (LEs). Finally, a central element (CE) is often observed as a structure overlapping the middle of the TFs and positioned parallel to the two LEs.</p><p>Although homologous chromosomes undergo presynaptic pairing and alignment in some organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Roeder1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Burgess1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, synapsis requires a fully formed CR that extends the length of the chromosomes. In this paper we will use the term &#x0201c;alignment&#x0201d; to describe the parallel association of homologs (or AEs) at a distance equal to or greater than the width of the SC and the term &#x0201c;pairing&#x0201d; to describe the close association of homologous sequences as determined by FISH.</p><p>Components of TFs, such as ZIP1 (budding yeast), SYCP1 (mouse), SYP-1 (worms), and C(3)G (Drosophila), have been identified as proteins containing long coiled coil segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-MacQueen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Osman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these TF proteins are similar in predicted secondary structure, they share very little similarity in amino acid sequence. Despite this lack of sequence conservation, the proteins are all thought to form TFs across the CR of the SC by binding of their C-termini to the AEs with head-to-head orientation of their N-termini at the center of the CE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Anderson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Schmekel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Instead, this C-terminal deletion protein forms a large cylindrical polycomplex structure. EM analysis of this structure reveals a polycomplex of concentric rings with alternating dark and light bands, presumably corresponding to long arrays of polymerized TFs. However, deletions of N-terminal regions completely abolished both SC and polycomplex formation. To explain these data, Jeffress <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Jeffress1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that in Drosophila, the N- terminal globular domain of C(3)G is critical for the formation of anti-parallel pairs of C(3)G homodimers, and thus for assembly of complete TFs, while the C-terminus is required to affix these homodimers to the AEs.</p><p>The question then arises as to how C(3)G molecules can be polymerized to form a linear array of TFs. The idea that such polymerization events are facilitated by the apposition of paired AEs seems unlikely given the finding that C-terminal deletions of C(3)G form polycomplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Jeffress1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remains to be determined whether or not functional homologs of SYCE2 and TEX12 might facilitate C(3)G polymerization, and thus CE formation in Drosophila oocytes.</p><p>To discover additional components of the SC and genes involved in other critical processes in meiosis, we previously undertook a novel genetic screen for female meiotic mutants in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the genes identified in the screen, <italic>corona</italic> (<italic>cona</italic>), was found to have both a severe defect in meiotic recombination and a profound effect on the localization of C(3)G. Previous analyses of <italic>cona</italic> mutants demonstrated a failure of the SC protein C(3)G to localize correctly in the absence of CONA, demonstrating defective SC formation. As is the case for <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutants, the frequency of meiotic exchange in <italic>cona</italic> females was reduced 50- to 200-fold compared to wild-type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> without a similar reduction in the number of DSBs &#x0005b;SLP and RSH, unpublished data&#x0005d;. Moreover, double mutants for <italic>c(3)G</italic> and <italic>cona</italic> displayed a defect in recombination that was comparable to either single mutant &#x0005b;SLP and RSH, unpublished data&#x0005d;, and thus the two proteins likely function in a common pathway with respect to facilitating meiotic exchange. Like C(3)G, CONA protein is only conserved within the genus Drosophila, but CONA contains no predicted coiled coil domains or other characterized functional motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we show that CONA is a new SC protein that co-localizes with C(3)G in a mutually-dependent fashion. We found that CONA accumulation is required for C(3)G localization into wild-type SC structures and formation of polycomplexes, but is not necessary for the formation of either the AEs or the chromosome cores from which they arise. Our results indicate that CONA is crucial for the assembly of the CR of the SC in Drosophila and may have a function similar to that of the vertebrate CE proteins TEX12 and SYCE2. However, the observation that pairing and alignment of AEs occurs in <italic>Tex12</italic> and <italic>Syce2</italic> mutant meiocytes, but not in <italic>cona</italic> oocytes, suggests that the SC plays a more critical role in the stable association of homologs in Drosophila than it does in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Corona Protein Co-Localizes with the Synaptonemal Complex</title><p>We previously showed that the <italic>cona</italic> gene corresponds to the transcription unit <italic>CG7676</italic> on the basis of the presence of a <italic>Doc</italic> transposon in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of <italic>CG7676</italic> in <italic>cona<sup>A12</sup></italic> that was not present on the un-mutagenized parental chromosome and the isolation of a second allele, <italic>cona<sup>f04903</sup></italic>, which bears a <italic>PiggyBac</italic> insertion in sequence flanking the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>CG7676</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Page3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

The normal localization of CONA and C(3)G is mutually-dependent &#x02013; in the absence of CONA, C(3)G is visible as only spots or short threads along meiotic chromosome cores, and in the absence of C(3)G, CONA appears to be absent from the meiotic nucleus. Three lines of evidence suggest that CONA plays a critical role in the stable assembly of C(3)G into the CR of the SC. First, <italic>cona</italic> mutant oocytes fail to form long stretches of continuous SC, and only short threads or spots of C(3)G are visible within the pro-oocyte nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000194-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000194.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Third, the requirement for CONA to facilitate C(3)G polymerization is also demonstrated by the fact that CONA localizes to the C(3)G PCs created by expressing C(3)G proteins that lack their C-termini and thus cannot bind chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000194-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

While we cannot rule out the possibility that similar short regions of &#x0201c;synapsis&#x0201d; exist in <italic>cona</italic> oocytes, it seems likely that even a small number of these along the length of the chromosome would result in at least some examples in which AEs lie as &#x0201c;parallel tracks&#x0201d; in chromosome spreads, a phenomenon that we did not observe.</p><p>Our analysis of <italic>cona</italic> mutant oocytes suggests that, unlike mammals, the SC is critical for early events governing the pairing/alignment of homologous chromosomes in Drosophila. We can envision at least three different models that might explain why homolog alignment is dependent on SC in Drosophila. In the first model, homologous chromosomes enter meiotic prophase already paired and aligned as a result of the persistence of pairing established during preceding cell cycles and the rapid formation of SC is required to maintain these associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Roeder1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this model has been favored in the past, two published reports refute the argument that homologous chromosomes enter meiosis already paired and aligned. As noted by Fung and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Fung1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> as well as Csink and Henikoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Csink1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, the pairing of homologous chromosomes in Drosophila somatic cells is disrupted during both replication and mitosis. Therefore, any pairing that exists prior to meiotic S phase would be lost and need to be re-established, most likely during meiotic prophase.</p><p>The second model posits that the different effects on homolog pairing and alignment observed in flies and mammals reflect differences in the ability of CE proteins to stabilize short stretches of SC. In contrast to flies, DSBs are required for synapsis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Baudat1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-McKim1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The short stretches of SC resulting from the formation of DSBs and early recombination intermediates in mouse meiocytes lacking SYCE2 or TEX12 may maintain the alignment of AEs in the absence of full synapsis. If the requirement for CE function is sufficiently more stringent in flies than in mammals, then short regions of synapsis similar to those observed in <italic>Tex12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Syce2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> meiocytes may be unstable or never form in <italic>cona</italic> mutant flies. In the absence of such stretches of SC or DSB-induced axial associations, the Drosophila homologs would be expected to quickly dissociate.</p><p>Our third model is based on the different temporal relationship between DSB formation and SC assembly in flies and mammals. In mammals, DSB formation and the formation of early recombination intermediates occur commensurate with, and are required for SC formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Baudat1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Romanienko1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, DSB initiation occurs after the completion of SC assembly in Drosophila and is not required for synapsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-McKim1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000194-Mehrotra1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Because SC assembly in flies occurs via a DSB-independent pathway, pairing/alignment of AEs may be abolished in mutant oocytes in which higher-order assembly of TFs is prevented. According to this model, initial pre-synaptic associations of homologs may be maintained either by the formation of early recombination intermediates and axial associations that lead to the initiation of short stretches of SC (the mammalian paradigm), or by the establishment of extensive synapsis (the Drosophila paradigm). In both cases, the initial event (formation of recombination intermediates or SC formation) is eventually followed and perhaps &#x02018;locked-in&#x02019; by the other. One could hypothesize that mammalian CE mutants can maintain alignments because of the earlier formation of recombination intermediates and axial associations. In contrast, lack of SC assembly in <italic>cona</italic> and <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutants would compromise the essential early step that maintains the alignment of homologous chromosomes in Drosophila oocytes. If the homologs are already apart by the time DSBs occur in <italic>cona</italic> and <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutants, DSBs would be too late to stabilize homolog associations and maintain AE alignment.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate an essential requirement for CONA in the polymerization of C(3)G that is required for SC formation. Understanding the mechanism by which CONA performs that role will require the identification of CONA-interacting proteins, which we expect will include the N-terminal globular domain of C(3)G and perhaps other CE proteins as well. Elucidating the function of these proteins in SC assembly and the consequences of their loss by mutation may also help us understand the role of the SC in establishing or maintaining the pairing and alignment of homologs in early prophase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Drosophila Stocks and Genetic Analyses</title><p>Drosophila stocks and crosses were maintained on a standard medium at 25&#x000b0;C.
