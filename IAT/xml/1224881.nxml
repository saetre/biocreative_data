The disease has caused severe economic losses to the salmon-farming industry in several countries in the northern hemisphere, and confirmed positive diagnostic results for ISA are reportable to the "Office International des Epizooties", OIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Viruses in the genus <italic>Isavirus </italic>are enveloped particles of 90&#x02013;140 nm diameter with surface projections consisting of a combined haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and a separate putative fusion (F) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The genome is composed of eight segments of linear, single-stranded negative sense RNA ranging in length from 1.0 to 2.4 kb with a total molecular size of approximately 14.3 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sequence analysis of several ISAV isolates on the eight segments consistently reveals two genotypes, one European and one North American. The gene-coding assignments of the ISAV genome differ from those of other orthomyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Some strains of ISAV can replicate and cause CPE in the CHSE-214 cell line while others do not replicate in this cell line at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The molecular basis for this phenotypic difference is not clearly known. Although there is a strong geographical correlation in that practically all ISAV isolates of the European genotype do not cause CPE in the CHSE cell line, this phenotype is not related to sequence variation in the HE protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In general, fish viral diseases are difficult to control due to the high susceptibility of fish at an early age, and insufficient knowledge of pathogenesis of virus infections. In this context, we are studying the mechanisms by which ISAV interacts with its host, including the identification of markers for ISAV virulence. Vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], including fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], mount an early strong innate immune response against virus infections, characterized by the induction and secretion of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) that mediate an antiviral state. Secreted IFNs signal through a common receptor activating a JAK/STAT signaling pathway which leads to the transcriptional upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), a number of which encode antiviral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The induced antiviral proteins include dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and the Mx proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the host IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous <italic>in-vitro </italic>studies revealed that ASMx1 inhibited the replication of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a dsRNA virus belonging to the <italic>Birnaviridae </italic>family, but it did not appear to inhibit replication of ISAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It was concluded from those results that ISAV and IPNV have developed different strategies to avoid the IFN-system of Atlantic salmon. Thus, we were interested in analyzing ISAV strains having phenotypically different growth properties in the CHSE-214 cell line to gain further insight in ISAV virulence. We present evidence that ISAV is sensitive to the antiviral activity of ASMx1.</p><p>The following two ISAV isolates were selected for use in this study: NBISA01 and HKS-36. The growth properties of the isolates in CHSE-214 cells have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. NBISA01 is CPE-positive whereas HKS-36 is CPE-negative in CHSE-214 cells. For use, the viruses were propagated and titrated in CHSE-214 cells and/or TO cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To demonstrate the effects of ASMx1 on the replication of the two ISAV strains, we compared the cytopathogenicity and virus yields of the viruses in normal CHSE-214 cells and in cells constitutively expressing ASMx1. The CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were a kind gift from Dr. B&#x000f8;rre Robertsen, Norwegian College of Fishery Science, University of Troms&#x000f8;, Norway. These cells were grown in presence of 0.5 mg/ml zeocine (Invitrogen Life Technologies) to maintain expression of the transfected genes (Dr. B&#x000f8;rre Robertsen, personal communication). Virus stocks were prepared from TO cell cultures infected with the selected ISAV isolates which were harvested when CPE was complete; usually 7&#x02013;9 days post inoculation (dpi). They contained 10<sup>8.16 </sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml for NBISA01, and 10<sup>7.16</sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml for HKS-36. CHSE-214 cell monolayers in 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks, each inoculated with 1 ml of virus, were monitored daily for CPE and were harvested 14 dpi. Viral titers of the harvests were determined on normal CHSE-214 cells in 48-well tissue culture plates as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A significant delay in development of CPE and a reduction in the severity of CPE, as well as a 10-fold reduction in virus yield were observed for NBISA01 grown in CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1 compared to normal CHSE-214 cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). No CPE was seen with HKS-36 in both types of CHSE-214 cells.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inhibition of ISAV NBISA01 by AsMx1 in CHSE-214 cells.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">CHSE-214 cells<sup>1</sup></td><td align="left">CPE development<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">CPE severity<sup>3</sup></td><td align="left">Virus titer<sup>4</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Normal</td><td align="left">5&#x02013;14 days</td><td align="left">Complete (5+)</td><td align="left">5.50</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ASMx1 overexpression</td><td align="left">6-* days</td><td align="left">Incomplete (3+)</td><td align="left">4.50</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>CHSE-214 cells: Normal CHSE-214 cells and CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1.</p><p><sup>2</sup>CPE development denotes time from first appearance to complete CPE in days post inoculation; * indicates incomplete CPE development by 14 days post inoculation.</p><p><sup>3</sup>CPE severity was scored from 1+ to 5+: Complete CPE was scored 5+; Incomplete CPE scored 1+ to 4+).</p><p><sup>4</sup>Virus titers are expressed as TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In an attempt to assess the effects of ASMx1 on the viral mRNA levels, we used real-time RT-PCR in the LightCycler with RNA Amplification Kit SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) and PCR primers FA-3/RA-3 targeting a 220-bp product on ISAV segment 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This assay has been shown to be 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RT-PCR assay, and to differentiate ISAV isolates into three CHSE phenotypes (replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating) based on their ability to replicate and cause CPE in CHSE-214 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted from 300 &#x003bc;l of cell culture supernatants of the uninfected and ISAV-infected tissue cultures harvested at 14 dpi by using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 &#x003bc;l of RNase free water and 1 &#x003bc;l was used in real-time RT-PCR. The assay was performed on three replicates of each virus sample. The thermal conditions were one cycle of reverse transcription at 55&#x000b0;C for 30 min, pre-denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s followed by 50 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 5s, 59&#x000b0;C for 10s, 72&#x000b0;C for 10s, and data acquisition at 80&#x000b0;C for 2s. Melting curve analysis was performed from 70&#x000b0;C to 95&#x000b0;C in 0.1&#x000b0;C/s increments to assess the specificity of the RT-PCR products. The quantitative (Ct values) and melting curve data were analyzed using LightCycler software version 3.5 (Roche Applied Science). The real-time amplification reaction products were also resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5 &#x000d7; TBE buffer and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and photographed under 304 nm UV light.</p><p>The real-time RT-PCR data are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The mean Ct value of ISAV RNA levels for NBISA01 was 17.39 &#x000b1; 0.24 in normal CHSE-214 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and 17.62 &#x000b1; 0.08 in CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). For HKS-36, the mean Ct value was 22.94 &#x000b1; 0.08 in normal CHSE-214 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and 21.08 &#x000b1; 0.003 in CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). For each virus strain, there was no significant difference in the Ct values of both types of CHSE-214 cells. Melting curve analysis showed that the <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>of the ISAV templates was 82.5 &#x000b1; 0.03&#x000b0;C and occurred as a single amplicon peak for both NBISA01 and HKS-36 in normal CHSE-214 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, E</xref>) and in CHSE-214 cells constitutively expressing ASMx1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H, K</xref>). All these amplicons had one band of 220 bp on agarose gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, F</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I, L</xref>), indicating virus-specific amplification and uniform virus populations in the individual virus samples. The melting curve analyses of amplification products of uninfected CHSE-214 cells and water control indicated the presence of primer dimers having values of 77.4 &#x000b1; 0.01&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3N, Q</xref>) and 78.1&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3T</xref>), respectively. No viral amplicon-specific melting peaks were observed in these samples. The absence of the 220 bp band on agarose gel in these samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3O, R, U</xref>) further confirmed the validity of melting curve analyses of these samples. Thus, by real-time RT-PCR we were not able to detect any effect of the ASMx1 activity on ISAV replication for both NBISA01 and HKS-36. In case of NBISA01, this indicated to us that there was no correlation between the virus yields (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and the Ct values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). This would be expected since the real-time RT-PCR detected both mRNA and viral genomic RNA and was not indicative of infectious virus. Moreover, RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR could be from infectious as well as non-infectious viral progeny. These observations allow us to speculate that the ASMx1 activity on ISAV occurs at the post-transcription steps of virus replication. The human and mouse Mx proteins are known to inhibit different steps of the influenza virus multiplication cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] which is dictated by their intracellular locations. The mouse Mx1 protein accumulates in the nucleus and interferes with primary transcription of influenza virus in the nucleus, whereas the human MxA protein which is localized in the cytoplasm inhibits a subsequent step that presumably takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells. ASMx1 has been reported to localize in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus in this context, the ASMx1 activity on ISAV may resemble that of the human MxA protein on influenza A virus.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Amplification, melting curve, and agarose gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR targeting a 220-bp product on ISAV segment 8 using total RNA from ISAV-infected normal CHSE-214 cells: NBISA01 (A-C) and HKS-36 (D-F)</bold>.

Orthomyxoviruses are known to be sensitive to the antiviral action of type I IFN, and have evolved viral IFN antagonists to suppress IFN induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Influenza A virus NS1 protein binds dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and prevents activation of PKR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and OAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Additionally, the NS1 protein is able to prevent activation of NF&#x003ba;-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] which are necessary for IFN-&#x003b2; synthesis in virus infected cells. Influenza B virus NS1 protein also inhibits activation of IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the activity of ISG15, one of the major type I IFN inducible proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thogoto virus protein ML suppresses IRF-3 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is therefore expected that ISAV also encodes protein(s) with IFN antagonistic properties, giving the virus an advantage in its fight against the antiviral host response to infection. The complete ISAV protein profile has not yet been definitively established. ISAV segment 8, like its influenza A virus counterpart, has been shown to encode two proteins; one open reading frame (ORF) was shown to encode a major structural protein corresponding to the virus matrix protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and the other ORF is considered to encode the non-structural protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] albeit with no sequence similarity to the influenza NS1 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It would be interesting to see if IFN and ISGs knockdowns would enhance the growth and/or cytopathogenicity of ISAV. This would provide further insight into the exact mechanisms by which ISAV interacts with the Atlantic salmon IFN system with implications for ISAV virulence.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), Atlantic salmon Mx1 protein (ASMx1), cytopathic effect (CPE), Tris borate EDTA (TBE).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJTK conducted all the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
