The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome harbors a putative agrin gene <italic>agr-1</italic>. We have cloned the corresponding cDNA to determine the primary structure of the protein and expressed its recombinant fragments to raise specific antibodies. The domain organization of AGR-1 is very similar to the vertebrate orthologues. <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin contains a signal sequence for secretion, seven follistatin domains, three EGF-like repeats and two laminin G domains. AGR-1 loss of function mutants did not exhibit any overt phenotypes and did not acquire resistance to the acetylcholine receptor agonist levamisole. Furthermore, crossing them with various mutants for components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with impaired muscle function did not lead to an aggravation of the phenotypes. Promoter-GFP translational fusion as well as immunostaining of worms revealed expression of agrin in buccal epithelium and the protein deposition in the basal lamina of the pharynx. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral IL1 head neurons and distal tip cells of the gonad arms are sources of agrin production, but no expression was detectable in body muscles or in the motoneurons innervating them. Recombinant worm AGR-1 fragment is able to cluster vertebrate dystroglycan in cultured cells, implying a conservation of this interaction, but since neither of these proteins is expressed in muscle of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this interaction may be required in different tissues. The connections between muscle cells and the basement membrane, as well as neuromuscular junctions, are structurally distinct between vertebrates and nematodes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Agrin is a large proteoglycan with a prominent function at the developing neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where it plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters.

At the sites of contact, the muscle arms make <italic>en passant</italic> synapses to the motor axons that run along the anterioposterior axis. Depending on the type of the neurotransmitter, the NMJ synapses can be excitatory (cholinergic) or inhibitory (GABAergic). Genetic screens for synaptogenesis mutants have identified key players in NMJ formation and structure. Animals carrying mutations in synaptic components often exhibit uncoordinated movements (<italic>unc</italic>), egg-laying defects (<italic>egl</italic>), defecation defects or paralysis. Pharmacological assays with nematocidal drugs, such as the cholinergic agonist levamisole or the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor aldicarb, have been extensively used in screening for mutants that are resistant to these drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Brenner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Vertebrate agrin molecules exist in two different forms, one with a signal sequence followed by a laminin-binding NtA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, light purple) and another one with a non-cleaved signal sequence (TM, empty rectangle) serving as a transmembrane anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Denzer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Neumann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, we could not find any potential exon encoding a domain similar to the NtA domain in the genomic sequence. The N-terminal part of AGR-1 has seven repetitive follistatin domains, while vertebrate agrin contains eight of them. Further differences are present in the C-terminal part of the AGR-1 protein where the serine/theonine-rich regions (S/T, light yellow) as well as the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin) domain are missing. Vertebrate agrin is a heavily glycosylated protein carrying large O-linked heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains at several positions in the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Tsen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Winzen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> shown as branched structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. This is probably not the case for AGR-1 since the S/T-rich region is missing. Finally, vertebrate agrins have three laminin G domains (lam G), while AGR-1 has only two and no EGF-like domains separating them. The overall similarities of the different agrin segments to the corresponding regions of chicken agrin are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g003">Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p>When the LamG domains from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein were used as a query against Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases the best hits besides the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> predicted agrin homologue (Q61GM7_CAEBR) included vertebrate agrins as well as laminins themselves and perlecans, shown in the alignments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>. In addition, a reciprocal analysis was done to see if some vertebrate agrin lamG domains produce best similarity hits with the nematode one. It turned out that the LamG domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin are quite distinct from those in vertebrates, and that the most similar lamG domains in vertebrates do not produce clear reciprocal best hits. This is not surprising since the LamG domains of the different proteins revealed equal similiarites to <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin LamG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). However, blast searches with each AGR-1 LamG separately resulted in a better match between the first <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamG and the second LamG from several vertebrate homologues, as well as between the second <italic>C. elegans</italic> LamG and the third LamG domain of vertebrate agrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This implies that the two LamG domains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin rather correspond to the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin. This is further supported by the alignment of the region preceding the second LamG domain of AGR-1, which aligned best to the chicken B<sub>0</sub> agrin isoform, i.e. it does not contain any inserts at the conserved B/z site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000731-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Based on the overall domain architecture and the fact that <italic>agr-1</italic> is the only gene in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome to encode a protein of this unique domain composition we conclude that AGR-1 is the nematode agrin orthologue and not an orthologue of any other lamG domain-containing protein.</p><fig id="pone-0000731-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000731.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Alignment of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lamG domains to the corresponding domains of other proteins.</title><p>A, The first LamG domain of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein (Agrin_LamG1_<italic>C.elegans</italic>) was used as a query for Swissprot, Trembl and Refseq databases.

Therefore, we investigated the pharyngeal pumping rate of normal versus mutant animals, but could not detect any differences.

In terms of domain structure, a high degree of similarity was found between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and vertebrate agrins, although some domains were missing.

Several other domains were missing, namely the Ser/Thr-rich region, the SEA module, and one of the three lamG domains at the C-terminal end of the molecule. We analyzed the two lamG domains present in the worm and compared them to the vertebrate lamG domains to determine whether they corresponded to a particular domain pair of vertebrate agrin. Blast searches revealed that the AGR-1 LamG domains aligned best to the last two LamG domains of vertebrate agrin. However, we could not detect any small inserts known to be important for the clustering function of the vertebrate neuronal agrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Ruegg2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gesemann1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. When we searched the intron sequences between the last few exons encoding the LamG domains in all three frames, we could not detect any potential alternative exons coding for amino acids resembling the conserved inserts in the A/y and B/z sites of vertebrates. Therefore, we concluded that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> there is only one major agrin isoform expressed and that the A/y and B/z alternative spice sites are specific to vertebrates.</p><p>With the goal to detect the endogenous agrin by western blot, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the fragment comprising two lamG domains. Purified antibodies detected protein bands of about 160 kDa and 75 kDa, present only in the lysates of the wild type worms and not in any of the agrin mutants. The bigger band corresponds to the protein core size and the smaller possibly to a degradation product or a shorter isoform. In the loss of function mutants <italic>agr-1(eg1770)</italic> and <italic>agr-1(eg153)</italic> we expected a complete lack of the protein, but <italic>agr-1(tm2051)</italic> carrying an in-frame deletion and was expected to express a shorter protein. However, in the <italic>agr-1(tm2051)</italic> mutant the deleted exons 26 and 27 encode the majority of the region against which the polyclonal antibodies were raised. Therefore, this truncated protein may not be recognized and no band detected even though the protein may be expressed. Another possibility is that the protein with the deletion does not fold properly and gets degraded. In any case, it is clear that the agrin mutants do not express the normal agrin protein as the wild type worms do.</p><p>The most surprising result of our study was the fact that we could not detect any agrin expression neither in body wall muscles nor in motoneurons innervating them (except for a transient expression in some embryonic motoneurons). The lack of agrin expression at the NMJs suggested that agrin may not have a conserved function in AChR clustering in the worm. Nevertheless, we investigated the possible phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans agr-1</italic> mutants related to muscle and/or NMJ function. In the case of defective muscle or NMJ formation, worms should display uncoordinated (<italic>unc</italic>) movement, defective thrashing pattern, and/or egg laying deficiency. However, we did not observe any significant impairment neither in <italic>agr-1</italic> single mutants, nor in combination with other related mutations. Pharmacological assays with levamisole, a potent nematode-specific cholinergic agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Lewis1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and aldicarb, an ACh esterase inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>, did not reveal any resistance in <italic>agr-1</italic> mutants. Therefore, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> we could not find any evidence for a role of agrin in muscle or synaptic functions, suggesting that the ancestral function of Agrin was not in NMJ formation. In accordance with our hypothesis, no clear MuSK orthologue (the vertebrate receptor for agrin) has been found in the nematode. Up to date only two factors important for nicotinic AChR clustering have been characterized in the worm. The Ror RTK Cam-1 is necessary for the localization of the ACR-16 (nicotinic AChR &#x003b1;-subunit) at the NMJ, but no kinase activity is needed for this function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Francis1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Another protein, essential for clustering levamisole-sensitive AChR at the NMJ in the worm, is LEV-10. Also for LEV-10, its extracellular domain was shown to be sufficient for the clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Gally1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, vertebrates express proteins that share high similarity to CAM-1 and LEV-10, suggesting that these novel factors discovered in the worm could have been conserved during evolution. Thus, both CAM-1 and LEV-10 may be components of distinct pathways important for AChR clustering in nematodes that may have been complemented by the agrin-MuSK pathway during evolution in vertebrates.</p><p>We then took a closer look at the sites of agrin expression visualized by reporter genes and antibody staining. Prominent expression was found in four head neurons and some pharyngeal cells. This relatively restricted expression pattern was confirmed by several reporter constructs with varying portions of the gene as well as by antibody staining.</p><p>We identified the four agrin-expressing neurons by injecting <italic>agr-1::dsRED</italic> construct into the transgenic lines expressing GFP in specific neuron subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Lee1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach identified the agrin-expressing neurons as inner labial (IL1) sensilla polymodal neurons. These are mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons and interneurons at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hart1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. There are six IL1 neurons in total (three pairs) in the head of the worm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-White1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, but agrin was found to be expressed only in the dorsal and ventral pairs. Such a sub-specialization might be significant to distinguish very fine sensory inputs from the environment. It is known that IL1 neurons together with OLQ (outer labial quadrant sensilla) neurons are responsible for the sensing of a light nose touch and the regulation of spontaneous foraging movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hart1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we tested agrin mutants for light nose-touch-avoidance by the eyelash test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Agrin mutants seemed to be as sensitive to touch as the wild type worms, suggesting that absence of agrin does not lead to a complete failure of IL1 function. Furthermore, IL1 neurons did not show any morphological abnormalities in the <italic>agr-1(eg1770); hdEx25</italic> strain.</p><p>The pharyngeal cells expressing agrin belong to the buccal epithelium which surrounds the anterior-most part of the pharyngeal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Albertson1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>; Wormatlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormatlas.org/">http://www.wormatlas.org/</ext-link>). In early larvae agrin is also expressed in other pharyngeal cells, most likely the marginal cells. The epithelial tissue forms a rigid narrow cylinder restricting the food entry into the pharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Albertson1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. Agrin expressed in this tissue might have a function in the structural support of the pharynx. The immunostaining with monoclonal and polyclonal anti-agrin antibodies detected the protein around the pharynx, resembling perlecan immunostaining in the pharynx basal lamina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Mullen1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, agrin is probably secreted from the pharyngeal cells and integrated into the basal lamina. This pharyngeal staining was missing in all three agrin mutant strains. To test proper pharynx function we measured the pumping rate, which did not differ between agrin mutants and wild type worms. To challenge pharynx function more drastically we tested whether bacterial size had any influence on the feeding and ingestion capability of the worms. For that purpose we grew the worms on <italic>Bacillus megatherium</italic>, a strain of large bacteria and compared it to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 strain used in regular laboratory maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Avery1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Pumping defective mutant strains <italic>eat-4(ky5)</italic> and <italic>eat-5(ad464)</italic>, which grow much more slowly on large bacteria, were used as positive controls. On both food sources our agrin mutant <italic>agr-1 (eg1770)</italic> grew equally fast as wild type worms. Pharynx morphology and resistance to mechanical stress seemed normal in the <italic>agr-1 (eg1770)</italic> mutant animals, suggesting that agrin is not essential for proper development or structural support. If agrin plays a role in pharynx-related functions, it is subtle or redundant.</p><p>Some expression of agrin was present in the distal tip cells of developing gonads in young larvae. The distal tip cell is critical for germ line proliferation and guides gonad migration by sensing environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Schedl1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Merz1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. We have investigated a possible effect of agrin deficiency in gonad migration or brood size, but the mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type worms in these aspects.</p><p>Interaction between agrin and &#x003b1;-dystroglycan in vertebrates is important in different tissues and processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Bezakova1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Grewal1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>). At the NMJ, DG stabilizes mature synapses by connecting the basal lamina to cortical F-actin. In the muscle sarcolemma DG is a central component of a large dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) where it serves again as a linker between the ECM and intracellular cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Martin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Michele1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>). At the NMJ and at the muscle membrane agrin binds with its C-terminal lamG domains to &#x003b1;-DG and with its N-terminal part to laminin providing additional support. Interaction between agrin and &#x003b1;-DG is found as well in the immune system, where this binding mediates lymphocyte activation via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Zhang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the established knowledge on vertebrate agrin and DG, we decided to investigate whether this interaction is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We could demonstrate direct binding of a recombinant fragment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> agrin to purified vertebrate &#x003b1;-DG by a membrane overlay assay. In COS cells transfected with the same recombinant fragment, endogenous DG was clustered and colocalized with agrin bound to the cell membrane.</p><p>Taken together, our experiments suggest that the interaction between agrin and dystroglycan may be conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but this interaction does not play a role at the NMJ or in muscle in general. This view is supported by the observation that <italic>C. elegans</italic> dystroglycan, <italic>dgn-1</italic>, is not expressed in muscle either, but rather in epithelia and neurons. It is found in basement membrane surfaces and is not involved in muscle function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Johnson1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the structural organization at the molecular level of the NMJ, as well as the DGC complex, is clearly distinct in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as compared to vertebrates. Our studies demonstrate that the existence of protein orthologs in evolutionarily distant organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Hutter1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> does not necessarily imply identical functions, at least not in every aspect. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> it appears that the muscle basal lamina depends rather on the presence of the perlecan orthologue <italic>unc-52</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Rogalski1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Mullen1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Rogalski2">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Francis2">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref> and on the integrin chain orthologues <italic>pat-2</italic> and <italic>pat-3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Williams1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Kramer1">&#x0005b;86&#x0005d;</xref> and not on dystroglycan and its ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Johnson1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand dystroglycan and agrin appear to function in epithelia and certain neurons but not in muscle. Our results indicate that the ancestral agrin function included dystroglycan binding but not AChR clustering activity at NMJs, a feature acquired later during evolution. Since also in vertebrates, agrin is expressed outside of muscle and NMJs, <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be a good model organism to delineate these ancestral functions of agrin that may still be functional in vertebrates as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>C. elegans culture conditions and preparation for RNA and protein extraction</title><p>The worm strains were grown at 20&#x000b0;C on NGM agar plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000731-Brenner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Four hybridoma clones were positive, their cultures were expanded, and the antibodies from conditioned media concentrated over protein G columns. In further experiments a pool of the purified monoclonal antibodies was used.</p><p>Polyclonal antibodies were raised in two rabbits (AG1 and AG2) against the recombinant agrin fragment containing both lamG domains fused to a short epitope of TNC. Antisera were tested by western blot and immunofluorescence for the specificity to the agrin fragment and preimmune sera, taken from the rabbits just before the immunization, served as negative control. To purify monospecific antibodies from these antisera the recombinant agrin fragment used as antigen was bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose&#x02122; 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia) and packed into a column. Polyclonal antiserum from rabbit AG1 was loaded, the column was washed, bound antibodies eluted and their activity tested by western blot of the recombinant protein.
