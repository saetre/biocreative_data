This exploitation of the host can involve the production of specific toxins, secretion of virulence effectors into host cells via type III and type IV secretion apparatuses, or mimicry of host signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Young1">Young et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Gruenheid1">Gruenheid and Finlay 2003</xref>). The host organism can combat the infection with an array of innate and adaptive immune responses. Because there are so many possible combinations of thrusts, feints, and parries, there are many potential outcomes to this battle, ranging from a simple skirmish to defeat for one or the other of the combatants. As a result, microbes can produce acute and virulent infections in diseases such as cholera or plague or can take a path to cause persistent infections as in tuberculosis, Lyme disease, or host-adapted salmonellosis. It is important to understand which bacterial and host factors determine whether a microbe will cause epidemic disease, be a brief nuisance infection, or become a commensal.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella enterica</named-content> serovar <italic>typhimurium (S. typhimurium)</italic> is naturally infectious to mice through an oral route and causes a systemic disease resembling human typhoid fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Lucas1">Lucas and Lee 2000</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> crosses the gut epithelium by entering and then killing M cells of the Peyer's patch. Once across the epithelial barrier, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infect macrophages and spread to the mesenteric lymph nodes and subsequently to other organs. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> has two type III secretory apparatuses (TTSAs) that translocate effector proteins across both bacterial and host membranes into the host cell cytoplasm. One TTSA encoded by <italic>Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1)</italic> plays an important role in cell entry, whereas a second TTSA, SPI2, alters the intracellular environment of the host cell to permit <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth. <italic>Salmonella</italic> likely does not find itself in the hemolymph of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in nature, but by placing it there we can ask some questions that are difficult to approach using other techniques.</p><p>The fly is able to fight invading microorganisms via an innate immune response that is composed of at least three arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Khush1">Khush and Lemaitre 2000</xref>). First, there is an inducible humoral immune response, which involves the secretion of antimicrobial peptides by a liver-like organ called the fat body. Second, there is a melanization response that exposes microbes to reactive oxygen as melanin is deposited on the invader. Third, there is the cellular immune response, which can result in the phagocytosis of relatively small organisms like bacteria or the encapsulation of larger parasites such as nematodes or parasitoid wasp eggs. The humoral immune functions are currently the most thoroughly characterized part of the fly's immune system. This aspect of the immune response is triggered when microbial molecules are recognized by fly pattern recognition receptors and signals are transmitted through the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways to activate three nuclear factor &#x003ba;B-like transcription factors, dorsal, Dorsal-related immunity factor, and Relish. It was work in this area that led to the discovery of Toll's central role in vertebrate immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Medzhitov1">Medzhitov et al. 1997</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about how <italic>Drosophila</italic> phagocytes affect the course of infections. It has been demonstrated that these cells act in concert with the humoral immune response to destroy invading bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Braun1">Braun et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-ElrodErickson1">Elrod-Erickson et al. 2000</xref>), and it is well established that they are involved in the encapsulation of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Carton1">Carton and Nappi 2001</xref>). A potential phagocytic receptor for gram-negative bacteria as well as molecules involved in phagocytosis in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Ramet1">Ramet et al. 2002</xref>). Still, we have much to learn about how the phagocytes find and phagocytose microbes, kill microbes, or send signals to the body to indicate that an infection is in progress.</p><p>To focus attention on the cellular immune response, we have been characterizing the interaction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> phagocytes and pathogens that are specialized at growing within phagocytes. These bacteria have evolved methods of defeating phagocytes. By using a combination of wild-type and mutant bacteria, we can probe the function of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> phagocyte. We have shown previously that the two intracellular pathogens <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium marinum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content> can infect <italic>Drosophila</italic> phagocytes, and that some of the pathogenesis mechanisms developed by these bacteria for use in vertebrate phagocytes also function in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Dionne1">Dionne et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Mansfield1">Mansfield et al. 2003</xref>). In this work we chose to study <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> because of its well-characterized secreted effector proteins. We found that the mutation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> effectors led to increased fly survival but, paradoxically, also increased bacterial survival. We propose a model that suggests the immune response of the fly can be deleterious to its health. This model predicts that the fly produces damaging immune effectors. We show that the fly homolog of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), encoded by the <italic>eiger</italic> gene, is involved in this process. Flies homozygous for mutations in <italic>eiger</italic> outlive wild-type flies infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>We attempted to infect <italic>Drosophila</italic> with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> by feeding bacteria to flies and by injecting bacteria into the hemocoel. Flies were resistant to feeding (unpublished data), but direct injection of approximately 10,000 bacterial cells resulted in an infection that caused death in 7&#x02013;9 d, while injection of sterile medium led to a mean time of death of approximately 20 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>The most thoroughly characterized immune response in the fly is the humoral immune response, which involves the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemocoel by an organ called the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Khush1">Khush and Lemaitre 2000</xref>). Two highly conserved signaling systems, the Toll and IMD pathways, have been shown to control the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Lemaitre1">Lemaitre et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Lemaitre2">1997</xref>). The IMD pathway is implicated in raising a response to gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Flies homozygous for an <italic>imd</italic> mutation succumbed to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections rapidly, dying within 12 h of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Bacterial numbers exceeded 100,000,000 per fly as the flies died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), and <italic>Salmonella</italic> in dying flies were found circulating in the hemolymph (unpublished data). Circulating bacteria were not seen in wild-type flies. In contrast to <italic>imd</italic> homozygotes, flies homozygous for a mutation in <italic>Dif,</italic> a transcription factor in the Toll pathway, did not die rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">1</xref>C). This experiment shows that mutations in the IMD but not the Toll pathway sensitize the fly to <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Further, these results suggest that the fly's humoral immune response limits the growth of free <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the hemocoel.</p><p>In mammals and birds, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> is largely an intracellular pathogen. To determine whether <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> was indeed growing in a protected intracellular niche in the fly, we measured the in vivo sensitivity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to gentamicin, an antibiotic that does not cross host-cell plasma membranes. To determine whether gentamicin could kill <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> in flies, 50 nl of 1 mg/ml gentamicin was injected into flies to load them with the drug. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> was injected into the flies 15 min later and incubated for 4 h to allow the antibiotic time to act. Flies were homogenized and plated on selective medium to determine <italic>Salmonella</italic> colony forming units (cfu) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Under these conditions, bacterial loads were 100-fold lower in antibiotic-injected flies than control flies, showing that the antibiotic could kill <italic>Salmonella</italic> immediately following injection. To determine whether <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> in an established infection were protected from gentamicin killing, we injected flies that had been infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> for 7 d with gentamicin or water, and incubated the flies for 4 h before homogenizing and plating them. The day 7 time point was chosen throughout this paper, as it is the latest time point we can use before most flies begin to die from the infection. This experiment showed that bacteria that had been in the fly for 7 d were protected from the antibiotic and suggests that the bacteria were located in an intracellular location.</p><p>In other bacterial infection models in the fly, death of the host occurs only when bacterial numbers increase beyond 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per fly. This is the case for infections both of wild-type flies with pathogens such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-DaArgenio1">D'Argenio et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Lau1">Lau et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Mansfield1">Mansfield et al. 2003</xref>) and of mutant flies with nonpathogenic bacteria such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Lemaitre1">Lemaitre et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-ElrodErickson1">Elrod-Erickson et al. 2000</xref>). This is not the case for <italic>Salmonella</italic> in a wild-type fly. To determine the growth characteristics of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, bacteria were injected over a 1,000-fold dilution range; 7 d after infection, flies were homogenized and plated. At this time, bacteria were found to cover only a 5-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Bacteria injected at low densities grew to levels between 10,000 and 100,000 bacteria per fly, but those injected at higher levels did not pass this threshold. This final number is at least 1,000 fold lower than the number of bacteria found during fatal <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> infections in the fly. <italic>Salmonella</italic> thus reaches a population ceiling in flies, and the flies die containing relatively small numbers of bacteria.</p><p>To determine the location of bacteria within the fly, we examined flies infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Bacteria carrying the plasmid containing the macrophage-inducible gene (pmig-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Valdivia1">Valdivia and Falkow 1997</xref>), which induces GFP expression upon entry into the phagosome, or the strain smo22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-VazquezTorres1">Vazquez-Torres et al. 1999</xref>), which constitutively expresses GFP (unpublished data), were injected into larvae and flies. GFP-expressing <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> could be seen within hemocytes bled from infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g002">2</xref>D). Hemocytes in adults are mostly sessile and cannot be easily removed from the fly. However, these cells can be observed through the cuticle, and clusters of these cells are found on the dorsal surface of the abdomen, along the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-ElrodErickson1">Elrod-Erickson et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Dionne1">Dionne et al. 2003</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> were found associated with these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g002">Figure 2</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g002">2</xref>H). The distribution of bacteria seen using the two GFP constructs was similar (unpublished data). This experiment suggests that, similar to the situation in mice, <italic>Salmonella</italic> are found within phagocytes. Furthermore, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> in fly hemocytes induced the expression of GFP from a <italic>Salmonella</italic> promoter normally induced upon phagocytosis by a mouse macrophage. This demonstrates that an <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> infection-related gene is induced even when the bacteria are infecting an animal at 29 &#x000b0;C instead of 37 &#x000b0;C.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> carrying mutations in a gene encoding a regulator of virulence, <italic>phosphatase P</italic><italic>(phoP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Rathman1">Rathman et al. 1996</xref>), or blocking the function of either SPI1 (orgA::Tn10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Jones1">Jones and Falkow 1994</xref>) or SPI2 (ssrA::miniTn5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Shea1">Shea et al. 1996</xref>), were injected into flies. All of these mutants killed flies more slowly than wild-type bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, graph area &#x0201c;i&#x0201d;). However, analysis of bacterial growth within infected flies revealed a more complicated story. <italic>PhoP</italic> mutants produced infections that were less lethal than wild-type <italic>Salmonella,</italic> but the infecting bacteria grew to the same levels seen in wild-type infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, a <italic>SPI1</italic> or <italic>SPI2</italic> mutant caused little death, and the bacteria grew to an average of 149,000 cfu/fly (<italic>SPI2</italic> mutants) instead of the average of 40,000 cfu per fly found in wild-type infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">3</xref>B). Thus, the level of bacterial growth of this mutant is almost 4-fold higher than for wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic>. This suggests that if <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> cannot manipulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells by secreting effectors, the survival of both pathogen and host is dramatically improved.</p><p>To determine which of the known TTSA effector proteins contributed to this phenotype, flies were injected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> carrying in-frame deletions of these genes as well as several others we suspected might be involved in virulence in the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Datsenko1">Datsenko and Wanner 2000</xref>). Deletions of <italic>spiC, Salmonella secreted effector A (sseA), sseB, sseC,</italic> and <italic>sseD</italic> all resembled a <italic>SPI2</italic> knockout as expected because the proteins encoded by these genes are implicated in building the SPI2 translocation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Nikolaus1">Nikolaus et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Freeman1">Freeman et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-RuizAlbert1">Ruiz-Albert et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Zurawski1">Zurawski and Stein 2003</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding the <italic>Salmonella</italic> leucine-rich repeat-containing protein <italic>(PSlrP)</italic> produced a phenotype similar to that of the knockout of the entire <italic>SPI2</italic> TTSA in terms of fly death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, graph area &#x0201c;ii&#x0201d;). Wild-type virulence could be restored to the <italic>slrP</italic> mutant by expressing <italic>slrP,</italic> controlled by its native promoter, <italic>in trans</italic> on a single-copy plasmid, p.<italic>slrP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, graph area &#x0201c;ii&#x0201d;). Because <italic>SPI1</italic> and <italic>SPI2</italic> bacteria accumulate to higher levels than wild-type strains, in the fruit fly, we measured growth of <italic>slrP-</italic>knockout bacteria. Mutation of <italic>slrP</italic> did not significantly alter the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). These experiments suggest that <italic>slrP</italic> is a determinant of <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence in the fruit fly, but that mutation of <italic>slrP</italic> alone is not sufficient to alter <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth. The protein encoded by <italic>slrP</italic> is suspected to be a specific effector translocated directly into the host cytoplasm. Its function there remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Miao2">Miao et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Miao1">Miao and Miller 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Waterman1">Waterman and Holden 2003</xref>).</p><p>The results we obtain during fly infection differ from what is found in mammalian and avian hosts. SPI1 is required by <italic>Salmonella</italic> for breaching the gut barrier but is dispensable if the bacteria are introduced systemically by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection. Both <italic>phoP-</italic> and <italic>SPI2</italic>-mutant <italic>Salmonella</italic> are highly attenuated even when injected into mammalian hosts; host survival increases, and the mutant bacteria do not readily replicate and are cleared during infections. In the fly, not only does host survival increase during infection by <italic>SPI1</italic> or <italic>SPI2</italic> mutants but, paradoxically, the bacteria are not cleared and replicate better than their wild-type parents. This is an interesting difference, because it separates mere bacterial presence from pathogenesis and disease. It remains to be determined why the fly does not clear the mutant bacteria in the manner that is seen in the mammalian host.</p><p>The analysis of adult hemocytes in the fly is difficult, because we lack good molecular markers for them, and the cells are sessile and rare enough to make them difficult to find regularly in tissue sections. We therefore turned to a functional assay to monitor the behavior of these infected cells by determining their ability to carry out one of their definitive behaviors, phagocytosis. Flies were infected with wild-type and mutant <italic>Salmonella</italic> and then assayed for the phagocytic capacity of the hemocytes on their dorsal surface. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dead <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> were injected into flies and incubated for 60 min to allow time for phagocytosis to occur. Trypan blue was then injected into the flies to quench the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria. Uptake of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was then monitored by observing the flies under FITC illumination with a dissecting microscope. At day 1 post-<italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, hemocytes infected with wild-type, <italic>SPI1</italic>-mutant, <italic>SPI2</italic>-mutant, and <italic>SlrP</italic> bacteria showed similar phagocytic activities (unpublished data). Following 7 d of infection, flies infected with wild-type or <italic>slrP</italic>-mutant bacteria had greatly reduced numbers of phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">Figure 3</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g003">3</xref>H). In contrast, phagocytes remained active during the course of infection by <italic>SPI1</italic> or <italic>SPI2</italic> mutants. Our interpretation of this experiment is that the wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection results in death of phagocytes or a reduced capacity for phagocytosis. This reduction is not dependent on SlrP function.</p><p>In mammals, cytokines such as TNF and interferon relay information about infection through the body. Cytokine expression, in particular TNF expression, is responsible directly and indirectly for a significant degree of the pathology observed during microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Beutler1">Beutler and Rietschel 2003</xref>). Flies have one known TNF-like protein, encoded by the gene <italic>eiger</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Igaki1">Igaki et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Moreno1">Moreno et al. 2002</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>eiger</italic> can induce cell death, but no phenotype had been identified for loss-of-function mutants thus far. We infected wild-type and <italic>eiger<sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic> flies with <italic>Salmonella</italic> to determine whether this fly TNF homolog played a role in the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The mean time to death was lengthened by 3 d in the two <italic>eiger</italic> mutants tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This experiment suggests that <italic>eiger</italic>/TNF signaling during a <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection contributes to the rate of death of the fly. Accumulation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> did not differ between <italic>eiger</italic> mutants and the background fly strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This suggests that <italic>eiger</italic> mutants do not directly affect <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth, but do markedly affect host survival. RNA transcripts of <italic>eiger</italic> were not significantly altered during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection in comparison to Luria broth (LB)-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020418-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This suggests that if <italic>eiger</italic> is regulated during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, the transcriptional changes are too small to be seen relative to expression in whole flies or the changes are posttranscriptional.</p><p>In human disease, morbidity and mortality are often the result of immune responses to invading pathogens rather than to direct action of the pathogens themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Beutler1">Beutler and Rietschel 2003</xref>). Fever, inflammation, and shock are examples of such processes. In plants, a model is emerging in which host cells monitor important cell functions and respond to their perturbations by pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Staskawicz1">Staskawicz et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020418-Schneider1">Schneider 2002</xref>). We suggest the infection caused by <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the fly has attributes of both models. <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth appears to be restricted to hemocytes by action of the humoral immune response. Perhaps the manipulation of these hemocytes by secreted effectors induces additional immune responses that limit bacterial growth. This resembles what is seen in a resistant plant infected by a bacterium expressing the appropriate avirulence protein. Such proteins are secreted into the plant cell's cytoplasm via a TTSA, and they alter the host cell's physiology, presumably to make growth conditions for the bacteria more favorable. Resistant plants can sense this physiological change and raise a type of immune reaction called a hypersensitive response. In the case of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> we suggest that the fly's immune response not only limits the growth of the pathogen but also damages the fly and ultimately leads to its death. When <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> is prevented from using its secreted effectors, the bacteria survive in the phagocyte and grow to higher numbers, possibly because the bacteria are not being attacked as intensely by the host. The result is that there are more bacteria in the fly and host death is greatly delayed. These two properties appear to be separable. The mutations in <italic>eiger</italic> suggest that there are signaling events that increase the death rate in the fly but do not alter the numbers of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. These experiments provide a new genetic model to explore microbial choice of pathogenic lifestyles in addition to a potential new genetic model for the study of TNF-induced metabolic collapse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>Injection assays</title><p>Bacteria and medium were injected in a volume of 50 nl through a pulled glass needle.
