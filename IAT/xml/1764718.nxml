As mortality approaches 50&#x00025;, and current medical therapy against ICH shows only limited effectiveness, an alternative approach is required, such as stem cell-based cell therapy. Previously we have shown that intravenously transplanted human neural stem cells (NSCs) selectively migrate to the brain and induce behavioral recovery in rat ICH model, and that combined administration of NSCs and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) results in improved structural and functional outcome from cerebral ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We postulated that human NSCs overexpressing VEGF transplanted into cerebral cortex overlying ICH lesion could provide improved survival of grafted NSCs, increased angiogenesis and behavioral recovery in mouse ICH model. ICH was induced in adult mice by unilateral injection of bacterial collagenase into striatum. HB1.F3.VEGF human NSC line produced an amount of VEGF four times higher than parental F3 cell line in vitro, and induced behavioral improvement and 2&#x02013;3 fold increase in cell survival at two weeks and eight weeks post-transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Brain transplantation of F3 human NSCs over-expressing VEGF near ICH lesion sites provided differentiation and survival of grafted human NSCs and renewed angiogenesis of host brain and functional recovery of ICH animals.

Protein extracts from brain tissue (20 &#x000b5;g) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein separation was performed using a 10&#x00025; polyacrylamide with 0.05&#x00025; bis-acrylamide. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with antibodies specific for VEGF1(1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz Science, Santa Cruz, CA), VEGF2 (1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz), caspase 3 (1000, Santa Cruz), Bax (1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz), Bcl-2 (1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz), Bcl-xL (1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz), Akt1 (1&#x02236;1000, Chemicon), PI3 kinase p85 and p110 (1&#x02236;1000, Oncogene). PI3-kinases catalyze the synthesis of PI-4,5-biphosphate, which regulates various processes including cell proliferation, survival, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. PI3-kinase is a heterodymeric complex of an 85K regulatory subunit and an 110K catalytic subunit. Secondary antibodies (Amersham Chicago, IL) and a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) were used for immunodetection.

VEGF levels in F3.VEGF-transplanted brain loci were 156.9&#x000b1;18.6 pg/mg protein (2 weeks) and 138.5&#x000b1;15.2 pg/mg proteins (8 weeks), while in the brain sections of F3 grafted loci was 67.9&#x000b1;20.0 pg/mg (2 weeks) and 46.2&#x000b1;9.5 pg/mg (8 weeks). In PBS-injected ICH animals, VEGF contents were below the detectable level of the VEGF ELISA assay. These results indicate that F3.VEGF NSCs at the ICH lesion sites are capable of producing markedly higher amount of VEGF than the parental F3 cells in the lesion sites and thus capable of providing neuroprotective and neoangiogenetic action in the ICH injury sites resulting in improved behavioral outcome. VEGF levels in ICH animals grafted with F3.VEGF, F3 or PBS were also determined by Western blot analyses. ICH animals with F3.VEGF cell transplantation showed higher levels of VEGF than animals receiving F3 cells (Data not shown).

We also tested the hypothesis that the human NSCs could be used as a novel carrier for the delivery of the VEGF gene, providing neuroprotection in animals suffering from ICH injury. Our results demonstrated that the F3 human NSCs transduced with VEGF gene could survive well in the ICH animal brain and release VEGF protein in the hemorrhagic brain injury sites following transplantation.</p><p>In the present study, from as early as one day post-transplantation to 8 weeks post-transplantation, F3.VEGF cells provided functional recovery as determined by rotarod test and limb placement test and also induced an increased survival of transplanted NSCs, inhibition of apoptosis, and renewed angiogenesis in the host brain. The present study demonstrates that VEGF secreted from transplanted human NSCs promoted cell survival pathways and blocked cell death in the ICH brain.</p><p>F3 NSCs overexpressing VEGF were able to survive much better than parental F3 NSCs, so that there were a 2-fold increase in cell survival of transplanted F3.VEGF cells at 2 weeks post-transplantation and a 3-fold increase at 8 weeks, and a majority of grafted F3.VGEF cells differentiated into either neurons or astrocytes in response to signals from the local microenvironment. In addition, the number of TUNEL-positive cells, neruons undergoing apoptotic cell death, was much lower in the ICH animals receiving F3.VEGF cells than in animals receiving PBS or parental F3 cells. The number of von Willebrandt factor-positive microvessels in ICH brain receiving F3.VEGF cells is 3&#x02013;4 fold higher as compared to the control F3-ICH brain. These results indicate that F3.VEGF NSCs at the ICH lesion sites are capable of producing markedly higher amount of VEGF than the parental F3 cells and thus providing neuroprotective and neoangiogenetic action in the ICH injury sites resulting in improved behavioral outcome.</p><p>The present results showed a marked reduction in expression of proapoptotic proteins caspase 3 and Bax in ICH brain receiving F3 or F3.VEGF cells, while their expression was found to increase in control vehicle/PBS group. In converse to the levels of proapoptotic proteins, levels of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and survival signal molecules (p85, p110 and Akt1) in ICH brain receiving F3 or F3.VEGF grafts were significantly higher as compared with control ICH-PBS group. These results suggest that F3.VEGF cells provide neuroprotective effect via down-regulation of expression in pro-apoptotic proteins while production of anti-apoptotic proteins and cell survival promoting molecules are up-regulated. It is known that VEGF activates PI3-kinase-Akt pathway via VEGF receptors. Akt, a serine&#x02212;threonine protein kinase, exerts antiapoptotic effects by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, by inactivating fork-head transcription factors by which transcription of proapoptotic genes is inhibited, by inducing transcription of the survival genes regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B and CREB, and by phosphorylating and inactivating the proapoptotic factors BAD and pro-caspase-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000156-Chao1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000156-Sharp1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As demonstrated in the present study, VEGF is also beneficial to the ICH-injured brain indirectly by promoting angiogeneis. New vessel formation mediated by VEGF will improve blood supply to the injured region, thereby efficiently providing oxygen and nutrients to the degenerating and regenerating neurons in the injured brain.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the VEGF treatment in vivo and in vitro could provide protection against several forms of neuronal injury independently of its angiogenic action.
