A role for the miR172/SMZ module as a rheostat in flowering time is further supported by SMZ binding to several other genes encoding miR172 targets.

The ability to detect the daily photoperiod is of particular importance in many plant species, as it enables them to enter the reproductive phase in response to seasonal changes in day length. When the photoperiod is permissive to flowering, a signal is produced in leaves that is transported to the shoot meristem, where it initiates the formation of flowers. It is now widely accepted that an important component of this long-distance signal is the flowering protein FT. Here, we show that the AP2-like transcription factor SMZ, which represses flowering and is a target of the regulatory miRNA172 microRNA, functions together with related proteins to directly regulate <italic>FT</italic> expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to genome tiling arrays, we find that SMZ binds directly to the <italic>FT</italic> genomic locus and to several other key flowering-related loci. Unexpectedly, the ability of SMZ to repress flowering strictly depends on the presence of the MADS-domain transcription factor FLM. In addition, SMZ binds to its own regulatory sequences and those of three closely related genes, providing evidence of strong negative feedback between SMZ and the other AP2-like miRNA172 targets.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout their lives, plants progress through distinct developmental phases, from germination and vegetative growth to flowering and, finally, senescence. The transition from vegetative growth to flowering is of particular importance because the correct timing of this switch is mandatory to ensure reproductive success. Plants have therefore evolved an elaborate genetic network that integrates endogenous and environmental signals to guarantee that flowering commences when conditions are most favorable.</p><p>Genetic and molecular analyses in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and other plants have identified several distinct genetic pathways that are involved in regulating the floral transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Levy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Putterill1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of genetic interactions, one can distinguish between the gibberellic acid pathway, the autonomous pathway, and the vernalization pathway. Finally, light, and especially day length, is an important stimulus that is integrated into the flowering time regulatory network by the photoperiod pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Garner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Imaizumi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is a facultative long-day plant, which means that it will flower more rapidly when day length exceeds a critical minimum. Interestingly, plants measure photoperiod in the leaves and not at the shoot apex where the new flowers will be formed. It has therefore been long postulated that the light-exposed leaves produce a flower-forming substance to regulate the formation of flowers at the shoot apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Sachs1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Knott1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This ultimately led to the formation of the &#x0201c;florigen&#x0201d; hypothesis, which postulated that a substance, &#x0201c;florigen,&#x0201d; is produced in leaves under inductive photoperiod and is transported to the shoot apex to induce flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Chailakhyan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. It was later demonstrated that such a flower-inductive substance could be transmitted from one plant (donor) via grafting to another plant (receptor) that had been cultivated under noninductive conditions.</p><p>An important factor that allows <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to discriminate between short day (SD) and inductive long day (LD) is the B-box&#x02013;type zinc finger protein CONSTANS (CO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Putterill2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The regulation of CO at both the mRNA and protein levels ensures that the protein will accumulate and activate flowering only under LD conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Imaizumi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Valverde1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Laubinger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, CO appears to carry out its function in leaves, where it acts in the phloem companion cells to regulate a systemic signal that induces photoperiodic flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-SuarezLopez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-An1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the protein FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) acts as a florigen to convey flowering time signals from the leaves to the apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Kardailsky1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. First, it was established that <italic>FT</italic> is the major target of CO in leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Samach1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Wigge1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. It was further demonstrated that the FT protein interacts at the shoot apex with another flowering time regulator, the bZIP transcription factor FD, to induce downstream flower-specific targets such as the MADS-domain proteins <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) and <italic>FRUITFULL</italic> (<italic>FUL</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Wigge1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Abe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that <italic>FT</italic> is transcribed in leaves but acts at the apex implied that FT can move, either as mRNA or as protein. Later experiments were unable to detect <italic>FT</italic> mRNA movement but provided evidence that FT protein is able to reach the apex when expressed in the vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Lifschitz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Tamaki1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the induction of flowering under LD by CO/FT is counteracted by several factors that either prevent <italic>FT</italic> expression in the leaf or act downstream of FT to modulate its function at the shoot apex. In particular, MADS-domain transcription factors have been shown to act as repressors of flowering. The most prominent of these is FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which represses flowering in winter annual accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> before the plants have been exposed to a prolonged period of cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Michaels1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It has recently been shown that FLC, when expressed either from the phloem-specific <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter or the meristem-specific <italic>KNAT1</italic> promoter, efficiently represses flowering and that these effects are additive. Further, it was demonstrated that FLC directly binds to the regulatory regions of three positive regulators of flowering, <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>FD</italic>, and <italic>SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>), presumably to repress these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Searle1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Two other MADS-domain transcription factors, FLM and SVP, have also been shown to repress flowering. In contrast to FLC, which is involved in the vernalization pathway, these two genes seem to be involved predominately in the photoperiod pathway, and <italic>FLM</italic> and <italic>SVP</italic> act as partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Hartmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Scortecci2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. There is, however, also evidence that implicates SVP and FLM in temperature-dependent regulation of flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and SVP has recently been shown to interact with FLC in a repressor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Li1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast to FLC, FLM and SVP, which are MADS-domain transcription factors, each <italic>TEM</italic> gene encodes an AP2 domain as well as a B3-type DNA binding domain. <italic>TEM1</italic> is most strongly expressed in leaves, where its expression is regulated in a circadian fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Castillejo1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is in contrast to FLC, which bound most strongly to the first intron of <italic>FT</italic>, indicating that <italic>FT</italic> is regulated by different repressors in different regions.</p><p>Yet another family of six AP2-like transcription factors also act as repressors of flowering. This clade of proteins comprises APETALA 2 (AP2) itself, the three TARGET OF EAT (TOE) proteins (TOE1, TOE2, and TOE3), and SCHLAFM&#x000dc;TZE (SMZ) and its paralog SCHNARCHZAPFEN (SNZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Schmid1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. All six genes have in common that they are predicted targets of microRNA172 (miR172), expression of which is regulated by GIGANTEA (GI) to control flowering in a CO-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Jung1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. It has previously been shown that TOE1 and TOE2 act as repressors of flowering: <italic>toe1</italic> mutants are significantly early flowering, and this effect is enhanced in a <italic>toe1 toe2</italic> double mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Aukerman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Jung1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. However, plants that expressed miR172 constitutively were found to flower much earlier than even the <italic>toe1 toe2</italic> double mutant, indicating that the other AP2 family members most likely act redundantly with TOE1 and TOE2 to repress flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Aukerman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Chen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. A good candidate for such a repressor is SMZ, which was originally identified in an activation-tagging screen because of its dominant late-flowering phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Schmid1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, SNZ, a paralog of SMZ, has been shown to repress flowering when expressed at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Schmid1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it was unclear whether SMZ and SNZ normally act as repressors of flowering.</p><p>Here, we show that the miR172 targets <italic>SMZ</italic> and <italic>SNZ</italic> are bona fide floral repressors and act redundantly with <italic>TOE1</italic> and <italic>TOE2</italic> to delay flowering specifically under LD conditions. Plants expressing <italic>SMZ</italic> at high levels are late flowering, which is due to an almost complete block in <italic>FT</italic> induction. The effects of SMZ on <italic>FT</italic> expression appear to be direct, as chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to hybridization to tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) identified <italic>FT</italic> as a target of SMZ. In addition, several other known regulators of flowering time were identified as SMZ targets. Among them are <italic>SMZ</italic> itself, <italic>SNZ</italic>, <italic>AP2</italic>, and <italic>TOE3</italic>, suggesting a complex feedback regulation among miR172 targets. Finally, we found that repression of flowering by SMZ is independent of the potent floral repressor FLC, but requires FLM for its function, providing a direct connection between two important classes of flowering time regulators, AP2- and MADS-domain proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SMZ Represses Floral Induction by Inhibiting the Photoperiod Pathway</title><p><italic>smz-D</italic> was originally isolated as a dominant late-flowering mutant in an activation-tagging screen under LD conditions. <italic>SMZ</italic> is expressed in young seedlings and is developmentally regulated, as deduced from microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and confirmed by a genomic SMZ&#x02236;GUS reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g001">Figure 1B&#x02013;1D</xref>).

functioning as a floral repressor, we isolated homozygous <italic>SMZ</italic> loss-of-function alleles from T-DNA insertion collections. Neither of the individual <italic>smz</italic> mutant lines displayed any obvious phenotypes; in particular, the total number of leaves did not significantly differ from that of wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000148-t001">Table 1</xref>). Most notably, the plants were not early flowering, as one would have expected to result from the loss of a putative floral repressor. Also, a double mutant lacking <italic>SMZ</italic> and its closest paralog <italic>SNZ</italic> was found to be indistinguishable from the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Together with <italic>AP2</italic>, <italic>TOE1</italic>, <italic>TOE2</italic>, and <italic>TOE3</italic>, <italic>SMZ</italic> and <italic>SNZ</italic> form a clade of six AP2-domain transcription genes. Because functional redundancy has been observed within this clade in respect to the timing of floral induction of the <italic>toe1 toe2</italic> double mutant, we first focused on the function of <italic>TOE1</italic>, <italic>TOE2</italic>, <italic>SMZ</italic> and S<italic>NZ</italic> rather than that of <italic>AP2</italic> and <italic>TOE3</italic>, which are predominately expressed at the meristem, and created a mutant line that lacks <italic>toe1 toe2 smz snz</italic> functions. This quadruple mutant was found to flower significantly earlier than Col-0, <italic>toe1</italic>, and even <italic>toe1 toe2</italic> double-mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000148-t001">Table 1</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 in all comparisons). This result confirms that SMZ and its paralog SNZ are indeed acting as floral repressors redundantly with TOE1 and TOE2. This effect is only apparent in the sensitized <italic>toe1 toe2</italic> mutant background, as <italic>TOE1</italic> normally masks the effects of <italic>smz</italic> and <italic>snz</italic> loss of function.</p><p>The early flowering we observed in certain combinations of <italic>smz</italic>, <italic>snz</italic>, <italic>toe1</italic>, and <italic>toe2</italic> loss-of-function alleles was associated with a reduced number of rosette leaves, whereas the number of cauline leaves remained constant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000148.s006">Figure S1</xref>). It is interesting to note that even the <italic>toe1 toe2 smz snz</italic> quadruple mutant still flowers significantly later than plants that constitutively express miR172, which have been reported to produce on average two to three rosette leaves before bolting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Aukerman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Chen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Closer inspection of the list of high-confidence SMZ targets (FDR&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) revealed that three other miR172 targets were also significantly bound.

No high-confidence binding by SMZ was detected to the last two members of the clade of miR172 targets, <italic>TOE1</italic> and <italic>TOE2</italic>. The finding that four out of six miR172 targets were significantly bound by SMZ is more than expected by chance (Fisher exact test; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

Further, the effect of high SMZ levels on flower development is most likely not only due to a repression of <italic>FT</italic>, but also to SMZ repressing other flowering time regulators as well. This idea is supported by the finding that, besides <italic>FT</italic>, the floral integrator and flower development genes <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>AP1</italic> were also identified by ChIP-chip as high-confidence (FDR&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) targets of SMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g008">Figure 8H and 8I</xref>). In each of these cases, binding occurred directly upstream of the transcription start site, suggesting strongly that expression of these genes is under direct negative regulation by SMZ.

As already described for <italic>FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), <italic>AP1</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> were strongly induced in the quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000148.s011">Figure S6</xref>).

The latter most likely is due to indirect activation of these genes. The expression of <italic>AP2</italic> and <italic>TOE3</italic> was also increased. This is in agreement with the proposed negative feedback regulation among the miR172 target genes. In contrast, <italic>FRI</italic> was only marginally up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000148.s011">Figure S6</xref>).

Consistent evidence from both gene expression and ChIP-chip experiments suggests that SMZ directly represses the transcription of a range of known flowering time genes and that the delay in flowering time caused by high levels of SMZ is most likely a result of repression of a number of flowering time regulators in both the leaves and the shoot meristem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>To ensure reproductive success, plants have evolved a complex regulatory network that integrates various endogenous and environmental factors to ensure that flowering occurs when conditions are most favorable. Many of the key regulators that control flowering time have been identified and the majority of them are putative transcription factors. Extensive epigenetic regulation of several key regulators of flowering complicates the situation even further <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Farrona1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on genetic analyses, pathways that control the transition to flowering have been defined, but the details of how this transcription factor network functions at a molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we have combined genetic analysis with high-throughput microarray technologies to understand in detail how the AP2-like transcription factor SMZ represses flowering. A model summarizing our findings regarding the genetic interactions of <italic>SMZ</italic> and its position in the network regulating flowering in response to photoperiod is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1000148-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000148.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Genetic Interactions governing photoperiodic flowering.</title><p>Photoperiod is perceived in leaves and entrains the circadian clock. <italic>CONSTANS</italic> (<italic>CO</italic>) is a major output of the clock in terms of regulating flowering.

This activation of <italic>FT</italic> is counteracted by floral repressors such as SMZ, which itself is negatively regulated by miR172. SMZ is also repressing related genes in a negative feedback loop. At the shoot apex, SMZ binds to regulators sequences of <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) and <italic>SUPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>), two other known regulators of flowering time and floral development.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000148.g009"/></fig><p>SMZ is predominately expressed in young leaves, suggesting that this is the tissue where it normally functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Jung1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Schmid2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Leaves play a crucial role in the perception of day length, and it has recently been demonstrated that the information to induce flowering can be conveyed from the leaves to the shoot apex via transport of the FT protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Lifschitz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Tamaki1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The regulation of <italic>FT</italic> expression is therefore of the utmost importance for a plant to ensure the correct timing of flowering. Plants achieve this control by a combined effect of activators of <italic>FT</italic> expression, such as CO, and repressors, such as FLC, FLM, SVP, and the TEM proteins, some of which have been shown to directly bind to regulatory regions of the <italic>FT</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Searle1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Li1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Castillejo1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of SMZ from a leaf-specific promoter recapitulated the late-flowering phenotype of constitutive SMZ overexpression, indicating that presence of SMZ in the vasculature was sufficient to repress flowering. Molecular analyses indicate that SMZ directly contributes to the regulation of <italic>FT</italic> in leaves. The evidence for this is 2-fold: first, plants expressing SMZ at high levels fail to induce <italic>FT</italic> in response to LD, and second, SMZ binds directly to the <italic>FT</italic> locus. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that SMZ acts as a floral repressor and that <italic>FT</italic> is a major transcriptional target of SMZ in leaves.</p><p>Whether FT constitutes the sole mobile signal that conveys the instruction to flower from leaves to the apex is still an open question.

Although we did not detect high-confidence binding of SMZ to <italic>LFY</italic>, strong, significant binding was observed to <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>AP1</italic>, so it is possible that the reduced abundance of these factors at the meristem may be at least partly responsible for the observed phenotype. Along these lines, it has recently been reported that a <italic>soc1 ful</italic> double mutant reverts to a vegetative state after flowering had been induced, resulting in a perennial growth habit of the double mutant and demonstrating the importance of these genes in robustly inducing flowering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Melzer1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, SMZ does not act alone in repressing flowering but instead redundantly with related proteins, all of which are miR172 target genes. It has previously been shown that miR172 overexpression did not dramatically alter the mRNA levels of its targets. This has been interpreted as evidence for translational repression being more important than mRNA cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Chen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Later, however, it was shown that at least one of these genes, <italic>AP2</italic>, can repress its own transcription, demonstrating that a negative feedback very much confounds this conclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Schwab1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It was, however, not clear whether this repression was direct or indirect. Also, it was unclear just how widespread this negative feedback regulation among the miR172 targets really was. Our genome-wide ChIP binding and gene expression studies indicate that SMZ is not only binding to its own genomic region, but regulates at least three other family members as well, demonstrating that the negative feedback is direct and common among the miR172 targets.</p><p>The function of SMZ appears to strictly depend on the presence of the MADS-domain transcription factor FLM. The mechanistic details of this interaction remain unknown, but one can imagine several possible scenarios. SMZ might directly interact with FLM protein to form a repressor complex. However, at least when tested in yeast, we did not find any indication for direct interaction between SMZ and FLM (unpublished data). An alternative would be that FLM needs to be present at target loci in order to facilitate either SMZ binding or activity, but without physical interaction between the two. The dependence of SMZ on FLM seems to be rather specific, as inactivation of the MADS repressors FLC nor SVP, both of which have been shown to directly repress <italic>FT</italic>, does not prevent SMZ function. It has been suggested that FLM and SVP genetically act as partners in repressing flowering time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Scortecci2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, at least in the case of repressing SMZ activity, FLM and SVP functions are clearly separate and not interchangeable.</p><p>In addition to the genes discussed so far, <italic>TEM1</italic>, a known repressor of flowering, was also bound by SMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). How binding of <italic>TEM1</italic> by SMZ could possibly regulate flowering is currently unclear. It should be noted that the expression levels of <italic>TEM1</italic> were not changed in leaves and at the meristem by <italic>smz-D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

One may hypothesize that, similar to what we have observed among the miR172 targets, control of <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> expression also involves a regulatory feedback mechanism.</p><p>Regardless of the precise mechanisms that control <italic>TEM</italic> expression, the increased <italic>TEM2</italic> levels in <italic>smz-D</italic> very likely contribute to the repression of <italic>FT</italic>. Finally, <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) was also identified among the genes most strongly bound by SMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000148-g008">Figure 8F</xref>).

Col-0 carries a recessive <italic>FRI</italic> allele, and it is therefore unlikely that the binding of SMZ to the <italic>FRI</italic> promoter is responsible for the delay in flowering we observe in <italic>smz-D</italic>. However, SMZ and the other miR172 targets could very well contribute to the control of <italic>FRI</italic> expression in late-flowering accessions that carry a functional <italic>FRI</italic> allele. This would provide <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with a way to regulate <italic>FLC</italic> levels by modulating FRI expression.

In nature, to tightly control flowering time, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> must achieve a careful balance between miR172 and its targets. Negative feedback of SMZ onto the other miR172 targets likely contributes to this regulation. miR172 and its targets are not specific to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but are conserved in other dicotyledonous as well as monocotyledonous plant species, suggesting that these genes play an important role in plant development in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000148-Dezulian1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

The intricate regulatory interactions we uncovered by just looking at just one single factor, SMZ, demonstrate how complex regulation of flowering time at the molecular level is.
