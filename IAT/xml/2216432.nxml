The initial investigations of Sirt1 deficient mice have revealed a phenotype that includes a reduced lifespan, small size, and an increased frequency of abnormal sperm. We have now performed a detailed analysis of the molecular and functional effects of Sirt1 deficiency in the germ line of Sirt1 knock-out (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice. We find that Sirt1 deficiency markedly attenuates spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis. Numbers of mature sperm and spermatogenic precursors, as early as d15.5 of development, are significantly reduced (&#x0223c;2-10-fold less; P&#x02264;0.004) in numbers in Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, whereas Sirt1 deficiency did not effect the efficiency oocyte production following superovulation of female mice. Furthermore, the proportion of mature sperm with elevated DNA damage (&#x0223c;7.5&#x00025; of total epididymal sperm; P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02) was significantly increased in adult Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; males. Analysis of global gene expression by microarray analysis in Sirt1 deficient testis revealed dysregulated expression of 85 genes, which were enriched (P&#x0003c;0.05) for genes involved in spermatogenesis and protein sumoylation. To assess the function of Sirt1 deficient germ cells, we compared the efficiency of generating embryos and viable offspring in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) experiments using gametes from Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and sibling Sirt1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice.

Together, these data support an important role for Sirt1 in spermatogenesis, including spermatogenic stem cells, as well as germ cell function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Sir</italic> (Silent Information Regulator) genes were originally discovered in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) where they were shown to affect expression of genes, due to their ability to promote heterochromatin, at the HML and HMR mating type loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Shore1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most notably, it plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Sirt1 has been shown to promote gluconeogenesis in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Rodgers1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and increase respiration and insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Bordone1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The former process involves deacetylation of FOXO1 and PGC1-&#x003b1; by Sirt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Rodgers1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> whereas the latter process involves Sirt1-dependent suppression of expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) which uncouples respiration from ATP production in the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Bordone1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Sirt1 has been shown to protect against oxidative stress in &#x003b2;-cells, thru a process involving deacetylation of FOXO proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Sirt1 promotes fat mobilization and inhibits fat cell differentiation in white adipose tissue via a mechanism involving interaction of Sirt1 with peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) and suppression of the transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Picard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that these and other affects of Sirt1 in mammalian cells may act to counter metabolic syndrome, the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, which becomes more pronounced with age in some mammals including humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Guarente1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Sirt1 has also been shown to have pro-survival effects on neurons. For example, the neuroprotective affect of the mutation in Wallerian degeneration slow (<italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic>) mice has been shown to be dependent on SirT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Araki1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Sirt1 over-expression has been shown to protect against &#x003b2;-amyloid induced death of microglia by a mechanism involving inhibition of NF-KB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Chen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. While the exact nature of the neuro-protective effects of Sirt1 on neurons is presently unknown, it likely involve inhibition of apoptosis by the interaction of Sirt1 with a number of different proteins involved in the survival response to stress, including p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Vaziri1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> FOXO transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Brunet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> NF-KB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Yeung1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, E2F1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and Ku70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Cohen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Sirt1 deficient (knock-out) mouse strains have now been developed in a number of independent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-McBurney1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that the low number of spermatozoa and atrophied testis in male Sirt1 deficient mice is due to effects that manifest at least as early as d15.5 of development, and correspond with elevated frequency of DNA damage in mature sperm in adult mice. Microarray analysis of global gene expression in testis from Sirt1 deficient mice reveals aberrant expression of a number of genes that have important roles in spermatogenesis, as well as genes involved in sumoylation. Furthermore, using in vitro fertilization (IVF), we show that both male and female gametes from Sirt1 deficient mice have a reduced efficiency at generating viable zygotes, although these zygotes are fully capable of developing to term following embryo transfer to pseudo-pregnant females.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>The Sirt1 knock-out (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Cheng1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and Oct4-GFP transgenic mouse strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Szabo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> were kindly provided by Fred Alt (Harvard University) and Dr. Jeff Mann (University of Melbourne) respectively.

In this study, we have examined in detail the role of Sirt1 in germ cell function and gametogenesis using a Sirt1 knock-out mouse strain. We find that both mature sperm and spermatogenic stem cell numbers are significantly reduced in Sirt1 deficient mice and embryos respectively, whereas oocyte numbers are not affected. While the fertility of Sirt1 deficient gametes is markedly attenuated, we were able to generate F1 Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice which survived to adulthood by performing IVF with gametes from Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. The deleterious effect of Sirt1 deficiency on sperm numbers is at least in part accounted for by elevated levels of DNA damage, as assessed using the Comet assay. Microarray analysis of global gene expression in the testis from Sirt1 deficient mice revealed aberrant expression of a number of genes involved in spermatogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that Sirt1 has important roles in spermatogenesis and germ cell function.</p><p>While we did not observe an affect of Sirt1 deficiency on the ability to produce mature oocytes, we did notice a marked decrease in efficiency in generating both 2-cell embryos and live-offspring when performing IVF with oocytes from Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001571.s003">Table S1</xref>). We have confirmed that Sirt1 is expressed in oocytes (data not shown), and therefore, these results suggest Sirt1 may play a role in fertilization and/or early stages of embryogenesis. Nevertheless, the ability to generate live offspring utilizing gametes from both Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; males and females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001571-t001">Table 1</xref> and reference 20) clearly shows that Sirt1 is not essential for embryogenesis. Whether the survival of these F1 Sirt1 deficient embryos is due to compensation by other Sirtuins or other proteins remains to be assessed.</p><p>The observation that Sirt1 deficiency causes a reduction not only in the numbers of mature sperm in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001571-g001">Fig 1</xref>) but also in numbers of spermatogenic stem cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001571-g002">Fig 2</xref>) from d15.5 male embryos indicates that Sirt1 may have important roles in certain types stem cells. Based on recent observations by us and others, we predict that the exact nature of the effect of Sirt1 deficiency will likely be lineage dependent. For example, while Sirt1 deficiency attenuates spermatogenesis, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Sirt1 exhibit enhanced survival in response to genotoxic stress and the ability to bypass cell senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Chua1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we have observed enhanced survival and growth potential of HSC from Sirt1 deficient mice during culture in cytokine deprived media, and negligible differences in numbers of HSC between young Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and Sirt1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice (unpublished observations). Thus Sirt1 likely has different functions in different cell types, including stem cells.</p><p>Global analysis of gene expression revealed an over-representation of genes in the GO categories of spermatogenesis and protein sumoylation. The former observation is in agreement with the reduced sperm count and increased frequency of abnormal sperm and DNA damage in sperm from Sirt1 deficient mice. Most of the differentially expressed genes involved in spermatogenesis were over-expressed in the testis of Sirt1 deficient mice. Sirt1 has the potential to promote transcriptional silencing, for example by deacetylating and inactivating the transcription factors p300 and FOXO proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Bouras1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Motta1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the effect of Sirt1 deficiency on expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis in the testis could be a direct affect at the level of transcription. However, the expression of a number of these genes occurs predominantly at specific stages of spermatogenesis. For example, Hook1 is expressed predominantly in spermatocytes and round spermatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-MendozaLujambio1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and Nasp is predominantly expressed in spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Welch1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus a possible affect due to altered cellularity, the relative numbers of different types of spermatogenic precursors, in the testis of Sirt1 deficient mice on differential expression of these genes cannot be presently ruled out. It will be of interest to assess whether Sirt1 regulates transcription of genes involved in spermatogenesis and/or alters the proportions of spermatogenic cells in the testis, perhaps by causing a block at a specific stage of spermatogenesis, in future studies.</p><p>Interestingly, genes involved in the sumoylation of proteins, the addition or removal of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) to proteins, are also over-represented in the genes differentially expressed in Sirt1 deficient testis. Recent studies have suggest that Sirt1 can affect the sumoylation of certain proteins via a mechanism where the deacetylation of specific Lys residues by Sirt1 allows the subsequent addition of SUMO by other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Bouras1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-StankovicValentin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that, the over-expression of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2, both of which are capable of adding SUMO to other proteins, in the testis of Sirt1 deficient mice may be a compensatory response to promote the sumoylation of specific proteins in the testis in the absence of the deacetylase activity of Sirt1. The exact role of Sirt1 in the regulation of sumoylation of proteins in spermatogenic cells, and the relevance of this to spermatogenesis, remains to be addressed.</p><p>Results from recent studies on the ability of Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to successfully mate and produce offspring with other mice are incongruent. A study by McBurney et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-McBurney1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and the results presented here suggest that Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice are infertile, in that they cannot successfully mate with other mice, are at least that fertility is severely compromised by Sirt1 deficiency. However, Gu et al have recently reported that Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, both males and females, can generate offspring by mating with wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. While the reason for this discrepancy is not presently understood, it is unlikely to be accounted for by the expression of different dysfunctional versions of Sirt1 in the different Sirt1 knock-out strains, since both the strain used by Gu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and that used in our study were derived from the same Sirt1 knock-out ES cell strain (Exon 4 of the Sirt1 gene is deleted in both strains) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Cheng1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible explanation is hybrid vigor, since the Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; strain used by Gu et al was on a 129SvJ/C57BL6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001571-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> whereas the strain used by McBurney et al was on a 129/J background, and the Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice used here had been back-crossed onto a C57BL6 background. Nevertheless, our ability to generate viable offspring using IVF with Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; gametes, in both Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; X wild type crosses and Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; X Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001571.s003">Table S1</xref>), shows that Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (at least those derived from Sirt1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; X Sirt1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; crosses) are not sterile, in agreement with the results of Gu et al. Furthermore, the observation that viable F2 Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice may be readily generated using IVF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001571.s003">Table S1</xref>) shows that assisted reproductive technologies may be a practical method to study the long term effect of Sirt1 deficiency, across multiple generations of Sirt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, on development and aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001571.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Numbers of apoptotic cells is increased in Sirt1 testis.
