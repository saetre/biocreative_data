In particular, much recent attention has focused on small (&#x0003c;100 nucleotide) RNA species which significantly impact gene expression in eukaryotes, either by modulating transcript levels or the packaging of specific chromatin (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). However, much larger noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) also play fundamental roles in eukaryotic metabolism and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Like smaller RNAs, large ncRNAs (&#x0003e; 1 kb) can also modulate chromatin states and gene expression. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, two ncRNAs, <italic>roX1 </italic>and <italic>roX2</italic>, target the Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex to the male <italic>X</italic>-chromosome, a crucial step in <italic>Drosophila </italic>dosage compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In mammalian dosage compensation, the large <italic>Xist </italic>transcript along with its antisense counterpart, <italic>Tsix</italic>, are crucial in modulating the epigenetic state of X-linked loci (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). After transcription, <italic>Xist </italic>spreads across the entire length of one of the two X-chromosomes in female cells, resulting in the transcriptional silencing of most other loci located on the inactive X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Another large ncRNA, <italic>NRON</italic>, was recently shown to be involved in nuclear trafficking, through its interaction with a variety of nuclear import proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A number of RNAs also localize to specific nuclear subdomains, such as the ten to thirty SC35 splicing domains localized within each mammalian cell (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). SC35 domains comprise large (0.5&#x02013;3 micron) structures defined by immunofluorescence to the spliceosome assembly factor SC35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; this excludes the Cajal Bodies and smaller entities defined by the snRNP "speckle" staining pattern, but otherwise, SC35 domains overlap nuclear speckles, splicing factor compartments (SFCs), and interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). Much debate has centered on the function and composition of these domains, either as sites of pre-mRNA metabolism and export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or storage sites of splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While each SC35 domain is enriched in a large number of splicing factors and other factors involved in mRNA metabolism, a large pool of polyadenylated (poly(A)) and possibly nuclear retained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] RNA also localizes to each domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the identity of which has implications for the function of SC35 domains.</p><p>The function(s) of noncoding RNAs which act as chromatin modulators and nuclear scaffolds, depends on their localization to the nucleus. Unlike RNAs coding for nuclear proteins, which exit the nucleus when used as templates for protein synthesis, noncoding nuclear RNAs may exist solely within the nucleus throughout their lifetime. We reasoned that RNA transcripts with nuclear roles like <italic>XIST </italic>or comprising the poly(A) component of SC35 domains could be identified using a simple microarray approach to compare nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA populations. With this approach, we identified two evolutionarily conserved large noncoding transcripts that, like <italic>XIST</italic>, are enriched in human nuclei. Both nuclear enriched abundant transcripts (NEATs) are located on chromosome 11 in humans, less than 70 kb apart. Analysis of publicly available mouse transcriptome data confirms that the mouse homologs of these noncoding RNAs, located less than 50 kb apart on mouse chromosome 19, are also nuclear enriched. Each of these noncoding RNAs shows a broad distribution in different tissues, though their expression patterns differ slightly. Through RNA fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH), we show that the mouse and human homologs of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>localize to the periphery of SC35 domains. Strikingly, the second transcript, <italic>NEAT2 </italic>localizes to the interior of all mature SC35 domains, suggesting a role for the transcript in either the structure or function of these nuclear substructures. Such pan-localization to SC35 domains by a noncoding poly(A) transcript has been discussed for several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], thus the identification of <italic>NEAT2 </italic>represents an important step towards the further molecular and functional dissection of these domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>An array-based approach to identify ubiquitously expressed nuclear RNAs</title><p>The classical long ncRNA with a nuclear role is <italic>XIST</italic>. <italic>XIST </italic>is a large, spliced, ncRNA, which is polyadenylated and stably expressed in female somatic cells where it localizes to the nucleus and tightly associates with one of the two X chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Using <italic>XIST'</italic>s properties as a guide, we looked for noncoding RNAs with nuclear functions by searching for similarly nuclear-enriched noncoding transcripts.</p><p>To identify nuclear enriched transcripts, we utilized the Affymetrix U133A and U133B expression array set to compare the nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions of two female cell types: the primary human fibroblast cell line, WI-38, and an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid line, GM00131. Based on the Unigene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001), these arrays allow the analysis of 39,000 transcripts with over 45,000 probes. In each cell line, many probe sets were enriched greater than 2-fold in the nuclear fraction, however only 113 of these were enriched in both (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Nuclear enriched probes were aligned to the human genome and their corresponding loci described using the University of California at Santa Cruz genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Based on these analyses, these abundant nuclear sequences included six probes to <italic>XIST</italic>, forty-two to introns, fifty-one to open reading frame (ORF) genes, six to repeat elements, and four probes each to two autosomal seemingly noncoding RNA loci.</p><p>The presence of a number of intronic probes on the Affymetrix arrays was striking, suggesting that a large number of Unigene EST clusters are not unique transcripts but instead represent improperly annotated introns. Indeed, many of these intronic probes had corresponding poly(A) repeats located in downstream genomic sequence which likely facilitated the annealing of oligo-dT primers at these sites during reverse transcription reactions. Affymetrix array design, which uses sequences selected from GenBank, dbEST and RefSeq, may not have completely filtered out such such falsely primed intronic-derived ESTs. Genes do sometimes reside within the introns of other transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], however, of the over 20 intronic probes we examined, all were transcribed from the same strand as the gene within which they reside. As there is no reported bias for intra-intronic genes to be transcribed in the same direction as the overlapping transcript, these data suggest that the vast majority of these probes detect intronic RNA rather than novel genes.</p><p>Nuclear enriched, non-intronic sequences aligned to either repeat elements and ORF or apparently non-ORF (noncoding) RNA transcripts. The enrichment of ORF genes within the nucleus may hold clues to RNA metabolism and may indicate high-level constitutive transcription coupled to relatively rapid cytoplasmic mRNA turnover. Perhaps the regulation of these genes is post-transcriptional, with other factors (such as microRNAs) regulating cytoplasmic RNA stability. Alternatively, they may be regulated by nuclear retention mechanisms similar to those allowing rapid translation of the mouse cationic amino acid transporter in response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To address these possibilities we used the GOStat program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to determine if any gene ontology subgroup was overrepresented in our sample of nuclear enriched genes. The 93 probes to coding sequences (excluding repetitive sequences and probes to noncoding RNAs) represent 87 unique genes of which 61 possess gene ontology annotations. Of these, 21 are nuclear components as compared to 5509 of 31046 in the genome as a whole, revealing a statistically significant enrichment of nuclear genes in this sample set (P = 0.0309). The biological significance of this finding is unclear but may reflect translation of these proteins either within the nucleus or within the perinuclear space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which may have copurified with the nuclear fraction.</p><p>Of the 3 noncoding transcripts identified, <italic>XIST </italic>is the most consistently nuclear-enriched ncRNA identified by this screen, as the six probes to it are enriched 7.8 to 11.3-fold in the nuclear fraction. Probes to two autosomal apparently noncoding RNA loci are also comparably nuclear enriched in both cell lines. We named these two loci <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2</italic>, to reflect their status as nuclear enriched, abundant transcripts and their clustering within the genome (see below). Four probes to the first locus, <italic>NEAT1</italic>, are nuclear enriched from 2.1 to 25.6-fold in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts and four different probes to the <italic>NEAT2 </italic>locus show nuclear enrichment from 2.2 to 7.4-fold in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2 </italic>were also as abundant as <italic>XIST </italic>as their probes showed a similar range of intensities as <italic>XIST </italic>probes.</p></sec><sec><title>Two noncoding RNAs enriched in the nuclei of human cells</title><p>Genomic alignment, along with Northern blot and Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) analyses, defines the two NEAT transcripts as unique loci, separated by less than 60 kb on chromosome 11q13.1 of humans with no apparent intervening genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The genomic proximity of these two transcripts is striking, given that the human genome is roughly 3000 Mb and the probability of an unbiased screen returning two genes located side by side is less than 1 in 30,000. Transcription within the <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2 </italic>loci has previously been described but not fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Notably, there is no significant homology between the <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2 </italic>loci (see below).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>NEAT1 </italic>is a large, infrequently spliced RNA</title><p>Our detailed molecular analysis by 5'-RLM/3'-RACE and cDNA sequencing indicates that the primary transcript from the NEAT1 locus is a predominantly unspliced, 3.7 kb, poly(A) ncRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> &#x00026; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) (sequence deposited in Genbank as <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF177379">EF177379</ext-link>). Northern blot analysis suggests a transcript ~4 kb in length with broad expression and highest levels in the ovary, prostate, colon and pancreas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). While this blot provided clear evidence of a widely expressed 4 kb transcript, transcripts above 9 kb in length may not have transferred efficiently to the membrane. A larger poly(A) transcript (&#x0003e;17 kb) (AF001892 and AF001893) with an overlapping 5' end is also suggested by other, less precise Northern data (data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). The size of this transcript is difficult to define, due likely to a combination of transcript heterogeneity and the difficulty of detecting large RNAs on Northern blots. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis suggests that this large transcript is expressed at significantly lower levels than the ~4 kb transcript (data not shown). While a small (&#x0003c;500 bases) cDNA clone, trophoblast-derived noncoding RNA (<italic>TncRNA</italic>), mapping to the 3' end of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>(~4 kb transcript) has also been described, it is exclusively expressed in trophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our results indicate the existence of at least two unique isoforms of <italic>NEAT1</italic>: a widely expressed, abundant 4 kb transcript and a much larger (&#x0003e; 17 kb), less common transcript sharing a transcriptional start site, based on 5'-RLM-RACE and Northern analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>NEAT2 </italic>is a large, infrequently spliced RNA</title><p>Previously, a transcript in the <italic>NEAT2 </italic>region was partially described in a screen for genes overexpressed in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and given the name Metastasis Associated in Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (<italic>MALAT-1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While <italic>MALAT-1 </italic>was initially defined as a cluster of ESTs more than 8 kb in length, our more precise 5'-RLM/3'-RACE studies of the <italic>NEAT2 </italic>locus show a slightly different sequence for the transcript which more closely matches the current database of ESTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) (sequence deposited in Genbank as <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF177381">EF177381</ext-link>). As the functional relevance of this transcript to metastatic potential awaits further analysis, we will refer to this transcript as <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>.</p><p>The vast majority of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is present in the cell in an unspliced form (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Like <italic>NEAT1</italic>, <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>shows broad tissue expression, with highest expression in the ovaries, prostate and colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), but unlike <italic>NEAT1</italic>, not the pancreas. Importantly, neither transcript (spliced or unspliced) has an open reading frame (ORF) of significant size. Despite the presence of antisense transcripts in the genomic annotation of the NEAT cluster, we detect no antisense transcription at either NEAT locus in GM00131 cells, HeLa cells or in the undifferentiated female human embryonic stem cell line H9 (NIH code WA09) by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern analysis (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative genomic analysis of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2</italic></title><p>The presence of two highly conserved areas within <italic>NEAT1</italic>, along with genomic synteny, facilitated the discovery of the mouse homolog of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>on chromosome 19 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Detailed molecular analysis suggests that mouse <italic>Neat1 </italic>is a ~3.2 kb transcript with no significant ORFs (sequence deposited in Genbank as <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF177378">EF177378</ext-link>). Unlike human <italic>NEAT1</italic>, quantitative RT-PCR analysis does not detect any larger transcripts from the locus (data not shown). Moreover, the only sequence conservation between mouse and human is within this 3.2 kb transcript.</p><p>The mouse <italic>Neat2 </italic>locus is located approximately 40 kb from mouse <italic>Neat1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As with human <italic>NEAT1</italic>, murine <italic>Neat1 </italic>has no significant ORFs. While mouse <italic>Malat-1 </italic>was originally described as a series of overlapping ESTs homologous to human <italic>MALAT-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we have delineated the transcript from the mouse <italic>Neat2 </italic>locus by Northern analysis and 5'-RLM/3'-RACE (sequence deposited in Genbank as <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF177380">EF177380</ext-link>). Taken together, these data indicate that the mouse <italic>Neat2/Malat-1 </italic>transcript is ~7 kb, with broad tissue expression. Like human <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>, mouse <italic>Neat2/Malat-1 </italic>has no significant ORFs.</p><p>To the extent that tissues overlap between blots, mouse <italic>Neat1 </italic>and <italic>Neat2/Malat-1 </italic>show similarly broad expression to human <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>, with highest levels in ovary, kidney, lung and thymus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Significantly, while the sequence of both transcripts is conserved within the mammalian lineage, this conservation does not extend to any ORFs.</p><p><italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is exceptionally conserved, considering that noncoding RNAs typically have less evolutionary constraints placed on their primary sequence than protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In particular, where insertions and deletions often disrupt ORFs by frame-shift mutations, noncoding RNAs are likely more tolerant of such changes, provided that they do not interfere with secondary structure or function. <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>does not contain the series of expanded repeats that are seen in <italic>XIST </italic>([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), suggesting that perhaps <italic>NEAT2NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is less tolerant of such changes than <italic>XIST</italic>. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is conserved within multiple mammalian species, yet no <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>homologs were identified in any non-mammalian species. The presence of a <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>homolog in the non-eutherian opossum, <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>, together with the apparent absence of the transcript in non-mammalian species suggests that <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is specific to the mammalian lineage. The strikingly high level of conservation of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>within mammals suggests multiple constraints on its sequence. Like the conservation of other noncoding elements within the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], this conservation awaits explanation through further analysis.</p><p><italic>NEAT1 </italic>does not share the broad conservation seen for <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>between human and mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Two small segments of the transcript are, however, conserved between humans and mice. Strikingly, the region most conserved between mouse and human <italic>NEAT1 </italic>is also the most conserved region between human <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT1 </italic>of dogs, rats, and cows (data not shown). Interestingly, <italic>NEAT1 </italic>is present on two different dog chromosomes, only one of which is clustered with the sole dog <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>. Lack of synteny surrounding the <italic>NEAT1 </italic>paralogs suggests that a large-scale duplication within the dog lineage does not explain this event. Like <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>, no non-mammalian homologs of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>were identified. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>NEAT1 </italic>may be eutherian specific, due to gaps in the opossum genome around the putative NEAT cluster. As previously noted, dot plot analyses reveal that despite the genomic proximity of the <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2 </italic>loci, their transcripts show no significant homology to each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><p>The identification of mouse homologs of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>allowed us to examine nuclear enrichment data from the Mouse Transcriptome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This dataset was generated using Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), a technique which involves the sequencing based quantification of over 2 million short ESTs per sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. EST populations of nuclear and post-nuclear subcellular fractionations were examined in the male mouse cell line BLK CL.4 and male mouse liver tissue. In both the BLK CL.4 cell line and mouse liver, both <italic>Neat1 </italic>and <italic>Neat2/Malat-1 </italic>were both more than ten-fold enriched in nuclear fractions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Only four other transcripts (all of which are ORF genes) show nuclear enrichment levels similar to <italic>Neat1 </italic>and <italic>Neat2/Malat-1</italic>. These protein coding transcripts may be, like those seen in our microarray screen, regulated by various post-transcriptional mechanisms which result in their nuclear retention. Two-hundred and fifteen unique mouse genes were more than 2 fold enriched in both BLK CL.4 and liver nuclei (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) and of these 174 had gene ontology annotations. Similar to our human studies, of these annotated genes, 60 were nuclear components as compared to 5302 of 17217 genes in the murine genome as a whole, revealing a statistically significant enrichment of nuclear genes in this sample set (P = 0.00056). As noted above, this may reflect nuclear or perinuclear translation of these transcripts and copurification of the perinuclear component with the nuclear fraction.

Both these transcripts are abundant and easily detectable.

In some cells, these foci have a more restricted distribution, showing polarity in two regions of many cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These <italic>NEAT1 </italic>RNA foci show sharply defined borders and little nucleoplasmic signal.

The mouse cell lines examined show a mixed distribution: many cells have <italic>Neat2/Malat-1 </italic>RNA concentrated in domains, while other cells in the same population have only strong nucleoplasmic signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><p>Early G1 daughter cells show two sites of transcription for both <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I</xref>) and simultaneous gene/RNA localization (not shown) indicates they are both biallelically expressed.

Our initial analyses indicate that the domain distribution of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA is similar to nuclear structures called SC35 splicing domains. As previously discussed, these structures are enriched in poly(A) RNA and factors involved in processing, splicing and export of mRNA. Many snRNAs concentrate within these domains and several individual mRNAs have been shown to enter the domains with which their genes associate upon transcription. However, while hypothesized for many years, no specific large poly(A) species, coding or noncoding, has been shown to be a component of all domains. We asked whether <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>was a component of these domains by performing RNA FISH in combination with immunohistochemical labeling with an antibody to SC35 in human cells and SRM-300 in mouse cells. Strikingly, in interphase cells with the typical domain pattern, <italic>NEAT2</italic>/<italic>Neat2 </italic>RNA is found in every SC35/SRM-300 domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). While <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA is clearly a component of these domains, there is not precise overlap: <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA tends to concentrate more in the center of the domain but also defines a larger domain than either SC35 or SRM-300 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). SC35 was previously shown to form a smaller inner core within a larger domain defined by poly(A) RNA and Sm-defined speckles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>We next colocalized <italic>NEAT1/Neat1 </italic>RNA with SC35/SRM-300 in mouse and human cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). Unsurprisingly, given their localization relative to <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>foci, <italic>NEAT1 </italic>foci predominantly border the domains, with multiple foci oftentimes encircling a single domain, especially in human cells.</p><p>As it has been speculated that a structural poly(A) RNA may be at the core of SC35 domains we first compared the distribution of poly(A) RNA and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA in mouse and human cells. These analyses revealed that poly(A) RNA and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>transcripts were completely coincident in nuclear domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Immediately after mitosis there is a short window of time in which the SC35 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>) and poly(A) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I</xref>) domains are clearly reformed, but <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA only overlaps the domains close to its transcription site. Shortly after in G1, <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>quickly distributes to all domains. These results show that while <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA is a component of SC35 domains in most cells, it is not necessary for their formation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In a microarray screen for nuclear, polyadenylated noncoding RNAs, we identified three abundant transcripts with significant nuclear retention: the canonical ncRNA, <italic>XIST</italic>, and two large noncoding loci on human chromosome 11. We show that these two ncRNAs are differentially expressed in a wide range of tissues in human and mouse and localize to specific subnuclear domains that have been the subject of much interest in relation to mRNA metabolism.</p><p>Our rationale for examining the nucleus for enriched poly(A) transcripts was prompted by two areas of research. First, the chromosome-wide regulation of monoallelically expressed genes (a potential autosomal analog of X inactivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] suggests that there may be regulatory RNAs similar to <italic>XIST </italic>that interact with specific autosomes. Second, earlier biochemical studies indicated that there is a substantial population of heterogeneous nuclear RNA that does not give rise to cytoplasmic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and it has long been suggested that this nuclear-retained RNA may provide insights into nuclear structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Recent genomic studies have identified a large number of putative ncRNAs based on analysis of ESTs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), however these approaches provide little insight into the biology of the many RNAs identified. Here we used a unique approach to identify poly(A) ncRNAs that met specific criteria of abundance and, most importantly, nuclear enrichment. Using Affymetrix arrays to compare the expression levels of over 39,000 transcripts in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions from two human cell-types, we identified transcripts from two loci, which like <italic>XIST </italic>are significantly enriched in the nucleus. These two loci are located less than 70 kb apart, yet represent two different genes with no homology to each other. <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>are conserved within the mammalian lineage, yet neither contains conserved open reading frames. While <italic>NEAT1 </italic>contains two segments of high conservation, the ~8 kb sequence of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is highly conserved without insertions or deletions. This high level of conservation is particularly striking in light of the relative lack of conservation typically seen for large ncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In fact, <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>appears to be more conserved than the canonical noncoding RNA <italic>XIST</italic>. While there are reports of both a larger, less abundant transcript and of a much smaller trophoblast specific transcript (TncRNA) that map to the human <italic>NEAT1 </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], both of these transcripts lie outside any region of conservation. Both human and mouse homologs of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>show broad, differential expression patterns across many different tissues. Further, in both organisms, of the over 39,000 transcripts examined in human and the over 79,000 transcripts examined in mice, <italic>NEAT1</italic>/<italic>Neat1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2</italic>/<italic>Neat2 </italic>are among the most nuclear enriched poly(A) transcripts in multiple cell lines. Taken together, these findings of high conservation, broad expression and nuclear enrichment strongly suggest that <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>have important functional roles within the mammalian nucleus.</p><p>The subnuclear distribution of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA provides immediate insights into its function. The broad distribution of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA clearly indicates that it is not involved in chromatin regulation of its parent chromosome. SC35 splicing domains (or speckles) are essentially universal components of the nuclei in higher eukaryotes. A number of specific protein coding genes have been identified which preferentially localize to the periphery of an SC35 domain in each cell, and for several of these their transcripts localize within those particular domains (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). These domains concentrate numerous splicing factors, SR proteins, poly(A) RNA and mRNA export factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The concentration of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA in these domains thus strongly suggests it has a function related to pre-mRNA metabolism.</p><p>As previously mentioned, a large pool of polyadenylated (poly(A)) RNA localizes to each domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the identity of this poly(A) component has implications for the function of these structures. While it has long been speculated that some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or possibly all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] of the poly(A) RNA in these regions may comprise a long-lived structural RNA, the poly(A) component of these domains might also be a heterogeneous mixture of pre-mRNA or mature RNA transcripts at their sites of maturation. While this latter condition would indicate that SC35 domains function as active sites of RNA processing and export, if this poly(A) component is composed of a small number of structural noncoding RNAs, this might instead suggest that SC35 domains function as storage sites for splicing factors. Importantly, such stable localization of ncRNAs to these domains could not only indicate a role for ncRNA in establishing the structure of SC35 domains but might also indicate that these ncRNAs contribute to the function of pre-existing domains either through their own enzymatic activity or by targeting specific proteins or RNAs to those domains.</p><p>While SC35 domains contain high concentrations of snRNAs, no large poly(A) RNA has been previously identified as a component of these domains. The presence of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>in these regions is thus of substantial interest. Since <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>exhibits a pan-localization to every SC35 domain in most cells, we surmised that it may serve as a structural scaffold involved in the initial formation of these domains. However, our observations in early post-mitotic daughter cells argue against such an interpretation: domains in these cells clearly contain SC35 and poly(A) RNA, whereas <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA is localized to just two sites of transcription. Thus, while <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA may be a component of the poly(A) RNA in these domains, it does not account for all of it, consistent with evidence of other poly(A) pre-mRNAs in these regions. This does not rule out a later structural role for <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>, but suggests it is more likely important for the function of pre-existing domains, rather than establishing the initial structure of these domains.</p><p>The identity of this remaining poly(A) signal present at the formation of SC35 domains is not known but is suggested by our studies. Insight into the nature of this RNA can be derived from the fact that no other poly(A) transcripts were identified as nuclear enriched in our analyses of the human and mouse transcriptomes. Given the nature of our study, we would have expected to find any highly expressed, nuclear retained, long ncRNAs which act in the formation of SC35 domains. Thus, our results suggest that the remaining poly(A) population present at the formation of SC35 domains is either short, poorly expressed, heterogeneous in nature, or not nuclear retained.</p><p>Our results indicate that there are at least two distinct populations of poly(A) RNA within SC35 domains. <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>is highly expressed and present in all mature SC35 domains, whereas the examination of nascent SC35 domains indicates the existence of a second population of other poly(A) RNAs. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the exact extent to which <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>RNA contributes to the overall poly(A) RNA signal in SC35 domains. However, if <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>comprises the bulk of the poly(A) component of SC35 domains its properties might obscure the properties of the remaining poly(A) signal. Thus, while many studies have made general observations concerning the properties of the bulk poly(A) component of SC35 domains, our results caution against over interpretation of these results. Directed study of <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>should help place these earlier observations in a clearer context.</p><p>The finding that <italic>NEAT1 </italic>RNA clusters typically localize at the edges of SC35 domains, regions known to be enriched in active genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], suggests a possible relationship of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>to pre-mRNA metabolism, however, in this case the implication is less clear. The observation that <italic>NEAT1 </italic>foci are often limited to certain nuclear regions does not appear to reflect a confinement to its parent chromosome, but likely reflects an affinity for other nuclear structures of limited mobility. Studies examining the relationship of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>RNA to other nuclear structures are ongoing (Clemson et al., in preparation), and preliminarily indicate that <italic>NEAT1 </italic>foci may have a complex relationship to a subset of paraspeckles, nuclear compartments which localize to the edge of speckles and contain components involved in adenosine to inosine substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>The overexpression of a transcript at the human <italic>NEAT2 </italic>locus, <italic>MALAT-1</italic>, has been associated with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] but whether this is causative or merely correlative has not been established. Supporting our results, during the preparation of this manuscript the overexpression of a transcript corresponding to murine <italic>Neat1 </italic>termed <italic>Vinc </italic>(Virus-inducible noncoding RNA) was described in rabies infection and shown to be nuclear enriched in mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To reflect its enrichment in the nucleus of many different cell types in different organisms and its homology to human NEAT1, we refer to the <italic>Neat1</italic>/<italic>Vinc </italic>transcript as <italic>Neat1</italic>. Given their broad expression and localization in ubiquitous nuclear structures, any dissection of the function of <italic>NEAT1</italic>/<italic>Vinc </italic>and <italic>NEAT2</italic>/<italic>MALAT-1 </italic>will require the examination of these RNAs in the context of a variety of cell types and conditions.</p><p>Aside from its utility in identifying two unique nuclear localized noncoding RNAs, the data from our screens yields other intriguing results when examined as a whole. For instance, our screens reveal the nuclear enrichment of RNA species that code for proteins with known nuclear localization patterns. Such enrichment may be indicative of nuclear translation, or translation of these proteins in the perinuclear space. Additionally, these studies identified several intronic probes in the Affymetrix dataset (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). As these probes are all transcribed from the same strand as the gene within which they reside and there is no reported bias for intronic genes to be transcribed in the same direction as the overlapping transcript, it appears that these probes detect intronic RNA rather than novel genes. This grouping of intronic probes might be of use in some interesting large scale splicing analyses. For instance, given that many of these intronic probes have corresponding exonic probes also represented in the U133A and B chipsets, analysis of existing Gene Expression Omnibus datasets for changes in the relative representation of these probes across samples might uncover conditions, cell types, or genetic backgrounds which display differential patterns of RNA splicing with respect to these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species suggest that there are no more than three abundant large non-coding polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus; the canonical large noncoding RNA <italic>XIST, NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1</italic>. A function for <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>in mRNA metabolism is suggested by their high levels of conservation and their intimate association with SC35 splicing domains in multiple mammalian species. We have taken advantage of the power of genome-scale expression analysis and publicly available transcriptome data to study the subcellular localization of RNA species. By these broad approaches we have precisely identified noncoding RNA components of an enigmatic nuclear structure. The identification of specific poly(A) RNA species within SC35 domains should greatly facilitate the functional dissection of these domains. Further cytological analyses of the relationship of <italic>NEAT1 </italic>and <italic>NEAT2/MALAT-1 </italic>to pre-mRNA metabolism and specific nuclear structures is ongoing. Inhibition of these RNAs, through knockout or RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), may yield further clues as to their role in nuclear architecture or cell function and may ultimately facilitate the functional dissection of the nuclear structures with which they associate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subcellular fractionation of RNA and array analysis</title><p>WI-38 primary human fibroblasts (ATCC) and human EBV-transformed human lymphoblasts, GM00131 (Coriell) were grown under normal conditions.

All transcripts run 5' to 3' from left to right. Transcripts represented in green (<italic>NEAT1</italic>, <italic>NEAT2</italic>, <italic>Neat1 </italic>and <italic>Neat2</italic>) were characterized by Northern analysis, 5'RLM-RACE and 3' RACE.

The 3' end of this larger transcript is drawn fading to represent that while its location is suggested by AF001893 (Guru et al., 1997) and our own Northern analyses (data not shown), we were unable to fully map its 3' end by RACE, most likely due to a series of genomic poly(A) repeats throughout the transcript. Transcripts in black were previously described to various levels by EST walking, Northern and RACE analysis.
