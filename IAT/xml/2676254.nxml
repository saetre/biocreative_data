It is becoming increasingly well appreciated that changes in the function and expression of GLT-1 and GLAST occur under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here we investigated the plasticity in expression of GLT-1 and GLAST in the spinal dorsal horn using immunohistochemistry following partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) in rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Animals were confirmed to develop hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation by 7 days following PSNL. Baseline expression of GLT-1 and GLAST in naive animals was only observed in astrocytes and not in either microglia or neurons. Microglia and astrocytes showed evidence of reactivity to the nerve injury when assessed at 7 and 14 days following PSNL evidenced by increased expression of OX-42 and GFAP, respectively. In contrast, the total level of GLT-1 and GLAST protein decreased at both 7 and 14 days after PSNL. Importantly, the cellular location of GLT-1 and GLAST was also altered in response to nerve injury. Whereas activated astrocytes showed a marked decrease in expression of GLT-1 and GLAST, activated microglia showed <italic>de novo </italic>expression of GLT-1 and GLAST at 7 days after PSNL and this was maintained through day 14. Neurons showed no expression of GLT-1 or GLAST at any time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that the expression of glutamate transporters in astrocytes and microglia are differentially regulated following nerve injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), including the spinal dorsal horn[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been implicated in the generation and maintenance of hypersensitivity after tissue inflammation and injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, and acts on glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and metabotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in cation influx and depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Excessive glutamate results in an overload of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx that can result in excitotoxicity and ultimately death of neurons. Inhibitory interneurons have been suggested as particularly vulnerable to excitotoxic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The concentration of extracellular glutamate is tightly regulated by a family of high affinity Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate transporters in the cytoplasmic membrane of glial cells and to lesser extent in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A total of five glutamate transporters have been cloned and characterized. Among these, GLT-1 and GLAST are the major glutamate transporters in the CNS, and are mainly expressed in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Astrocytes metabolize the sequestered glutamate to glutamine using the enzyme glutamine synthetase and shuttle the newly synthesized glutamine back into neurons where it can be reconverted to glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating data indicate that dysfunction in glutamate transport produces marked changes in spinal processing of nociceptive inputs. Inhibition of glutamate transporters causes an elevation in spinal extracellular glutamate concentrations and produces spontaneous nociceptive behaviors and hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Deficiency and down-regulation of GLT-1 or GLAST in the spinal dorsal horn has been associated with the development of neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It remains unclear however, whether transporter expression and function are differentially regulated in different spinal cell types. This issue was explored in this study by examination of changes in the expression and cellular localization of GLT-1 and GLAST in the spinal dorsal horn over time following partial sciatic nerve ligation (PNSL).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Behavioral Findings</title><p>Consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the paw ipsilateral to the PSNL developed significant mechanical hypersensitivity as compared to the control side and to control rats.

Staining of GLT-1 and GLAST was found in the spinal dorsal horn at baseline. GLT-1 and GLAST were not co-localized with the microglia marker OX-42 or the neuron marker NeuN at baseline, but rather only in cells positive for the astrocyte marker GFAP. This suggests that the expression of GLT-1 and GLAST under normal conditions in the spinal dorsal horn primarily originates in astrocytes. This conclusion is consistent with reports on the distribution of GLT-1 and GLAST in hippocampus and cerebellum where the transporters were found to be in astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Nerve injury was found to result in a decrease in the total amount of GLT-1 and GLAST at 7 and 14 days after PSNL. The clear implication from the double-labeling study is that the synthesis of the transporters is down-regulated in astrocytes after PSNL. This result is consistent with other reports. For example, the total amount of GLT-1 decreased after facial nerve axotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and with spinal nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Another line of investigation has shown that glutamate uptake is attenuated in spinal dorsal in rat after complete spinal nerve ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Decreases in GLT-1 and GLAST transporters and an ensuing accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is consistent with neurophysiological studies of spinal neurons following nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] wherein an excess of afterdischarges was noted as a cardinal feature. Conversely, gene transfer of GLT-1 into spinal cord attenuates inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]</p><p>Evidence of activation of spinal glia cells shown here by the increases in GFAP and OX-42 staining density is also consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. An important implication from this work is that activated astrocytes evidently shift homeostatic functions upon exposure to nerve injury and part of this shift involves decreased regulation of synaptic functions evidenced by down-regulation of glutamate transporters. The mechanism by which astrocytes become activated remains an area of needed investigation. Potential signals may include central release of fractalkine or other growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Activation of spinal astrocytes appears to coincide with the initiation of re-growth of injured axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which suggests that perhaps the shift in astrocyte function is to support the growth of central axons of primary afferent fibers that are in the process of re-generating across the lesion site. Evidence to support this possibility is that growth related antigens such as growth associated protein-43 and endogenous lectin RL-29 show peaks in the dorsal horn at the same time points where peaks in re-generating axons are found in injured nerve roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>A novel finding from this work is the observation that PNSL-activated microglia initiate a new expression of GLT-1 and GLAST. In agreement with this observation, GLT-1 was observed as newly expressed in scattered microglia in an astrocyte-neuron culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This finding suggests that as astrocytes shift to support re-growth and the establishment of re-connectivity, that microglia assumes the role of regulating synaptic function.</p><p>Finally, no expression or change in expression of GLT-1 or GLAST was observed in neurons. The expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 was not explored here. Hence the potential for plasticity in this expression remains open to investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper provides evidence that not only the expression but also the cellular localization of the glutamate transporters changed following PSNL. Under baseline physiological conditions, the expression of GLT-1 and GLAST in the spinal dorsal horn is confined to astrocytes. After PSNL, spinal glial cells show evidence of activation, the expression of GLT-1 and GLAST are decreased, and the decreases occur in the astrocytes. Microglia activated following PSNL initiate a new expression of GLT-1 and GLAST.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>A total of 46 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180&#x02013;220 g were used.

The stained sections were then examined with a Nikon E600 (Nikon Instech Co, Japan) fluorescence microscope and images were captured with a CCD spot camera.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The relative intensity of GLT-1-IR and GLAST-IR per section was measured in the spinal dorsal horn using a computerized image analysis system (NIS-Elements, BR 2.30). An optic threshold was set above background level firstly to identify positively stained structures. Relative intensity values used for comparison were calculated by multiplying the mean optic density in areas of interest and then subtracting out background staining (mean optic density * positive area &#x02013; value of background). In each rat, four to six sections of the spinal cord at each time point were selected randomly. An average percentage of GLT-1-IR, GLT-1 + OX-42-IR, GLT-1 + GFAP-IR, GLAST-IR, GLAST + OX-42-IR, and GLAST + GFAP-IR relative to the control group, was obtained for each animal across different time points, and then the mean &#x000b1; SE among the animals was determined. Four to eight rats were included for each group for quantification of the results. All measurements were performed by blinded evaluators. Data were compared with student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls tests. P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GLT-1: glutamate-aspartate transporter; GLAST: excitatory amino acid carrier-1; PSNL: partial sciatic nerve ligation; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate; AMPA: a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WJX carried out all the experiment and drafted the manuscript.
