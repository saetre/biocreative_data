There has been some success in identifying genetic factors underlying type 2 diabetes in some human populations (for example, calpain 10, <italic>PPARG</italic>, <italic>KCNJ11</italic>, <italic>TCF7L2</italic>, and <italic>ENPP1</italic>), and new whole-genome association studies are identifying further new candidates; however, many genes remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). One approach to identifying new genes is to use the mouse as a model. For example, using a combination of quantitative trait loci mapping and mutagenesis techniques, we recently identified a novel gene involved in insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p><p>Phenotype-driven <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screens have proven to be a powerful and efficient tool for the identification of novel models of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Mutations are introduced at a rate of &#x0223c;1/1,000 (one functional mutation at any one locus in 1,000 mice), and each founder mutagenized mouse carries &#x0223c;30 such mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). ENU is an alkylating agent that preferentially induces A/T to T/A transversion mutations at random across the genome; these point mutations can create a variety of alleles, including hypomorphs, hypermorphs, and loss or gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Thus, ENU could be used to introduce mutations into potentially any gene in the genome that can be mutated to give rise to diabetes or diabetes-related traits such as glucose intolerance. As an example, new ENU-induced dominant mutations in the key metabolic enzyme glucokinase (maturity onset diabetes of the young 2 &#x0005b;MODY2&#x0005d;) have recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) from large-scale dominant ENU mutagenesis screens. Br&#x000fc;ning et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>) showed that double heterozygotes of null alleles of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 led to the development of overt diabetes in &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of animals in contrast to single heterozygotes. Diabetes development was dependent on genetic background with C57BL/6J showing &#x0223c;85&#x00025; transition to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). We therefore decided to sensitize our ENU mutagenesis screen by using mice heterozygous for an insulin receptor knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>) maintained on a C57BL/6J background, which exhibits mild insulin resistance but not diabetes. Here, we describe two ENU-induced mutations in the transcription factor <italic>Sox4</italic> that result in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release leading to a mild impairment in glucose tolerance, and we also show that one of these in combination with haploinsufficiency of the insulin receptor and associated insulin resistance provide a novel digenic model that may have relevance to the study of polygenic type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The SRY-related high mobility group (HMG)-box (SOX) gene family is a group of important transcriptional regulators of a number of developmental processes, including the development of the endocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Mice homozygous for a null mutation of <italic>Sox4</italic> showed abnormal pancreatic bud formation and endocrine cell differentiation, and cultured pancreatic explants failed to form normal islets. In wild-type animals, levels of <italic>Sox4</italic> expression peaked at embryonic day 13 and persisted at high levels in adult islets. No role has yet been elucidated for <italic>Sox4</italic> in the adult pancreas.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal husbandry.</title><p>Mice were kept in accordance with U.K. Home Office welfare guidelines and project license restrictions.

Upon regaining fertility, they were mated with C3H/HeH females, and up to 50 F1 offspring per male were generated. A total of 789 male F1 offspring heterozygous for the insulin receptor knockout mutation were assayed for glucose tolerance at 12 and 24 weeks of age by IPGTT. Fourteen male mice were identified with impaired glucose tolerance and were tested for inheritance of the phenotype by backcrossing to C3H/HeH females (impaired glucose tolerance &#x0005b;IGT&#x0005d; lines 1&#x02013;14). Five phenotypes were confirmed as inherited in the first backcross generation (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping line IGT4 and identification of a mutation.</title><p>One of the lines clearly associated with an impaired glucose tolerance phenotype was IGT4. The causative mutation was initially mapped to chromosome 13 using 16 backcross animals and a panel of 140 microsatellite markers. An additional 67 second-backcross animals refined the candidate region to 5.4 Mb (25.9&#x02013;31.3 Mbp). Analysis of the candidate region using the Ensembl database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/index.html</ext-link> Build 27) identified 39 genes, including a large cluster of prolactin-like genes that were excluded from analysis because they are unlikely candidates for a glucose tolerance phenotype. The remaining eight genes were sequenced in the F1 founder mouse to identify the ENU-induced causative mutation. A single A to G mutation was found at nucleotide position 1,025 (A1025G), resulting in a tyrosine to cysteine substitution at amino acid 123 (Y123C), which lies in the highly conserved HMG-binding domain of the transcription factor <italic>Sox4</italic> (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sox4</italic> homozygous mutant mice have an embryonic-lethal phenotype.</title><p>Embryos homozygous for the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation die in utero at 14.5 dpc.

We therefore decided to test whether the two mutations complement each other by breeding compound heterozygotes. We found that Y123C/S70P mice exhibit the same embryonic phenotype as the homozygotes for either mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We also tested the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation by breeding it <italic>in trans</italic> with a deletion that spans the <italic>Sox4</italic> gene (<italic>Del(13)Svea36H</italic>) and again observed embryonic lethality indistinguishable from that of the two homozygous S<italic>ox4</italic> mutants. The Mud91 <italic>Sox4</italic> S70P allele <italic>in trans</italic> with a deletion that spans the <italic>Sox4</italic> gene (<italic>Del</italic>(<italic>13</italic>)<italic>Svea36H</italic>) was previously shown to be embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p><p>To further ascertain the nature of the IGT4 cardiac phenotype, we analyzed IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C/<italic>Del</italic>(<italic>13</italic>)<italic>Svea36H</italic> embryos at 14.5 dpc by micro-MRI (&#x003bc;MRI). IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C/<italic>Del</italic>(<italic>13</italic>)<italic>Svea36H</italic> embryos showed external edema (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Cardiac defects observed by &#x003bc;MRI included an outlet ventricular septal defect, dysplastic atrioventricular valves, a double-outlet right ventricle, and a hypoplastic or interrupted aortic arch (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Of the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C/<italic>Del(13)Svea36H</italic> embryos, 60&#x00025; also showed a cleft palate, and on one occasion we found bilateral renal hypoplasia and bilateral hypoplasia of the thymus. Apart from a primum atrial septal defect, only found in the Mud91 <italic>Sox4</italic> S70P, these MRI results are consistent with the findings in embryos homozygous for Mud91 <italic>Sox4</italic> S70P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). The results are a phenocopy of the range of cardiac defects previously detected in the targeted allele of <italic>Sox4</italic>, but additionally we detected dysplastic atrioventricular valves that have not been described in the <italic>Sox4</italic> knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>).</p><p>The failure of these mutations to complement either each other or a deletion of the <italic>Sox4</italic> gene demonstrates that IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation affects gene function. Moreover, the fact that the mutation gives the same embryonic phenotype when <italic>in trans</italic> with a deletion suggests that IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation is a null.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sox4</italic> heterozygous mutant mice show impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion.</title><p>Glucose tolerance was assayed using an IPGTT with glucose measured at 0 min (T0), 60 min (T60), and 120 min (T120). Male mice heterozygous for both the insulin receptor knockout (insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) and the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutant allele exhibited impaired glucose tolerance in an IPGTT test at 12 weeks of age (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Glucose levels were significantly different from wild-type or insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates at all three time points examined (T0, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; T60, &#x02264;0.001; and T120, &#x02264;0.001). The existence of the Mud91 <italic>Sox4</italic> S70P allele allowed us to test whether a different <italic>Sox4</italic> mutation also affected glucose tolerance (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Inheritance of either of the <italic>Sox4</italic> mutant alleles (Y123C or S70P) alone and in the absence of the insulin receptor mutation increased glucose levels significantly compared with wild-type or insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates 60 min after glucose administration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with levels failing to return to normal levels in Y123C mice after 120 min (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Glucose intolerance observed in two independently derived alleles of <italic>Sox4</italic> confirms that the phenotype is caused by the identified mutations. In the case of the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation, the presence of the insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> significantly increased blood glucose concentrations in an IPGTT, demonstrating a sensitizing effect of the insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> knockout (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). To investigate whether there was a defect in insulin secretion that might account for the glucose intolerance, we measured insulin secretion for both <italic>Sox4</italic> alleles (Y123C or S70P). This was carried out in the absence of the insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mutation using a 30-min glucose tolerance test with blood samples taken and glucose and insulin levels measured at T0, T10, T20, and T30 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Both lines showed significantly elevated glucose levels (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) at T20 and T30 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and secreted significantly lower levels of insulin (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) in response to a glucose challenge compared with wild type at T10, T20, and T30 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>To further confirm a defect in insulin secretion, we measured glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets from mice carrying the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Basal insulin secretion was the same as wild-type littermate control islets. However, incubation in 20 mmol/l glucose stimulated significantly less insulin secretion from mutant compared with wild-type littermate islets (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Furthermore, the response to the sulfonylurea tolbutamide was also significantly impaired, but not to the same extent as observed in 20 mmol/l glucose (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). There was no significant difference in total insulin content between mutant and wild-type islets (Supplemental Fig. 1, available in the online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-0337">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-0337</ext-link>). Because tolbutamide closes ATP-sensitive K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) directly, this result suggests that the insulin secretory defect observed in <italic>Sox4</italic> heterozygous mutant mice lies downstream of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure. Insulin secretion in insulin receptor heterozygous controls was significantly higher at all points, consistent with increased in vivo insulin secretion (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Additionally, insulin receptor islets showed reduced total insulin content (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; Supplemental Fig. 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Sox4 heterozygous animals form normal islets.</title><p>Pancreatic sections from <italic>Sox4</italic>-heterozygous animals and wild-type littermates were examined for differences in both islet mass and architecture. There was no significant difference between wild-type and heterozygous IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mice in their percentage of islet areas (the percentage of a histological section identified as islet; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Histological staining showed no qualitative difference in islet architecture in terms of arrangement or relative numbers of &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, or &#x003b4;-cells (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy of islets from <italic>Sox4</italic>-heterozygous animals and wild-type littermates at 12 weeks of age showed no obvious differences (Supplemental Fig. 2). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of islet RNA showed an increase in <italic>Sox4</italic> expression that just reaches significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.045) and no difference in expression levels of a number of key &#x003b2;-cell target genes, including insulin (Supplemental Fig. 3).</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA knockdown of <italic>Sox4</italic> in INS1 cells.</title><p>To further validate the in vivo and isolated islet data, we investigated the effect of loss of <italic>Sox4</italic> gene expression in a rat insulin-secreting cell line INS1 using RNA interference (siRNA) to knock down the expression of the endogenous <italic>Sox4</italic> gene. INS1 cells were transfected with one of four siRNA duplexes: nonsense (negative control), Gck (positive control), or two different <italic>Sox4</italic>-specific siRNAs &#x0005b;Sox4(1) and Sox4(2)&#x0005d;). All siRNAs were tagged with Cy3 fluorescent dye to enable transfected cells to be easily detected. Gene-specific knockdown of the corresponding RNAs was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of <italic>Gck</italic> and <italic>Sox4</italic> mRNAs was abolished by siRNAs targeted against these genes, but neither was affected in INS1 cells transfected with nonsense siRNA (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Basal insulin secretion was the same for all transfected cells (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>), and siRNA knockdown had no effect on total insulin content compared with nonsense transfected cells (Supplemental Fig. 4). Nonsense siRNA-transfected INS1 cells responded to incubation in both 2 and 20 mmol/l glucose by secreting increasing amounts of insulin. In comparison, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at 2 and 20 mmol/l glucose was significantly reduced for both nonoverlapping <italic>Sox4</italic> siRNA duplexes and for the <italic>Gck</italic>-positive control compared with wild type (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). There was a significant reduction in insulin secretion from <italic>Sox4</italic> siRNA-transfected INS1 cells in response to tolbutamide compared with nonsense siRNA-transfected cells. This was not observed with <italic>Gck</italic>-transfected cells (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). These results resemble those found for isolated <italic>Sox4</italic> mutant islets (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These experiments have been repeated in the mouse insulinoma cell line Min6 with the same results (Supplemental Figs. 4&#x02013;6).</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular calcium measurements.</title><p>To further characterize the glucose-stimulated insulin secretory defect in <italic>Sox4</italic> siRNA-transfected INS1 cells, we measured changes in intracellular calcium concentration &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> in response to incubation in increasing glucose concentrations. In <italic>Sox4</italic> (duplexes 1 and 2), nonsense, and mock-transfected cells, glucose concentrations &#x0003e;2 mmol/l elicited a rise in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub>, and this was abolished, as expected, in cells transfected with <italic>Gck</italic> siRNA (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These data suggest that the secretory defect lies downstream of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, calcium influx that follows channel closure, and membrane depolarization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>Sox4</italic> is a transcription factor that is expressed in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Embryos null for <italic>Sox4</italic> show normal pancreatic bud formation and endocrine cell differentiation up to 12.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). However, after this stage, they failed to form normal islets, and there was a lack of proper expansion of the endocrine cell population and particularly of &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Breeding of compound heterozygotes (IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C and Mud91 <italic>Sox4</italic> S70P) and crossing both alleles with the chromosome deletion del36H confirms that both <italic>Sox4</italic> mutations, as predicted, affect the function of the protein. The observation of glucose intolerance in the two independent heterozygous ENU alleles also confirms that the ENU mutation accounts for the phenotype, and the likelihood of other ENU mutations being present within the mapped region is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). The role of <italic>Sox4</italic> in the adult islet is unknown.</p><p>Random ENU mutagenesis has proven to be an effective tool in the identification of novel mouse models of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). In our sensitized approach, which used a mouse knockout exhibiting insulin resistance but not diabetes and a sensitive phenotypic assay (IPGTT), we have successfully identified a novel mouse model for impaired glucose tolerance and cloned the underlying gene. Mice heterozygous for either ENU mutated allele of <italic>Sox4</italic> (Y123C or S70P) exhibited a statistically significant impairment in glucose tolerance at 12 weeks of age.</p><p>IPGTT testing of mice heterozygous for a null mutation of <italic>Sox4</italic> has been reported to have nonsignificant differences in glucose tolerance at the 30-min time point of the test; however, there was a clear trend of increased blood glucose concentrations in heterozygotes at all of the IPGTT time points after fasting shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). It should be noted that the genetic background of these mice is different. Furthermore, Wilson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>) carried out IPGTT tests using a 1 g/kg glucose challenge, lower than the 2 g/kg that we used, and this may have also contributed to the differences we observed.</p><p>Both ENU-induced mutations in <italic>Sox4</italic> (S70P and Y123C) were significantly glucose intolerant because of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin release was also observed in isolated islets from IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutant mice when compared with wild-type littermates. Knockdown of <italic>Sox4</italic> in insulinoma cells with two different siRNAs targeted to separate regions of the gene abolished glucose-stimulated insulin release, as did siRNA knockdown of the key metabolic enzyme Gck. Changes in &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> evoked by glucose, however, were normal in <italic>Sox4</italic> mutant cells, indicating that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels close normally. This suggests the insulin secretory defect lies downstream of calcium signal and may represent, for example, a defect in triggering exocytosis. Electron microscopy analysis, however, did not reveal any gross abnormalities in vesicles or their distribution.</p><p>Tolbutamide stimulates insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells by closing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the plasma membrane directly, leading to membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. This results in calcium influx and a rise in intracellular calcium (&#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub>) that triggers insulin release. We observed a significant reduction in tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion both in isolated mutant islets and in <italic>Sox4</italic> siRNA&#x02013;treated INS1 or Min6 cells compared with wild-type cells, consistent with a defect downstream of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. However, insulin secretion by mutant islets or siRNA-treated insulinoma cells was significantly more stimulated by tolbutamide than by 20 mmol/l glucose treatment (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 5). It is known that at higher tolbutamide concentrations, there is stimulation of insulin exocytosis by direct interaction with the secretory machinery independently of closure of the plasma membrane K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. This mechanism may explain why the inhibition of tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion by the <italic>Sox4</italic> mutation is not as strong as that observed for glucose alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p><p>The glucose intolerance caused by the IGT4 <italic>Sox4</italic> Y123C mutation is made worse by the presence of the heterozygous insulin receptor null mutation. This may in part be a contribution of insulin receptor haploinsufficiency to insulin resistance in key tissues, such as liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, that reduces glucose tolerance, further compounding lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, the insulin receptor is important in &#x003b2;-cell function, as shown by tissue-specific knockout of this gene that results in decreased acute insulin secretion and in impairment of glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Martinez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>) have shown that the transcription factor <italic>Foxo1</italic> is regulated in the &#x003b2;-cell by glucose but that this requires the insulin receptor. The <italic>Sox4</italic> mutations outlined in this work have an effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the absence of the insulin receptor heterozygous null mutation, so although we cannot rule out a sensitizing effect in the &#x003b2;-cell when the insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mutation is present, it is not a requirement for impairment. The IGT4 model in combination with insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> shows the effect of multiple mutations on glucose intolerance. This is important because it is thought that multiple variants in susceptibility genes contribute to impairment of glucose homeostasis in diabetes through the sum of multiple negative variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, insulin receptor<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> heterozygotes secrete more insulin and have lower isolated islet insulin content. This may reflect the higher levels of secretion as a result of insulin resistance.</p><p>Sox proteins are dependent on other transcription factors as partner proteins for efficient gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Specificity of Sox proteins are therefore reliant on different binding partners, which may explain the diverse roles in different tissues and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Elucidation of the binding partner of <italic>Sox4</italic> in adult islets may lead to the identification of the genes it regulates.</p><p>Sinner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) have recently reported that in colon carcinoma cells, there is an interaction between <italic>Sox4</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic> with &#x003b2;-catenin and <italic>TCF4</italic>. They propose a role for these Sox genes in regulating Wnt signaling. <italic>Sox4</italic> was shown to interact with either &#x003b2;-catenin or <italic>TCF4</italic>. In contrast, Sox17 bound cooperatively with both &#x003b2;-catenin and <italic>TCF4</italic>. It will be very interesting to determine whether these interactions are found in the &#x003b2;-cell, given the implication of <italic>TCF7L2</italic> and <italic>Wnt</italic> signaling in insulin secretion (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>).</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is a multifactorial disease resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors and develops as a result of both insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion. We have clearly demonstrated a role for <italic>Sox4</italic> in glucose-stimulated insulin release in adult pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and in causing mild but significant glucose intolerance. It will be important to assess whether <italic>Sox4</italic> has a role in contributing to type 2 diabetes in humans or to monogenic MODY type diabetes. Further characterization of the role of Sox4 in the adult &#x003b2;-cell will aid us in understanding the complex picture of transcriptional regulation in this important cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-0337_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-0337_supps.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>H.F. has received a studentship from the Medical Research Council.
