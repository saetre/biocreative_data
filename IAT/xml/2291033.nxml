In early embryos, the pioneer trunk vessels, the dorsal aorta and cardinal vein, develop from vascular endothelial cells derived from the lateral plate mesoderm through a process called vasculogenesis. Subsequently, blood vessels grow from existing vessels, through a process referred to as angiogenesis, into peripheral tissues and developing organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In developing embryos, increasing evidence has revealed that blood vessels also provide signals for the proper morphogenesis of developing organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the adult form of organisms, angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis to regrow blood vessels in wounded tissues is needed to repair damaged and replace lost tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In humans, it has been well documented that angiogenesis plays a vital role in tumor growth, and thus the potential of antiangiogenesis drugs to inhibit tumor growth has been extensively explored worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>During angiogenesis, vascular branching is one of the key morphogenetic events, which presumably is responsible for constructing a complex vascular network which assures that blood is available to every single cell. Despite its important role in sustaining organismic development throughout life, the genetic mechanism of blood vessel branching is largely unknown partly due to the intricate interactions between molecular signals and numerous cell types that are involved in angiogenesis, e.g., multiple cellular activities, including cell proliferation, migration, extension, and possibly cell fate specification all of which require signaling through multiple growth factors such as VEGF, FGF, PDGF, and EGF. Interactions between blood vessel endothelial cells and neighboring cells and even cells in the bloodstream can also regulate angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recently, it has been implied that immune-mediated cells and molecules can influence blood vessel growth in adults. For example, mast cells have been found to aggregate at sites of active angiogenesis under both physiological and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Histamine has been determined to be an angiogenic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and is thought to be directly involved in tumor growth based on findings of high expression levels and enzymatic activity of the key histamine synthesis enzyme, histidine decarboxylase, in numerous growing tumors, such as small-cell lung carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In fact, clinical trials have shown that histamine H2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine and ranitidine, increase the survival of gastric and colon cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has also been reported that histamine regulates angiogenesis at the level of cell proliferation and cell permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, histamine seems to be involved in multiple cellular and molecular interactions during angiogenesis. It is still unclear whether histamine can influence blood vessel branching during angiogenesis, and if it does, through which intracellular signaling pathway it works.</p><p>In this report, we took a chemical genetic approach to reveal the role of histamine in vascular branching using a zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation which causes specific vascular branching defects without affecting endothelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We show that vessel branching defects in <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants can be rescued by a high level of histamine either directly added to the water or by inhibiting histamine degradation using a histamine methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor. On the other hand, blocking histamine synthesis by a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor enhanced the <italic>reg6 </italic>vessel phenotypes. Finally, we show that the expression level of the egr-1 transcription factor, but not the VEGF family, is strongly correlated with the <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotypes, suggesting that histamine might modulate blood vessel branching by regulating egr-1 levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Specific blood vessel branching defect of the zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation</title><p>The zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation was isolated by its defects during caudal fin regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was previously shown that the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation causes blood vessel dilation during plexus formation of vessel regeneration due to defects in blood vessel branching, not in cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Herein, we further tested whether the <italic>reg6 </italic>vessel branching phenotype might be due to or might cause the cell migration defect by measuring the distance endothelial cells were able to migrate at different stages of blood vessel regeneration. Upon amputation, blood vessels undergo wound healing to seal the ends within the first 24 h followed by sprouting to reconnect the severed vessels and resume blood circulation at the amputation site. Blood vessel endothelial cells then proliferate and begin to migrate into the regenerating tissues to form a vascular plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found that regenerating endothelial cells in both wild-type and <italic>reg6 </italic>fish are able to migrate more than 0.35 mm within 2 days post amputation (dpa) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B, I</xref>) when the swollen vessel lumen phenotype has just begun to develop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, yellow arrows), suggesting that vessel dilation is not due to a cell migration defect. When the same fish were measured again at 3 dpa, we found that endothelial cells in <italic>reg6 </italic>fish had migrated more than 0.8 mm, which was similar to that in wild-type fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>) despite significantly swollen vessels having developed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, F</xref>, yellow arrows). Thus, the formation of swollen vessel lumina in <italic>reg6 </italic>fish does not seem to cause cell migration defects, at least up to 3 dpa. Cross-sections of <italic>reg6 </italic>regenerating fins revealed enlarged lumina in most of the regenerating vessels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, arrows).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Normal migration of regenerating endothelial cells in zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants</bold>.

In addition, while endothelial cells stretch thin and form tight junctions and intact enclosed blood vessels of different sizes in wild-type regenerating fins (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, E</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), <italic>reg6 </italic>endothelial cells did not appear as stretched-out as those in the wild-type and seldom formed obvious tight junction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, F</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Taken together, our current and previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] results suggest that <italic>reg6 </italic>function is specifically required for cell elongation and the formation of tight junctions between endothelial cells that are essential for blood vessel branching morphogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular defects of <italic>reg6 </italic>endothelial cells</bold>.

In wild-type embryos, the posterior cardinal vein branches to form a transient capillary plexus beginning at around 30 h post fertilization (hpf) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]), which is typically located ventral to the dorsal aorta in the tail and is comprised of 2 or 3 parallel yet interconnected vessels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F</xref>). In <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants, however, the caudal vein forms fewer branches and develops a large swollen vascular lumen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, D, G, H</xref>). The <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation is temperature sensitive causing up to 70% penetrance of its embryonic phenotypes at 33&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) and 0%~5% at 20&#x000b0;C (not shown). The temperature sensitivity of its regenerating vessel phenotype is described below (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Taking advantage of the incomplete penetrance of the <italic>reg6 </italic>embryonic phenotype, we initiated a screening to search for chemical suppressors and enhancers of <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation. We tested a small collection of known compounds using <italic>reg6</italic>-homozygous embryos (see "Methods"). Of the 560 tested chemicals, one showed significant suppression of <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotypes in developing caudal veins at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>). This chemical, 4-(N, N-dimethylamino) butylisothiourea dihydrochloride (SKF91488), is an inhibitor of HMT, the major enzyme responsible for histamine degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To test the specificity of SKF91488 on <italic>reg6 </italic>vessel phenotypes and its cytotoxicity to developing embryos, we treated <italic>reg6 </italic>and wild-type embryos with different concentrations of the compound. The results showed that suppression was dose-dependent, and the penetrance of the <italic>reg6 </italic>embryonic phenotype could be reduced to 20% by 50 &#x003bc;M SKF91488 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The HMT inhibitor caused no morphological defects or vessel over-branching in wild-type embryos at as high as 100 &#x003bc;M (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Embryonic phenotype of the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation</bold>.

The results showed that a high level of histamine indeed was able to rescue the embryonic phenotypes of <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants, although the concentration of histamine needed to produce significant suppression was 1000 &#x003bc;M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, green bars).

To further confirm the effect of histamine on <italic>reg6 </italic>vessel branching defects, we treated regenerating vessels of <italic>reg6 </italic>and wild-type adult fish with histamine and SKF91488. Consistent with the results obtained from embryos, the regenerated swollen vessel lumen phenotype in <italic>reg6 </italic>fish was both quantitatively and qualitatively suppressed by 10 &#x003bc;M SKF91488, as treated ones formed fewer and smaller blood blisters than their untreated siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). We then tested whether histamine can also rescue the <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotype in regenerating vessels. In fact, 1 mM histamine did suppress the <italic>reg6 </italic>regenerating vessel phenotype (data not shown).

But within the same inbred family, the penetrance was less variable (CC Huang, unpublished observations). Therefore, we were careful to use fish of the same stock for making comparisons.

In the distal portions of regenerating fins of <italic>reg6 </italic>adults, the vessel defects usually caused necrosis and degeneration, which were thus greatly reduced by histamine and SKF91488 (data not shown).

As stated before, the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation is temperature sensitive. At a low temperature (20&#x000b0;C), the number of swollen vessels in <italic>reg6 </italic>regenerates was nearly zero (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We treated <italic>reg6 </italic>regenerating vessels at this temperature with urocanic acid, one of the inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase which is the key enzyme for histamine synthesis.

We found no correlation between VEGF signaling and the <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotype, as the expression levels of zebrafish VEGF-A, C, and D, and VEGFR1, 2, and 3 were approximately the same in both wild-type and <italic>reg6 </italic>fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

These results suggest that histamine might promote blood vessel branching by regulating egr-1 expression directly or indirectly.

In particular, when using the embryonic phenotype for initial screening, which only required 0.5 &#x003bc;g of the test compound (with a MW of 250), the adult phenotypes, if they existed, allowed us to verify the drug effect with only 5 &#x003bc;g of drug for each test (see also "Methods"). In conjunction with <italic>TG(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup><italic>y</italic>1 </sup>transgenic fish, the screening could be specifically targeted for angiogenesis-related drugs (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). In addition, with zebrafish, we were able to perform toxicity tests at the same time at the whole organism level. All these factors make zebrafish a great tool for drug testing and discovery. The <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation is unique in that it is homozygously viable and displays similar blood vessel branching defects during embryogenesis and fin regeneration. More importantly, the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation has the advantage of temperature sensitivity which allowed us to screen for suppressors and enhancers. Since <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants display specific defects in blood vessel branching, it has become a good tool for studying the genetic and pharmacological mechanisms of vessel branching which are largely unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of histamine in blood vessel branching in <italic>reg6 </italic>and wild-type zebrafish</title><p>Our results reveal a role of histamine in promoting vessel branching during angiogenesis using zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants. The <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants were found to have specific defects in blood vessel branching during plexus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants were treated with the HMT inhibitor, SKF91488, which presumably causes accumulation of histamine, or with a high level of histamine, the blood vessel branching defect of <italic>reg6 </italic>was significantly rescued. In contrast, blocking histamine synthesis enhanced the <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotype. These results were further supported by the finding that HMT expression is elevated in <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants. All these suggest a simple model for the <italic>reg6 </italic>blood vessel branching defect which results from a high level of HMT and concomitant histamine deficit.</p><p>The role of histamine in regulating blood vessel branching is also observed in wild-type zebrafish. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, we showed that blocking histamine synthesis with urocanic acid causes blood vessel branching defect and/or a <italic>reg6</italic>-like phenotype in the caudal veins of wild-type zebrafish embryos. In this experiment, however, we learned that it really required high concentration and careful selection of time window of urocanic acid treatment in order to see its effect on blood vessel branching. Treatment of high concentration of urocanic acid for long period of time, e.g. from 6&#x02013;32 hpf caused high lethality rate in developing embryos suggesting that histamine is important for other developmental processes. Furthermore, we noted that urocanic acid did not seem to suppress the branching of intersegmental vessels, suggesting that the influence of histamine on vascular branching morphogenesis is selective or more sensitive for the plexus-forming blood vessels.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible mechanisms of regulating blood vessel branching by histamine</title><p>As vascular branching involves complex intracellular and extracellular changes, including breakdown of the extracellular matrix and intercellular junctions, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and induction of cell proliferation, it is difficult to predict the mechanism through which histamine rescues vessel branching defects in <italic>reg6 </italic>fish. Even though our phenotypic characterizations provide clues to the specific endothelial cellular defects underlying <italic>reg6 </italic>vascular defects, including defects in cell extension, cell junction formation, and likely permeability as well, it is still not possible at this moment to define a cellular mechanism for the rescue effect of histamine in <italic>reg6 </italic>fish due to the fact that the genetic identity of <italic>reg6 </italic>has yet to be resolved. We have mapped <italic>reg6 </italic>to the telomere region of LG 25 (CC Huang, unpublished results) where sequence information is largely lacking, and thus, it is difficult to obtain an accurate physical map. We are currently verifying a physical map of that region assembled by the Zebrafish Genome Sequencing Project at the Sanger Center with our <italic>reg6 </italic>mapping panels. We will need to build a more-accurate physical map of this region for future mapping and cloning of the <italic>reg6 </italic>gene.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have obtained more clues to <italic>reg6</italic>'s function from previous and the present studies. Our previous study showed that the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation does not cause over-proliferation of regenerating endothelial cells and that <italic>reg6 </italic>function is specifically required during plexus formation when blood vessel endothelial cells are actively branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we further showed that the <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation does not affect the migration of regenerating endothelial cells. Instead, endothelial cells of <italic>reg6 </italic>mutants seem to be defective in extending cell processes and forming cell junctions among themselves. Our results also suggest that <italic>reg6</italic>'s function might be involved in regulating histamine metabolism and egr-1 expression. Consistent with previous results, we observed no effect of histamine on endothelial cell proliferation or migration in wild-type fish, even though it has been shown that histamine is able to cause endothelial cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our studies using the zebrafish <italic>reg6 </italic>mutation provide evidence that histamine likely modulates blood vessel branching at a yet unidentified cellular level other than cell proliferation or migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation of egr-1 and the vessel branching defects of <italic>reg6</italic></title><p>It is very intriguing that we found a close relationship between the egr-1 transcription factor and <italic>reg6 </italic>phenotypes. The level of egr-1 was low in <italic>reg6 </italic>mutant fish during regenerative angiogenesis, was elevated by histamine and an HMT inhibitor, and was further reduced upon treatment with a histamine synthesis blocker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). Although the role of egr-1 and its relationship with histamine in vascular branching awaits further studies, we found an interesting feature of egr-1 in our studies that seem to echo previous finding. Fahmy et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] has shown that egr-1 is required for angiogenesis and tumor growth through an FGF but not a VEGF signaling pathway. Our QPCR analyses showed that the transcription levels of VEGFs and VEGFRs remained the same in wild-type and <italic>reg6 </italic>fish with or without histamine manipulations suggesting that the mechanism(s) of blood vessel branching mediated by histamine that involves egr-1 is independent of the VEGF signaling. It would be exciting to know whether histamine modulates blood vessel branching directly through egr-1 and/or a FGF pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct and indirect actions of histamine on blood vessel endothelial cells</title><p>Histamine has been shown to increase vessel permeability by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as VCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the composition of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Presumably, these actions together can promote vessel branching. Our result that histamine can prevent the formation of swollen vessel lumina suggests its influence on actively branching vascular cells. We also showed that histamine can reverse the swelling of vessels and return them to normal, suggesting a role of histamine during vascular plexus remodeling. One possible explanation for these results is that histamine affects a cellular mechanism that is common to both vascular activities, for example cell adhesion or extracellular matrix remodeling. In fact, the histamine receptor inhibitor, cimitidine, has been shown to downregulate the endothelial expression of E-selectin adhesion molecules and prevent tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which raises the possibility that histamine might directly modulate vessel branching on endothelial cells by regulating E-selectin expression. However, the fact that histamine does not change endothelial cell proliferation or cause over-branching or any other morphological changes in wild-type fish suggests that endothelial cells are not the direct target of histamine. Thus, it is possible that histamine might both directly and indirectly influence vascular branching.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate the power of using a zebrafish mutation in pharmacogenetic studies.
