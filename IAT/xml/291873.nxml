Although its transcriptional and post-translational regulation has been extensively studied, its regulation by interacting proteins is not well understood. To identify cellular proteins that associate with ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system with an adipocyte cDNA library. Using the N-terminal domain of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c as bait, we identified Twist2 (also known as Dermo-1), a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) protein, as a novel ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c interacting protein. Over-expression of Twist2 strongly repressed the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, primarily by reducing its binding to target sequences. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity with HDAC inhibitors relieved this repression. Our data suggest that physical interaction between Twist2 and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c attenuates transcriptional activation by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by inhibiting its binding to DNA, and that this inhibition is at least partly dependent on chromatin modification by HDACs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) play a critical role in lipid homeostasis by regulating genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Three isoforms of SREBPs have been identified, SREBP1a, SREBP1c (also known as adipocyte determination and differentiation dependent factor 1 &#x0005b;ADD1&#x0005d;) and SREBP2, constituting a family of basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c3">3</xref>). SREBP1a and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c are generated by alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing from a single gene, while SREBP2 is encoded by a distinct gene with 47&#x00025; identity with SREBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c3">3</xref>). Unlike other transcription factors, SREBPs are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in a transcriptionally inactive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c5">5</xref>). When cellular cholesterol concentrations are low, SREBP cleavage-activating protein, together with Insig-1 or Insig-2, escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi, where they are cleaved in sequence by Site 1 and Site 2 proteases. The mature forms of SREBPs, with N-terminal fragments, are then released from the Golgi and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to the promoters or enhancers of SREBP target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Of the three SREBPs, it is ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c that mainly activates genes responsible for fatty acid synthesis, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), acetyl Co A carboxylase (ACC) and steroyl Co A desaturase (SCD) in fat and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c3">3</xref>). ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue and liver, and its mRNA is induced at an early stage of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c10">10</xref>). Ectopic expression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in preadipocyte cell lines promotes adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c10">10</xref>) and stimulates the activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b3;, a master transcription factor for adipogenesis, by producing activators (or endogenous ligands) of PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c11">11</xref>). In addition, ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c expression is modulated by nutritional status and regulated in an insulin-sensitive manner in which it regulates transcription of insulin-dependent lipogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c12">12</xref>). It is therefore likely that ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is a major transcription factor coordinating fatty acid and glucose metabolism in insulin-sensitive organs. On the contrary, several studies have suggested that ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is dispensable for the development of adipose tissue <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c15">15</xref>). For example, aP2-ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c transgenic animals show lipodystrophy rather than increased fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c13">13</xref>). However, ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c-specific knockout mice have decreased fat mass and severely decreased hepatic and plasma triglycerides, suggesting that ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is critical for lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Compared with other SREBPs, ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is a relatively weak transcription activator. This can be explained by the fact that it has few acidic amino acids in its N-terminal region compared with SREBP1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c16">16</xref>). SREBP1a and SREBP2 associate through their N-terminal domains with various transcriptional co-activators including p300, CBP and ARC&#x0002f;DRIP, but no interaction between ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and co-activators has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c18">18</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that the transcriptional activity of SREBP1 isoforms is stimulated by interaction with other co-regulatory factors such as Sp1 and NF-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c21">21</xref>).</p><p>Although the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c has been investigated intensively, little is known of proteins that interact with it and regulate its transcriptional activity. To address this issue, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we demonstrate that Twist2, a bHLH protein, is a novel ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c interacting protein. Twist2 (also called Dermo-1) is expressed in fat and liver where ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is also highly expressed. Over-expression of Twist2 specifically repressed the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by inhibiting its binding to target promoters. Furthermore, histone deacetylase (HDAC)- inhibiting drugs such as sodium butyrate abolished Twist2-dependent inhibition, implying that Twist2 interferes with ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in cooperation with HDACs. Together, our observations suggest that Twist2 antagonizes the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, and that together Twist2 and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c may regulate energy homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening</title><p>As bait, the N-terminal region of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c containing the acidic domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;153) was cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain into vector pAS2 (Clonetech).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f1">1</xref>C, 21&#x00025; of the input full length Twist2 bound to immobilized GST&#x02013;ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (lane 6), indicating that Twist2 forms a stable complex with the N-terminus of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c <italic>in vitro</italic>. Twist2 was not detected when GST was used on its own (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f1">1</xref>C, lane 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Twist2 in liver and adipose tissue</title><p>As a key transcription factor for fatty acid metabolism, ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is highly expressed in fat and liver. To investigate whether Twist2 is also expressed in tissues where ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is abundant, we performed northern blot analyses and semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f2">2</xref>A, expression of Twist2 mRNA was detected in both fat and liver tissue and was also induced during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f2">2</xref>B and C). Western blot analysis also showed that Twist2 is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, fat tissue and liver (data not known). These results imply that Twist2 may modulate the activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in fat and liver tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression of transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by Twist2</title><p>In order to investigate the consequences of the interaction between ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and Twist2, we examined the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in the presence and absence of Twist2. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the promoters of the FAS and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c genes contain binding sites for ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and that they are transactivated by ectopic expression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c24">24</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f3">3</xref>A and B, expression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c activated the promoters of FAS and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and co-expression of Twist2 suppressed this activation, while Twist on its own had no effect. This observation is consistent with recent reports that Twist2 is a transcriptional repressor of p65 (an NF-&#x003ba;B subunit) and MEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c26">26</xref>). The proximal promoter region of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c contains binding sites for LXR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; as well as ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and both ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and LXR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; independently transactivate ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c28">28</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f3">3</xref>C, co-expression of Twist2 with LXR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; did not affect the transcriptional activity of LXR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; at the ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c promoter, indicating that Twist2 specifically represses the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c. Because SREBP1a and SREBP2 also can transactivate the FAS promoter, we tested the effect of Twist2 on the transcriptional activity of SREBP1a and SREBP2. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f3">3</xref>D, while co-expression of Twist2 did not affect significantly on the transcriptional activity of SREBP2 at the FAS promoter, Twist2 reduced the transcriptional activity of SREBP1a, whose N-terminal acidic domain includes almost all amino acid sequences in the acidic region of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c but for five residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Twist2 reduces target DNA binding of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c</title><p>We tested whether Twist2 interferes with binding of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c to its target DNA. Unlike other bHLH proteins, ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c has dual DNA-binding specificity to both E-boxes (CANNTG) and SRE boxes (ATCACCCCAC), because it contains an atypical tyrosine residue in place of the arginine in the basic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c23">23</xref>). EMSA demonstrated that Twist2 decreased the DNA-binding ability of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c at both E-box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3, 8 and 9) and SRE motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref>B, lanes 3, 7, 8 and 9). Although Twist2 is a bHLH protein, it did not bind to the SRE or E-box motifs, but instead interfered with binding by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by complexing with it. When Twist2 was reacted with antibody before mixing with ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, its repressive effect was relieved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref>A, lanes 9 versus 10 and B, lanes 9 versus 12).</p><p>To establish that Twist2 inhibits DNA binding by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. It has been shown previously that ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c transactivates its own promoter by binding to the SRE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c24">24</xref>). When ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c protein was immunoprecipitated in the ChIP assay, DNA fragments containing the SRE element of the ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c promoter were amplified from the immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f5">5</xref>A, lane 3). Expression of Twist2 with ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c inhibited the binding of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c to its target (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f5">5</xref>A, lane 4). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and Twist2 were similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f5">5</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Histone deacetylation is involved in the repression of the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by Twist2</title><p>It has been reported recently, that repression of the transcriptional activity of MEF2 by Twist2 is dependent on HDAC and that Twist2 forms a complex with E12. We therefore examined the effects of HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, on the transcriptional regulation of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by Twist2, and found that it prevented Twist2-mediated repression of the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f6">6</xref>A). In addition, Twist2-dependent repression of the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c was enhanced by over-expression of HDACs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f6">6</xref>B). These results imply that Twist2 contributes to the transcriptional suppression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c not only by decreasing the DNA-binding ability of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c but also by associating with HDACs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Twist2 is a bHLH protein that was cloned as an E12-binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c30">30</xref>). When heterodimerized with E12, Twist2 binds to E-boxes and Twist-boxes without displaying any substantial transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c30">30</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that Twist2 represses many transcription factors. For example, it inhibits MyoD, a myogenic bHLH transcription factor that is also inhibited by the Ids family of HLH proteins. Because Id family proteins have only the HLH domain and not a basic region, they function as dominant-negative partners of MyoD to inhibit muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c31">31</xref>). Unlike Id proteins, Twist proteins are able to block DNA binding of MyoD by squelching E12 proteins, which are necessary as partners for efficient DNA binding of MyoD, and bind to MyoD indirectly to form a transcriptionally inactive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c33">33</xref>). Interestingly, it has been suggested that HDACs are involved in the repression of MyoD by Twist2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c25">25</xref>). Twist2 is also reported to repress osteoblast differentiation at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c35">35</xref>).</p><p>It appears that Twist2 also functions as an oncoprotein, antagonizing p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c36">36</xref>). Consistent with this, Twist2 knockout mice show severe growth retardation and apparently atrophic dermis, thymus, liver and fat tissue, with increased numbers of apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c26">26</xref>). Loss of Twist2 results in elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and perinatal death from cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c26">26</xref>). Twist2 mRNA expression is induced by TNF&#x003b1; via the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B, and Twist2 appears to repress cytokine gene expression by a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c26">26</xref>).</p><p>We have shown above that Twist2 also regulates ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by physical interaction. Twist2 was expressed in both fat and liver tissues where ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is highly expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f2">2</xref>), and ectopic expression of Twist2 repressed transcription by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c at both FAS and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f3">3</xref>). It is likely that repression by Twist2 is due to inhibition of DNA binding, because over-expression of Twist2 attenuated the DNA-binding ability of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f5">5</xref>). Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors such as sodium butyrate abolished Twist2-dependent repression, implying that the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c may be regulated by Twist2 via HDACs.</p><p>These observations suggest that bHLH transcription factors, which regulate cell type determination and differentiation by Ids and&#x0002f;or Twists, act by a common mechanism. It has been reported previously that the transcription by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, like MyoD, is down-regulated by Ids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c37">37</xref>). However, it is likely that the mechanism by which Twist2 inhibits MyoD- and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c-dependent transcription are not identical. Twist2 inhibits MyoD indirectly by squelching E12 protein while Twist2 forms a protein complex with ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and interferes with the domains of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c necessary for transcriptional activation.</p><p>As described above, the N-terminal acidic domains of SREBPs are important for their transcriptional activity by associating with co-activators. The acidic domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;50) of SREBP1a interacts with the ARC (activator-recruited cofactor) complex for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c17">17</xref>). As shown here by yeast two-hybrid analysis, it is likely that ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c interacts with Twist2 through its short acidic domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;60), but not its other domains that include the bHLH domain (amino acids 308&#x02013;403). In addition, Twist2 expression did affect the transcriptional activity of SREBP1a, as well as ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, but not SREBP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f3">3</xref>). The acidic region of SREBP1a includes almost all amino acid sequences, which that of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c have. Thus, this result also supports that Twist2-mediated transcriptional repression might be mediated by the interaction through the N-terminal acidic region of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c. Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the interaction between Twist2 and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is via the HLH domain. Instead, it appears that Twist2 binding to the N-terminal region of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c down-regulates transcription by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c either by squelching co-activator binding to ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, recruiting co-repressors to the acidic domain, or changing the conformation of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c into an inactive form that cannot bind to DNA. On the basis of our observations, the latter two models seem to be plausible explanations of how Twist2 regulates the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c. As assessed by <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP assay and <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSA, the interaction between ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and Twist2 clearly reduced the DNA-binding ability of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f5">5</xref>). A DNA&#x02013;ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c&#x02013;Twist2 triple complex was not observed with E-box or SRE probes in EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg934f4">4</xref>). Instead, addition of Twist2 reduced the amount of DNA-bound ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c just like Ids. These results suggest that Twist2 binding to ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c itself reduces the DNA-binding affinity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, possibly by changing the conformation of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c into a transcriptionally inactive form.</p><p>Furthermore, as proposed by Gong <italic>et al</italic>. in the repression of transcriptional activity of MyoD by Twist2, it is also likely that Twist2-dependent transcriptional repression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c is, at least partially, mediated by the formation of transcriptionally inactive protein complex through recruiting co-repressors to ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c target gene promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c25">25</xref>). As described above, sodium butyrate, which is a well-known HDAC inhibitor, relieved the Twist2-induced transcriptional suppression of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, which implies that Twist2 represses the transactivity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c by recruiting HDACs. Although, the mechanism(s) by which Twist2 recruits co-repressors to the ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c target gene promoter region remains to be elucidated, it is plausible that Twist2 recruiting co-repressors to ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c might change protein complex or inactivate it by protein modifications. Recently, Giandomenico <italic>et al</italic>. reported that p300 binding to SREBP1a increases the DNA-binding ability of SREBP1a, and p300-dependent acetylation of SREBP1a and SREBP2 regulates their protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c38">38</xref>).</p><p>One may speculate that Twist2, as a repressor of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, affects several aspects of energy homeostasis regulated by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c40">40</xref>). For example, increased production of TNF&#x003b1; is observed in the obese state and has been implicated in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Also, TNF&#x003b1; has been shown to block the stimulatory effect of insulin on ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in human adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c41">41</xref>). Thus, it is likely that this TNF&#x003b1;-induced down-regulation of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in the adipocytes of obese or diabetic patients is, at least partially, mediated by increased levels of Twist2, because TNF&#x003b1; has been shown to stimulate expression of Twists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg934c26">26</xref>). Consistent with this, we have observed elevated Twist protein levels in fat tissue from <italic>ob&#x0002f;ob</italic> and <italic>db&#x0002f;db</italic> mice that have an obese phenotype combined with severe insulin resistance and high serum TNF&#x003b1; (Y.S.Lee and J.B.Kim, unpublished data).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that Twist2 is a novel ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c interacting protein. Since the interaction between ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c and Twist2 suppressed the transcriptional activity of ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c, abnormal expression of Twist2 may affect energy homeostasis such as lipid and glucose metabolism, which are governed by ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c. However, future studies are required to define the role of Twist2 and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c in whole body energy homeostasis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg934f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Interaction between Twist2 and ADD1&#x0002f;SREBP1c.
