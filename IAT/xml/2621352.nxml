One approach to this problem is to measure effects when such proteins are expressed in heterologous neurons. We report on effects of an ALS-associated, misfolding-prone mutant human SOD1, G85R, when expressed in the neurons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Stable mutant transgenic animals, but not wild-type human SOD1 transgenics, exhibited a strong locomotor defect associated with the presence, specifically in mutant animals, of both soluble oligomers and insoluble aggregates of G85R protein. A whole-genome RNAi screen identified chaperones and other components whose deficiency increased aggregation and further diminished locomotion. The nature of the locomotor defect was investigated. Mutant animals were resistant to paralysis by the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, while exhibiting normal sensitivity to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and normal muscle morphology. When fluorescently labeled presynaptic components were examined in the dorsal nerve cord, decreased numbers of puncta corresponding to neuromuscular junctions were observed in mutant animals and brightness was also diminished. At the EM level, mutant animals exhibited a reduced number of synaptic vesicles. Neurotoxicity in this system thus appears to be mediated by misfolded SOD1 and is exerted on synaptic vesicle biogenesis and/or trafficking.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A new animal model of the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's Disease) is presented. Two percent of ALS cases result from heritable mutations affecting the abundant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Such mutations have been indicated to impair the folding and stability of the enzyme, leading it to misfold and aggregate in motor neurons, associated with the paralyzing disease. Here, when a mutant form of human SOD1 was produced in neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms, it led to a severe locomotor defect&#x02014;the worms were essentially paralyzed. The protein formed aggregates in the neurons, including an intermediate form of aggregate, soluble oligomers, that has been linked to toxicity to cells. By contrast, worms expressing the normal version of human SOD1 protein exhibited normal movement and no aggregation. The movement defect was further analyzed using chemical inhibitors and found to result from defective function of synapses, the connections made between neurons, and between neurons and muscle. Finally, in a screen using RNA interference, we observed that the worms' aggregation and locomotor condition was worsened when a class of molecules called molecular chaperones, which assist protein folding in the cell, were impaired in function. This is consistent with the idea that misfolded SOD1 is directly involved with causing the neuronal dysfunction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, with a specific protein in each case observed to aggregate in a particular population of neurons.

PVDR nearly always exhibited fluorescent aggregates, usually first observed at the L4 stage, whereas PDER was generally spared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; note that PDER was present in G85R-YFP animals, delineated by diffuse green fluorescence not clearly visible in this image). The nature of the difference between these two neurons that governs the different aggregation behavior is interesting to contemplate and may relate to specific neuronal activity. More generally, whether neurons which have sequestered misfolded SOD-YFP into an insoluble fraction are functionally more affected in vivo than neurons lacking aggregates, as suggested by Matsumoto et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, who observed reduced viability of SOD-YFP aggregate-containing cultured cells, or, conversely, are protected by aggregation, as suggested by primary neuron studies with Htt<sup>ex1</sup>-polyQ-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Arrasate1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, is unknown.</p><fig id="pgen-1000350-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000350.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Distinct neuronal pattern of aggregation in G85R-YFP animals.</title><p>A, Involvement of selected lateral neurons.

This protein, when expressed in DA motor neurons, has been observed to produce a continuous pattern of fluorescent puncta in the dorsal nerve cord, where neuromuscular junctions are present (e.g. ref. 39). Wild-type and G85R (unfused) transgenic animals were crossed to P<italic>unc-129</italic>::GFP-synaptobrevin transgenic animals, and the double transgenic progeny were examined for the number of dorsally located green synaptic puncta that demarcate neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Whereas wild-type animals exhibited a continuous band of such puncta, the mutant animals exhibited a discontinuous pattern. In addition to the reduced number of puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), their signals were also reduced.

A hit of the dopamine transporter DAT-1 was confirmed with allele <italic>tm903</italic>.

By contrast, a wild-type human SOD produced neither locomotor defects nor aggregation. Further testing indicated that the human SOD mutant, G85R, unable to fold properly and producing both soluble oligomers and aggregates, appears to produce neuronal dysfunction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at the presynaptic level. This was indicated by three types of observation. First, there was a reduced number and brightness of puncta of fluorescently-labeled synaptobrevin, RAB-3, and synapsin, as well as of the presynaptic active zone protein RIM1 in the dorsal nerve cord in transgenic G85R animals as compared with wild-type SOD transgenic animals. Second, mutant transgenic animals but not wild-type exhibited resistance to aldicarb paralysis, consistent with deficient acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses in the mutant. Third, EM studies on a small number of animals revealed paucity of vesicles in the presynaptic region of nerve ring synapses of the mutant animals. In addition, EM showed reduced numbers of vesicles and mitochondria in ventral nerve cord processes (axons) of transgenic mutant animals. In contrast with the foregoing findings pointing to presynaptic dysfunction, there was a lack of postsynaptic effects. The cholinergic agonist levamisole produced the same efficient paralysis of both mutant G85R and wild-type SOD transgenic animals. In addition, EM inspection of muscle revealed normal morphology.</p><p>The putative presynaptic defect could result, in the first instance, from defective biogenesis, axonal transport, or recycling of synaptic vesicles. The diminution of vesicles in dorsal and ventral nerve cord processes and their sparsity in the presynaptic regions as demonstrated from the EM and fluorescence studies suggest that biogenesis or transport is affected. Because accumulations of vesicles were not detected in cell bodies, it seems less likely that transport is affected. Yet the failure of recovery of the GFP-synaptobrevin fluorescence following photobleaching could be consistent with an ongoing transport or recycling defect. Further studies will be required to resolve the steps affected.</p><p>Excitingly, effects of expression of human SOD1 on synaptic transmission in another invertebrate system have recently been reported. Watson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Watson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> observed that expression of human SOD1 (wild-type or mutant) in motor neurons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> produced an age-progressive climbing defect that was associated in electrophysiological studies, stimulating muscle through the giant fiber circuit, with progressive loss of muscle response during high frequency stimulation.</p><p>Presynaptic effects have also been observed in several contexts in <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing a number of other neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Animals transgenic for both wild-type and FTDP-associated mutant forms of tau presented with locomotor defects, associated with aldicarb resistance (and levamisole sensitivity), followed by appearance of macroscopic aggregates and then apparent neuronal loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Kraemer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Animals transgenic for &#x003b1;-synuclein exhibited locomotor defects when any of a number of synaptic proteins were knocked down, associated with aldicarb resistance and levamisole sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Kuwahara1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast with these studies, however, the studies of SOD1 presented here indicate a direct and specific effect of the mutant G85R SOD1 on presynaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Misfolding and Aggregate Formation and Linkage to Locomotor Defect</title><p>So far it is not evident how or whether the presence of G85R-SOD aggregates in cell bodies of specific neurons, comprising a variety of neuronal cell types in the transgenic mutant animals, directly relates to the apparent presynaptic defect. We note, however, that the degree of locomotor defect correlates roughly with the degree of aggregation observed. For example, for the G85R-YFP transgene, out of multiple stable integrant lines, those with the highest level of fluorescence and greatest level of aggregation exhibited the strongest locomotor defect. Thus, either the aggregates themselves or perhaps the apparent precursors, soluble oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), may be directly responsible for the presynaptic defect. The defect could come at the level of physical interactions of oligomers or aggregates either directly with synaptic vesicles themselves or with soluble or cytoskeletal components that are involved with vesicle biogenesis and traffic. A recent study producing pan-neuronal expression of dimeric versions of human wild-type and G85R SOD1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also observed locomotor defects associated with aggregation, but, in contrast to the direct correlation above, observed that a heterodimeric G85R-WTSOD-GFP molecule, while producing less aggregation than G85R-G85R-GFP, led to a greater paraquat-induced reduction of animal survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Witan1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus in the context of a heterodimer, residual SOD enzymatic activity may contribute to toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Lack of Neuronal Cell Death</title><p>Notably, despite evident protein aggregation and synaptic dysfunction, neurons in the mutant animals studied here were not subject to cell death, even during later adult life. This resembles the observation in the recent report of Watson et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Watson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> where human SOD1 expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motor neurons produced both focal SOD protein accumulation and measurable electrical dysfunction but no observable cell death. Similarly, in earlier studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> PLM neurons transgenic for polyglutamine expansion, touch sensitivity function was abolished but cell death did not occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Parker1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This lack of cell death may either relate to the state of disease progression or be a function of the invertebrate neuronal systems themselves. For example, concerning stage of disease, in the mammalian context, SOD1-affected motor neurons appear likely to be functionally affected for a period of time before being subject to cell death. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic>, by contrast, the trajectory may not extend sufficiently in time to produce cell death, albeit that added insults such as oxidative toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Kraemer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> may be capable of producing cell death. Alternatively, these systems may differ from that of mammals. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has, for example, a limited number of glia, and they may not function as in the mammalian context to hasten death of affected neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Boille1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Nagai1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, the absence of cell death could be a function of a different neuronal response to chronic exposure to misfolded protein as compared with mammalian neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Proteostatic Protection from Misfolded SOD in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Neurons</title><p>The RNA interference screen conducted here, examining relative levels of G85R-YFP protein aggregation in relation to knockdown of various gene products, validated in many cases by crosses with corresponding mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000350-t002">Table 2</xref>), provided evidence that a proteostatic network similar to that present in body wall muscles of <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Nollen1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-vanHam1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Morimoto1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> is operative in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons. Whether it is induced in response to mutant human SOD1 remains to be determined, and whether a higher level of expression of some or all members of the network could be protective remains to be tested. Two transcriptional regulators that lie at the top of such a network were identified, HSF-1 and PHA-4/FoxA, which have a broad range of targets in, for example, chaperone pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Morimoto1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and redox regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Panowski1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively. Components within the network were also identified, including chaperones, an E3 ligase, and redox components. Additional components had effects on aggregation but their mechanism of action remains unclear, including SUMO, the TGF-&#x003b2; homologue, DBL-1, expressed mainly in neurons, and two components of DNA maintenance, topoisomerase I and a subunit of pol&#x003b1;/primase complex, implicating DNA integrity in the response. Notably absent from both the interference screen and from EM studies was evidence for involvement of the autophagy system. Consistent with this, administration of rapamycin was without effect on the extent of aggregation (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Relation of the Worm G85R SOD-Induced Phenotype to G85R SOD-Associated ALS in Mouse</title><p>Do the phenotypic properties observed here bear any relation to mammalian disease induced by expression of mutant SOD1? Could the transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> inform usefully about mammalian disease? As mentioned, the G85RSOD-YFP fusion protein expressed in mice indeed produces an ALS-like disease whereas WTSOD-YFP fusion produces no ill effect. Interestingly, the presynaptic effects observed here with the G85R transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> may have a parallel in mutant G85R SOD transgenic mice, as reported recently by Caroni and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Pun1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, who examined motor neuron axons and NMJs in hind limb muscle of mutant transgenic animals of varying age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000350-Fischer1">&#x0005b;see also 59&#x0005d;</xref>. In vulnerable motor neuron axons (FF and FR), they observed at early time (7 months of age; 2 months before end-stage) localized synaptic vesicle accumulation associated with diminished overall density of vesicles, reflecting apparent stalling of vesicle traffic, followed at a later stage by severe loss of synaptic vesicles associated with loss of presynaptic active zone markers. The findings at later time generally agree with the observations here in dorsal cord of our G85R <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where both fluorescent synaptic vesicle protein markers and an active zone marker (RIM1) appear to be reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The nature of the vesicle trafficking defect in either setting remains to be elucidated. Does it reflect failure of vesicles to be produced in the first instance, as suggested by the lack of organelles in ventral cord processes here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and/or is it a block of recycling, as might be suggested by the FRAP analysis of GFP-synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000350-g006">Figure 6C</xref>)? Is it a direct effect of mutant SOD, forming physical association with synaptic vesicles? Or is it a secondary effect, mediated e.g. via the motor/cytoskeletal trafficking system? Questions concerning both the basis to vesicular defects and the overall pathway of toxicity of mutant SOD protein remain to be resolved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>DNA</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans snb-1</italic> promoter, a PCR-amplified genomic DNA segment extending from minus 3021 bp to just upstream of the SNB start codon, was inserted in place of the <italic>unc-54</italic> enhancer/promoter in the plasmid pPD30_38 (Fire Lab Vector Kit, Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA), and the various human SOD cDNA-containing segments were then adjoined.
