Whereas bacterial and archaeal RNases H2 are active as single polypeptides, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homolog, Rnh2Ap, when expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, fails to produce an active RNase H2. By affinity chromatography purification and identification of polypeptides associated with a tagged <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Rnh2Ap, we obtained a complex of three proteins (Rnh2Ap, Ydr279p and Ylr154p) that together are necessary and sufficient for RNase H2 activity. Deletion of the gene encoding any one of the proteins or mutations in the catalytic site in Rnh2A led to loss of RNase H2 activity. Even when <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 is catalytically compromised, it still exhibits a preference for cleavage of the phosphodiester bond on the 5&#x02032; side of a ribonucleotide&#x02013;deoxyribonucleotide sequence in substrates mimicking RNA-primed Okazaki fragments or a single ribonucleotide embedded in a duplex DNA. Interestingly, Ydr279p and Ylr154p have homologous proteins only in closely related species. The multisubunit nature of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 may be important both for structural purposes and to provide a means of interacting with other proteins involved in DNA replication/repair and transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNases H are enzymes that specifically hydrolyze RNA when annealed to a complementary DNA and are present in all living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c1">1</xref>). Most organisms have more than one type, leading to the classification into two distinct groups, RNase HI/H1 and RNase HII/H2, based on amino acid sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c2">2</xref>). Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology between the two classes of RNases H, they have similar three-dimensional structures and a common arrangement of carboxylic acid residues that form the catalytic site and presumably cleave their substrates via similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c4">4</xref>). Some bacteria and archaea have only one type of RNase H, while other bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have both RNases HI and HII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c5">5</xref>). Eukaryotic RNases H also are of both type I and II. Within a given class, there is a wide variation in specific activity, divalent metal ion preference and sites at which the enzymes are capable of cleaving RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c2">2</xref>). In addition to having a similar catalytic mechanism, both enzymes seem to have overlapping functions in cells, since over-expression of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HII can complement an RNase HI deletion phenotype in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c6">6</xref>) and RNase H2 exhibits an increased activity in <italic>rnh1</italic>&#x00394; deletion strains of yeast, probably to partially compensate for loss of RNase H1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c7">7</xref>).</p><p>In single-celled eukaryotes, both RNase H-encoding genes can be deleted with only minor defects on the cell&#x02019;s ability to respond to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c8">8</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the RNase H1-encoding gene results in embryonic lethality in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c9">9</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c10">10</xref>), the former being due to an inability to amplify mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c9">9</xref>). Unlike RNases H1, the cellular function(s) of eukaryotic RNases H2 is still not well defined but is thought to be involved in removal of Okazaki fragment primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>) and for removal of single ribonucleotides in DNA&#x02013;DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c14">14</xref>). For many years, the composition of this class of RNase H remained elusive, with some studies suggesting multiple subunits and others indicating a single polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c15">15</xref>). Although this enzyme is readily detected in enzymatic assays, it is present in low amounts and proved to be difficult to purify by classical techniques.</p><p>Highly purified RNases H2 from human tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c16">16</xref>) and calf thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c17">17</xref>) exhibit biochemical properties distinct from RNase H1 but share many common properties with archaeal and bacterial RNase HII. Genes encoding clear homologs of bacterial RNases HII are found in eukaryotes and, when the gene is deleted in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a 70&#x00025; reduction in RNase H activity in crude extracts is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c18">18</xref>). Overproduction of this polypeptide results in only a modest increase in RNase H activity and expression of this polypeptide in <italic>E.coli</italic> yields an RNase H with little (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>) or no enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c19">19</xref>). In contrast, RNases HII from bacteria and archaea are active when expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c21">21</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that eukaryotic RNases H2 may require post-translational modification or an additional subunit(s). Many reports using highly purified RNases H2 derived from mammalian sources suggest the possibility of at least one additional component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c15">15</xref>). To determine the composition and enzymatic properties of eukaryotic RNases H2, we employed the well-studied eukaryotic organism, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The X2180-A (wt), <italic>rnh1</italic>&#x00394; (HIRO29), <italic>rnh2</italic>&#x00394; (HIRO16A) and <italic>rnh1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rnh2</italic>&#x00394; (HIRO27AF) strains used in this work have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c7">7</xref>).

In a separate western blot analysis, the band noted as Rnh2Ap was detected using anti-HA antibodies (data not shown).

Two proteins with molecular masses of &#x0223c;37 and 15 kDa were always present. These two polypeptides were identified from three preparations as Ydr279p and Ylr154p by N-terminal microsequencing and mass spectrometry.

The small subunit (21 kDa) of human RNase H2 (accession No. AF312034) has no obvious sequence similarity to either Rnh2Bp or Rnh2Cp of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2. It seems likely that the composition of proteins constituting eukaryotic RNases H2 evolved independently and may allow the enzymes to associate with other different proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 comprises three polypeptides</title><p>Bacterial and archaeal RNases HII are active as single polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c20">20</xref>). However, the composition of eukaryotic RNase H2 has been a long-standing issue, with reports describing RNase H2 comprising either a single or two distinct polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c15">15</xref>). By expressing an epitope-tagged Rnh2Ap, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homolog of bacterial and archaeal RNase HII, we were able to obtain an enzymatically active RNase H2 from yeast that contains two additional polypeptides, Ydr279p and Ylr154p. Deletion studies and the ability to form a catalytically active complex when all three subunits are co-expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> led us to conclude that Rnh2Ap, Ydr279p and Ylr154p are necessary and sufficient to make functional <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2. Therefore, we suggest the protein subunits of RNase H2 be named Rnh2Ap (Ynl072p), Rnh2Bp (Ydr279p) and Rnh2Cp (Ylr154p).</p></sec><sec><title>Rnh2Ap is important for catalytic activity of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2</title><p>The catalytic residues in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> reside at least in part in Rnh2Ap, as demonstrated by the loss or decrease in RNase H2 activity when mutant Rnh2Ap proteins are examined (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f2">2</xref>A and B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f4">4</xref>C). Expression of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Rnh2Ap or human RNASEH2A (data not shown) in <italic>E.coli</italic> does not yield an active enzyme in our hands, a result consistent with that reported by Lima <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c27">27</xref>) for the human protein. However, Qiu <italic>et al</italic>. describe recovering RNase H activity of Rnh2Ap after expression in <italic>E.coli</italic> in an insoluble form followed by renaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>). We employed one of the substrates used in their experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f4">4</xref>B) and observed cleavage at the same sites as did Qiu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c20">20</xref>). Moreover, Frank <italic>et al</italic>. report activity associated with the large subunit of RNase H2 purified from calf thymus using the gel renaturation assay for RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c26">26</xref>). The simplest explanation to reconcile these differences is to assume that the catalytic activity resides in the Rnh2Ap subunit and can inefficiently be made active upon renaturation when expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> or possibly exhibit activity when there is additional <italic>in vivo</italic> modification of the bovine enzyme. Interestingly, the compromised D155A and D183A mutant proteins cleave the DNA<sub>12</sub>&#x02013;RNA<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;DNA<sub>12</sub>/DNA<sub>28</sub> substrate almost exclusively to form an RNA<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;DNA<sub>12</sub> fragment, suggesting a strong preference for cleavage adjacent to an RNA&#x02013;DNA junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f4">4</xref>C), a hallmark of RNase HII/2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c17">17</xref>). RNases H1 do not cleave at this position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypes associated with RNase H2 mutations</title><p>Removal of RNA primers during lagging strand DNA synthesis seems to involve Rad27p (<italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Flap endonuclease) and Dna2p, but some evidence suggests RNase H2 might aid in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c29">29</xref>). Two studies examined the effect of deleting <italic>rnh2A</italic> on expansion of triplet repeats and chromosome breakage at the triplet repeats and found either no or only modest effects. Qiu <italic>et al</italic>. observed a small increase in frequency of canavanine-resistant mutants as well as an increase in a frameshift mutation (<italic>CAN1</italic> forward mutation assay) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>). The combination of <italic>rad27</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rnh2A</italic>&#x00394; increased the frequencies in a manner suggesting that Rad27p and RNase H2 may both recognize and resolve RNA-primed Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c11">11</xref>). In a genome-wide screen of yeast mutants whose deletion results in an increase in mutagenesis using the <italic>CAN1</italic> forward mutation assay, <italic>RNH2C</italic> was one of 33 genes of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> identified as necessary to keep mutation frequencies at normal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c30">30</xref>). Mutation frequencies for <italic>rnh2A</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rnh2C</italic>&#x00394; in the two different reports are very similar. Of the 33 strains identified in the genome-wide study, the <italic>rnh2C</italic>&#x00394; strain exhibited mutation frequencies about two to three times that of the wild-type strain. Failure to identify <italic>RNH2A</italic> or <italic>RNH2B</italic> in the genome-wide screen may reflect the difficulty in including or excluding candidates with such small increases in resistance to canavanine.</p><p>Deletions of any of the genes encoding the three subunits of RNase H2 exhibit a synthetic fitness phenotype with an <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c31">31</xref>). Sgs1p is a helicase of the RecQ family, with several of the members of this family known to be involved in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c32">32</xref>). Each of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rnh2</italic> (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic> or <italic>C</italic>)&#x00394; double deletion strains has a doubling time of &#x0223c;140 min compared with 90&#x02013;100 min for each single deletion strain. The slow growth rates of the double mutants were partially reversed in all cases by introduction of a <italic>rad51</italic>&#x00394;. The similarity in the synthetic fitness properties conferred on <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; strains by <italic>rnh2</italic>&#x00394; mutations is readily explained by the results we report here that the loss of any of the three subunits of RNase H2 results in the absence of RNase H2 activity. The synthetic fitness results have been interpreted as an indication that the Sgs1p helicase can aid in resolving problems created by the absence of RNase H2, particularly resolution of recombination intermediates and damaged replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Potential for additional subunits to interact with other cellular components</title><p>Additional proteins in eukaryotic RNases H2 may serve two functions. First, eukaryotic Rnh2A-like proteins are longer at both the N- and C-termini than the bacterial and archaeal proteins, and Rnh2Bp and Rnh2Cp might be required to fold Rnh2Ap into an active conformation by proper positioning of the N- and C-terminal amino acids. Secondly, the accessory proteins may provide a means by which RNase H2 interacts with other cellular components. In some of our analyses of the components of the RNase H2 complex, we have detected other proteins, most of which are abundant in the cell, and none seems likely to be related to RNase H2 function. However, large-scale studies detecting interactions amongst proteins in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> have indicated several interactions of Rnh2Bp and Rnh2Cp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh209f5">5</xref>), including with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh209c36">36</xref>). There is no previous description of Rnh2Ap interacting with either Rnh2Bp or Rnh2Cp as we report here. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 is cell cycle regulated, having its highest levels during S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases where it could be important in DNA replication and repair. Interestingly, Rnh2Bp and Rnh2Cp are suggested to interact with a variety of proteins some of which are involved in transcription (Fkh1p), replication/repair (Top2p), and cell cycle progression during S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (Cak1p). Many of the proteins are kinases and phosphatases that have the potential to modify any or all of the RNase H2 subunits.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_2_407__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_2_407__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh209f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H2 by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation following FLAG immunopurification.
