Its C-terminal domain, which is common to the four EED isoforms, contains seven repeats of a canonical WD-40 motif. EED is an interactor of three HIV-1 proteins, matrix (MA), integrase (IN) and Nef. An antiviral activity has been found to be associated with isoforms EED3 and EED4 at the late stage of HIV-1 replication, due to a negative effect on virus assembly and genomic RNA packaging. The aim of the present study was to determine the regions of the EED C-terminal core domain which were accessible and available to protein interactions, using three-dimensional (3D) protein homology modelling with a WD-40 protein of known structure, and epitope mapping of anti-EED antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our data suggested that the C-terminal domain of EED was folded as a seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller protein. During the completion of our work, crystallographic data of EED became available from co-crystals of the EED C-terminal core with the N-terminal domain of its cellular partner EZH2. Our 3D-model was in good congruence with the refined structural model determined from crystallographic data, except for a unique &#x003b1;-helix in the fourth &#x003b2;-blade. More importantly, the position of flexible loops and accessible &#x003b2;-strands on the &#x003b2;-propeller was consistent with our mapping of immunogenic epitopes and sites of interaction with HIV-1 MA and IN. Certain immunoreactive regions were found to overlap with the EZH2, MA and IN binding sites, confirming their accessibility and reactivity at the surface of EED. Crystal structure of EED showed that the two discrete regions of interaction with MA and IN did not overlap with each other, nor with the EZH2 binding pocket, but were contiguous, and formed a continuous binding groove running along the lateral face of the &#x003b2;-propeller.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Identification of antibody-, MA-, IN- and EZH2-binding sites at the surface of the EED isoform 3 provided a global picture of the immunogenic and protein-protein interacting regions in the EED C-terminal domain, organized as a seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller protein. Mapping of the HIV-1 MA and IN binding sites on the 3D-model of EED core predicted that EED-bound MA and IN ligands would be in close vicinity at the surface of the &#x003b2;-propeller, and that the occurrence of a ternary complex MA-EED-IN would be possible.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human EED protein, the human ortholog of the mouse embryonic ectoderm development (<italic>eed</italic>) gene product, is a member of the superfamily of WD-40 repeat proteins which belongs to the highly conserved <italic>Polycomb </italic>group (<italic>Pc</italic>G) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The human EED protein has been found to interact with several cellular proteins in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. At the inner side of the plasma membrane, EED interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin &#x003b2;7 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a domain involved in major integrin functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Within the nucleus, EED participates in Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs), multiprotein edifices which have been identified in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and in mammals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Several types of PRCs have been described and referred to as PRC1, PRC2 and PRC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PRC2/3 content includes, among other components, EED, EZH2, SUZ12 and RbAp46/48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the context of HIV-1-infected cells, EED has been found to interact with three viral proteins, the structural protein matrix (MA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the enzyme integrase (IN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the regulatory protein Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These interactions involved the C-terminal domain of EED, or EED core, common to the four isoforms. It has been suggested that the nuclear depletion of EED which resulted from the EED-Nef interaction occurring at the plasma membrane of HIV-1-infected cells would be responsible for the release of an EED-mediated transcriptional block and for an indirect transcriptional activation of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This hypothesis was consistent with the reported functions of <italic>Pc</italic>G proteins, which act as transcriptional repressors of homeotic genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), and contribute to the maintenance of the silent state of chromatin in upper eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It was also consistent with the finding that HIV-1 preferentially integrates into transcriptionally active regions of the host genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, at the early phase of the HIV-1 life cycle, EED might play a role in targeting the regions of proviral DNA integration into the host chromatin. At the late steps of the virus replication cycle, we found that overexpression of isoforms EED3 and EED4 had a significant negative effect on virus production, and that virus assembly and genome packaging were the major targets of this EED inhibitory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The finding that EED was an interactor of three HIV-1 components and an intracellular factor possibly involved in antiviral innate immunity prompted us to analyse the three-dimensional (3D) structure of EED. Crystallogenesis of EED was therefore undertaken to better understand the nature of the multiple interactions and functions of EED in the HIV-1 life cycle. Unfortunately, none of our attempts to obtain diffracting crystals of EED alone, or in complex with its viral partners MA, IN or Nef was successful, and we therefore analyzed the 3D structure of EED using indirect approaches. They consisted of (i) three-dimensional modelling based on computer-assisted methods of sequence alignment and determination of homology with a prototype of seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller protein previously crystallized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; (ii) mapping of accessible regions of the EED protein, using anti-EED antibodies and a phage display technique.</p><p>During the completion of this work, crystallographic data of the EED protein core, co-crystallised with a peptide from the N-terminal domain of EZH2, was deposited in the protein data bank (PDB code #2QXV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and later published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our predictive model determined by indirect methods was in good consistency with the crystal structure of EED, except for the region 267&#x02013;295 which comprises a unique &#x003b1;-helix facing a short &#x003b2;-strand in the crystallographic structure. Major immunogenic regions in EED were found to correspond to flexible loops and &#x003b2;-strands which were accessible at the surface of the &#x003b2;-propeller. In addition, EED modelling suggested that HIV-1 MA and IN bound to two contiguous sites forming a continuous protein-interacting domain localized in a groove running along the lateral face of the EED &#x003b2;-propeller.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>EED Crystallogenesis</title><p>The coding sequence for the His-tagged EED protein of 441 residues representing isoform 3 (EED3-H<sub>6</sub>) was expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. EED3 corresponded to the sequence spanning residues Met95-Arg535 in the EED1 isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>protein was found to be highly soluble and was purified to homogeneity, using affinity chromatography followed by a gel filtration step. Solutions of EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>titrating 5 to 10 mg/ml were subjected to more than a thousand of different conditions for crystallization. EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>protein crystals, appearing as thin platelets of 0.1 &#x000d7; 0.07 &#x000d7; 0.01 mm<sup>3</sup>, were observed after 30 days at 19&#x000b0;C under certain buffer conditions (0.1 M MES buffer, pH 6.0, 40 % MPD ; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). One single crystal was removed from the well-buffer, washed and dissolved in SDS-sample buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that this crystal was really constituted of EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; lane 2). However, the crystals obtained under these conditions failed to generate X-ray diffraction patterns. We then tried to co-crystallise EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>with its viral protein partners MA, IN or Nef, respectively, but all these attempts were unsuccessful. We then used alternative methods for structure determination of EED, as described below.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Crystallogenesis of histidine-tagged isoform 3 of EED</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold>, Platelet-like crystals of EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>protein of 441 residues, obtained in suspended drop in 0.1 M MES buffer pH 6.0, 40 % MPD. <bold>(B)</bold>, Solubilization of the crystals and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.

It was therefore possible to build a three-dimensional model for the C-terminal core domain of EED spanning residues 84&#x02013;441 (roughly corresponding to the EED3 isoform), using homology modelling by sequence alignment and homology with protein(s) of known structures, and assessment of accessible motifs and epitopes at the surface of the EED protein. The template used was the &#x003b2; subunit of the bovine signal-transducing G protein (G&#x003b2;), of which crystal structure has been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, due to the limited degree of identity between their primary structures (only 20 % amino acid residues identical between EED3 and G&#x003b2;), the sequence alignment of both proteins was manually optimized to improve the correspondence between consensus residues in the WD repeats. The model obtained for EED3 corresponded to a typical seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Each WD-40 repeat was folded as 3 &#x003b2;-strands referred to as a, b and c, respectively. The sequence connecting every WD-40 repeat also folded as an additional &#x003b2;-strand, called d. Thus, a WD-40 repeat formed a structural unit made of 4 antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands referred to as &#x003b2;-blade, and the seven &#x003b2;-blades defined in EED were folded as a &#x003b2;-propeller structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Structural models and immunogenic regions of EED isoform 3</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold>, Seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller model of the EED core domain, based on sequence homology with the beta subunit of the bovine G protein (G&#x003b2; ; [27, 28]).

EED and EZH2 proteins are partners involved in PRC2/3 complexes, along with SUZ12 and RbAp46/RbAp48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The proposed structure represented the co-crystallized complex of a fragment of the N-terminal domain of EZH2 (residues 39 &#x02013; 68) with the C-terminal domain of EED (residues 82 &#x02013; 440). EED-EZH2 interaction took place via the insertion of both ends of the EZH2 &#x003b1;-helical peptide into two peptide-binding hydrophobic pockets in EED formed by the side chains of V112, L123, W152 and P161, and by residues L318, L353, L391 and P396, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The 3D structure reconstructed from crystallographic data was globally similar to our 3D-model of seven &#x003b2;-bladed propeller, with three exceptions. In &#x003b2;-blade IV, there were two structures at the junction of &#x003b2;-strands IVc and IVd that were unique among representatives of WD-40 proteins, (i) an &#x003b1;-helix encompassing region 267&#x02013;280 (&#x003b1;1) and (ii) an outer &#x003b2;-strand referred to as &#x003b2;17. (iii) In &#x003b2;-blade VI, a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helix (termed &#x003b7;1) was found on the N-terminal side of &#x003b2;-strand VId (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Surface-exposed regions in the seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller domain of EED</title><sec><title>Theoretical considerations</title><p>An important feature of the &#x003b2;-propeller structure of the EED core was that most of the accessible surfaces should be confined to the outer &#x003b2;-strands d, and to flexible loops connecting &#x003b2;-strands of the same blade (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These accessible regions would be potential sites of protein-protein interaction, as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis of protein complexes involving other &#x003b2;-propeller proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. E.g. in the case of bovine G&#x003b2; protein, several residues belonging to loops d-a and b-c were found to be involved in hydrophobic contacts with the &#x003b1; subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These accessible regions would also contain putative immunogenic epitopes, responsible for the induction of EED antibodies in animals in response to administration of human EED. The next experiments were designed to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of accesible regions in EED using anti-EED antibodies and phage biopanning</title><p>We raised in rabbit a highly reactive and specific antiserum against affinity chromatography-purified, His-tagged EED3 isoform also used for crystallization trials. IgG were isolated from this antiserum and used in a screen with recombinant phages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We reasoned that anti-EED IgG immobilized on a solid support would preferentially bind to phages which are mimotopes of accessible and antigenic regions of EED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The phages selected on these anti-EED antibodies mapped to eight discrete regions on EED, numbered 1 to 8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). These regions spanned residues 98&#x02013;106 (1), 128&#x02013;133 (2), 223&#x02013;228 (3), 268&#x02013;273 (4), 294&#x02013;305 (5), 314&#x02013;319 (6), 382&#x02013;387 (7) and 434&#x02013;439 (8), respectively. Five of these regions, n&#x000b0; 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, corresponded to predicted accessible loops separating &#x003b2;-strands in the EED 3D-structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal portion of the &#x003b1;-helix K268-D279 coincided with the immunogenic region 4 that we identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><p>The question raised however, for the accessibility of three regions, numbered 1, 3 and 8, which were partially or totally folded as &#x003b2;-sheet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). Region 1 overlapped with &#x003b2;-strand Ia and the adjacent loop a-b forming the junction with &#x003b2;-strand Ib (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). Its motif 103-WHS-105 was included in the EZH2 binding site, and was accessible in a groove oriented towards the lower face of the propeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Likewise, the reactivity of region 3, which coincided with &#x003b2;-strand IIId, was in good consistency with the 3D-model, as it was oriented outwards and accessible at the surface of the &#x003b2;-propeller. However, our data concerning region 8 were more intriguing : this region corresponded to the &#x003b2;-strand VIIc which was close to the C-terminus and was accessible to antibodies in our experimental screening. This suggested that EED in solution adopted a 3D structure which was less tightly closed than shown in the 3D model. Thus, our mapping of major immunogenic regions of EED was in good consistency with the position of accessible loops and surface exposed portions of &#x003b2;-stands predicted by the EED 3D-model.</p></sec><sec><title>3D structure and protein interacting regions in the EED core domain</title><p>The binding site of the HIV-1 MA protein has been mapped to position 294&#x02013;309 on the linear sequence of EED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The newly established conformation of this region implied that the region of interaction with the MA protein was not only confined to the flexible loop IVd-Va on the upper face of the &#x003b2;-propeller, but also included the short, rigid &#x003b2;-strand IVd and the neighboring loop IVd-Va, located on the lateral face of the &#x003b2;-propeller. This was not contradictory to our mapping of the MA binding site on the EED linear sequence, since &#x003b2;-strands d were the most exposed &#x003b2;-strands at the periphery of the &#x003b2;-propeller (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Of note, the upper face of the &#x003b2;-propeller was narrower in surface, compared to its lower face.</p><p>However, there was some ambiguity in the determination of the IN binding domain in EED, as two potential binding sites (bs) were identified by phage display, one at position 96&#x02013;105 (bs1), the other one at position 224&#x02013;232 (bs2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the light of the EED crystal structure, it appeared that in bs1, residues 97&#x02013;102 were buried in the &#x003b2;-propeller central tunnel, and amino acids 103&#x02013;105 were part of the groove on the lower face of the EED &#x003b2;-propeller which homed the N-terminal fragment of EZH2 in co-crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. F96 was the only residue of bs1 which was oriented upwards and accessible on the top of EED. By contrast with bs1, bs2 mapped to the &#x003b2;-strand IIId and the neighbouring turn included in loop IIId-IVa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This region lied at the periphery of the &#x003b2;-propeller and was therefore highly accessible, as determined from crystallographic data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D</xref>).</p><p>It was therefore difficult to conceive how one single IN molecule could bind simultaneously to bs1 and bs2, as these sites were far from each other and in different orientation with respect to the &#x003b2;-propeller plane. Although the possibility existed that one molecule of EED would bind to two IN molecules (e.g. dimeric or tetrameric forms of IN), this was unlikely for the following reasons : (i) only one single EED-binding site has been identified in the HIV-1 IN sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and it is unlikely that the same IN motif would bind to two different sequences in EED ; (ii) mutant EED-103A3, in which the tripeptide motif 103-WHS-105 was replaced by the tripeptide AAA, was still binding to IN with significant efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggested that region 224&#x02013;232 (bs2) was the most probable and unique binding site for IN on EED.</p><p>Although the IN and MA binding sites were found to be located at significant distance from each other on the EED linear sequence (224&#x02013;232 and 294&#x02013;309, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), they appeared to be in close vicinity in the 3D structure : both were located on the lateral face of the EED &#x003b2;-propeller, as shown by surface representation, but they did not overlap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This was corroborated by the absence of competition between MA and IN for binding to EED3-H<sub>6 </sub>protein in vitro in histidine pull-down assays (data not shown). In addition, the possibility of occurrence of ternary complex involving EED, MA and IN has previously been suggested by their colocalization observed by immuno-electron microscopy of HIV-1-infected cells at early steps of the virus life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Surface representation of the &#x003b2;-propeller domain of EED and protein-interacting regions</bold>.

Interestingly, although &#x003b1;-helices represent privileged domains of protein-protein interaction, none of the newly identified helices in the EED core, &#x003b1;1 or &#x003b7;1, represented binding domains of known cellular or viral partners of EED, e.g. EZH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], MA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], or IN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The refined structural model of the EED C-terminal core as a seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller determined from crystallographic data provided structural support to our mapping of immunogenic epitopes recognized by our anti-EED polyclonal antibodies, and of the binding sites of HIV-1 MA and IN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several immunoreactive regions coincided with the MA, IN and EZH2 binding sites, confirming the accessibility of these regions at the surface of EED. According to the EED 3D-model, the domain of interaction with the HIV-1 MA protein would be localised on the lateral face of the &#x003b2;-propeller, and be comprised of two loops separated by the short &#x003b2;-strand IVd (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The region of interaction with IN would be assigned to &#x003b2;-strand IIId and its neighboring turn, also located on the peripheral area of the &#x003b2;-propeller. When represented on the surface of the EED molecule, the two discrete prints of MA and IN interaction were contiguous but did not overlap, and formed a continuous protein-interacting groove running along the lateral face of the EED &#x003b2;-propeller. This groove slightly opened towards the lower face of the &#x003b2;-propeller (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The absence of overlapping of the MA and IN binding sites and the possible occurrence of ternary complex involving EED, MA and IN raised the issue of the biological parameters of a simultaneous binding of EED to MA and IN, and of the role that such a ternary complex might play in the HIV-1 life cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids, proteins and cells</title><p>Plasmids coding for GST-fused or His-tagged proteins EED, MA, IN and Nef and protein expression in bacterial cells have been described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>EED crystallogenesis</title><p>The commercial kits used (Crystal screen 1 and 2 ; Grid Screen Ammonium sulfate ; Grid Screen Sodium Chloride ; Grid Screen MPD ; Grid Screen PEG 6000 ; Grid Screen PEG/LiCl ; Natrix ; SaltRX ; Index &#x00026; PEG; Ion Screen) were purchased from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) and NeXtal (PEG Suite ; Anions &#x00026; Cations ; Qiagen SA).
