To identify genes that might regulate retinal development, gene expression in the developing retina was profiled at multiple time points using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The expression patterns of 1,051 genes that showed developmentally dynamic expression by SAGE were investigated using in situ hybridization. A molecular atlas of gene expression in the developing and mature retina was thereby constructed, along with a taxonomic classification of developmental gene expression patterns. Genes were identified that label both temporal and spatial subsets of mitotic progenitor cells. For each developing and mature major retinal cell type, genes selectively expressed in that cell type were identified. The gene expression profiles of retinal M&#x000fc;ller glia and mitotic progenitor cells were found to be highly similar, suggesting that M&#x000fc;ller glia might serve to produce multiple retinal cell types under the right conditions. In addition, multiple transcripts that were evolutionarily conserved that did not appear to encode open reading frames of more than 100 amino acids in length (&#x0201c;noncoding RNAs&#x0201d;) were found to be dynamically and specifically expressed in developing and mature retinal cell types. Finally, many photoreceptor-enriched genes that mapped to chromosomal intervals containing retinal disease genes were identified. These data serve as a starting point for functional investigations of the roles of these genes in retinal development and physiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Spatial and temporal patterns of expression for over 1000 genes in identified retinal cells invites functional investigations into the role of these genes in development and physiology</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate retina is a model system for studying both the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Only six major types of neurons develop within the retina, along with a single type of glial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Rodiek1">Rodieck 1998</xref>). These cells are readily distinguished from one another by morphology and laminar position within the retina. Birthdating studies have shown that retinal cell types are generated in overlapping intervals, with ganglion cells, cone photoreceptors, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells generated prior to birth, and bipolar neurons and M&#x000fc;ller glia generated after birth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Sidman1">Sidman 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Young1">Young 1985</xref>a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Young2">1985</xref>b).

The competence model states that the intrinsic ability of mitotic retinal progenitor cells to produce a particular cell fate changes continually through development. A cell produces only a single fate, or a subset of fates, at any one time even though lineage analysis has shown that most retinal progenitors have the potential to produce many or all fates over the entire period of retinal development. Interestingly, even at one time in development, retinal progenitor cells show heterogeneity in their developmental competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Alexiades2">Alexiades and Cepko 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Belliveau1">Belliveau and Cepko 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Belliveau2">Belliveau et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Rapaport1">Rapaport et al. 2001</xref>). In addition to the contribution of intrinsic determinants of cell fate specification, the fates chosen by the daughters of a retinal progenitor may be influenced by extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Watanabe1">Watanabe and Raff 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Altshuler1">Altschuler et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Kelley1">Kelley et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Levine1">Levine et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Levine2">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Belliveau1">Belliveau and Cepko 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Young3">Young and Cepko 2004</xref>). Finally, certain aspects of retinal cell fate choice, such as the specification of at least some rod and bipolar cells, appear to occur in postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Ezzeddine1">Ezzeddine et al. 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although the competence model was formulated to explain cell fate choice in the retina, it is clear that cell specification in many other regions of the developing nervous system&#x02014;including neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Selleck1">Selleck and Bronner-Fraser 1996</xref>), spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Ericson1">Ericson et al. 1996</xref>), and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-McConnell1">McConnell 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Qian1">Qian et al. 2000</xref>)&#x02014;involve changes in progenitor competence over time, frequently resulting in altered sensitivity to extrinsic factors. The model of temporal changes in competence is strongly supported by recent elegant studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Isshiki1">Isshiki et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Pearson1">Pearson and Doe 2003</xref>), where a temporal order of transcription factor expression was found to set the context of cell fate determination. The fundamental similarity among these systems nonetheless accommodates mechanistic differences. The situation in the retina, where early progenitor cells cannot be induced to adopt late fates and vice versa (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-James1">James et al. &#x0005b;2003&#x0005d;</xref> for a possible exception to this rule), is distinct from the progressive developmental restriction that is seen in the cerebral cortex, where early cortical progenitor cells are competent to generate cells of upper (late-born) and lower (early-born) layers of the cortex, but become restricted to generating only late-born fates as development proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Desai1">Desai and McConnell 2000</xref>).</p><p>It is not known what genes mediate changes in progenitor competence during retinal development. Likewise, it is not known to what extent individual retinal progenitor cells from a single time point differ in their developmental competence from one another, although a few genes that are expressed in distinct subsets of progenitor cells have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Austin1">Austin et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Matter1">Matter et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Alexiades2">Alexiades and Cepko 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Dyer1">Dyer and Cepko 2000</xref>a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Brown1">Brown et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Wang1">Wang et al. 2001</xref>). Moreover, the genes that regulate the differentiation of any retinal cell type following commitment to a specific fate are generally poorly understood, although a number of transcription factors such as Crx, Nrl, and NR2E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Chen1">Chen et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Furukawa1">Furukawa et al. 1997</xref>a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Haider1">Haider et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Mears1">Mears et al. 2001</xref>) are clearly important in rod development. Unbiased, comprehensive expression profiling studies offer the possibility of identifying the molecular components and networks underlying these processes, as well as revealing target genes involved in intermediate and terminal differentiation of individual retinal cell types.</p><p>We have used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to profile gene expression during the development of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Blackshaw1">Blackshaw et al. 2001</xref>). SAGE, which provides an unbiased and nearly comprehensive readout of gene expression, is conceptually very much like expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing, with the difference being that concatenated libraries of short sequence tags derived from each cDNA found in the sample of interest are sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Velculescu1">Velculescu et al. 1995</xref>). By identifying genes that show dynamic expression via SAGE and testing the cellular expression of these genes via in situ hybridization (ISH), we can identify genes that potentially regulate proliferation, cell fate determination, and cell differentiation. Furthermore, by examining SAGE libraries made from adult tissue, genes that are specifically expressed in mature cell types can be identified.</p><p>By employing both SAGE-based expression profiling and large-scale ISH analysis to determine cellular expression of developmentally dynamic transcripts, we aim to combine the strengths of these two approaches and obtain a detailed picture of molecular events taking place during development of the retina. The laminar structure of the retina, which allows identification of the major cell types expressing a transcript under examination, makes large-scale ISH particularly informative relative to many other regions of the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Summary of SAGE Data</title><p>SAGE was conducted on mouse retinal tissue taken at 2-d intervals from near the start of neurogenesis at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) to nearly the end of neurogenesis at postnatal day 6.5 (P6.5). In addition, libraries were made from P10 wild-type mice and the adult retina. Previously generated SAGE data from the microdissected outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina, which comprises roughly 97&#x00025; rod photoreceptors, from retinal tissue from mice that were deficient for Crx (littermates of the wild-type P10 mice), and from adult hypothalamus were also incorporated into the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Blackshaw1">Blackshaw et al. 2001</xref>). All of these libraries were sequenced to a depth of 50,000&#x02013;60,000 SAGE tags each 14 bp long. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> lists the number of distinct tags found in the 12 retina1 libraries and their abundance levels, along with the number of tags that do not match any known transcript. While 10&#x00025; of all unique tags found twice or more in the 12 libraries did not correspond to an identified transcript, only 3&#x00025; of the tags found five times or more did not match a known transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref> lists all individual tag levels in each of these retinal libraries, along with data from a number of other publicly available nonretinal mouse libraries. We have also created a database, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://134.174.53.82/Cepko/">http://134.174.53.82/Cepko/</ext-link>, that is searchable by gene name, SAGE tag sequence, accession number, genome location, or UniGene number. It displays all SAGE tags and their levels, as well as ISH images (see below).</p><p>The accuracy of the SAGE data was assessed by comparing the 15,268 SAGE tags from E14.5 retina to an unnormalized and unsubtracted set of 15,268 ESTs generated by another research group from E14.5 mouse retina of a different strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Mu1">Mu et al. 2001</xref>). An r-value of 0.65 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) was obtained that compares well with SAGE expression profiles obtained in similar tissues but from different individuals that were not strain-matched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Blackshaw2">Blackshaw et al. 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Analysis of SAGE Tag Expression Patterns in Developing Retina Using Cluster Analysis</title><p>In order to determine whether the temporal pattern of a gene's expression during retinal development might predict its cellular site of expression or its molecular function, clusters of coexpressed genes were assembled.

Ribosomal proteins, which typically showed higher expression early in development, were highly enriched in clusters 5, 9, 10, 15, and 23 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020247-t001">Table 1</xref>)&#x02014;clusters that also were enriched for cell cycle regulators (particularly clusters 10 and 23). Mitochondrial proteins, by contrast, were concentrated in clusters 4 and 5. Cluster 2 consisted entirely of crystallins, which may be due to contamination by lens tissue in the E12.5 and P0.5 libraries. Phototransduction genes, on the other hand, were found to be concentrated in the late-onset clusters 1, 21, 22, and 24. Genes representing a number of other functional categories also were enriched in specific clusters, although the reasons in these cases are not clear. Examples of this include the concentration of genes involved in RNA processing in clusters 6 and 7, genes coding membrane transporters in cluster 10, and genes that are involved in vesicle-mediated transport in cluster 20.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Large-Scale ISH of Dynamically Expressed Genes</title><p>Genes identified by SAGE were chosen for analysis via ISH by focusing on genes that showed dynamic expression by <italic>k-</italic>means cluster analysis using Euclidean distance, and some degree of retinal enrichment (i.e., genes were expressed at lower levels in nonretinal SAGE libraries&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). Within this data set, genes whose presumptive function suggested that they might regulate cell fate choice (e.g., transcription factors, growth factors and their receptors, etc.) received highest priority for testing, although many genes of unknown function with developmentally dynamic expression also were tested. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref> for the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO) classification of each probe tested. The analysis was restricted to genes represented by at least 0.1&#x00025; of total SAGE TAGS in at least one of the retinal libraries, so as to control for sampling variability and to allow for ready detection via ISH. (Exceptions were made for a number of transcription factors and other genes of potentially major functional interest.) This abundance threshold was met by 4,133 tags. Probes corresponding to 1,051 of these tags were tested via ISH. This total included the 346 candidate photoreceptor-enriched genes tested in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Blackshaw1">Blackshaw et al. 2001</xref>), as well as 37 previously characterized retinal genes that served as positive controls for ISH and to allow clarification of cellular expression patterns.

During early stages of retinal development, the outer neuroblastic layer (ONBL) consists almost entirely of mitotic progenitor cells, while newborn neurons (mostly consisting of amacrine and ganglion cells) reside in the inner neuroblastic layer (INBL). The position of mitotic progenitors within the ONBL varies depending upon their progress through the cell cycle, with S phase cells being found on the vitreal side of the ONBL near the border with the INBL and M-phase cells being found on the scleral side of the ONBL abutting the retinal pigment epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Young1">Young 1985</xref>a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Young2">1985</xref>b). Around the time of birth, immature photoreceptors occupy the outer portion of the ONBL. They are comingled with mitotic cells of the G2, M, and G1 phases of the cell cycle, while the S phase mitotic progenitors are in the vitreal side of the ONBL. Finally, by P6, most retinal cells occupy their final positions within the retina. Rod and cone photoreceptors occupy the ONL. Bipolar neuron cell bodies occupy the scleral portion of the inner nuclear layer (INL); the cell bodies of M&#x000fc;ller glia occupy a strip in the center of the INL; and amacrine cell bodies are found in the vitreal portion of the INL. The ganglion cell layer (GCL) contains both ganglion cells and a displaced amacrine cells.</p><p>In the developing retina, expression in the scleral and vitreal portions of both the ONBL and INBL were scored separately, along with whether the gene in question was expressed in all or only a subset of cells in the layer in question. In the case of the adult retina, cell identity in wild-type animals could be scored readily by laminar position of the cells expressing the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Rodiek1">Rodiek 1998</xref>), and thus the identity of expressing cells was scored directly.</p><p>Extracting order from the diversity of gene expression patterns observed in the developing nervous system can be a daunting task. It is not obvious how best to generate a useful taxonomy of these expression patterns. In tackling this problem, we found it useful to classify cellular expression patterns of genes both by eye and by clustering software. Both methods have specific advantages&#x02014;user classification more readily identifies rare but distinct patterns, while machine-based clustering allows more flexibility with respect to cluster number and appears to better accommodate classification of intermediate patterns. All classifications were based on the location of the ISH signal within the retinal layers over time during development. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref> contains the full list of expression patterns generated by visual inspection, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">Table S7</xref> has the full list of cellular expression clusters generated by clustering software.

Genes in these categories were expressed at some level in most cells of the developing and mature retina. This variability likely reflects the relative lack of specificity of the expression pattern in these clusters. The finding that most of the highly cell-specific clusters identified by user annotation were readily distinguished by the clustering software supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Using SAGE Data to Predict Cellular Expression Patterns in Developing Retina</title><p>Temporal changes in gene expression as measured by SAGE turn out to be a useful but inexact method of predicting cellular expression patterns of genes within the retina. While no SAGE cluster was invariably associated with a given cellular expression pattern, genes in certain late-onset SAGE clusters (e.g., clusters 1 and 22) were highly likely to be expressed in developing rods. In the case of early-onset gene expression patterns, which would likely be expressed in retinal progenitor cells, comparison to a microarray-based study could be made. Microarray profiling data of 4N progenitor enriched versus 2N cells has led to the identification of a number of these genes as being enriched in 4N progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Livesey2">Livesey et al. 2004</xref>). These genes were concentrated in a limited number of SAGE tag clusters (particularly clusters 5, 15, and 23), but were largely absent from clusters that showed a perinatal peak in expression (such as cluster 6), which were enriched for genes expressed in developing rods, bipolars, and amacrine cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st009">Table S9</xref> for a full breakdown of 4N-enriched genes by SAGE tag cluster).</p><p>In general, the temporal expression pattern observed in a given SAGE tag cluster was accurately reflected by the ISH data, although precise prediction of cellular expression patterns based on cluster data were not achieved. Clusters that showed postnatal peaks in expression, such as cluster 6, could contain a great diversity of cellular expression patterns, yet still be enriched for genes that showed strong expression in specific cell types that were differentiating. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st010">Table S10</xref>, which details the percentage of tags in a given cluster that represent each specific user-annotated expression pattern, can serve as a starting point for predicting the probability that a gene matching a given SAGE tag will show a given cellular expression pattern in the developing retina.</p><p>The expression clusters&#x02014;whether generated by user annotation or clustering software&#x02014;at best represent a lower limit to the number of distinct expression patterns within the developing retina. Although the number of distinct types of cells in the developing retina is not known, it is undoubtedly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-MacNeil1">MacNeil and Masland 1998</xref>). Particularly when considering genes expressed in subsets of cells in the ONBL, or subsets of developing amacrine cells, the level of resolution of our ISH-based screen does not allow one to distinguish many of the more complex patterns. Techniques such as multiple-probe fluorescence-based ISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Levsky1">Levsky et al. 2002</xref>) and single-cell microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Tietjen1">Tietjen et al. 2003</xref>) will be required to resolve such questions as whether individual cells coexpress genes that display complex expression patterns.</p><p>One interesting and potentially useful finding from the SAGE cluster data is that genes known to have highly selective cell-specific expression within a single retinal cell type could show different times of onset of expression. For instance, there is heterogeneity in the time of onset of expression among the genes that mediate rod phototransduction, a feature that has previously been reported in ferret retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-Johnson2">Johnson et al. 2001</xref>). Phototransduction genes were found in four different clusters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020247-t001">Table 1</xref>), with genes such as <italic>RPGRIP</italic> showing comparatively early onset of expression, followed by the progressively later onset timesof <italic>rod arrestin, rhodopsin,</italic> and, finally, <italic>G&#x003b1;1</italic> and <italic>GCAP1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st011">Table S11</xref> for a full list of tags corresponding to these genes). ISH confirmed the accuracy of the SAGE data for these onset times (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This heterogeneity of the time of onset of expression is observed for terminal differentiation markers of every cell type studied in the retina, as well as for markers of subsets of mitotic progenitor cells (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://134.174.53.82/cepko/">http://134.174.53.82/cepko/</ext-link> for the full set of ISH data).

We identified a large number of genes that showed selective expression at certain times during development in relatively small subsets of cells in the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020247-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). These include a large number of known and putative transcription factors, such as <italic>Sox2, Sox4, Tbx2, Eya2</italic> and <italic>Mbtd1</italic> (a novel polycomb family member), along with many genes of other functional classes.

In the first case, a single observer (S.B.) generated a presumptive minimal classification of expression patterns following visual inspection of each hybridization pattern (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref> for a full list). This subjective classification took into account a relatively informal assessment of signal intensity. This approach yielded a total of 72 distinct patterns, of which 19 contained only a single member. In the second case, laminar expression within the retina was scored on a 0&#x02013;5 point scale based upon visual inspection for each defined cell type in the prenatal, perinatal, and mature retina, and cluster analysis software was used to perform <italic>k-</italic>means clustering (using Euclidean distance) of cellular expression patterns (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">Table S7</xref> for the full data set). As with the cluster analysis of the SAGE data, in order to determine an optimal minimal number of clusters, the total distance among data points within the clusters of cellular expression data (within cluster dispersion) were plotted for cluster sizes from 10 to 65 over 100 simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st014">Table S14</xref>) using Euclidean distance measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020247-De1">De Hoon et al. 2004</xref>).

Statistically, when this actual sampling process is random enough, Poisson would be the most practical and reasonable assumption compared to other probability models. This assumption, with the assumption that each tag is uniquely mapped to a transcript, leads to the probability model used for clustering analysis of SAGE data (below).</p><p>First, all SAGE tags were assigned at random to <italic>k</italic> groups. Second, a cluster center, which led to the expected expression pattern of each tag, was calculated for each cluster. Chi-square test statistics were used to measure the distance between the observed expression pattern and the expected expression pattern of a tag in a cluster. Third, using an iterative method, tags were moved between clusters, and intra- and intercluster distances were measured with each move. Tags were allowed to remain in the new cluster only if they were closer to it than to their previous cluster. Fourth, after each move, the expression vectors for each cluster were recalculated. Last, the shuffling proceeded until moving any more tags made the clusters more variable, increasing intracluster distances and decreasing intercluster dissimilarity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for full details of the algorithms used, as well as Cai, et al. 2004 for a more detailed discussion of applications of the protocol).</p><p>To compute optimal values for the number of clusters <italic>k,</italic> the within-cluster dispersion was computed for increasing values of <italic>k</italic>.
