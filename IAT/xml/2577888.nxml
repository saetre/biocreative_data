Similar to cGSN, pGSN also binds actin, a major body protein that may be exposed or released by cellular injury. The consistent observation of lowered levels of pGSN in diverse states of acute injury and inflammation, such as hepatic failure, malaria, acute lung injury, myonecrosis, and cardiac injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Ito1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Suhler1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, has led to a hypothesis that it participates in the clearance of actin from the circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies have revealed that critical extents of pGSN depletion in patients subjected to trauma, burns, major surgery or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation correlate with poor outcomes, including death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-DiNubile1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Mounzer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the finding that pGSN binds inflammatory mediators such as platelet activating factor and lysophosphatidic acid suggests that its physiological function may be to localize inflammation and blunt its systemic effects, and that extensive pGSN depletion due to actin exposure following injury allows inflammatory mediators to cause widespread tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Osborn1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although tissue injury has not been clearly documented in early sepsis, low pGSN levels have been reported in sepsis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Suhler1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and a recent paper reported reduced pGSN levels in surgical sepsis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Wang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. From the available information, whether pGSN depletion results from surgery, sepsis or a combination thereof is unclear. However, animal models of sepsis reveal pGSN depletion within hours of septic challenge, and repletion of pGSN concentrations with recombinant pGSN reduces septic mortality. Moreover, circulating actin is detectable in the septic animals, and pGSN replacement converts it from an aggregated to a more soluble state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore undertook a pilot study to determine whether actin appears in the circulation of septic humans and if pGSN decreases correlate with outcomes in non-surgical sepsis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical sepsis database and plasma samples</title><p>Human plasma samples were selected from a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients admitted to adult intensive care units at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and all aspects of the study were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of MGH and the Harvard School of Public Health.

Patients were considered for inclusion in the cohort if they had any risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including sepsis, septic shock, trauma, aspiration, or multiple blood product transfusions. Patients were excluded if they were immunosuppressed, were under 18 years of age, if a comfort care directive was in place, or if they had chronic lung disease. Platelet poor plasma samples were generated from blood collected in EDTA-containing tubes obtained from patients within 24 hours of admission and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. We only included patients admitted between 2001&#x02013;2003 to minimized differences in clinical practices and then excluded those patients who had recently undergone surgical procedures (within one week of intensive care unit admission), or had concurrent diagnosis of ARDS.

After blocking the membrane overnight in 5&#x00025; non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05&#x00025; Tween 20, primary antibodies were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. To assay for plasma actin, a rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (A2103, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used at a 1&#x02236;2000 dilution. Bound primary antibodies were probed with HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG's (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) at 1&#x02236;2000 dilution.

In order to facilitate direct comparisons, pGSN levels and APACHE III scores were grouped into quartiles prior to analysis. Variables with p less than 0.1 in univariate analysis were then used as independent variables in a stepwise logistic regression analysis, with a p less than 0.05 criterion for retention of variables in the final model.

It is possible that the ELISA method used by Wang et al. may underestimate true levels of circulating pGSN.</p><p>Based on its actin-binding property, pGSN has been categorized as part of the extracellular &#x0201c;actin-scavenging&#x0201d; system that counteracts actin toxicity when actin is released into the extracellular space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, the degree of pGSN depletion should reflect the degree of tissue injury that may lead to significant exposure of actin to the extracellular space. Indeed, low pGSN levels associate with poor outcomes in trauma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Mounzer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and critically ill surgical patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Wang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and in patients who received a cytotoxic conditioning regimen prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-DiNubile1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our observation that circulating actin is detectable early in septic patients suggests that tissue injury occurs at or near the onset of sepsis. Similar observations have been made in animal models of sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The origin of the circulating actin in sepsis is not clear; however, microparticles generated from circulating blood cells and endothelium in sepsis are possible candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Joop1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Nieuwland1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Further investigation is warranted to test this speculation and to identify the location of the initial damage incurred in sepsis as the source of circulating actin.</p><p>In addition to protein molecules such as actin, A-&#x003b2; protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Chauhan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lind2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, pGSN binds and modulates bioactive lipids, such as endotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Bucki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Goetzl1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and platelet activating factor (PAF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Osborn1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. pGSN can interfere with PAF's ability to activate platelets and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Osborn1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect may partially explain how exogenous pGSN replacement significantly enhances survival of septic animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Lee3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and blunts the inflammatory response in animal models of lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-ChristofidouSolomidou1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003712-Rothenbach1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these data, we propose that pGSN functions as an important endogenous guard against overwhelming inflammation from tissue injuries. Therefore, a pGSN deficient state associated with sepsis may be a modifiable risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity. Additional studies are needed to explore pGSN's importance in sepsis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Part of the study has been presented in abstract form at the Society of Critical Care Medicine
