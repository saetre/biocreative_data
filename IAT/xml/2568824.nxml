In the absence of organotins, 100 nM cortisol increased GR-dependent expression of galactosidase activity 185-fold. HEK-293 cells that were transfected only with the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter showed background activity because HEK-293 cells express no or very low levels of endogenous GR. Upon simultaneous incubation of cells with DBT and cortisol, a dose-dependent inhibition of GR-mediated transactivation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). At 1 &#x000b5;M DBT, the inhibition was comparable with that of 1 &#x000b5;M RU486. Interestingly, the repeated exposure of cells to DBT increased the inhibitory effect on GR-mediated transactivation. Upon subjecting cells to eight changes of medium containing a given DBT concentration at 15 min intervals and preincubation for another 14 h, a two- to three-fold stronger inhibition of GR transactivation was observed than in cells that were preincubated for 16 h with the same DBT concentration (data not shown). In contrast to DBT, a slight stimulation of transactivation was found for TBT, reaching a maximal effect at 250 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Whereas DPT had no effect on GR-mediated transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), an up to two-fold stimulation was observed for TPT, with a 75&#x00025; increase of transactivation at 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

An important advance was the recent observation that the triorganotins TBT and TPT are potent activators of the nuclear hormone receptors RXR and PPAR&#x003b3; and that they promote adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that these organotins might contribute to the development of metabolic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Grun1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Nakanishi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the diorganotins DBT and DPT were found to be inactive toward RXR and PPAR&#x003b3; in these studies.</p><p>The pathophysiological effects of DBT have been less well studied and understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that DBT at nanomolar concentrations, but not other organotins investigated, disrupts GR function. In a recent study we showed that the organotins DBT, TBT, DPT and TPT inhibited the enzyme 11&#x003b2;-HSD2, which catalyzes the conversion of active 11&#x003b2;-hydroxyglucocorticoids into their inactive 11-keto derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Atanasov1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. IC<sub>50</sub> values of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 inhibition between 1 &#x000b5;M for TPT and 5 &#x000b5;M for DBT were obtained. Thus, while some organotins such as TPT may enhance local glucocorticoid effects by inhibiting 11&#x003b2;-HSD2-dependent glucocorticoid inactivation, DBT blocks GR activation at concentrations that are ten-fold lower than those effective on 11&#x003b2;-HSD2. Importantly, 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 is not expressed in HEK-293 and H4EII cells as well as THP-1 and native human macrophages that are used in the present study, and the observed effects of DBT are not caused by altered intracellular glucocorticoid metabolism. These observations suggest that different organotins cause distinct disturbances of corticosteroid hormone action <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The ability of DBT to inhibit GR function is relevant for human toxicity from two ways. First, humans are exposed to DBT through its use as a heat stabilizer in the production of PVC plastic materials (water distribution pipes, tubings and bottles) from which it can leach into drinking water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. And second, DBT is likely to be responsible for some of the toxicity of TBT in the environment, because earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicated that trialkylated organotins are mainly metabolized to their dialkylated forms by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes through hydroxylation and dealkylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Ueno2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

DBT was hardly degraded in the liver of treated mice, rats and guinea pigs, indicating that the relatively inert DBT may be responsible for some of the TBT toxicity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in the regulation of many physiological processes including the control of energy metabolism and the modulation of the immune system. Here, we demonstrate that DBT blocks the glucocorticoid-induced expression of hepatic PEPCK and TAT, two enzymes with a key role in energy metabolism. Furthermore, our results from experiments with LPS-stimulated native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages show that DBT is able to abolish the suppressive effect of glucocorticoids on the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6. By reducing the GR-dependent trans-repression of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, DBT disrupts the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids, which plays an important role for the resolution of inflammatory reactions.</p><p>Our results indicate that DBT disrupts GR-mediated regulation of gene transcription at the initial step of receptor activation by abolishing ligand binding to the receptor. The effects of DBT on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression in liver cells and in macrophages resembled those of RU486, supporting the evidence that DBT directly inhibits GR activity. The concentrations of DBT that affected GR-mediated gene expression in our experiments were close to those found in tissue and blood samples from human and wildlife in the range of 3&#x02013;300 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Whalen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Kannan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, DBT and TBT have fewer interactions with the GR than dexamethasone, DPT and TBT. TBT, DPT and TPT did not inhibit GR-mediated transactivation, suggesting that the inhibitory actions of DBT are due to binding to an allosteric site. This hypothesis is supported by DBT inhibition of GR-mediated transcriptional activity in the presence of 100 nM cortisol, which is over ten-fold higher than the K<sub>d</sub> of cortisol for GR. At this concentration, the steroid binding site on the GR will be occupied by cortisol.</p><p>Docking analysis identified a binding site for DBT close to Gln<sup>570</sup> on &#x003b1;-helix 3 and Arg<sup>611</sup> on &#x003b1;-helix 5. DBT has several van der Waals contacts with residues in this allosteric site on the GR. Analysis of DBT in this site in the apo-GR and holo-GR reveals that DBT alters the interaction of dexamethasone with the GR. Analysis of the GR with DBT in the apo-GR revealed a conformational change in the steroid binding pocket which results in steric clashes between dexamethasone and Gln<sup>570</sup> and Gln<sup>642</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Energy minimization of DBT in the holo-GR complex removed these steric clashes. However, after energy minization, Asn<sup>564</sup> moved and lost its stabilizing contact with the C11 hydroxyl on dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003545-g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The interaction between &#x003b1;-helix 3 and &#x003b1;-helix 5 is important in transcriptional activity of steroids for the GR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Zhang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Alteration of &#x003b1;-helix 3 by DBT occupying the allosteric site on the GR may explain how DBT inhibits dexamethasone binding to GR and its subsequent transcriptional activation.</p><p>Although neither TPT nor TBT altered GR-mediated transcriptional activity in the absence of cortisol, both of these organotins stimulated the activity of the GR-cortisol complex. Binding of TPT and TBT to other proteins of the transcriptional complex or effects on post-translational modifications of the receptor or its associated proteins could be important in TBT- and TPT-induced stimulation of GR-mediated transcription in the presence of cortisol.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that DBT, but not TBT, DPT or TPT, inhibits ligand binding to GR and subsequent stimulation of its transcriptional activity. Molecular modeling analyses indicate that binding to an allosteric site by DBT, but not by the other organotins, alters the orientation of key residues in the ligand binding pocket of the GR. Disruption of GR activation by DBT can disturb essential physiological processes such as the immune system, as shown by inhibition of glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Thus, by interfering with GR function, DBT may contribute to immune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Analysis of transcriptional activation of reporter genes</title><p>HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/L glucose, 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. 200,000 cells/well were seeded in poly-L-lysine coated 24-well plates, incubated for 16 h and transfected by the calcium-phosphate method with plasmid for human GR-&#x003b1; (0.1 &#x000b5;g/well), MMTV-lacZ &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter (0.15 &#x000b5;g/well) and pCMV-LUC luciferase transfection control (0.05 &#x000b5;g/well).

Relative quantification of PEPCK mRNA expression levels was performed on an ABI7600 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR reactions were performed in 96 well plates using 25 ng of cDNA, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and assay on demand primers and probes from Applied Biosystems (Mm01247057_g1) following the instructions from the manufacturer. The relative expression of each gene compared to the internal control &#x003b2;-actin was determined using the 2-&#x00394;CT method.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Determination of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity</title><p>H4IIE cells (300,000 cells/well in 6-wells plate) were allowed to adhere overnight, and then washed twice with serum- and steroid-free MEM followed by 16 h incubation with DBT. Dexamethasone (5 nM) was added, and cells were incubated for another 20 h, washed once with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2&#x00025; Nonidet-P40) supplemented with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor cocktail at a working dilution of 1 tablet in 25 ml (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). After centrifugation (10 min, 10'000&#x000d7;g, 4&#x000b0;C), cleared lysates were used to measure TAT activity. 50 &#x000b5;l of lysate (diluted in lysis-buffer) was added to 465 &#x000b5;l of reaction mix (90 mM potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25 mM L-tyrosine disodium, 90 mM &#x003b1;-oxoglutarate, pH 7.0, 0.45 mM pyridoxal-5&#x02032;-phosphate, pH 6.5) and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The reaction was stopped by adding 35 &#x000b5;l 10 N KOH, and after 30 min incubation at room-temperature, the absorbance at 331 nm against a blank (lysis buffer treated identically) was determined. The activity was normalized to protein content in cell lysates, as determined by BCA-solution (Pierce, Soccochim, Lausanne, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Analysis of cytokine production</title><p>THP-1 cells and native human monocytes (50,000 cells/well, 24-well plates) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from blood of non-smoking healthy male volunteers of age 25&#x02013;40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Tschopp1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Venous EDTA-blood (180 ml) was collected and left to sediment in 6&#x00025; dextran. Leukocytes were enriched for monocytes using a two-step discontinuous Percoll gradient (1.0791 and 1.0695 g/ml). The purity of isolated monocytes was 70&#x02013;80&#x00025;. Native human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by incubation for 7 days in culture medium without medium change, whereas THP-1 cells were differentiated by incubation with 5 ng/ml PMA for 72 h. The medium was replaced by fresh RPMI-1640 containing DBT, and cells were incubated for 16 h. Then, 10 nM dexamethasone and 30 ng/ml LPS were added and cells incubated for another 20 h before harvesting the medium and analysis of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; by ELISA (BD Biosciences, Allschwil, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Docking of organotins within human GR</title><p>The PDB files for DBT, TBT, DPT and TPT were obtained from CambridgeSoft's Chemfinder chemical compound database. Human GR (PDB&#x02236;1M2Z) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Bledsoe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> was extracted from the PDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Berman1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and converted into an apo-monomer using a text editor. Then, organotins were docked into human GR using Autodock 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Huey1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Morris1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The well depth and equilibrium separation for tin in DBT and other organotins were set to 0.63 kJ/mol and 4.40 &#x000c5;. Initially, the grid size was set to cover the entire receptor. Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) docking was run for 100 trials of 25 million energy evaluations each and a histogram of the binding energies for the various conformations was calculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003545-Morris1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This analysis identified two interior sites in the GR. One site overlapped the steroid-binding site. The other site was close to the A ring of dexamethasone. Several non-specific sites for TPT and other organotins were found on the surface of the GR. To analyze docking of organotins to sites with a specific mode of binding, we adjusted the grid to cover the interior of the GR and redid the docking as described above.</p><p>The organotin-GR complex calculated by Autodock was refined with Discover 3 software in Insight II, allowing the GR and the organotin to move to an energy minimum. Discover 3 was used with the ESSF force field and a distant dependent dielectric constant of 2 for 10,000 iterations in each energy minimization.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values are expressed as means&#x000b1;SD.
