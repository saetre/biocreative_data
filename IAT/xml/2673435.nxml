All subunits of RPA are essential for life, but the specific functions of the 32 and 14 kDa subunits remains unknown. The 32 kDa subunit (RPA2) has multiple domains, but only the central DNA-binding domain (called DBD D) is essential for life in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. To define the essential function(s) of RPA2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a series of site-directed mutant forms of DBD D were generated. These mutant constructs were then characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mutations had minimal effects on the overall structure and activity of the RPA complex. However, several mutants were shown to disrupt crosslinking of RPA2 to DNA and to dramatically lower the DNA-binding affinity of a RPA2-containing subcomplex. When introduced into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, all DBD D mutants were viable and supported normal growth rates and DNA replication. These findings indicate that RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions are not essential for viability and growth in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We conclude that DNA-binding activity of RPA2 is dispensable in yeast and that the essential function of DBD D is intra- and/or inter-protein interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein; RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity and low specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). RPA is highly conserved throughout evolution and has been found in all eukaryotes examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). RPA's two major functions are to bind ssDNA and to interact with proteins. These interactions are essential for cellular DNA replication, repair and recombination. RPA has also been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the coordination of DNA metabolism with other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>).</p><p>RPA is a heterotrimer composed of three structurally related subunits of 70, 32 and 14 kDa (RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, respectively). All three subunits are essential for formation of a stable, functional RPA complex, and all three genes have been shown to be essential in yeast (the gene for RPA1 is referred to as <italic>RFA1</italic>, RPA2 is <italic>RFA2</italic> and RPA3 is <italic>RFA3</italic> in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The 70 kDa subunit is composed of four OB fold domains required for both DNA and protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The 32 kDa subunit contains three domains: an N-terminal flexible domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), a central, essential, OB-fold domain designated DNA-binding domain (DBD) D and a C-terminal protein-interaction domain. The 14 kDa subunit contains only one domain; this OB-fold domain (DBD E) appears to be primarily a structural component of the RPA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) though contacts between it and ssDNA have recently been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>All of the OB folds in RPA can interact with ssDNA. Structural and crosslinking analyses suggest that the domains bind with a 5&#x02032; &#x02192; 3&#x02032; polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). Of the four domains in RPA1 (F, A, B and C), DBD A and B form a high-affinity DNA-binding core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), while DBD F and C both bind with weaker affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). DBD D in RPA2 has been shown to interact with DNA in the context of the heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>), but can also weakly bind DNA as a subcomplex with RPA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). DBD E in RPA3 has recently been shown to bind to telomere sequences and to contact ssDNA when the RPA complex binds to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The exact mechanism by which RPA modulates its interactions with various DNA substrates is unknown. RPA undergoes multiple conformational changes in the presence of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), which is in part dependent on the length of the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Analysis of RPA mutations in the conserved aromatic residues in each DBD imply that the different DBDs are involved in interactions with different lengths of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This is supported by cross-linking studies, where RPA1 associates more with DNA duplexes containing short (10 nt) ssDNA tails, but RPA2 is primarily crosslinked to DNA duplexes containing long (30 nt) ssDNA tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This may be functionally important, as RPA2 has been shown to initially cross-link to the growing DNA chain during DNA replication in isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The data discussed earlier have lead to several models of DNA binding by RPA and implicated RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions in regulation of RPA function. It has been suggested that DBDs A and then B, the high-affinity core, first bind to a small region of DNA. This is followed by binding of DBDs C and D to form a stable, 30-nt binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). There is also evidence for a tighter packing of RPA on ssDNA at high RPA to DNA ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In this 10-nt binding mode, it is thought that DBDs A and B are primarily interacting with the DNA. It has also been suggested that the interactions of DBD C and D with DNA are modulated by interactions with other proteins and that this regulates RPA function and promotes the departure of RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This model, called the handoff model, predicts that RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions are important for the cellular function of RPA.</p><p>There is little direct evidence on the role of RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. There have been two previous studies analyzing the function of RPA2 mutants (<italic>rfa2</italic>) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Mutations in <italic>RFA2</italic> have significant phenotypes including reduced growth, temperature sensitivity, DNA damage sensitivity and increased rates of spontaneous mutation. The most severe phenotypes have been observed with mutations in DBD D and DBD D domain is the only region RPA2 shown to be essential for viability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, several of the <italic>rfa2</italic> mutants with strong phenotypes also caused decreased protein stability and/or complex formation. Therefore, it is unresolved whether the phenotypes resulted from altered DBD D function or decreased structural stability. It is currently not known what activities of RPA2 are essential for RPA function in the cell.</p><p>The goal of these studies was to determine the role of DBD D of RPA2. Current studies have suggested three possible, but not mutually exclusive, functions for this domain: DNA-binding, regulation (protein interactions) and structural (complex formation). Using existing structures for RPA domains and the sequence homology between RPA domains, we have generated a series of mutant forms of yeast RPA2 with changes in predicted DNA-binding site of DBD D. These mutants were then analyzed for biochemical function and their ability to function in the cell. All mutant forms were able to form complexes with the other subunits of RPA <italic>in vitro</italic> and were viable <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several of the mutants had altered conformations based on cross-linking analysis and were sensitive to DNA damaging agents. However, these phenotypes did not correlate with reduced RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions. These studies demonstrate that RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions are not an essential function of this subunit. This analysis suggests that RPA2 is necessary for structural integrity and may also be needed for intra- and/or inter-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Oligonucleotides were synthesized by either Sigma (St Louis, MO) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).

Therefore, sequence homology was used to identify the putative DNA-binding interface of yeast RPA2. The crystal structure of the high-affinity DNA-binding core (DBD A and DBD B) of human RPA1 bound to DNA has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The structure of DBD A from the yeast 70 kDa subunit is similar to the homologous domain of human RPA and the residues that interact with DNA are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Mutation of individual polar residues that interact with DNA dramatically and additively decreased RPA's affinity for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). By analogy, we hypothesized that the DNA-interaction site of RPA2 would contain a combination of polar and aromatic residues that interact directly with DNA. Furthermore, we predicted that mutation of these residues would disrupt binding of RPA2 to DNA.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of human RPA1 core DBDs (DBD A and DBD B) were aligned with the DBD D sequences from yeast and human RPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

All the identified residues were highly conserved between the six sequenced <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genomes and showed partial conservations between more distantly related fungal species (data not shown). These residues were targeted as putative DNA-binding residues in our mutagenesis and each was mutated to alanines to disrupt the putative DNA-binding site of RPA2. Eight mutant genes were generated with each containing two to three of the putative DNA-interacting residues mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, two combination mutants, termed multi-mutants, were generated that contained seven (D80A, T82A, E97A, R99A, K100A, K146A, K147A) and six alanine (D80A, T82A, E103A, D104A, D158A, E162A) substitutions, these will be referred to as RPA2(MM1) and RPA2(MM2), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>RPA DBD D mutants.

However, because the structure of yeast RPA2 is not known and the role of individual regions of RPA2 poorly understood, these mutants were also analyzed to determine their effect on RPA2 DNA-binding and cellular function. Taken together, this set of mutations represents a directed alanine-scan of the DBD of RPA2.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical characterization of RPA2 mutants</title><p>Each of the mutant forms of RPA2 was expressed with the two other RPA subunits in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the resulting RPA complexes were purified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp090/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). All the mutant forms purified as heterotrimeric complexes with yields similar to that of wild-type RPA. This shows that all of the mutants were stable and interacted with the other two RPA subunits to from heterotrimeric complexes.</p><p>The DNA binding of the mutant RPA complexes was analyzed by gel mobility shift (GMSA) and FP assays. All the forms showed high-affinity binding in GMSA to oligonucleotides between 20 and 40 nt. The association constants determined for each of the heterotrimeric mutant complexes were not statistically different from that of wild-type RPA (data not shown). To try to define any subtle differences in DNA-binding activity, a subset of the mutants was also analyzed by fluorescence polarization (FP). FP is a direct technique that measures the anisotropy of a fluorescently labeled DNA probe when it is titrated with protein. An advantage of FP is that it can be used to directly determine apparent binding constants under a variety of solution conditions. Thus, it was possible to directly determine the binding constant under equilibrium conditions. RPA&#x02022;2(ERK), RPA&#x02022;2(DT), RPA&#x02022;2(MM1) and RPA&#x02022;2(MM2) had binding constants equivalent to wild-type RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, RPA&#x02022;2(WF) had slightly reduced binding to dT30 (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of RPA = 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> and <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> RPA&#x02022;2(WF) = 3.85 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.018). RPA&#x02022;2(MM1) and RPA&#x02022;2(MM2) had wild-type binding in all assays examined. Each of the multi-mutants contained three sets of mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These results strongly indicate that none of the mutations contained in the two multi-mutants (DT, ERK, KK, DE and ED) had a significant effect on binding either individually or in combination. We conclude that none of the mutant forms of RPA2 except for RPA&#x02022;2(WF) effect binding of the RPA complex to ssDNA but that the RPA complex containing RPA&#x02022;2(WF) has only a slightly reduced affinity for DNA. These data confirm previous work that showed that mutations in DBD D have only subtle effects on overall binding to DNA but that the aromatic mutant (W101A,F143F) reduced the affinity of DBD D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Affinity of yeast heterotrimeric RPA complexes containing mutations in RPA2 for dT30.

RPA2 has a low affinity for DNA in comparison with the high affinity of the RPA complex, making it difficult to determine the effects of RPA2 mutations on DNA binding of the trimer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In order to quantitate the DNA-binding activity of RPA2 directly, it was necessary to analyze binding of a subcomplex containing only the 32 and 14 kDa subunits. Therefore, we expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> RPA2/3 sub-complexes of two forms that had no phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> [wild type and RPA2(KF)] and two forms that had a phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> [RPA2(MM1) and RPA2(WF) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp090/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>)]. All four of these subcomplexes forms were expressed at high levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified with similar yields to wild-type RPA2/3 (data not shown). The affinity of each complex was then analyzed using FP assays.</p><p>Under near-physiological salt conditions (100 mM NaCl, 21 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), the binding of heterotrimeric RPA to dT30 was near stoichiometric; it saturated quickly at &#x0223c;10 nM protein and reached a maximal polarization value of &#x0223c;400 U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Under the same conditions, a wild-type RPA2/3 subcomplex required more than four orders of magnitude higher protein concentrations to bind the same amount of DNA; binding reached near saturation at a protein concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The physical limitations of the assay prevented analysis of higher concentrations of protein. This result indicated that the affinity of RPA2/3 for DNA is at least four orders of magnitude lower than that of the trimeric RPA complex. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Affinity of yeast dimeric RPA2/3 complexes containing mutations in RPA2 for dT30 under physiological salt conditions.

At higher ionic strength, essentially no binding of the RPA2/3 complex was observed (data not shown). At low ionic strength (30 mM KCl), saturation of binding was obtained at slightly lower protein concentrations and the polarization maximum obtained at saturation was similar to the level of polarization obtained with wild-type trimeric RPA (data not shown). These studies demonstrated that similar anisotropy values were obtained with both trimer and dimer RPA complexes under stoichiometric-binding conditions. Therefore, we fit the RPA2/3 subcomplex binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) assuming that polarization would have saturated at the same maximum polarization observed with the trimeric RPA. This allowed us to estimate the association constant of wild-type RPA2/3 for dT30 to be &#x0223c;1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

It was not possible to determine the absolute binding affinity for these mutant complexes. However, assuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) that the small changes in polarization signal observed with the mutants were caused by binding and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) that the isotherms would have saturated if sufficient protein was added, we estimated the maximum binding constants for each of the mutant subcomplexes (curves shown for mutant forms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This analysis provided estimates of the upper limit for the binding constants of these mutant forms: 10, 10 and 40% that of wild-type dimer for RPA2(KF)/3, RPA2(WF)/3 and RPA2(MM1)/3, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, insert).

We conclude that all three of these mutants have dramatically lower binding than the wild-type dimeric complex. These results demonstrate that these mutations in RPA2 significantly decreased RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions.</p><p>There was no correlation between <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype observed with these mutants and the DNA-binding affinity of DBD D. Of the three mutant forms examined, RPA2(MM1) had the strongest phenotype; however, this mutant also was estimated to have the highest affinity of the three mutant subcomplexes. RPA2(WF) had a phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> and effected binding of the trimeric RPA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) but appeared to have an intrinsic affinity for DNA that was similar to RPA2(KF), which has no phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>.

To try to understand the effects of the RPA2 mutation on the biochemical function of the RPA complex, we also examined the interactions of the trimeric RPA mutant complexes with primer template junctions. A single-stranded template strand was annealed with a 5&#x02032; radiolabel primer strand that then had a 4-thio-deoxyuridine incorporated on the 3&#x02032; terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Using different length template strands allowed us to create primer template junctions with either a 10 or 30-nt ssDNA tail. The DNA was then incubated with RPA at different protein:DNA ratios, UV irradiated to activate the photolabel, separated on an SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel, and autoradiography was performed to visualize crosslinked complexes. The extent of RPA2 cross-link is always compared with crosslinking of RPA1 as an internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Photoaffinity labeling of yeast trimeric RPA complexes containing mutations in RPA2.

This is thought to reflect intrinsic DNA-binding activity of RPA2 and its position in the RPA&#x02013;DNA complex. When crosslinking of the mutant complexes were examined with a 10-nt overhang, all showed reduced crosslinking of RPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). It has been observed previously that human wild-type RPA2 is crosslinked more efficiently with a 30-nt overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This increase was observed with all of the mutants examined (compare ratios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>C and 6D). In addition, we observed more variation in crosslinking with the 30-nt overhang. RPA&#x02022;2(DT) crosslinked at levels near wild-type RPA and the two mutant RPA&#x02022;2(WF) and RPA&#x02022;2(KF) had the lowest levels of crosslinking to the DNA (&#x0223c;20% and &#x0223c;40% of wild-type, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E and data not shown). These data do not distinguish whether these differences reflect a difference in the conformation of the RPA&#x02013;DNA complex or a change in the interactions of the mutant RPA2 subunit and the DNA (see also &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). RPA&#x02022;2(WF) had the lowest level of cross-linking of any of the mutant forms with both DNA substrates. This is consistent with RPA&#x02022;2(WF) being the only trimeric complex that had reduced affinity for ssDNA.</p><p>Two general conclusions can be drawn from the crosslinking experiments. First, the reduction in crosslinking observed with the 10-nt overhang suggests that these mutants are affecting the DNA-binding activity of DBD D or are changing the conformation of the RPA&#x02013;DNA complex in these RPA complexes. Second, the changes in crosslinking observed with both substrates do not correlate with activity in the cell: RPA&#x02022;2(WF) had the lowest level of crosslinking with both substrates and a modest repair phenotype, RPA&#x02022;2(KF) had reduced crosslinking with both DNA substrates but no phenotype, and RPA&#x02022;2(ERK) and RPA&#x02022;2(DT) had higher crosslinking with the 30-nt overhang but only (ERK) had a phenotype. This supports the general conclusion that the DNA-binding activity of RPA2 is not critical for RPA complex function in the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>RPA contains six DBDs. All these domains can interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Previous studies provide evidence for multiple interactions between the different DBDs of RPA and DNA. A variety of deletion and mutational analyses have indicated that DBD A and DBD B are both necessary and sufficient for high-affinity DNA binding by RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Electron microscopic analysis showed that human RPA binds as a compact form with short ssDNA substrates and as an elongated form with long ssDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Mutation of aromatic residues in four DBDs of yeast RPA indicate that DBD A and B are involved in binding to DNA of all lengths, whereas DBD C and D seem to contribute modestly to binding to long substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Two binding modes have been identified for yeast RPA; at low salt concentrations, a mode with an occluded binding site size of 18&#x02013;21 nt was observed while at high salt concentrations, a larger site size of 26&#x02013;28 nt was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Cross-linking analysis has also demonstrated that multiple domains of RPA are in close proximity to the primer-template junction when RPA binds to partially duplex-ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These types of interactions are also observed <italic>in situ</italic>, where RPA2 is initially crosslinked to nascent RNA&#x02013;DNA primers but RPA1 becomes crosslinked as the primers are elongated into Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Together these and other data have been used to suggest that different domains of RPA bind sequentially to form different complexes depending on the length of the DNA bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the positioning and weak DNA affinity of RPA2 is used to modulate RPA&#x02013;DNA binding through interactions with other proteins in a &#x02018;hand-off&#x02019; model of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>To test these models and to gain a better understanding of the role of RPA2&#x02013;DNA binding, we generated and characterized a series of polar or aromatic residue to alanine mutations in yeast DBD D with the intent of disrupting RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions. These mutations primarily affected residues in the putative DNA-binding cleft of DBD D but also included some residues predicted to be in other regions of the domain. These mutants were then analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. None of these mutant forms affected the formation of the RPA complex <italic>in vitro</italic> or the stability of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. All these mutant <italic>rfa2</italic> alleles were also viable and supported normal DNA replication in yeast. Three of the mutant <italic>rfa2</italic> strains (<italic>rfa2-ERK, rfa2-MM1</italic> and <italic>rfa2-WF</italic>) were found to have modest DNA-repair phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>. All three strains contained mutations of residues in the putative DNA-binding cleft and one mutant [RPA2(WF)] caused reduced binding of the trimeric RPA complex. However, other mutant forms examined also had mutations in the putative DNA-binding cleft (<italic>rfa2</italic>-<italic>DT</italic>, <italic>rfa2-KK, rfa2-ED</italic> and <italic>rfa2-MM2</italic>) and had no discernable phenotype in yeast. Thus, there was no simple correlation between the location of the mutations and their effect on cell function. Direct analysis of DNA-binding activity of the mutated subunits and crosslinking efficiency also did not simply correlate to the phenotypes of the mutants. For example, RPA2(KF), which had low ssDNA binding, reduced crosslinking to primer template junctions but no phenotype. In contrast, mutant RPA2(MM1) had a higher affinity for DNA but also had the strongest DNA damage phenotype. These data argue that RPA2&#x02013;DNA interactions are not essential for RPA function in cell viability and growth.</p><p>The &#x02018;hand-off&#x02019; model was originally proposed based on analysis of protein interactions in SV40 DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This model suggests that the winged helix of RPA2 recruits proteins and allows them to gain access to the DNA by displacing DBD C and D from the DNA. Although our findings do not rule out a role for the winged-helix domain of RPA2 in protein recruiting, they argue that interactions with DNA are not essential for RPA2 function and indicate that the &#x02018;hand-off&#x02019; model is not occurring in yeast. This is not surprising as yeast cells with a deletion of the winged helix survive and have no or minimal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>). Deletion of the winged helix in yeast also only has a marginal effect on the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>If the DNA-binding activity of RPA2 is not essential, what is the essential activity of this domain? At minimum, RPA2 is necessary for the formation of the RPA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In addition, a number of protein-interactions have been mapped to RPA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) indicating that DBD D could also be participating in essential protein contacts. Other DBDs in RPA, DBD A and DBD F in RPA1 also interact with both proteins and DNA in their respective binding clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). In the case of RPA2, protein interactions may be the predominant, critical function.</p><p>The model that RPA2 has an essential function in addition to complex formation is supported by analysis of RPA in plants. The deepwater rice, <italic>Oryza satvia</italic>, has multiple genes encoding RPA1 and RPA2 subunits but only one RPA3 gene. Three distinct forms of RPA are found in <italic>O. satvia</italic>, each contains one of the RPA1 and RPA2 gene products and all contain the common RPA3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). These three RPA complexes have different expression and intracellular localization patterns suggesting that they have different roles in the cell. Since these functionally different RPA complexes have different RPA2 subunits but share a single RPA3 subunit, it is most likely that the RPA2 subunits have functions in addition to complex formation. Multiple RPA genes and complexes also seem to exist in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where mutations in one gene for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RPA1 are lethal but mutations in another RPA1 gene only cause DNA damage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>Humans also contain a second RPA2-related gene. This RPA2-like subunit (called RPA4) is expressed in certain human tissues and in some cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). RPA4 has 47% identity with RPA2 and can form a complex with RPA1 and RPA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). It is also interesting to note that RPA4 is reported to be predominantly expressed in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). This suggests that like plants, humans may have different RPA2/RPA4 in actively replicating versus mature tissues. This also supports DBD D having functions in non-complex related, tissue-specific functions. Further studies are needed to define which protein interactions are needed for RPA2 function.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp090/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Institutes of Health Research Grant [GM44721 to M.S.W.]; Russian Fund for Basic Research and the Program of Presidium of RAS &#x02018;Molecular and Cellular Biology&#x02019; [N08-04-00704 to O.L.]; American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship [0310046 to A.M.D.].
