Novel treatment approaches are required which attack the unique molecular and biological features that contribute to the growth of these tumors. A particularly promising target is the abnormal tumor vasculature, which represents one of the defining characteristics of the most malignant and common astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We previously compared the gene expression profile of endothelial cells isolated from freshly resected GBMs with that of endothelium isolated from non-neoplastic temporal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These experiments and subsequent studies identified 21 genes that met the statistical requirements as putative glioma endothelial markers (GEMS). One especially promising candidate was <italic>TEM1/endosialin</italic>.</p><p><italic>TEM1 </italic>was identified in the tumor endothelium of human colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Soon after, it was recognized that <italic>TEM1 </italic>encoded endosialin, which corresponded to the tumor vascular endothelial antigen recognized by the FB5 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further analyses revealed selective <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression in tumor endothelium, pericytes and a subset of fibroblast-like cells of tumor stroma in breast carcinoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein and putative membrane receptor. Recent evidence suggests it may interact with extracellular matrix components including collagen I, collagen IV and fibronection, as well as Mac-2 BP/90K in promoting vascular migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>knockout (KO) mice are fertile and appear to develop normally. However, when human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were implanted orthotopically onto the serosal surface of the large intestine of nude <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO mice, both tumor take and growth were inhibited while the number of tumor microvessels increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The selective induction of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>in malignant gliomas, its cell surface bioavailability and the evidence that lack of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>can disrupt tumor growth and vascular differentiation in a xenograft model combine to make it a potential target for molecular therapy.</p><p>We sought to expand these preliminary findings by examining the specificity of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression in a larger collection of primary and secondary brain tumors. We also wished to determine whether <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>induction in brain tumors was conserved in a commonly used U87MG intracranial xenograft model. Finally, we wished to determine whether <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression was required for brain tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. We confirm that <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>is induced, primarily in the vascular compartment, in a wide range of both low-grade and high-grade cerebral neoplasms and is inversely correlated with patient age. TEM1/endosialin shows limited co-localization with fibronectin, a putative binding partner, in malignant brain tumors. <italic>In vitro</italic>, <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression can be stimulated in human microvascular endothelial cells grown in matrigel. Finally, we show that <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>upregulation occurs in the tumor vasculature of intracranial GBM xenografts and absence of <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>is associated with increased numbers of microvessels within tumors explanted from <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO mice, supporting a role for <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>in the migration and maturation of the brain tumor vasculature. However, despite its conserved expression pattern in the tumor cerebrovasculature, we find that <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>is not required for intracranial tumor growth in <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Clinical specimens</title><p>Clinical specimens were provided by the Brain Tumor Bank of the University of Pittsburgh as approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and the Neurosurgical Brain Tissue Bank of the University of Rochester as approved by the University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board.

Sections were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated in graded ethanols. DIG-labeled RNA probe cocktails were diluted to 200 ng/ml in RNA hybridization solution (EMD Bioscience, Madison, WI) and hybridized to slides overnight at 55&#x000b0;C. Slides were treated with RNase A/T1 (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stringently washed. Slides were blocked with normal rabbit IgG (Dako) diluted 1:20 in buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% casein). For detection, sections were incubated with rabbit HRP-anti-DIG primary (Dako) diluted 1:150 in blocking buffer. Signal was amplified by incubating each slide with one drop of biotinyl-tyramide (Dako).

In GBMs, 3/9 tumors or approximately 33% of the tissues demonstrated a robust staining pattern for <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>(nearly 100% of vessels positive), while another 2/9 tumors showed moderate expression (approximately 50% of vessels positive) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Little to no expression of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>was noted in normal adult tissues. Alternate studies have argued that TEM1/endosialin in the tumor vasculature is expressed by vessel-associated pericytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Two additional reports identified TEM1/endosialin in populations of VEGFR2<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>/VE-cadherin<sup>+ </sup>endothelial precursor cells derived from CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells or in CD45<sup>+</sup>/VE-cadherin<sup>+ </sup>"vascular leukocytes" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both cell types have been proposed to contribute to tumor vascularization, although the degree to which either one incorporates into tumor vessels remains controversial. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells immortalized with SV40 large/small T-antigen, a model of proliferating neovascular endothelial cells, also express <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We argue that <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>is expressed to varying degrees by tumor endothelial cells, pericytes and stromal fibroblasts. In normal blood vessels, the pericytes bind tightly to endothelial cells and influence migration, stabilization and maturation of the endothelium. In the cerebrovasculature, pericytes are additionally critical for maintenance of the differentiated blood-brain barrier (BBB) and failure of the BBB in brain tumors is associated with disruption and loss of pericytes lining endothelial cells. Pericytes are of emerging interest as therapeutic targets as vessels may be more sensitive to chemotherapy or radiotherapy when denuded of pericytes. When Bergers, <italic>et al</italic>., targeted both the endothelial cell and pericyte compartments with combinatorial receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory (RTKI) therapies, they achieved more favorable responses than with either therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cao, <italic>et al</italic>., demonstrated that systemic overexpression of Ang2 blocked pericyte recruitment to tumor vessels and led to massive vascular destabilization and tumor suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The collective data support the hypothesis that <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>has a favorable expression profile for targeting both the endothelial and pericytic portions of the tumor vasculature.</p><p>Expression of TEM1/endosialin by a subset of tumor fibroblasts may also influence tumor growth and angiogenesis. Activated tumor fibroblasts contribute to the deposition of fibronectin, collagen I and collagen IV, all of which may bind TEM1/endosialin and guide vessel invasion, migration or differentiation. SDF-1 expression by activated tumor fibroblasts has been shown to drive tumor progression and angiogenesis in breast carcinoma models and has been reported to recruit endothelial progenitor cells to the microvasculature of murine gliomas, where differentiation into both pericytes and endothelium was detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A recent genetic study reported that TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment of proliferating endothelial cells led to an endothelial-mesenchymal transition, wherein endothelial cells downregulated CD31 and upregulated fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1). They confirmed the presence of FSP1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>+ </sup>intermediate cells in tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further work is necessary to fully determine the complete expression profile of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>and its relationship to these intricately related stromal cell populations.</p><p>In the US, primary brain tumors are diagnosed in approximately 40,000 new patients a year. In addition, brain metastases occur in 20-40% of cancer patients, leading to 200,000-400,000 new cases of brain metastases a year. Despite differences in the molecular fingerprints of the tumor cells themselves, it may be possible to identify common changes in the vasculature of these disparate tumor types. Initial studies by ourselves and others reported <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>upregulation in human brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We wanted to expand these findings in order to better establish the full extent of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression in brain tumors. This study confirms expression of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>at the RNA and protein level in astrocytic and metastatic brain tumors, with little to no expression in normal control brain. Expression was primarily limited to the tumor vasculature but occasional stromal cells also stained for <italic>TEM1/endosialin</italic>. Greater than 30% of GBMs displayed robust <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression, while lesser percentages of lower grade tumors expressed <italic>TEM1/endosialin</italic>. Unfortunately, we did not know whether the individual specimens analyzed were from the tumor center or closer to the tumor margin. Preliminary mouse xenograft data suggested that Tem1/endosialin staining was increased along the tumor margin, but this needs to be further investigated in both clinical and mouse tumors. It will be especially useful to assess <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>expression in future experiments using xenografted primary glioma spheroids or glioma stem cells, which grow as a more highly invasive intracranial tumor than the U87 model, although with less pronounced angiogenesis. Interestingly, one pilocytic astrocytoma displayed robust expression of <italic>TEM1/endosialin</italic>. Although pilocytic astrocytomas are considered low-grade tumors, they are highly angiogenic and often enhance on MRI, which is indicative of vascular leakiness, disruption of the blood-brain barrier and often more aggressive disease. A recent study in breast cancer identified an association between <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression and progressive and/or recurrent disease as well as nodal involvement, all hallmarks of a more aggressive disease state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, TEM1/endosialin may have prognostic value for breast cancer. We did detect a statistically significant (p = 0.004) inverse correlation between <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression in astrocytomas and patient age, although the implications of this remain unclear. While diagnosis at a younger age can be a predictor of long-term survival for GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], our initial analyses reveal no difference in survival between <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expressing and non-expressing tumors.</p><p>Tomkowicz, <italic>et al</italic>. recently identified collagen types I and IV and fibronectin as potential ligands for TEM1/endosialin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They showed that CHO cells engineered to overexpress TEM1/endosialin (CHO-TEM1) exhibited greater adhesion to fibronectin than control CHO cells (CHO-K1). They suggested a model by which TEM1/endosialin is induced in cells associated with endothelium and stromal fibroblasts. The subsequent interactions between TEM1/endosialin expressing cells and fibronectin, collagen I or IV present in the extracellular matrix drive cellular migration required for tumor invasion and angiogenesis. In an independent study, TEM1/endosialin and collagen IV were shown to colocalize in finger-like processes during angiogenic development in the human fetal telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We had identified collagen I and collagen IV as putative glioma endothelial markers which exhibited a minimum 4-fold induction as compared to normal endothelial cell samples and were induced in both glioma and colon carcinoma endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, we were curious to determine whether we could detect co-localization of fibronectin with TEM1/endosialin in our primary and secondary tumor samples. We did detect upregulation of both TEM1/endosialin and fibronectin within the same tumor specimens, although only a subset of the samples showed co-localization along the vasculature, supporting a physiologic interaction of these proteins. In addition, Tomkowicz and colleagues showed that the CHO-TEM1 cells, but not CHO-K1 control cells, grew with web-like morphology and formed large clusters when cultured in matrigel. The CHO-TEM1 cells also exhibited enhanced migration through matrigel that was blocked by incubation with a humanized antibody targeted against TEM1/endosialin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Others have shown that incubation with anti-TEM1/endosialin antibodies can block tube formation by endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>data showed that human endothelial cells grown in matrigel induce TEM1/endosialin themselves in response to the culture environment. Together, the biochemical and localization data support a functional role for TEM1/endosialin in promoting cell-cell interactions and migration during tumor angiogenesis.</p><p>Since the expression profile of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>and existent xenograft data suggested <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>might be a viable therapeutic target for brain tumors, we wished to ascertain whether <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>induction was conserved in an orthotopic model of GBM. Intracranial U87MG xenografts demonstrated robust upregulation of <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>in the tumor vasculature with little to no expression in non-neoplastic brain. Again, staining was predominantly present in the vessels, although we could detect staining in occasional tumor stromal cells. Interestingly, when we implanted U87MG cells engineered to stably overexpress VEGF, a small percentage of tumor cells stained positive for human <italic>TEM1/endosialin</italic>, although there was no significant difference in <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>staining in the mouse vessels (BNW, unpublished data).</p><p>When we implanted intracranial GBM xenografts into nude <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO and WT mice, we detected no difference in tumor take or survival. This differs from the colon carcinoma data and suggests that the impact of Tem1/endosialin in the cerebral microenvironment may differ from its role in intestinal tumorigenesis. Nanda, <italic>et al</italic>., reported a significant decrease in tumor take and volume when they implanted colon carcinoma xenografts into the large intestine of nude <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, they did not detect a difference in tumor growth when identical cells were implanted subcutaneously into KO and WT animals. They argued that this emphasized the importance of an anatomically relevant microenvironment for tumor growth and study. This is a similar argument to that proposed by Camphausen, <italic>et al</italic>., who compared the expression profiles of U87MG and U251MG GBM cell lines grown <italic>in vitro </italic>to those from cells grown as subcutaneous or intracranial xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. They noted that the expression profiles in tissue culture were significantly different from the subcutaneous profiles, which were, in turn, distinct from the intracranial expression profiles. The disparity between GBM xenograft expression profiles suggested that the orthotopic implantation site can dictate gene expression, presumably due to signaling between the tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. In the current scenario, it would again appear that <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>expression levels within distinct anatomical compartments differentially influence tumor growth and pathology. Importantly, the data suggest that inhibition of <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>function alone in tumors is insufficient for suppression of brain tumor growth.</p><p>Despite unchanged tumor growth and equivalent animal survival between <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>WT and KO animals, we did detect an increase in the number of microvessels present in the KO GBM tumors. This strengthens a role for TEM1/endosialin in the maturation of the tumor neo-vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. TEM1/endosialin was recently reported to be upregulated by hypoxia via a HIF-2 pathway in a limited number of cell lines, although we could detect no induction in primary human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the brain is a highly vascularized site, and it may be that the level of oxygenation is sufficient to promote xenograft growth in the absence of <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>induction. It is more likely <italic>TEM1/endosialin </italic>is directly or indirectly required for differentiation or maturation of the vasculature, as opposed to strict proliferation, and that lack of TEM1/endosialin protein leads to the overabundance of vessels demonstrated in the knockout mouse tumors. Further studies are needed to determine if the increased vascularity of the <italic>Tem1/endosialin </italic>KO tumors could render them more sensitive to radiation or chemotherapy, by enhancing the delivery of radiosensitizing oxygen or therapeutic drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined tumor data confirm that TEM1/endosialin contributes to the development of the brain tumor vasculature. Although lack of TEM1/endosialin expression did not inhibit brain tumor growth in our model, the cell surface bioavailability of TEM1/endosialin and its localization to tumor and tumor vasculature components in both primary and metastatic brain tumors, both diseases with limited current treatment options, support efforts to target this protein with alternative approaches, including antibody or antibody-cytotoxin based strategies, such as a recently reported anti-TEM1/endosialin IgG conjugated to saporin, and other efforts in pre-clinical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or as combination therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EBC-W designed the studies, contributed ISH and IH experiments and analysis and wrote the manuscript.
