Adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Adiponectin receptor type 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA was detected in the cells by RT-PCR. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological AMP kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR), in the cells. AdipoR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection potently knocked down the receptor mRNA, and the effect of this knockdown persisted for as long as 10 days after the transfection. The transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA, as determined by real-time PCR, and reduced ALP activity and mineralization, as determined by von Kossa and Alizarin red stainings. In contrast, AMP kinase activation by AICAR (0.01&#x02013;0.5 mM) in wild-type MC3T3-E1 cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. BrdU assay showed that the addition of adiponectin (0.01&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml) also promoted their proliferation. Osterix, but not Runx-2, appeared to be involved in these processes because AdipoR1 siRNA transfection and AICAR treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mRNA expression, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cumulative evidence has shown that there is a positive correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and fat mass, suggesting that body fat and bone mass are related to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several studies on adipocyte function have revealed that not only is adipose tissue an energy-storing organ but it also secretes a variety of biologically active molecules, which are named adipocytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Adiponectin is one of the adipocytokines specifically and highly expressed in adipose tissue. It is also abundantly present in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and has been proposed to play important roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two adiponectin receptor subtypes, adiponectin receptor type 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), have been identified; these mediate the biological effects of adiponectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in the muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several studies indicate that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin, respectively, and that their stimulation by adiponectin results in increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) and PPAR&#x003b1; ligand activities as well as fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in the liver and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, the expression levels of AdipoR seem to be very important for adiponectin sensitivity. Obesity decreases AdipoR expression levels, thereby reducing adiponectin sensitivity and enhancing insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Genetic variations in AdipoR have been reported to be linked to a common genetic predisposition to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that adiponectin and its receptors are also expressed in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting that adiponectin may carry signals and may have a function in bone tissue as well. However, there have been only few studies on the physiological actions of adiponectin on osteoblasts, and thus this issue requires further clarification.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the abovementioned issue in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells using AdipoR inhibition by its small interfering RNA (siRNA) and AMP kinase activation by its pharmacological activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-&#x003b2;-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The results showed that adiponectin promoted the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells possibly via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase pathways, suggesting that adiponectin might cause osteoblastogenesis via AMP kinase activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of adiponectin receptors and knockdown by siRNA transfection</title><p>We first investigated AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expressions in MC3T3-E1 cells.

To elucidate the action of adiponectin through AdipoR1, we performed experiments using an RNA interference to block the receptor expression. Real-time PCR revealed that a treatment with 50-nM siRNA-AdipoR1 blocked the expression of AdipoR1 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), while a treatment with cyclophilin B (CypB) siRNA blocked the expression of CypB mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), showing that the knockdown effect of siRNA-AdipoR1 was specific. The effect of knockdown by siRNA-AdipoR1 persisted for as long as 10 days after the transfection, when the expression level was still suppressed by 85.1% in comparison to that in the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Adiponectin R1 and R2 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells and effects of siRNA-AdipoR1 transfection.

However, little is known about the physiological action of adiponectin on osteoblasts. In this study, we demonstrated that osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells expressed AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2. We found that the suppression of AdipoR1 expression by its siRNA inhibited the differentiation and mineralization of the cells, and we suggested that adiponectin promoted these processes through the action of AdipoR1 on the osteoblasts. We also found that adiponectin activated AMP kinase in the cells, and that AICAR, a pharmacological AMP kinase activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], promoted the differentiation and mineralization of the cells. Both adiponectin and AICAR also stimulated the proliferation of the cells. Taken together, adiponectin seemed to promote the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells possibly via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathway. Recent studies have also shown that adiponectin promotes osteoblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and exerts an enhancing action on human osteoblast differentiation and mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although we did not carry out experiments using the inhibitor or siRNA of AMP kinase, our results seem to be consistent with those reported in these studies. Further, we disclosed the involvement of the AMP kinase signaling pathway in the stimulatory actions of adiponectin on osteoblasts.</p><p>Luo et al. have reported that the adiponectin concentration in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was approximately 60 &#x003bc;g/ml, which was about six-fold higher than that in human serum. They have shown that the addition of FBS into the medium actually enhances the ALP activity of primary human osteoblasts; however, the addition of adiponectin-free FBS does not enhance the activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the influence of adiponectin, which is present in high concentrations in FBS, must be ignored when the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts in long cultures are examined. In this study, we knocked down the expression of AdipoR1 by transfecting its siRNA and investigated how the lack of adiponectin action in the microenvironment of MC3T3-E1 cells would affect the cell functions. There seem to be two advantages of using MC3T3-E1 cells as a model system to study the role of adiponectin signaling on osteoblast growth and differentiation. First, since the cells produce adiponectin endogenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], there is no need to add adiponectin to the cultures. Second, since the present study and a previous one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed that the cells do not express AdipoR2, data interpretation will not be complicated by the compensatory effect of AdipoR2 after the siRNA knockdown of AdipoR1. By reducing AdipoR1 expression through its siRNA transfection, we were able to demonstrate that endogenously produced adiponectin was important in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation as well as in matrix mineralization.</p><p>Shinoda et al. have shown that there were no abnormalities in the bone mass or turnover of either adiponectin-deficient mice or adiponectin-transgenic mice that overexpressed adiponectin in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. They have reported that circulating adiponectin suppresses osteoblastogenesis through the endocrine pathway, while local adiponectin stimulates it through the autocrine/paracrine pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additionally, they have suggested that these contradictory effects of adiponectin might explain no apparent bone changes in its gene-modified mice. In this study, we found that the blockage of the AdipoR1 expression by transfecting its siRNA inhibited the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Since this siRNA transfection obstructed not only the autocrine/paracrine pathway of adiponectin but also its endocrine pathway, cytokine might play an important role in the activation of osteoblasts in the microenvironment of bone marrow.</p><p>Yokota et al. have shown that adiponectin is also found in bone marrow fat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and Berner et al. have shown that the level of adiponectin is higher in diluted bone marrow fluid than in the serum of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These facts suggest that fat cells as well as bone cells might contribute to the production and high concentration of adiponectin found in bone marrow. Because adiponectin receptors are known to be expressed ubiquitously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], it is possible that adiponectin can influence not only osteoblasts but also other lineages of bone marrow cells. In fact, adiponectin has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on B lymphopoiesis and a stimulatory effect on myelopoiesis in bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, further studies seem to be necessary to clarify the interplay among osteoblasts and other cells in the biological actions of adiponectin in the microenvironment of bone marrow.</p><p>Runx-2 has been identified as an important transcription factor that is involved in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that the stimulatory actions of adiponectin and AICAR on MC3T3-E1 cells in this study might be mediated by this transcription factor. However, neither of these agents affected mRNA or protein expressions of Runx-2, suggesting that the transcription factor might be not involved in the stimulatory effects of adiponectin on MC3T3-E1 cells. On the other hand, there remains a possibility that the Runx-2 activity can be altered by the adiponectin signaling pathway. It has been demonstrated that Runx-2 was activated by Erk via phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the Erk activity was reported to be not altered by adiponectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it is not clear from our current experiments whether the adiponectin downstream effector AMP kinase can phosphorylate Runx-2 either directly or indirectly. Alternatively, we indicated that Osx mRNA expression was enhanced by adiponectin and AICAR. Although Osx is generally regarded as the downstream effector of Runx-2, the upregulation of Osx mRNA has been reported without the alteration of Runx-2 mRNA levels or in the absence of Runx-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that Osx and Runx-2 can be differently regulated and Osx can modulate osteoblastic function independent of Runx-2. Moreover, Shinoda et al. have recently shown that adiponectin activates the intracellular signaling of insulin in bone marrow cells through the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt, the main downstream molecules of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], thereby suggesting that insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways might be alternative candidates for mediating the stimulatory effects of adiponectin on osteoblasts.</p><p>The biological effects of adiponectin are known to be mediated through the two adiponectin receptor subtypes AdipoR1 and R2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which subsequently activate AMP kinase, PPAR&#x003b1; ligand, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and regulate fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. AMP kinase is a highly conserved heterotrimeric signaling kinase responsive to hypoxia, exercise, and cellular stress, and it is associated in a variety of cellular responses, including suppression of gluconeogenesis in the liver, promotion of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, inhibition of fatty acid and sterol synthesis, increase in fatty acid oxidation, and inhibition of lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, there exists little or no information about the potential roles of this signaling molecule in bone metabolism. In this study, we found that AMP kinase activation promoted the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. AMP kinase is known to have the ability to phosphorylate and inactivate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoid compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Statins, which also inactivate HMG-CoA reductase, have been shown to promote osteoblastogenesis via cellular BMP-2 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, further studies are necessary to investigate whether or not the activation of AMP kinase would inactivate HMG-CoA reductase in MC3T3-E1 cells and enhance their differentiation and mineralization.</p><p>A couple of studies have revealed that there are interplays between the AMP kinase pathway and the MAPK pathway in the cellular responses of osteoblasts as well as the islet cells in the pancreas. Kefas et al. have previously shown that the prolonged activation of AMP kinase by AICAR promotes apoptosis of the beta cells in the islets through a sequential activation of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Luo et al. have reported that the adiponectin-induced proliferative response of human osteoblasts was mediated by the AdipoR/JNK pathway, while the differentiation response was mediated via the AdipoR/p38 MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although we found that the stimulatory effects of adiponectin on MC3T3-E1 cells might be mediated by AMP kinase, these previous results suggest that the involvement of MAPK or other pathways must also be investigated in future.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions in the microenvironment of cultured cells.
