Mechanosensitive osteocytes are important during the osteogenic response. The growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis plays a key role during regulation of bone formation and remodeling. Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are able to modulate IGF activity. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of IGFBP-2 in the translation of mechanical stimuli into bone formation locally in rat tibiae. Female Wistar rats were assigned to three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 5): load, sham, and control. The four-point bending model was used to induce a single period of mechanical loading on the tibial shaft. The effect on IGFBP-2 mRNA expression 6 hours after stimulation was determined with nonradioactive <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on decalcified tibial sections. Endogenous IGFBP-2 mRNA was expressed in trabecular and cortical osteoblasts, some trabecular and subendocortical osteocytes, intracortical endothelial cells of blood vessels, and periosteum. Megakaryocytes, macrophages, and myeloid cells also expressed IGFBP-2 mRNA. Loading and sham loading did not affect IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in osteoblasts, bone marrow cells, and chondrocytes. An increase of IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive osteocytes was shown in loaded (1.68-fold) and sham-loaded (1.35-fold) endocortical tibial shaft. In conclusion, 6 hours after a single loading session, the number of IGFBP-2 mRNA-expressing osteocytes at the endosteal side of the shaft and inner lamellae was increased in squeezed and bended tibiae. Mechanical stimulation modulates IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in endocortical osteocytes. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays a role in the lamellar bone formation process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mechanical loading</kwd><kwd>Four-point bending system</kwd><kwd>Nonradioactive <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</kwd><kwd>IGFBP-2 mRNA expression</kwd><kwd><italic>In vivo</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><p>Mechanical stimulation is important for the maintenance of the skeleton of humans and other animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bone serves as a structural support for the body and has the ability to modify its architecture throughout life. Mechanical stimulation regulates bone mass and architecture according to Frost&#x02019;s mechanostat hypothesis. Physical activity results in increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, whereas inactivity has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis plays an important role in the regulation of bone remodeling. Of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-I is predominantly expressed in rat bone and IGF-II is predominantly expressed in human bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. IGFs are involved in bone formation after mechanical stimulation. Mechanical loading upregulates IGF-I mRNA expression in osteocytes, as shown in rat vertebra by Lean and colleagues using the caudal vertebra compression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Northern blot analysis also showed enhanced periosteal IGF-I mRNA expression after mechanical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Besides an increase in IGF-I mRNA synthesis, Bravenboer and colleagues reported upregulation of IGF-I protein concentration in bone after mechanical stimulation using additional weight bearing in running rats (rat-with-backpack) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>As in other tissues, the autocrine and paracrine actions of IGFs in bone are modulated by a family of six structurally related binding proteins, the IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs can be synthesized by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and are capable of modulating the effects of IGFs by potentiating or inhibiting their action; some IGFBPs also have IGF-independent actions that can either inhibit or stimulate cellular function.</p><p>Since rat osteoblasts do not express IGFBP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it is most likely that IGFBP-1 does not play a significant role during bone formation after mechanical stimulation in rats. Although IGFBP-2 is the major IGFBP synthesized by rat osteoblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a role for IGFBP-2 during mechanical loading has not been established yet. IGFBP-3 has both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on bone cells. IGFBP-4, which is locally produced by osteoblasts, has an inhibitory effect on bone metabolism, whereas locally synthesized IGFBP-5 by osteoblasts has a stimulatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the effects of IGFBP-4 on osteoblasts are IGF-I-dependent, whereas IGFBP-5 probably acts as a store for IGFs in bone tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. IGFBP-6 is expressed in rat osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In conclusion, IGFBP-2 is the most abundant IGFBP in rat osteoblasts; however, the role of IGFBP-2 during bone formation after mechanical stimulation <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been determined yet. We hypothesized that IGFBP-2 mRNA expression level might be changed in bone cells during bone formation after mechanical stimulation.</p><p>The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the localization of IGFBP-2 mRNA in the cortical tibial shaft after mechanical stimulation. To this end, we induced a single period of mechanical loading using the four-point bending model of Forwood and Turner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Since loading will result in bending and squeezing of the tibia and sham loading only in squeezing of the tibia, the sham group was used as a control for the load group. The left tibiae served as contralateral controls. The four-point bending model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was used to generate a single period of dynamic loading of the right tibia in rats <italic>in vivo</italic> in order to detect acute changes of IGFBP-2 mRNA locally in bone tissue after stimulation by mechanical stress. The rats were subjected to a single episode of loading comprising 300 cycles (2 Hz) using a peak magnitude of 60 N.

Since the actions of IGFs are influenced by their IGFBPs, we examined IGFBP-2 mRNA expression at 6 hours after loading.

No differences in morphology of the cells were observed between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed an increase in the number of endocortical osteocytes expressing IGFBP-2 mRNA in loaded (1.68-fold) and sham-loaded (1.35-fold) tibiae 6 hours after a single period of mechanical loading with the four-point bending system. The upregulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was restricted to osteocytes at the endosteal side of the shaft and multiple inner lamellae. No difference between IGFBP-2 mRNA expression in the left and right control tibia was observed. We conclude that bending and squeezing of rat tibiae result in an increase of locally synthesized IGFBP-2 mRNA by endocortical osteocytes. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays an as yet unidentified role in the lamellar bone formation process.</p><p>We suggest that the IGFBP-2-producing osteocytes of the loaded tibiae are involved in the increased lamellar bone formation after mechanical loading. Forwood and colleagues reported that a single short period of loading using the four-point bending system resulted in an increased lamellar bone formation rate at the endosteal surface of rat tibia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This has been confirmed in a validation study at our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The lamellar bone formation is located at the endosteal side of the shaft, which is identical to the location of newly synthesized IGFBP-2 mRNA after mechanical loading, as demonstrated in this study. IGFBP-2 mRNA expression was restricted to this area and was not observed in the osteocytes at the periosteal side of the shaft. Mechanical loading with an external bending load of 60 N <italic>in vivo</italic> will result in an increased woven bone formation rate at the periosteal surface as a result of irritation of the periosteum and increased lamellar bone formation rate at the endosteal surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We suggest that IGFBP-2 mRNA may be less involved in woven bone formation because the osteocytes at the periosteal side of the shaft did not express IGFBP-2. This suggests that IGFBP-2 mRNA in the mechanosensitive osteocytes is specifically important for lamellar bone formation.</p><p>In addition, this study showed that the sham-loaded tibiae have increased IGFBP-2 mRNA production in endocortical osteocytes 6 hours after sham loading. Apparently, besides bending, squeezing alone is also responsible for the upregulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA in the endocortical osteocytes. However, squeezing did not induce lamellar bone formation.</p><p>Remarkably, there is a large range in the data for the percentage of IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive osteocytes in the contralateral control tibiae of the load group in comparison to the data of the contralateral tibiae of the sham group. This could be caused by the biological variation between the individuals because the animals were randomly divided between the groups and there is no significant statistical difference between those tibiae.</p><p>For this study we used the four-point bending model of Forwood because this apparatus produces a controlled mechanical strain in the tibia of living rats. An advantage of this approach is that it does not require surgical intervention and allows normal physical activity after the loading session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The osteogenic response will occur at a distinct location in bone. Therefore, we used the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization technique in order to detect the local osteogenic response at the cellular level. Nonradioactive <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization is a powerful and sensitive technique to localize gene expression within decalcified rat tibiae. It was demonstrated that the IGFBP-2 probe is specific because IGFBP-2 mRNA expression is present in the choroid plexus and the neurons of the medulla oblongata, as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and in the chondrocytes of the proliferative and hypertrophic zone of the growth plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. The applied load of 60 N is supraphysiological, and 6 hours after a single loading session is too early to demonstrate bone formation.</p><p>In summary, this study shows an increase of the number of osteocytes at the endosteal side of the shaft and inner lamellae expressing IGFBP-2 mRNA 6 hours after mechanical loading and sham loading <italic>in vivo</italic>. We conclude that these IGFBP-2-producing osteocytes in the endosteal shaft are mechanosensitive. We suggest that IGFBP-2 plays a role in the lamellar bone formation process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors thank Huib van Essen (Department of Endocrinology, VU Medical University), Esther Lok, Suzanne Bonne, and Paula Mul (Clinical Laboratory for Animal Experiments) for assisting with the animal experiments.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Forwood</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Blowers</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Nadorfi</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modification of the in vivo four-point loading model for studying mechanically induced bone adaptation</article-title><source>Bone</source><year>1998</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>307</fpage><lpage>310</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S8756-3282(98)00090-8</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Forwood MR, Bennett MB, Blowers AR, Nadorfi RL (1998) Modification of the in vivo four-point loading model for studying mechanically induced bone adaptation.
