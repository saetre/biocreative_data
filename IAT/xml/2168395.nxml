We have tested the <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of MuRF1 and MuRF2 for muscle metabolism by using knockout (KO) mouse models. Single MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mice are healthy and have normal muscles. Double knockout (dKO) mice obtained by the inactivation of all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles developed extreme cardiac and milder skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice was maintained throughout the murine life span and was associated with chronically activated muscle protein synthesis. During ageing (months 4&#x02013;18), skeletal muscle mass remained stable, whereas body fat content did not increase in dKO mice as compared with wild-type controls. Other catabolic factors such as MAFbox/atrogin1 were expressed at normal levels and did not respond to or prevent muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice. Thus, combined inhibition of MuRF1/MuRF2 could provide a potent strategy to stimulate striated muscles anabolically and to protect muscles from sarcopenia during ageing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>muscle hypertrophy and atrophy</kwd><kwd>striated muscle</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MuRF2</kwd><kwd>Z-disks</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Striated muscle cells respond to changing functional requirements by a coordinated set of adaptations. For example, resistance training effectively remodels myofibrils, fiber type compositions, mitochondrial content, and muscle cell sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Seynnes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), leading to body and skeletal muscle mass increases of 2&#x02013;5 kg and strength gains of 5&#x02013;20&#x00025; within one week in athletes after optimal exercise and nutrition (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004</xref>). Conversely, acute muscle unloading or starvation induces muscle protein catabolism (about 0.3&#x00025; of calf muscle mass is lost per day in bed-rested patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rittweger <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), and up to 35&#x00025; muscle loss in rats after 1 week of space flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fitts <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>)). The trophic pathways promoting muscle growth and protein synthesis are modulated by a plethora of factors, including hormones, exercise, and myocellular stretch (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006</xref>), that enhance muscle tissue and myocytic cell growth. <italic>In vivo</italic>, these must be balanced by anti-anabolic signals that are less understood. Pathophysiologically, dominance of catabolism causes muscle wasting syndromes, for example, critical illness myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Latronico <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), or blunted anabolism causes sarcopenia during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Solomon and Bouloux, 2006</xref>). Because of their clinical importance, muscle catabolism-promoting factors are receiving increasing attention (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bodine, 2006</xref>), in particular, the ubiquitin ligases MAFbx/atrogin1 and MuRF1, because of their consistent upregulation during a variety of catabolic muscle states, including denervation, long-term immobilization, and microgravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lecker <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nikawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Consistent with a critical role of MAFbx/atrogin1 and MURF1 for muscle catabolism, MAFbx/atrogin1 and MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice develop muscle atrophy more slowly after denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bodine <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The shared binding of MuRF1 and MuRF2 to a set of seven structural muscle proteins (including titin; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) prompted us to investigate the functional relationship between MuRF1 and MuRF2 by mouse genetics. For example, titin may regulate the E3-ligase activities of MuRF1 and MuRF2 in an activity-dependent fashion: titin is a giant intrasarcomeric protein that makes up a myofibrillar spanning system, confers elastic properties to the myofibrils, and associates with numerous signaling molecules whose expression is muscle-activity dependent (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Granzier and Labeit, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lange <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus we generated MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mouse models for testing whether MuRF1 and MuRF2 functionally cooperate. Both MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mice have normal fertility and life span (consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bodine <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In contrast, MuRF1/MuRF2 double knockout (dKO) mice develop an extreme and lifelong muscle hypertrophy. The molecular basis for the cooperative nature of MuRF1/2 signaling is likely their combined regulation of a large shared set of ligands, including proteins required for myofibrillar stretch sensing, translation, and transcription factors. Cooperative MuRF1/2 signaling is emerging as an important pathway that coordinates myofibrils, ribosomes, and nuclear gene expression in myocytes when being stressed metabolically or biomechanically.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Increase of heart organ and cardiac myocyte size after deletion of MuRF1 and MuRF2</title><p>Our MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mouse models correspond both to constitutive null models (for details on gene targeting, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). The obtained MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mice that are homozygous null for MuRF1 or MuRF2 have normal fertility and are viable (consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bodine <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Also, deletion of MuRF1 or MuRF2 has no effect on life span until month 24 (our oldest MuRF1 or MuRF2 KO mice so far). Fertility of single MuRF1 or MuRF2 KO mice allowed the generation of dKO strains by breeding them together. Newborn dKO mice have a severe phenotype: 74&#x00025; of mice homozygous for both MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO alleles die within the first 7&#x02013;16 days of life. Dissection of these young dKO mice revealed grossly enlarged hearts that filled the entire mediastinum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Histology of mice that died spontaneously revealed microthrombi in the heart, edema in the lung, microbleedings, and compression of the neighboring organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Taken together, these pathological findings are consistent with death from chronic heart insufficiency and acute cardiac decompensation with heart failure.</p><p>Morphometric analysis of single cardiac myocytes demonstrated 59&#x00025; enlarged myocytes and 58&#x00025; enlarged nuclei, both indicating cellular hypertrophy and explaining muscle hypertrophy at least in part (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). The effects of deleting MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles on heart to body weight (HW/BW) ratios were synergistic: young MuRF1 or MuRF2 KO mice had 10 and 8&#x00025; HW/BW increases (<italic>P</italic>=0.1 and 0.2 respectively), whereas hearts of dKO mice had 231&#x00025; increased HW/BW ratios (<italic>P</italic>=0.001, &#x0003c;1 month; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref> right). The histological studies of older mice revealed for dKO myocardium a concentric-type hypertrophy. No fibrosis by Masson stainings or myofibrillar disarray was observed at light microscopic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref> bottom). The inner and outer layers of the myocardium could still be distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the severe phenotype of dKO mice contrasts the absence of a noticeable phenotype in MuRF1 or MuRF2 KO mice and therefore demonstrates cooperativity of MuRF1 and MuRF2 on the genetic level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>dKO mice develop and maintain skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy throughout their life span</title><p>Those dKO mice that survived the first two postnatal weeks became long-term survivors: All dKO mice alive at week 3 (<italic>n</italic>=27; 26&#x00025; of total dKO offspring) were still alive at month 18 (unless being killed for our studies) and were able to have offspring. Adult dKO mice maintain cardiac hypertrophy (dKO: 84&#x00025; increase, <italic>P</italic>=0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, electrocardiography indicated intact excitation conduction in dKO hearts from aged mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>; contrasting, for example, the conduction blocks observed in Nkx2.5 KO mice; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pashmforoush <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Next, we examined the physiological cardiac performance by MRI imaging in more detail. This indicated massive persistent hypertrophy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we estimated ejection fractions (EF) and stroke volumes by time-resolved MRI. This showed grossly reduced EFs (dKO: 0.2&#x02013;0.3; wild type (WT): 0.7; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas stroke volumes were 26&#x00025; reduced under basal conditions.</p><p>Because dKO hearts support physiological circulation at least under non-challenged laboratory conditions for up to month 18, the effects of the absence of both MuRF1 and MuRF2 could also be studied in muscles of adult and aged animals. Similar to sustaining cardiac hypertrophy up to month 18 (our oldest dKO mice), MuRF1 and MuRF2 had also synergistic lifelong effects on skeletal muscle mass: after deletion of all four alleles, we found 38&#x00025; increased quadriceps to body weight (QW/BW) ratios in dKO mice when compared with WT (<italic>P</italic>=0.001), whereas single MuRF1 or MuRF2 KOs had 17 and 11&#x00025; increased QW/BW ratios (<italic>P</italic>=0.05 and 0.08, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> left). Similar as in heart muscle, skeletal muscle hypertrophy correlated with the hypertrophy of individual fibers (see histology of quadriceps muscle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> right).</p><p>Intriguingly, during ageing, body weights of dKO and WT mice progressively diverged: whereas ageing WT mice substantially gained weight (64&#x00025; increase when comparing months 5 and 18), weight gains were attenuated in dKO mice (17, 27, and 35&#x00025; differences at 12, 15, and 18 months, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.001), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> left). Dissections of senescent WT and dKO mice indicated that a striking lack of body fat accumulation in senescent dKO mice accounted for their reduced weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> right). This was apparently not linked to a general cachexia, because skeletal muscle hypertrophy was maintained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref> right).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of binding partners shared by MuRF1 and MuRF2 and their convergent signaling on CARP, FHL2, and SQSTM1</title><p>Because muscle hypertrophy and the lean phenotype develop only after inactivation of all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles, we searched for binding partners that are recognized by both MuRF1 and MuRF2 in an attempt to find molecular explanations for the phenotypic synergistic effects of MuRF1 and MuRF2 on muscle protein and lipid/energy metabolism.</p><p>A total of 87 genes were identified as MuRF1 or MuRF2 interacting prey clones that coded for myofibrillar proteins (18, including 11 Z-disk proteins), transcriptional regulators (11), translation factors (4), and component of the mitochondrial proteome (including ATP-synthesis (9)). Of these 87 genes, a set of 35 genes was fished with both MuRF1 and MuRF2 baits and was further confirmed by mating studies. The group of ligands shared by MuRF1 and MuRF2 included a set of four myofibrillar Z-disk proteins and the transcriptional regulators CARP, myozenin1/calsarcin2, FHL2 (also associated with Z-disk region; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Clark <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further test whether the Yeast Two-Hybrid (YTH) prey clones code indeed for MuRF1 and MuRF2 binding proteins, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down studies using expressed CARP, myozenin1/calsarcin2 (two molecules selected as known transcriptional regulators of muscle gene expression), MRP-L41/pig3 (selected as a member of the mitochondrial ribosomal group, also being implicated in growth control; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Yoo <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), and EEF1G/EF-1&#x003b3; (selected as a sophisticatedly regulated component of the translation machinery; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Belle <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) as well as its mitochondrial counterpart GFM1. Results indicated that a central MuRF1 fragment that comprises the MuRF1 residues 109&#x02013;315 (&#x02018;MuRF1Bcc'; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) is both sufficient and required for interaction with CARP, EEF1G, GFM1, myozenin1/calsarcin-2, and pig3/MRP-L41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, expressed MuRF2Bcc interacted <italic>in vitro</italic> with CARP, EEF1G, and GFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, YTH mating suggested that MuRF3Bcc does not interact with CARP, myozenin-1/calsarcin-2, and pig3/MRP-L41 (data not shown).</p><p>MuRF3 was recently shown to interact also with FHL2 and suggested to regulate its expression as an E3-ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fielitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we tested next whether the expression of MuRF3 and FHL2 are affected in dKO mice. MuRF3 was expressed at normal levels in dKO mice (Array Express E-MEXP-1321), whereas the FHL2 protein was highly upregulated in dKO mice deficient for both MuRF1 and MuRF2 (Figure 5A). Thus MuRF1/2 signaling on FHL2 is cooperative and cannot be substituted by the related ubiquitin ligase MuRF3. Intriguingly, other catabolic factors, such as atrogin1, are expressed at normal levels in dKO myocardium (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>), suggesting that MuRF1/MuRF2 and atrogins are functioning in different pathways. In contrast, CARP and SQSTM1 (Sequestosome1/p62) became strongly upregulated only after inactivation of all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles (Figure 5A). Gene expression profiling with Affymetrix system indicated that FHL2 and SQSTM1 mRNA levels are normal in dKO myocardium, and CARP is moderately upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Therefore, upregulation of CARP, FHL2, and SQSTM1 in dKO hearts are primarily caused by post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure and alteration of Z-disks after deletion of MuRF1 and MuRF2</title><p>Because MuRF1 and MuRF2 interact with multiple components of the Z-disk and of the mitochondrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>), we studied the ultrastructural effects of the absence of MuRF1 and MuRF2 on Z-disks and mitochondria in myocardium by electron microscopy. We were unable to detect differences between WT, MuRF1, and MuRF2-KO myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In contrast, myofibrils in dKO myocardium were abnormal: myofibrils had more electron-dense Z-disks and were less regular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Occasionally, myofibrils assembled in dKO hearts had free ends, somewhat reminiscent of growth tips found in proliferating skeletal myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ojima <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), and projected into regions rich in unassembled free filaments (not shown).</p><p>Mitochondria were less regular in shape and less orderly packed together. dKO myocardium also contained vacuoles, often embedded into mitochondrial clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Because of the mitochondrial defects, we tested the expression of PGC-1-&#x003b1; (as a master gene for mitochondrial biogenesis; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rasbach and Schnellmann, 2007</xref>). PGC-1-&#x003b1; transcription was not dysregulated in dKO myocardium (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Future studies are required to determine the molecular basis of altered mitochondrial numbers and structures in dKO myocardium.</p><p>These ultrastructural changes were only present after inactivation of all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles, again demonstrating that the MuRF1 and MuRF2 loci are genetically a complementation group.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Elevated ANP and MLP stretch signals in dKO muscles implicate MuRF1/MuRF2 in stretch signal inhibition</title><p>To gain insights into the mechanisms causing cardiac hypertrophy in dKO mice, we analyzed their transcriptomes by gene expression profiling. The transcriptional changes we found in dKO ventricles resembled those present in pressure induced aortic constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), including the upregulation of skeletal-type alpha actin 1, myosin light chains, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; isoforms A and B), and thrombospondin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> and ArrayExpress accession E-MEXP-1321). Consistent with elevated stretch signaling, ANP was strikingly upregulated in dKO ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Normal to moderately elevated expression of other markers for cardiac hypertrophy suggested that the ANP induction was not a secondary consequence of heart failure and calcium overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). SERCA2a (a marker for calcium overload during heart failure), serum response factor (SRF, previously suggested to transmit titin kinase/MuRF2-dependent stretch signals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lange <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), and p38 MAPK (activated by the ERK/Map kinase pathway) were not affected by the absence of MuRF1 or MuRF2. In dKO myocardium, neither microarrays nor western blots showed an upregulation of SRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).</p><p>Based on the elevated ANP levels in dKO ventricles, we hypothesized that stretch signaling is augmented in dKO muscles because of the failure to attenuate it. To test this hypothesis in skeletal muscle, we immobilized dKO skeletal muscles by a bycast. MLP/Csrp3 is required for stretch-regulated responses in myocardium and a binding partner of the Z-disk-associated protein TCap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Knoell <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and is also expressed in skeletal muscle (in contrast to ANP). Therefore, we monitored MLP/Csrp3 as a marker protein for stretch signaling. MLP/Csrp3, already elevated at basal conditions, remained highly elevated after a 72 h bycast immobilization in dKO (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that combined inactivation of MuRF1 and MuRF2 leads to chronic upregulation of stretch signals in both heart and skeletal muscle and failure to downregulate them.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Synergistic control of translational regulatory components by MuRF1/2</title><p>Possibly, the massive hypertrophic phenotype of dKO mice might be caused by reduced multi-ubiquitination and degradation of total muscle proteins (linked to inactivation of MuRF1/2 E3-ubiquitin-ligase activities). To test for reduced ubiquitination/degradation, we determined the levels of multi-ubiquitinated proteins on western blot panels displaying the different MuRF1/2 genotypes. Total levels of multi-ubiquitinated proteins did not change upon MuRF1/2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Among the family of ubiquitin-related modifiers, we only noted for SUMO4 an upregulation of SUMO4ylated species after MuRF1/2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we speculated that, as an alternative mechanism, MuRF1 and MuRF2 might regulate the translational machinery directly (e.g., via interaction with INT6, EEF1G, GFM1; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). When testing the myocardial expression of MuRF1/2-associated translation factors, we found that EEF1G and INT6 (subunits of EF-1 and elF3a, respectively; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Belle <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Morris <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) were upregulated specifically after deletion of all four MuRF1/2 alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with a general translational activation, we found upregulation of p70S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figures 6A</xref>) and its activated phosphorylated form phospho-p70S6K, as well as its substrate phospho-S6 (markers for an activated Akt/mTor pathway; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Phospho-p70S6K was recruited to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>), thus mimicking changes observed in exercise-induced translational activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Koopman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). For SRF, we noted no nuclear recruitment after MuRF1/2 deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To test more directly for translational activation, we injected deuterium-labeled phenylalanine (D5-F) into dKO and control mice, allowing the determination of fractional <italic>de novo</italic> muscle protein synthesis by comparing D5-F to phenylalanine contents in muscle protein lysates (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dardevet <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Incorporation of D5-F into dKO myocardium after 2 days was 46.6&#x00025; higher than in WT myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas incorporation of D5-F into WT, MuRF1-KO, and MuRF2-KO mice was statistically not different. Consistent with a chronically elevated rate of muscle metabolism, we found that serum creatinine levels (a degradation product of the muscle creatinine) were elevated by 55&#x00025; in dKO compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data point at the synergistic activation of the translational machinery in the absence of both MuRF1 and MuRF2, causing marked upregulation of phospho-S6K (or S6), whose level is tightly correlated with total muscle protein mass in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baar <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The fulminant cardiac phenotype of dKO mice documents the synergistic cooperation of the two homologous RING finger proteins MuRF1 and MuRF2: inactivation of the four MuRF1/2 alleles leads to 74&#x00025; early postnatal lethality. Autopsy and histology point at acute heart failure as the most likely cause of early postnatal death (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). After birth, dKO mice develop three- to fourfold enlarged hearts, whereas mice possessing a single intact MuRF1 or MuRF2 allele are healthy (reminiscent of functional complementation, e.g., MyoD and Myf5, where only removal of both proteins leads to a severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rudnicki <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). Thus, this is to our knowledge the first report showing the convergent signaling of two ubiquitin ligases (i.e., MuRF1 and MuRF2) in control of the trophic muscle state, molecules that have previously been implicated in skeletal muscle wasting and atrophy (for MuRF1, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bodine <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lecker <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nikawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) or in stretch-dependent control of muscle gene expression (for MuRF2, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lange <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, those dKO animals surviving the first 2 weeks have a normal life expectancy and are fertile, possibly because they &#x02018;outgrow' the initial massive enlargement of their hearts after birth: chest cavities expand after birth and relative HW/BW ratios drop from about 231&#x00025; at 2 weeks of age to 84&#x00025; at month 18. Longevity of 26&#x00025; of the dKO mice also allowed us to study the functional consequences of MuRF1/2 absence in ageing skeletal muscle: significant quadriceps skeletal muscle hypertrophy only developed after inactivation of both MuRF1 and MuRF2, and muscle hypertrophy was linked to fiber hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>A likely molecular explanation for MuRF1/2 cooperativity is their recognition of 35 or more shared targets: our YTH screens implicated both MuRF1 and MuRF2 in the recognition of specific components of the Z-disk, transcriptional regulators, the translational machinery, and the mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, MuRF1/2 recognize a broader range of targets than detected previously. Based upon a recent study on the interaction of cMuRF1 with titin A168&#x02013;170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mrosek <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), we speculate that the coiled-coil domains of MuRF1/2 (MuRFcc) have an extended flexible shape enabling multiple protein/protein interactions, thereby allowing the MuRF1/2cc domains to function as a recognition domain for numerous physiological targets. Thereby, MuRF1/MuRF2 could possibly orchestrate Z-disk signaling, transcription, translation, and mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metabolism in a coordinated fashion.</p><p>Analysis of dKO muscle tissues provided insights into the molecular mechanisms causing MuRF-dependent muscle hypertrophy that previous studies might have missed, because MuRF2 might have complemented for MuRF1 and <italic>vice versa</italic> in single KO models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bodine <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>): Our studies identified two causes that are likely to promote muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice. First, translation is enhanced in dKO myocardium as demonstrated by the upregulation of the downstream control check point S6 and the increased <italic>de novo</italic> muscle protein synthesis. As a potential mechanism leading to downstream translational activation, our YTH studies identified the interaction of MuRF1/2 with multiple components of the translational machinery, including INT6 (recently identified as a regulator of translation initiation factor 3; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Morris <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), EEF1G (a component of the elongation factor complex EF-1 that is sophisticatedly regulated during development and the cell cycle; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Belle <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), and GFM1 (the mitochondrial elongation factor G1).</p><p>These interactions together with the translational activation in dKO myocardium suggest that enhanced muscle synthesis accounts for muscle hypertrophy, whereas reduced protein degradation by multi-ubiquitination is at least less important. Consistent with enhanced muscle protein turnover in addition to a globally reduced muscle protein catabolism, we found elevated creatinine levels in the sera of dKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>As a second mechanism explaining muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice, we found that both cardiac and skeletal dKO muscles expressed elevated levels of stretch markers, including ANP and MLP (which again are predicted to promote muscle protein synthesis). Both ANP and MLP are also components of the myofibrillar Z-disk. Interestingly, ANP, CARP (both also highly upregulated in young dKO mice; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>), and MLP all target to the myofibrillar Z-disk region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bang <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Knoell <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoshijima, 2006</xref>). Consistent with a higher content of Z-disk proteins in dKO muscles, our EM studies showed denser and widened Z-disks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), a lattice structure that performs stretch-sensing functions in muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Vigoreaux, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Knoell <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Finally, failure to downregulate MLP after immobilization suggests that dKO muscles chronically express high levels of MLP independently of muscle exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Hyperactive anabolic stretch-sensing pathways could also potentially explain the unexpected lean phenotype of dKO mice: our adult C57/BL6 laboratory mice with unlimited access to nutrition and limited physical activity gained about 4&#x00025; weight per month by fattening. In contrast, our dKO mice (back-crossed onto the same genetic background) failed to accumulate fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). This could be explained, at least in part, by the activation of muscle protein synthesis and metabolism, recruiting a larger fraction of dietary calories for protein anabolism. Alternatively, MuRF1 and MuRF2 may also exert direct effects on lipid metabolism, as enoyl-coenzyme hydratase I (interacting with both MuRF1 and MuRF2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kim and Battaile, 2002</xref>) participates in the &#x003b2;-oxidation of lipids.</p><p>Overall, the phenotype of dKO mice together with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arya <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kedar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) are consistent with a role of MuRF1/2 to serve as an inhibitory feedback loop to downregulate anabolic responses after stretch/strain and metabolic stress: inactivation of MuRF1 and MuRF2 results in chronically elevated stretch signals, both in the heart (for ANP, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>; array data on ArrayExpress accession E-MEXP-1321) and in skeletal muscle (for MLP, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Future molecular insights into the signaling pathways shared by MuRF1 and MuRF2 may allow the design of combined MuRF1/MuRF2 inhibitors to achieve the effects seen in dKO mice including elevated muscle protein synthesis, failure to accumulate body fat during ageing, and maintenance of elevated trophic stretch signals. Although such a strategy will require considering cardiac hypertrophy as an additional unwanted effect the survival of dKO mice until month 18 encourages strategies to target MuRF1/MuRF2 for stimulating muscle anabolically. Finally, the striking lipolysis in dKO mice warrants future studies on the potential role of MuRF1 and MuRF2 in lipid and energy metabolism.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inactivation of the murine MuRF1 and MuRF2 genes and mouse breeding</title><p>The murine MuRF1 and MuRF2 genes were targeted by homologous recombination into exons 2 and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).

Numbers indicate independently identified prey clones in respective screens. M=interaction was found by mating. An SRF prey clone fished with the MuRF1 bait could not be confirmed by mating, as in our hands the 3&#x02032; UTR and not the coding sequence of SRF activated yeast growth during mating with MuRF1 and 2.
