The &#x003b3;-crystallins are encoded by a cluster of six genes, <italic>Cryga</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Crygf</italic> (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c2">2</xref>). In the mouse, the <italic>Cryg</italic> genes are expressed from embryonic day (E) 13.5 onwards in primary fibre cells and later on in secondary fibre cells, but not in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c4">4</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>Cryg</italic> genes have been reported for mouse and man and it is commonly accepted that these mutations are causative for a variety of lens opacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c8">8</xref>).</p><p> Because of the unique expression in the lens, the regulation of <italic>Cryg</italic> gene expression has been studied in various laboratories. The highly conserved proximal promoter region in the rat <italic>Cryge</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> and mouse <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> genes is characterised by binding sites for transcription factors and by a variety of sequence elements with remarkable features but without known functions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f1">1</xref>).</p><p> Additionally, there are differences in the response of cell culture systems and transgenic mice using the same promoter region. For example, the fragment &#x02013;67&#x0002f;&#x0002b;45 of the proximal <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter is sufficient for lens-specific expression in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c18">18</xref>). However, in N&#x0002f;N1003A lens cells the smallest promoter eliciting activity is the &#x02013;226&#x0002f;&#x0002b;45 fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c26">26</xref>).</p><p> On the other hand, a broad variety of transcription factors have been demonstrated to be involved in proper regulation of lens development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c27">27</xref>). However, only a few of them have been investigated with respect to their function in the regulation of &#x003b3;-crystallin encoding genes.</p><p><italic> Pax6</italic> is referred to as a &#x02018;master control gene&#x02019; of eye development regulating several crystallin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c30">30</xref>). <italic>Prox1</italic> is expressed in the mouse lens placode at E9.5, in the lens vesicle (E10.5), in the anterior, proliferating epithelium and in differentiating fibre cells (from E12 onward). In <italic>Prox1</italic> knock-out mutants lens fibre cell elongation is affected and <italic>Crygd</italic> expression is decreased, whereas <italic>Cryge</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> expression remains constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c31">31</xref>).</p><p><italic> Six3</italic> is important for early eye development, as demonstrated recently by its ectopic expression in the ear placode of medaka fish. This ectopic expression leads to formation of a morphologically intact lens in the ear placode, including expression of crystallins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c32">32</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Six3</italic> was found to be expressed at E6.5 in the head fold, a region later forming the mouse eye anlagen; however, in the lens it was not detected after E18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c33">33</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the role of those three transcription factors in the regulation of <italic>Cryg</italic> gene expression in some detail. We could demonstrate that Prox1 stimulates the <italic>Cryge</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoter &#x0223c;10-fold, but Six3 represses it to near background level. Pax6 is obviously without effect on <italic>Cryge</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> expression. Based upon these data, we suggest an antagonistic model of Prox1 and Six3 action at the <italic>Cryge</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human lens epithelial cell line CD5A was established from epithelial cells of donor lenses.

Virus was produced in CV1 cells and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C as culture supernatant. Virus was added directly to the lens epithelium upon arrival in the laboratory; the cells were monitored for growth over a 2&#x02013;3 week period. Once the cells had migrated and covered &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the surface of a 24-well plate, they were trypsinised into a single well of a 6-well plate. These were allowed to grow to confluence and then passaged into a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.

Since human <italic>CRYGD</italic> and &#x003c8;<italic>CRYGE</italic> and rat <italic>Crygd</italic> do not contain the Silencer and Cryner elements, as well as the RARE element, it is concluded that these particular promoters could be different to the others. These rodent promoters for <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> were defined as a separate subfamily.</p><p> Some 35 additional transcription factor-binding sites were identified using MatInspector Professional (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;genomatix.gsf.de">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;genomatix.gsf.de</ext-link>). All were conserved in positions for proximal promoters of the rodent <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> subfamily. Of these, seven were binding sites for proteins containing a homeodomain or a paired domain and are located in the region &#x02013;211 to &#x02013;105. These included Pax6- and Prox1-binding sites. Pax6 and PROX1 are important for lens development and fibre cell differentiation and so provided the focus for the present studies.</p><p> The region &#x02013;198 to &#x02013;186 is predicted as a binding site for the paired domain of Pax6; it partly overlaps with the retinoic acid response element (RARE). A similar module is also present in the human <italic>CRYGD</italic> promoter, but at a more upstream position. In fact, all distal <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoters have predicted Pax6-binding sites, but at different positions.</p><p> The region &#x02013;125 to &#x02013; 131 contains a predicted binding site for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Prospero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c46">46</xref>). Prospero is closely related to the vertebrate homologue Prox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c47">47</xref>), which is required for lens fibre cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c31">31</xref>), suggesting that PROX1 could be important for <italic>Cryd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> core promoter activity.</p><p> It is the combination of transcription factors that is important for lens development and other initial analyses of the core promoter have identified a large number of putative sites for transcription factors. To positively identify other transcription factors involved in regulating the <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> core promoter, we chose to study the effect of Six3 because of the recent demonstration of its importance in eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c33">33</xref>). Our experimental approach was to monitor <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoter activity after overexpression of Pax6, Prox1 and Six3 in lens epithelial cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterisation of the rodent <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoter</title><p>As examples for the <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> promoters we used several deletion constructs of either the mouse <italic>Cryge</italic> or <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f2">2</xref>a) driving the <italic>CAT</italic> or <italic>Luc</italic> gene as reporter. These were transfected into lens epithelial cell lines N&#x0002f;N1003A, &#x003b1;TN4 and CD5A; non-lens derived NIH 3T3 cells were used as a control. In N&#x0002f;N1003A and &#x003b1;TN4 cells the entire (&#x02013;629&#x0002f;&#x0002b;37) <italic>Cryge</italic> promoter shows 4&#x02013;5 times higher activity than the promoter-less reporter vector. Deletion of the fragment &#x02013;629 to &#x02013;219 results in an additional 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity; fragment (&#x02013;219&#x0002f;&#x0002b;37) is the most active and further deletions produced fragments not significantly different in activity from the promoter-less reporter vector. The only exception is the (&#x02013;77&#x0002f;&#x0002b;37) fragment, which has 2.6-fold the background activity. Therefore, the (&#x02013;219&#x0002f;&#x0002b;37) <italic>Cryge</italic> element is defined as the core promoter of the <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> subfamily (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f2">2</xref>b).</p><p> A better response for the basal promoter was obtained in the rabbit cell line N&#x0002f;N1003A as compared to the murine cell line &#x003b1;TN4. This was selected for our detailed studies. In line with the features of the <italic>Cryge</italic> promoter, a 10-fold elevation of basal activity was observed for the (&#x02013;226&#x0002f;&#x0002b;45) <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter in rabbit N&#x0002f;N1003A cells and also in human CD5A cells. Activation of the promoter fragment was lens cell specific, as no activity was detected in the fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of Pax6 on the <italic>Cryge</italic> promoter</title><p>We investigated the ability of Pax6 to stimulate the entire <italic>Cryge</italic> promoter by co-transfection of increasing amounts into the rabbit N&#x0002f;N1003A cell line. No statistically significant difference was observed between cells co-transfected or not with the <italic>Pax6</italic> expression plasmid (data not shown).

A band of the expected size (90 kDa) was detected in N&#x0002f;N1003A, but not in CD5A, cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f3">3</xref>a). We confirmed these results by RT&#x02013;PCR; <italic>Prox1</italic> is expressed in N&#x0002f;N1003A cells, but not in CD5A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f3">3</xref>b). To obtain Prox1 protein for further investigations, <italic>Prox1 </italic>cDNA was cloned in the expression vector pcDNA3. The PROX1-pcDNA3 plasmid was transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f3">3</xref>c). PROX1 protein was detected in transfected CD5A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f3">3</xref>a). Therefore, we used the CD5A cell line (which does not express endogenous <italic>Prox1</italic>) to test the effect of Prox1 on the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter.</p><p> In transient co-transfection experiments we investigated the ability of Prox1 to regulate the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter. Therefore, increasing amounts of <italic>Prox1</italic>-pcDNA3 were co-transfected with p&#x003b3;226LucII. Prox1 activates the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter 10-fold with a sigmoid dose&#x02013;response curve; to avoid an overloading effect of the transfection system, no more than 0.4 &#x000b5;g <italic>Prox1</italic> DNA was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f4">4</xref>). In contrast to CD5A cells, only a 2-fold activation of the promoter without a clear dose-dependent relationship was observed in N&#x0002f;N1003A cells. This difference might be caused by endogenous expression of <italic>Prox1</italic> in N&#x0002f;N1003A cells. <italic>Prox1</italic> did not affect pPLLucII, indicating promoter-specific effects.</p><p> To test whether the predicted Prospero-binding site is responsible for stimulation of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter, we used a set of 36 mutated promoter fragments. The mutations were randomly distributed within the entire proximal core promoter fragment (&#x02013;214&#x0002f;&#x0002b;48). As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f5">5</xref>, clones 7, 15, 19, 36 and 38 lost their ability to stimulate the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter. The observed reporter gene activity corresponds to the control level without Prox1 stimulation. Four of these mutations were localised within an interval between &#x02013;151 and &#x02013;174. Clone 15 affects the RARE element, which was demonstrated previously to be important for <italic>Crygf</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c10">10</xref>). Some other mutations found within this region obviously do not influence Prox1-dependent promoter activity (clones 13, 14, 17 and 29).</p><p> Clones 30 and 31 additionally enhance the stimulatory activity of Prox1 3-fold (i.e. 30-fold over the control). Mutation 31 is very close to the inhibitory mutation 19, but another mutation two bases downstream is without effect on Prox1 stimulation (clone 4). Therefore, all five of these mutations (7, 19, 31, 36 and 38) define a Prox1-responsive element (PRORE) between positions &#x02013;151 and &#x02013;174. The other mutation enhancing the Prox1 stimulatory effect (clone 30) is localised at position &#x02013;68 within the silencer element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c13">13</xref>); it is suggested that destruction of the silencer enhances the possibility of Prox1 stimulating the promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Function of <italic>Six3</italic> at the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter</title><p>We confirmed <italic>Six3</italic> expression in the mouse eye at E12.5 as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c33">33</xref>) by RT&#x02013;PCR. Endogenous transcription of <italic>Six3</italic> was also detected in human CD5A lens epithelial cell lines. The detection limit of PCR for <italic>Six3</italic> is approximately 1000 molecules of <italic>Six3</italic>-pcDNA3.1 per reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f6">6</xref>). <italic>Six3</italic> cDNA in rabbit N&#x0002f;N1003A cells could not be amplified, because the corresponding sequences of the rabbit are not yet known and conserved sequences from mouse and man could not be used successfully.</p><p> As described for Prox1, we investigated the influence of <italic>Six3</italic> on <italic>Crygf</italic> expression. Increasing amounts of <italic>Six3</italic>-pcDNA3.1 were co-transfected with p&#x003b3;226LucII into human CD5A lens epithelial or rabbit N&#x0002f;N1003A cells. As little as 6 ng of the <italic>Six3</italic> expression plasmid repressed the activity of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter by 40&#x00025;, compared to the promoter activity without <italic>Six3</italic>-pcDNA3.1. Larger amounts of <italic>Six3</italic> expression vector led to total repression of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f7">7</xref>a). As a control, <italic>Six3</italic> shows no effect on the promoter-less pPLLucII reporter plasmid. A similar repression of <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter activity was also observed after its stimulation by Prox1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f7">7</xref>b).</p><p> To obtain Six3 protein in sufficient amounts for further investigations, <italic>Six3</italic> cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. The corresponding Six3-pcDNA3.1 plasmid was transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysate. Using SDS&#x02013;PAGE, the expected 37 kDa size for full-length Six3 is observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f8">8</xref>a).</p><p> We investigated the ability of Six3 to interact with the <italic>Crygf</italic> core promoter by DNA precipitation. <italic>In vitro</italic> expressed Six3 was precipitated by immobilised DNA fragments (&#x02013;184&#x0002f;&#x02013;145) and (&#x02013;164&#x0002f;&#x02013;115) of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f8">8</xref>b, lane 1). To confirm the specificity of the interaction, oligonucleotides derived from the core promoter were used to compete off Six3 bound to the (&#x02013;226&#x0002f;&#x0002b;45) <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter. Only oligonucleotides representing the sequences (&#x02013;214&#x0002f;&#x02013;165), (&#x02013;184&#x0002f;&#x02013;145) and (&#x02013;164&#x0002f;&#x02013;115) of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter were able to displace Six3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f8">8</xref>b, lanes 2 and 3). Obviously, Six3 can be displaced from the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter by the sequence &#x02013;184&#x0002f;&#x02013;145, but it does not bind to it. This might be caused by steric inhibition due to biotin&#x02013;Streptavidin-mediated binding of the oligonucleotide to the matrix. All fragments of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter downstream of base pair &#x02013;115 did not show any specific interaction with Six3.</p><p> To decide whether <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to the overlapping promoter fragments has functional relevance, the same 36 clones as used for definition of the PRORE were used for transient transfections with Six3. Loss of the inhibitory action of Six3 was used to demonstrate an important function of the corresponding bases. As outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f9">9</xref>, two clones (9 and 37) led to a complete loss of Six3 repressor activity. Both clones have mutations in the interval between &#x02013;121 and &#x02013;117. Moreover, six other clones (1&#x02013;3, 12, 30 and 38) show only about half of the Six3 repressor activity of the wild-type promoter. The corresponding positions were all between &#x02013;101 and &#x02013;123 except for clone 2, which obviously destroys the Sox1-binding site. Since all other clones do not demonstrate an effect on Six3 repressor activity, the Six3-responsive element (SIRE) can be defined as between positions &#x02013;101 and &#x02013;123.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Similar regulation of rodent <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> genes</title><p>The <italic>Crygd</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>e</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>f</italic> genes of rat, mouse and man are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c40">40</xref>). A corresponding level of conservation is also found for their proximal promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke131f1">1</xref>), indicating a similar regulation of this gene subfamily. In line with their homology, the <italic>Cryge</italic> and <italic>Crygf</italic> promoters show similar activities in corresponding deletion constructs using rabbit N&#x0002f;N1003A cells as hosts. Successive deletion of the distal part of the <italic>Cryge</italic> promoter from base pair &#x02013;629 to &#x02013;219 leads to an increase in promoter activity, as observed for the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c48">48</xref>). Promoter fragments missing the sequences upstream of position &#x02013;219 have lost most of their activity because of the deleted RARE element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c9">9</xref>). Mediated by this element, co-transfection with recombinant RAR&#x003b1; and RAR&#x003b2; receptors enhanced activity of the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter 25-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c9">9</xref>).

The L-Maf-binding element (MARE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c47">47</xref>) is nearly identical to the previously reported &#x003b3;F-1 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c16">16</xref>); <italic>c-Maf</italic> null mutant mice do not express <italic>Cryg</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c50">50</xref>). However, the chicken &#x003b3;FBP protein (binding to the &#x003b3;F-1-binding site) inhibits promoter activity in reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c17">17</xref>). The mouse orthologue of &#x003b3;<italic>FBP</italic>, <italic>Hic1</italic>, is expressed in a variety of embryonic tissues, but not in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c51">51</xref>).</p><p><italic> Pax6</italic> is considered one of the most important genes in lens development because of its induction of ectopic eye formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c52">52</xref>) and because of the series of <italic>Small eye</italic> mutations, which do not develop eyes at all in the homozygous condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c53">53</xref>).

However, from our co-transfection experiments no indication of either an activating or an inhibitory influence of Pax6 can be deduced. Even if N&#x0002f;N1003A cells express endogenous Pax6, a small stimulatory effect should be expected, as seen for PROX1. Moreover, in the same cell line Cvekl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke131c28">28</xref>) demonstrated that the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter could be stimulated by overexpression of <italic>Pax6</italic>.

A mutation within this region does not change the stimulatory activity of Prox1, whereas mutations in a more upstream region between positions &#x02013;151 and &#x02013;174 lead to either a complete loss of the stimulatory activity or to a significant increase.

However, our data do not support this hypothesis, since the silencer element is located between positions &#x02013;76 and &#x02013;58. Our DNA binding studies defined a Six3-binding region between &#x02013;214 and &#x02013;115. Using a random mutagenesis screen for the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter, we could define a SIRE in the region between &#x02013;101 and &#x02013;123. In this region mutations in the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter change the repressive effect of Six3 significantly; mutations outside obviously do not influence Six3 function on the <italic>Crygf</italic> promoter.
