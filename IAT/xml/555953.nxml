The signaling molecule that mediates aggregation and development is cAMP. Aggregation proceeds in a rhythmic fashion; cAMP is secreted periodically by cells in the center of the aggregate. Cells in the neighbourhood respond by an oriented inward movement and secrete cAMP themselves to relay the signal. In cell suspensions periodic synthesis and release of cAMP leads to rhythmic shape changes that cause alterations in light transmittance and spike-shaped and sinusoidal light scattering oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The marked rhythmic behaviour of the cell population is also apparent by oscillations of other parameters, e.g. extracellular concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+ </sup>or H<sup>+ </sup>(for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Recently, changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>were postulated to comprise the (or at least a part of the) master oscillator controlling oscillation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A short [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transient induced by addition of CaCl<sub>2 </sub>or calmodulin antagonists alters light scattering oscillations and can even reset the oscillation phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The height of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-increase determines whether light scattering and the accompanying cAMP oscillations are abolished or augmented: large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients inhibit cAMP and light scattering oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] whereas small [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevations enhance oscillations of both parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. From these experiments it was concluded that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exerts a dual control over the production of the first messenger cAMP (for a detailed model see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). cAMP controls its own synthesis as binding of the agonist to cell surface receptors induces a transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, until now the question as to whether there is an interaction between cAMP acting intracellularly as second messenger and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in <italic>D. discoideum </italic>has not been resolved. In other cell systems such as nerve cells crosstalk between the cAMP and the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling pathway exists that is necessary to generate oscillations of both parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In order to gain insight into a possible connection between intracellular cAMP and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>we used a mutant defective in the phosphodiesterase RegA. RegA is one out of two cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (for an overview of classes of PDEs in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) that is inhibited by IBMX and comprises part of an eukaryotic phospho-relay system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>RegA</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants are rapid developers; their differentiation is shifted towards the stalk pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Chemotactic migration is characterized by an increased frequency of lateral pseudopod extension as compared to wild type amoebae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We found that the mutant displayed an altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-response pattern upon stimulation with cAMP with an augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from stores and a concomitant decrease of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry. Light scattering oscillations and the underlying cAMP oscillations were drastically reduced in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells. Chemotaxis was influenced by the extracellular presence of EGTA. We conclude that indeed, intracellular cAMP signaling and the regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>are linked at the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-storage compartments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Extracellular and intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-recordings</title><p>To test whether the absence of the main cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase affects regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>we analyzed extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-fluxes in cell suspensions and studied [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in single amoebae. cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in suspensions of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells occurred with a similar time course as in wild type. Yet, influx was reduced by approximately 40% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The loss of RegA should lead to an altered cAMP metabolism. Indeed, the basal total amount of cAMP was increased fourfold (13 &#x000b1; 3 pmol/10<sup>7 </sup><italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells; mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. of 16 determinations in 7 independent experiments vs. 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 pmol/10<sup>7 </sup>wild type cells; mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. of 11 determinations in 6 independent experiments). Addition of the PDE inhibitor IBMX (up to 200 &#x003bc;M) to wild type cells affected neither the amount nor the characteristics of cAMP-activated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-fluxes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx after cAMP stimulation is reduced in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells. The amount of influx (pmol/10<sup>7 </sup>cells) after addition of 1 &#x003bc;M cAMP is plotted versus extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Average influx was higher in wild type than in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>amoebae (mean &#x000b1; s.d. from at least 6 determinations in 3 independent experiments each).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-6-12-1"/></fig><p>IBMX does not inhibit extracellular PDE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] but affects cAMP hydrolysis intracellularly, so we compared basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>and cAMP-activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>to wild type cells in the absence and intracellular presence of IBMX. The inhibitor should affect the activity of both cAMP phosphodiesterases, RegA and PDE-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Without IBMX, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was similar in both strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, cAMP-addition induced a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transient in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In wild type, cAMP-activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes were observed after preincubation with 1 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>for 10&#x02013;15 min only (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). After loading of IBMX into the cytosol both, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>and cAMP-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes were altered. Basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was significantly increased in <italic>regA</italic><sup>-</sup>; the height of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transient after cAMP-stimulation was comparable to the control situation. In wild type, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was elevated and a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-change was also observed after cAMP addition in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In summary, increasing cAMP levels augmented cAMP-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients at concomitantly reduced levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx; the increase in basal intracellular cAMP caused by the absence of RegA was sufficient. Alteration of basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>required an even higher concentration of cAMP. This was achieved by inhibition of RegA and of PDE-E via loading of IBMX into the cytosol. In wild type where both enzymes are present basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was not elevated in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+ </sup>which indicates that the amount of cAMP had just reached a threshold value and that basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>is more tightly controlled than agonist activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Measurement of cAMP activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes in wild type and mutant amoebae.

A positive influence of cAMP via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of both, IP<sub>3</sub>-receptors and ryanodine receptors on release of stored Ca<sup>2+ </sup>has been reported (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). We therefore tested the response of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>amoebae upon stimulation with cAMP in the presence of the chelator BAPTA. We found that even after the addition of 1 mM BAPTA cAMP activated a transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The elevation was smaller than that observed in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium and amounted to an average of 44 &#x000b1; 3 nM above basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>(mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. of 18 determinations in 2 independent experiments). In wild type amoebae a cAMP-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-increase is not detectable in the presence of BAPTA; the occurrence of a transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells indicates an augmented release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from stores in the mutant. Support for an effect of cAMP via PKA came from experiments where we incubated cells with the membrane permeant activator of PKA, Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

In addition, we found that preincubation of wild type amoebae with 30 &#x003bc;M Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS reduced cAMP-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in cell suspensions by 26 &#x000b1; 8% (mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. of 3 independent experiments).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-changes in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells in the presence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator.

When light scattering was analyzed in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>suspensions two types of responses were observed. On one hand, regular oscillations with a phase length of 4.3 &#x000b1; 1 min (mean &#x000b1; s.d. of 61 determinations in 6 independent experiments) occurred (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The amplitude of these oscillations was reduced as compared to wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), i.e. by 78%. On the other hand, irregular light scattering changes were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Determination of cAMP levels revealed that cAMP scarcely oscillated in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) and increased on average by a factor of 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.6 (mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. of 5 independent experiments). The response upon addition of cAMP was also different: after an increased first light scattering peak and the occurrence of a second peak light scattering did not return to the baseline as in wild type suspensions but fell well below (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The alteration in light scattering responses in the mutant might be due to a shift in sensitivity to cAMP. As a control we tested the reaction upon stimulation with cAMP and found that <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells reacted when 3 nM cAMP was added (not shown) which indicates that the mutant strain is practically as sensitive as wild type. Measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e </sub>in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cell suspensions revealed irregular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e </sub>oscillations, similar to the results obtained for light scattering (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Light scattering and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e </sub>oscillations of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells.

The results presented in this study provide evidence for a reciprocal influence of the second messengers cAMP and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells. We observed altered agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-fluxes and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients in the <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant cell line where the absence of the main cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE led to a fourfold increased basal cAMP level. One could argue that the effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was not a consequence of the increased basal concentration of cAMP but rather due to a potentially altered pattern of gene expression in the mutant strain. Indeed, this is possible and could result in a different signal perception and/or processing. However, we consider an alteration in gene expression unlikely to be responsible for the augmented [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients upon cAMP-stimulation since the same effect could be evoked in wild type amoebae by loading of the PDE inhibitor IBMX into the cytosol. In addition, IBMX evoked an increase in basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in both, wild type and mutant cells. In <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>the inhibitor should act on the additional cAMP-PDE (PDE-E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and therefore increase cAMP levels even further. In wild type amoebae hydrolysis of cAMP should be retarded as well. Yet, the threshold of the cAMP concentration required to increase basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>might not be achieved as consistently as in the mutant since IBMX must act on both PDEs.</p><p>The sensitizing effect of the increased amount of cAMP on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>could be caused by several factors. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-flux characteristics can be changed by influencing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases located on both, the plasma membrane and membranes of internal stores. When we analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-fluxes with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive electrode influx was reduced in the mutant while the rates of influx and efflux were unchanged. If the activity of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PMCA) was altered then flux rates should be affected. Moreover, the reduced amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx precludes activation of a plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel. In other cell systems activation of the PMCA and of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels by an increase in cAMP levels was shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] but our data argue against a stimulating effect on plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel or PMCA activity in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>amoebae.</p><p>The second target of action of cAMP are intracellular stores. Indeed, we showed for the first time that in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>a cAMP-activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation occurred in the extracellular presence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator BAPTA. This argues for an alteration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake into and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from stores. An as yet unknown negative regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sequestration could cause accumulation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in the cytosol; until now, however, activation of SERCA-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases was found only (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). On the other hand, release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>could have been augmented by the high basal cAMP level in the mutant. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor by PKA results in increased sensitivity for IP<sub>3 </sub>in pancreatic acinar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; the same holds true for the ryanodine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Stimulation of PKA activity is plausible since pretreatment with the PKA-activator Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS elevated basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>and reduced agonist-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry. Membrane permeable Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS was shown to be virtually ineffective in inducing gene expression and to be highly selective for PKA vs cAMP receptor activation at the concentration employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In summary, we propose the following model: in the mutant sensitivity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release system is enhanced by an augmented PKA-mediated phosphorylation which is due to increased basal cAMP levels. This results in larger amounts of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>being liberated upon stimulation. In <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from stores was also found after addition of calmidazolium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which was shown to inhibit calmodulin-dependent and independent activity of calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Calcineurin in turn was proposed to be responsible for termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release by dephosphorylating the IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>augmented release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>leads to a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry across the plasma membrane as a negative feedback.</p><p>We suggest the alteration in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>to be responsible for the irregular light scattering and extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-oscillations of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells. Previously, Wessels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have shown that the mutant cannot propagate a cAMP wave since wild type amoebae no longer aggregated correctly when mixed with mutant cells. Indeed, we found that peak cAMP levels during light scattering oscillations were very low in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>as compared to wild type. This effect is plausible, as the increased sensitivity of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>second messenger system exerts a negative feedback on cAMP synthesis: large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients inhibit production of cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An interplay of cAMP and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-oscillations and their mutual dependence has also been shown in neurons: absence of either, cAMP or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-oscillations resulted in failure of the other component to oscillate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>the strong decrease in peak cAMP oscillation levels affected [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-oscillations which were irregular. The basis is probably an influence on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-oscillations. Such oscillations were suggested to occur but have not been demonstrated in single cells until now, presumably due to the small size of the amoebae and the characteristics of the wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>With respect to chemotaxis, reduced suppression of lateral pseudopod formation was shown in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells and an essential role of RegA for a correct response in a natural cAMP wave and chemotactic migration was assigned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; subsequently, a similar result was found in a mutant expressing a constitutively active PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. When we analyzed chemotaxis towards a cAMP-filled glass capillary we observed the same behaviour as described by Wessels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In principle, it is possible that the reduced capacity of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells to polarize was due to a difference in the developmental stage as compared to wild type cells. However, <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>develops much faster than wild type which suggests an even more efficient chemotaxis as this response increases during differentiation to aggregation competence. Alternatively, an altered or dampened signaling response caused by a lower number of cAMP receptors present on the cell surface could have caused the reduced chemotactic response. We consider this to be unlikely for the following reason. Aggregation-competent <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>amoebae possess roughly 50.000 cAMP receptors at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Yet, for chemotactic orientation and polarization in a cAMP gradient the difference in receptor occupancy between the front and the rear end of the amoebae is important rather than the absolute number of stimulated receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. So even if <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>expressed less receptors than wild type this should not influence the accuracy of the response. We propose the reduced polarization capacity of <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>amoebae to be caused by their altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-regulation. In the mutant strain the threshold for generation of an agonist-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-increase is lower than in wild type. The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation is not as tightly controlled and occurs even in the presence of BAPTA. The characteristics of a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-increase are important for the resulting cytoskeletal rearrangements and whether pseudopods are formed correctly. Indeed, artificial induction of a small global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transient by incubation with calmidazolium caused overall pseudopod protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In migrating cells the establishment of a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-gradient at the rear end was shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] which indicates the presence of a highly organized spatial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-pattern during chemotaxis. By contrast, a role of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation for the chemotactic response was questioned by Traynor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] because a mutant disrupted in a gene bearing similarity to IP<sub>3</sub>-receptors of higher eukaryotes aggregated and differentiated almost normally but displayed no cAMP-activated global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-change; yet, the existence of localized, small [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients in this particular mutant cell line that had escaped detection could not be excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>When we analyzed the influence of pretreatment with EGTA on chemotactic behaviour of wild type and <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells we found that the mutant was more sensitive. When compared to wild type, lower doses of EGTA were sufficient to reduce chemotactic speed. The effect of EGTA treatment is most probably due to emptying of the storage compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; the presence or absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>affects the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-content of stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. <italic>RegA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells are more sensitive than wild type amoebae because of the lower threshold for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release and thus a more rapid depletion of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Abnormal basal levels of cAMP impair chemotactic performance by augmenting agonist-activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevations which in turn lead to uncontrolled pseudopod extension. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>regulates cAMP acting as first messenger in a negative feedback loop: when the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>response is increased the amount of cAMP synthesized upon stimulation is low as observed in <italic>regA</italic><sup>- </sup>cells devoid of the phosphodiesterase RegA. The low level of cAMP relay results in improper light scattering oscillations. We conclude that intracellular cAMP acts on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>via PKA: phosphorylation of the system responsible for release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from stores leads to a greater sensitivity facilitating Ca<sup>2+ </sup>liberation. The cAMP activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-increase is due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from internal stores which triggers subsequent extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry. The fraction of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-elevation that is mediated by liberation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>is thus larger in the mutant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Fura2-dextran and BAPTA were from MoBiTec (G&#x000f6;ttingen, FRG).
