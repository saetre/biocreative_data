It is the only protein in the purple membrane, forming two-dimensional crystals providing a means for photosynthetic growth under conditions of low-oxygen tension. The apoprotein bacterioopsin is encoded by the <italic>bop</italic> gene and covalently linked to retinal. The next gene upstream of <italic>bop</italic> is reported to be <italic>brp</italic> (<italic>b</italic>acterioopsin-<italic>r</italic>elated <italic>p</italic>rotein) (OE3102R, VNG1465G). It has been demonstrated that the integrity of the intergenic region between the <italic>brp</italic> and <italic>bop</italic> genes is important for <italic>bop</italic> expression. Insertions of ISH2 elements in this region (mutants W1 and W11) led to the inactivation of transcription of the <italic>bop</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Pfeifer <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>). Insertions into <italic>brp</italic> also significantly decrease <italic>bat</italic> (<italic>b</italic>acterioopsin <italic>a</italic>ctivator of <italic>t</italic>ranscription) (OE3101R, VNG1464G) and <italic>bop</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Pfeifer <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>). The effect on <italic>bop</italic> mRNA may result from a polar effect on the downstream gene <italic>bat</italic>, which forms a transcription unit with <italic>brp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Shand and Betlach, 1991</xref>). In wild-type cells, both <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>bat</italic> transcription are induced during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Yang and DasSarma, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Shand and Betlach, 1991</xref>). Betlach and coworkers demonstrated that the <italic>bat</italic> gene encodes a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor that induces <italic>bop</italic> at low-oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gropp and Betlach, 1994</xref>), which naturally occurs in stationary phase. Bat contains a GAF domain, a PAS/PAC (redox-sensing) domain, and a C-terminal DNA-binding helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baliga <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). <italic>brp</italic> and a second gene <italic>blh</italic>, located 500 kb from the <italic>bop</italic> locus, have been implicated in retinal synthesis as an in-frame <italic>brp</italic> deletion led to the accumulation of &#x003b2;-carotene and a decrease of retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Peck <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Adjacent to <italic>bat</italic> is <italic>blp</italic> (<italic>b</italic>op-<italic>l</italic>inked <italic>p</italic>rotein) (OE3100F, VNG1463G), which is co-regulated with the <italic>bop</italic> gene by low-oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gropp <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) and encodes a protein with unknown function. Three genes upstream of <italic>blp</italic> are the <italic>crtB1</italic> gene (OE3093R, VNG1458G) encoding phytoene synthase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of C<sub>40</sub> carotenoids, and thus retinal biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baliga <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref> for a scheme illustrating regulation of bacteriorhodopsin synthesis).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The <italic>bop</italic> gene regulation network. The <italic>bop</italic> gene cluster is displayed from the <italic>crtB1</italic> gene to a gene coding for a conserved hypothetical protein that follows the <italic>bop</italic> gene (OE3107F). The newly introduced <italic>brz</italic> gene (yellow) occurs in the region previously considered the intergenic region between <italic>bop</italic> and its assumed neighbour <italic>brp</italic>. Gene expression to the corresponding proteins is indicated by a dashed line. The proteins are indicated by boxes with corresponding capitalized gene names. For bacteriorhodopsin, the conversion of the apoprotein (BO, bacterio-opsin) to the mature protein (BR, bacteriorhodopsin) containing retinal (rhomboid) is indicated. Regulation of gene expression is indicated by green (induction) and red (inhibition) arrows. Expression of the <italic>bat</italic> gene is inhibited by oxygen while expression of the <italic>brp</italic> gene is enhanced by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Shand and Betlach, 1991</xref>). The Bat protein is assumed to activate several genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Shand and Betlach, 1991</xref>). The Bat protein activates <italic>brp</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>), <italic>bop</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gropp and Betlach, 1994</xref>) and likely <italic>blp</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gropp <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). The Brz protein activates the <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>crtB1</italic> genes as shown in this manuscript (thick green arrows), but does not affect <italic>bat</italic> gene expression. This may indicate that the <italic>bop</italic> activation by Bat is not direct but mediated by Brz (green arrow broken beyond Brz). Also indicated is the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, phytoene and lycopene via beta-carotene to retinal. A negative feedback loop exists for which there are three alternative possibilities: substrate inhibition by retinal, inhibition by the bacterio-opsin apoprotein (brown dotted arrows) or activation by mature bacteriorhodopsin (blue dotted arrow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Sumper and Herrman, 1976</xref>). Also indicated is the activation of carotenoid conversion to retinal by Brp (green dotted arrow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Peck <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) and conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to phytoene which is catalysed by <italic>crtB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baliga <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) (black arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0067-0772-f4"/></fig><p>The genomes of two strains of <italic>H. salinarum</italic> have been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Pfeiffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.halolex.mpg.de">http://www.halolex.mpg.de</ext-link>), and they were found to be nearly identical in their chromosomal sequences. An exceedingly small open reading frame (ORF) (44 residues) (OE3104F, VNG1466H) was found annotated in the intergenic region between <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>brp</italic>, which was considered one of the many spurious ORFs that are characteristic for this GC-rich (68% GC) genome.</p><p>In this study, we show that the small protein, after correction of the start codon assignment, contains a zinc finger motif.

In addition, we show that a family of similar small proteins with a zinc finger motif is found not only in the genome of <italic>H. salinarum</italic>, but also in all archaea.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The gene upstream of <italic>bop</italic> is <italic>brz</italic> and not <italic>brp</italic></title><p>The <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>brp</italic> genes with their intergenic region had been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dunn <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Betlach <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>) and, ever since it was assumed that <italic>brp</italic> is the gene directly upstream of <italic>bop</italic>. On the genome sequence of <italic>H. salinarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Pfeiffer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.halolex.mpg.de">http://www.halolex.mpg.de</ext-link>), an ORF of only 44 residues in the intergenic region between <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>brp</italic> was annotated (OE3104F, VNG1466H). In light of the detailed analysis of the region upstream of <italic>bop</italic>, and considering that the GC-rich genome of <italic>Halobacterium</italic> contains ORFs of up to 1300 residues which do not code for a protein, it was considered unlikely that ORF OE3104F is a gene. This changed, when a protein translated from OE3104F was identified in our proteomic survey which was specifically tailored to study the small proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Klein <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It was also realized that an alternative GUG start codon exists 16 codons upstream resulting in a 60-amino-acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Using 5&#x02032; RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), we identified the transcription start site (TSS) to be the adenine preceding the GUG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The N-terminal extension of the protein contains two Cys residues and one His residue in addition to the His and Cys residues near the C-terminus of the protein. With the additional pair of Cys residues, the extended protein contains a zinc finger like motif, which is a well-known motif found in transcriptional and translational regulators, making it likely that this gene product is involved in gene regulation. Therefore, we named the gene <italic>brz</italic>. In addition, the 100 bp intergenic region between the <italic>brp</italic> and <italic>brz</italic> genes contains an imperfect inverted repeat which overlaps with the putative promoters of the two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, underlined). This repeat includes a putative TATA box of the <italic>brz</italic> promoter (located 25 bp upstream of the identified TSS) and a putative TATA box for <italic>brp</italic>. This suggests that <italic>brz</italic> and <italic>brp</italic> could be co-regulated and could ultimately be involved in the regulation of <italic>bop</italic> gene expression.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Position of the <italic>brz</italic> gene in the intergenic region between the <italic>brp</italic> and <italic>bop</italic> genes.

The mutant <italic>stopBrz</italic> should not be able to produce any functional protein, regardless of which potential start codon is used by the organism. Further, we mutated both Cys-11 to Ser (BrzC11S) to clarify the role of the alternative amino terminal sequence in formation of the proposed zinc finger motif, and His-52 to Phe (BrzH52F) to check the other part of the zinc finger motif.

The analysis was performed at two cell densities: 0.6&#x02013;0.8 OD<sub>600</sub> (late exponential phase) and 1.1&#x02013;1.5 OD<sub>600</sub> (early stationary phase) as <italic>bop</italic> transcription is induced at stationary phase.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effects of four <italic>brz</italic> mutations on the mRNA level of <italic>bop</italic>.

At least one CPxCG-like pattern is required for a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A selection of proteins containing a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif and definition of patterns and motifs to detect them.

The proteins in the lower part are functionally characterized. The zinc finger patterns are indicated by bold underlining. A definition of patterns and motifs is provided below the sequences. A CPxCG-related zinc finger motif consists of a pair of patterns, separated by 7&#x02013;40 amino acids. One of the patterns must be a CPxCG-like pattern (grey), of which three forms exist. The other can be a more general Cys/His pattern containing two Cys or His residues separated by two or three intermediate amino acids (white). All eight types of the general Cys/His pattern are shown, the CPxCG-like pattern being a specification of one of them (CxxCx).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0067-0772-f3"/></fig><p>The majority of the proteins containing this motif are annotated as &#x02018;(conserved) hypothetical protein&#x02019; (for example sequences see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>), but also a number of proteins involved in DNA and RNA interaction have been found. Among those are ribosomal proteins, small subunits of RNA polymerase, and transcription initiation and translation factors. The majority of the proteins detected by our algorithm did not show any hit to the Prosite motif database. However, there was a moderate cross-identification of iron&#x02013;sulphur proteins (4Fe&#x02212;4S ferredoxin, rubredoxin), which could be diminished by motif-based filtering.</p><p>One-fourth of the proteins having a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif are shorter than 100 residues (less than 12 kDa). The frequency maximum is at 50&#x02013;70 residues as revealed by statistical analysis of the annotated proteins from 32 completely sequenced archaeal genomes. Among the very small archaeal proteins, a remarkably large fraction (8%) has a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif, and thus may interact with DNA or RNA (Table S4). Even this may be an underestimation according to our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. A search for yet unannotated short six-frame translation products with a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif indicates that many of these may have been overlooked so far.</p><p>Upon analysis of 24 bacterial genomes, selected to represent a broad phylogenetic spectrum, a number of small proteins with a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif were also found (Table S5). However, these were not as frequent as in archaea. Only 1.5% of the annotated proteins smaller than 100 amino acids contained this motif, although some additional candidates were found by six-frame translation analysis. As an example, there are only 12 small zinc finger proteins (3%) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and eight (1.7%) in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. A distinct exception is the genome of <italic>Salinibacter ruber</italic> which contains many archaeal traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mongodin <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This species contains 20 (11%) small zinc finger proteins.</p><p>Overall, our bioinformatic results point to the existence of a prominent class of small proteins which may regulate gene expression by interaction with DNA or RNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The newly characterized gene between the <italic>brp</italic> and <italic>bop</italic> genes codes for a small zinc finger protein which regulates <italic>bop</italic> gene transcription and was named <italic>brz</italic>. Upon deletion of the gene or its inactivation by an in-frame stop codon, transcription of the <italic>bop</italic> gene is strongly impaired as shown by Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) and microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Table S1). While the effects detected by Northern analysis were very strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), results from DNA microarray analysis show only moderate regulation factors for <italic>bop</italic>. This may be due to a low dynamic range of DNA microarray analysis [as has also been found in other studies with this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Twellmeyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>)]. The same technique was used to confirm that the CPxCG-related zinc finger motif has an important role in the function of the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of a Cys residue from the N-terminal pattern (C11S), as well as a His residue from the C-terminal pattern (H52F), also strongly impaired <italic>bop</italic> gene transcription. The C11S mutant also supports re-annotation of the start codon for the <italic>brz</italic> gene.</p><p>Our data allow a reinterpretation of earlier observations showing that insertion of ISH2 elements in the &#x02018;intergenic region&#x02019; between <italic>brp</italic> and <italic>bop</italic> leads to the inactivation of <italic>bop</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Pfeifer <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>). The integration sites of the ISH2 elements are located within the <italic>brz</italic> gene (strain W1) or only 13 bp upstream of the newly assigned <italic>brz</italic> start codon (strain W11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, both integration events directly affect the <italic>brz</italic> gene rather than occurring in an intergenic region.</p><p>Brz functions within the overall context of <italic>bop</italic> gene regulation which involves several gene products, most of which are encoded in the immediate vicinity of the <italic>bop</italic> gene (<italic>bop</italic> cluster) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). As the product of the <italic>bat</italic> gene is known to regulate <italic>bop</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gropp <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), we analysed the effects of the different <italic>brz</italic> mutations on <italic>bat</italic> transcription by Northern blot (data not shown) and microarray (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Table S1). While mutation of <italic>brz</italic> had a major effect on <italic>bop</italic> transcription, it did not affect <italic>bat</italic> transcription. The same effects were observed earlier in the W1 and W11 strains having ISH2 element insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Leong <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>). Accordingly, the regulatory effects of Brz on <italic>bop</italic> are not mediated via Bat. The opposite scenario that Bat exerts its effects via regulation of <italic>brz</italic> cannot be excluded. Another possibility is that Bat and Brz cooperate on the protein level for <italic>bop</italic> gene regulation. Such an interaction is indirectly supported as the two Bat homologues of <italic>H. salinarum</italic> are both accompanied by genes coding for additional small zinc finger proteins with a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif. Adjacent to the <italic>bat</italic> homologue <italic>boa4</italic> (OE2448F) is the gene for the small zinc finger protein OE2447F. The <italic>bat</italic> homologue <italic>boa2</italic> (OE3134F) is separated by a single gene from the gene for the small zinc finger protein OE3131F. Regulation of the <italic>brz</italic> gene itself is likely and is supported by the imperfect inverted repeat observed in the intergenic region between <italic>brz</italic> and <italic>brp</italic> which overlaps the promoter region of both genes.</p><p>We performed DNA microarray analysis with the four <italic>brz</italic> mutants also in order to identify additional targets. In addition to the <italic>bop</italic> gene, three genes consistently showed reduced transcript levels for all four <italic>brz</italic> mutants, and they are all located in the immediate vicinity of the <italic>bop</italic> gene. Among those is a second key target involved in bacteriorhodopsin biosynthesis, the <italic>crtB1</italic> gene (OE3093R). It encodes the phytoene synthase catalysing the first step of carotenoid biosynthesis. Beta-carotene is the immediate precursor of the bacteriorhodopsin chromophore retinal. Thus, <italic>brz</italic> is a new member of those regulators which affect bacteriorhodopsin production at the protein level (<italic>bop</italic> gene regulation) and on the pigment level (<italic>crtB1</italic> gene regulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Co-regulation of <italic>bop</italic> and <italic>crtB1</italic> at the transcription level may occur by binding to the upstream activator sequence of the two promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baliga and DasSarma, 1999</xref>), for which sequence similarities have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baliga <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>crtB1</italic> regulation may be an indirect effect mediated via <italic>bop</italic> regulation. The indirect regulation of <italic>bop</italic> via <italic>crtB1</italic> can be excluded, as this would require accumulation of free retinal, which is never observed.</p><p>The other two genes which show reduced transcript levels upon DNA microarray analysis of all four <italic>brz</italic> mutants are: (i) <italic>OE3107F</italic>, the gene directly downstream of the <italic>bop</italic> gene and (ii) <italic>OE3095R</italic>, the gene immediately upstream of the <italic>crtB1</italic> gene. In both cases, however, gene distances are large enough to support independent transcription. Interestingly, these two genes are the direct neighbours of <italic>bop</italic> genes in two other bacteriorhodopsin-containing halophiles, <italic>H. walsbyi</italic> and <italic>H. marismortui</italic>. As for <italic>H. salinarum</italic>, the OE3107F homologues are encoded directly downstream of a <italic>bop</italic> gene. The homologues to OE3095R are encoded directly upstream of the same <italic>bop</italic> gene in opposite orientation. This resembles relative gene positions of <italic>H. salinarum</italic> except that a cassette containing six genes, among them <italic>brz</italic>, <italic>brp</italic>, <italic>bat</italic> and <italic>blp</italic>, has been inserted before the <italic>bop</italic> gene. These two co-regulated genes are not found in the closely related halophile <italic>Natronomonas pharaonis</italic> which does not contain bacteriorhodopsin, although it contains other retinal proteins (halorhodopsin, sensory rhodopsin II). OE3095R, which is 133 residues long, also contains a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif. This opens the possibility for a hierarchical regulatory network consisting of more than one zinc finger protein. Interaction between different gene regulators having a CPxCG-related motif may also be responsible for the fact that a number of additional genes were found to have reduced (or increased) mRNA levels, but only for some of the four mutants. The affected genes may even show a more prominent regulation factor than bacteriorhodopsin in DNA microarray analysis.</p><p><italic>In silico</italic> genome analysis revealed a new large class of small proteins possessing a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif similar to that in Brz. In our analysis, we concentrated on very short proteins (below 100 residues, i.e. below 12 kDa) which most likely are devoid of additional structural domains. Such small proteins are notoriously difficult to deal with. As we have recently shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Klein <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), small proteins have been systematically overlooked because of technical problems related to gel electrophoresis (protein washout) and proteomic analysis (low peptide numbers). Our data point to the high relevance of small zinc finger proteins in archaea and, to a lesser extent, in bacteria. A remarkably large fraction of the small proteins in 32 completely sequenced archaea contains a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif. On average, 8% of the small proteins contain such a motif (one in 12 proteins). This may even be an underestimation, as additional candidates were detected in yet unannotated six-frame translations. The proteins are also found in bacteria, but to a much lesser extent, as shown by analysis of 24 bacterial genomes. On average, 1.5% of the proteins contain a CPxCG-related zinc finger motif. A notable exception is <italic>S. ruber</italic>, which does not only contain a high percentage of CPxCG-related zinc finger motifs, but is otherwise also reported to have an extensive set of probably archaea-derived genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mongodin <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>If the small proteins with a CPxCG-related zinc finger protein are gene regulators in a way similar to what we have shown for Brz, then a new chapter of gene regulation analysis in archaea has to be opened. The current report is thus only a starting point. Further experiments are ongoing to analyse the role of the other small CPxCG-related zinc finger proteins with respect to functional specificity, affected targets and the general function mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> R1 and mutant strains derived from R1 were grown as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cline and Doolittle, 1987</xref>).

The algorithm is based on the identification of a CPxCG-like pattern (CPxCG, CxxCG, CPxCx) and a more general Cys/His pattern (two Cys or His separated by two to three intermediate amino acids). A CPxCG-related zinc finger motif consists of two paired patterns, of which at least one must be CPxCG-like. Based on initial data analysis, we allow pattern pairing only within the distance range of 7&#x02013;40 residues. Motif analysis of the resulting protein set against the Prosite database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hulo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) revealed a considerable (<italic>c</italic>. 15.5%) contamination with iron&#x02013;sulphur proteins (4Fe&#x02212;4S ferredoxins, rubredoxins). Negative filters using the Prosite motifs PS00198 and PS00202 were implemented to reduce these contaminations. Many of the proteins thus identified are very short. A distinct frequency maximum in the protein size range of 50&#x02013;70 residues was identified. We introduced a length cut-off of 100 amino acids (proteins thus being below 12 kDa). Further analysis is restricted to these &#x02018;small zinc finger proteins&#x02019;, i.e. proteins which have at least one CPxCG-related zinc finger motif and which are shorter than 100 residues.
