This gene codes for a protein of predicted Mr 72,800, a DNA helicase, which is also a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. The sequenced region contains an open reading frame of the correct length and orientation to encode the Rep protein. A secondary structure for the protein can be formulated from the amino acid sequence. We have compared both the primary and the secondary structures of Rep with other proteins and find the greatest homology between Rep and E. coli helicase II, the product of the uvrD gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0095-a" xlink:role="470"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0095-b" xlink:role="470"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="466"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="467"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="468"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="469"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="470"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00246-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="475"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
