Because pairing is imperfect, identification of <italic>bona fide</italic> mRNA targets presents a challenge. Most target recognition algorithms strongly emphasize pairing between nucleotides 2&#x02013;8 of the miRNA (the &#x02018;seed&#x02019; sequence) and the mRNA but adjacent sequences and the local context of the 3&#x02032; UTR also affect targeting. Here, we show that <italic>dispatched 2</italic> is a target of <italic>miR-214</italic>. In zebrafish, <italic>dispatched 2</italic> is expressed in the telencephalon and ventral hindbrain and is essential for normal zebrafish development. Regulation of <italic>dispatched 2</italic> by <italic>miR-214</italic> is via pairing with three, noncanonical, weak MREs. By comparing the repression capacity of GFP reporters containing different <italic>dispatched 2</italic> sequences, we found that a combination of weak sites, which lack canonical seed pairing, can effectively target an mRNA for silencing. This finding underscores the challenge that prediction algorithms face and emphasizes the need to experimentally validate predicted MREs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression, usually by inhibiting translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Mature miRNAs are generated from long endogenous primary transcripts by the RNAse III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer resulting in &#x0223c;22-nt double-stranded RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). One strand of the duplex gets assembled into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) coincident with target identification and pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). RISC identifies target mRNAs based on complementarity between the miRNA and mostly 3&#x02032; UTR mRNA sequences resulting in translational repression or, in cases where the pairing is perfect, degradation of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It has been suggested that 30&#x02013;50% of human genes are regulated by miRNAs, since a single miRNA can target multiple mRNAs and a given mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>MiRNAs play essential roles in development, physiology and disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Consistent with this, most miRNAs are expressed in a development-, tissue- or cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Direct cloning and genomic analyses suggest the presence of hundreds of miRNAs in higher eukaryotic genomes but only a small number have been fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). Besides identifying the full complement of miRNAs, a major problem in functional studies is the identification of the complete range of target mRNAs. Bioinformatic approaches to identify miRNA targets have been very effective in plants where complementarity between miRNAs and their target mRNAs is usually perfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In contrast, pairing in higher eukaryotes is typically imperfect with numerous gaps, mismatches and G:U base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Computational and experimental evidence led to the &#x02018;seed rule&#x02019;, where base pairing between nucleotides 2&#x02013;8 of the miRNA (the seed sequence) and its target mRNA is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). While the &#x02018;seed rule&#x02019; has been useful, there are many instances where gene silencing is observed despite multiple gaps and mismatches in the seed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Additional work has shown that other features in the 3&#x02032; UTR beyond seed pairing can affect silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>). Hence, a better understanding of the exact requirements for miRNA recognition is needed to facilitate predictive algorithms, functional characterization studies, to better design siRNAs in order to reduce potential off-target effects.</p><p>Previously, we showed that <italic>miR-214</italic> functions to modulate the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway during zebrafish somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Regulation of Hh signaling by <italic>miR-214</italic> is primarily through targeting of <italic>Suppressor of Fused</italic> (<italic>sufu</italic>). Here, we show that <italic>miR-214</italic> also targets <italic>dispatched homolog 2 (disp2)</italic>. Interestingly, for both <italic>sufu</italic> and <italic>disp2</italic>, we identified three possible miRNA recognition elements (MREs), but none of these sites contain a perfect seed match for <italic>miR-214</italic>. Our results suggest that weak sites which by themselves are capable of only minimal silencing, can combine to effectively reduce gene expression to levels comparable to that observed in the presence of perfectly complementary sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microinjection</title><p>Fertilized one-cell zebrafish embryos were injected with 1 nl volumes at the following concentrations: 2 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l of <italic>miR-214</italic>, 4 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l of <italic>disp2</italic><sup>MO</sup> (5&#x02032;-TGGACCCGCTTTCCATGCTGGAGTA-3&#x02032;), 100 ng/&#x003bc;l of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, capped <italic>disp2</italic> mRNA, 50 ng/&#x003bc;l of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, capped GFP reporter mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Target protectors</title><p>Target protectors were named and designed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

Overexpression of <italic>miR-214</italic> in zebrafish results in embryos consistently exhibiting a ventrally curved body axis at 48 h postfertilization (hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

When prediction algorithms were used to identify potential targets for <italic>miR-214</italic>, we found three possible MREs in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>disp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

As a control, we also created a construct in which two perfect MREs for <italic>miR-214</italic> were placed downstream of the GFP coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To assay silencing, synthetic mRNAs derived from these reporters were injected into single-cell zebrafish embryos in the presence or absence of exogenous <italic>miR-214</italic> and fluorescence levels in live embryos were determined at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;K). As expected, the presence of two perfect MREs for <italic>miR-214</italic> led to efficient silencing of GFP in the presence of <italic>miR-214</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F and G). Decreased fluorescence was also observed when the entire 3&#x02032; UTR from <italic>disp2</italic> was inserted downstream of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E). Deletion of the downstream half of the 3&#x02032; UTR (&#x00394;3) did not affect silencing, consistent with the fact the none of the three predicted MREs are located in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>H and I). In contrast, deletion of the upstream portion, which contains all three predicted MREs (&#x00394;5), abolished silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>J and K). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The <italic>disp2</italic> is targeted by <italic>miR-214</italic>.

As above, silencing was not observed upon deletion of the region containing the predicted MREs (&#x00394;5) nor was silencing observed when the 3&#x02032; UTR was derived from the GFP vector (GFP). As a specificity control, we also co-injected an unrelated miRNA (<italic>miR-20</italic>) with the C construct. No silencing of GFP was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>N). Lastly, we injected antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against <italic>miR-214</italic> (214<sup>MO</sup>) to determine whether inhibition of endogenous levels of <italic>miR-214</italic> during early zebrafish development would inhibit silencing of the GFP reporter. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>O&#x02013;T), inhibition of endogenous levels of <italic>miR-214</italic> led to increased GFP levels.

If <italic>miR-214</italic> targets <italic>disp2</italic>, overexpression of <italic>miR-214</italic> in zebrafish embryos should recapitulate the curling down phenotype. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, over 80% of <italic>miR-214</italic> injected embryos displayed the curling down phenotype. Interestingly, the percent of embryos displaying the curling down phenotype was nearly identical between injection of <italic>miR-214</italic> and a morpholino against the translation start site for <italic>disp2</italic> (<italic>disp2</italic><sup>MO</sup>). If the effect of excess <italic>miR-214</italic> is specific, co-injection of <italic>disp2</italic> mRNA should be able to suppress the overexpression phenotype.

Since most miRNAs target multiple mRNAs, it is likely that <italic>miR-214</italic> can still silence other mRNAs such that partial phenotypic rescue is the expected result.

If <italic>miR-214</italic> targets <italic>disp2</italic>, overexpression of <italic>miR-214</italic> should also block Prox1 expression in the hindbrain at 24 hpf. To test this, we marked the hindbrain midbrain boundary by immunostaining with CY2-tagged antibodies against Engrailed (green) and co-stained to detect Prox1 expression in the hindbrain.

Both genes contain three predicted MREs but none of these elements obey the seed rule for miRNA:mRNA pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). One possibility is that multiple weak MREs can act combinatorially to enable efficient silencing similar to the effect of one or more perfect MREs. We therefore sought to determine whether multiple weak MREs are required for silencing <italic>disp2</italic>. For this, six GFP reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) were created by deletion of one or more of the three <italic>disp2</italic> MREs. RNA was prepared from each of the resulting constructs, injected into zebrafish embryos and analyzed for fluorescence in living embryos (data not shown). Western blots were also performed on embryo lysates in the presence and absence of <italic>miR-214</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, co-injection of <italic>miR-214</italic> led to an almost 60% decrease in GFP levels when the 3&#x02032; UTR contained all three weak <italic>disp2</italic> MREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). When only two MREs were present, silencing of GFP was roughly equivalent to that observed with all three sites, regardless of the combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> D1, D2, D3). In contrast, single sites were mostly incapable of effective gene silencing although relatively small decreases were consistently observed, especially for MRE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> D12). The results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> demonstrate that the combination of three weak MREs are as effective in mediating silencing as two perfect MREs (2MRE) followed followed closely by the presence of two weak sites, which are far more effective than a single weak MRE. Thus, weak MREs can act combinatorially to silence gene expression. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Deletion analysis of <italic>disp2</italic> MRE function.

However, the results thus far illustrate that the precise requirements for any particular base are apparently quite flexible. Thus, to selectively silence one or more of the three MREs, we chose to utilize antisense morpholino target protectors designed to hybridize to MREs and block the ability of miRNAs to effect silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Three target protectors were designed complementary to portions of each of the three MREs in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>disp2</italic> (TP1, TP2, TP3). First, we co-injected all three target protectors with the C construct and <italic>miR-214</italic>. The presence of the three target protectors impaired silencing in the presence of <italic>miR-214</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;F). Co-injection of all three target protectors was not quite as efficient at blocking silencing as was co-injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against <italic>miR-214</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), but there was still a significant increase in GFP levels. Next, we co-injected single and pairwise combinations of target protectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>G and H). As shown, each individual target protector was able to restore GFP expression (from 10% to 30%) whereas pairwise combinations varied from a 30% increase in GFP levels to complete rescue in the presence of target protectors 1&#x02013;2. Taken together, efficient silencing of <italic>disp2</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR by <italic>miR-214</italic> requires contribution from multiple weak MREs. Although none of the three MREs contain perfect seed sequences, the three weak MREs can act combinatorially to silence gene expression. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Combinatorial action of weak MREs. mRNAs encoding GFP reporters containing the complete <italic>disp2</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR sequence were injected into zebrafish embryos along with target protectors against the three <italic>disp2</italic> MREs (TP1,2,3) in the presence or absence of exogenous <italic>miR-214.</italic> Single-cell embryos injected with all three target protectors were injected and examined for fluorescence at 1 dpf (<bold>A&#x02013;D</bold>).

First, using GFP reporters in zebrafish embryos, we were able to show that silencing by <italic>miR-214</italic> requires the presence of the <italic>disp2</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR. Second, overexpression of <italic>miR-214</italic> produced a curling down phenotype similar to that observed in <italic>disp2</italic> morphants. Third, interference with <italic>disp2</italic> function led to the loss of Prox1 positive nuclei in the hindbrain at 24 hpf and overexpression of <italic>miR-214</italic> phenocopied this effect. Importantly, the loss of Prox1 nuclei by injection of <italic>miR-214</italic> could be rescued by co-injection of <italic>disp2</italic> mRNA. Similarly, the curling down phenotype could be partially suppressed by co-injection of <italic>disp2</italic> mRNA. Finally, consistent with regulation by <italic>miR-214</italic>, <italic>disp2</italic> is expressed in the neural tube at 1 dpf, whereas <italic>miR-214</italic> is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). These data are entirely consistent with regulation of <italic>disp2</italic> by <italic>miR-214</italic>.</p><p>One limitation of the above results is that the exact function of Dispatched 2 remains to be determined. Despite the fact that it is very similar to Dispatched 1, loss of Dispatched 2 does not lead to detectable Hh signaling defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Thus, while curling down of zebrafish embryos is generally indicative of Hh defects, this is not thought to be the case for Dispatched 2. Complete understanding of the significance of <italic>miR-214</italic> regulation of <italic>disp2</italic> will await further functional analyses of Dispatched 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Combinatorial silencing</title><p>Many computational and experimental approaches have been used to formulate general rules that allow accurate identification of miRNA targets. Previous studies, as well as the results reported here, suggest that base pairing between the &#x02018;seed&#x02019; region (residues 2&#x02013;8 from the 5&#x02032;-end) of the miRNA and the mRNA target is the most readily identifiable determinant for predicting and establishing specificity. However, perfect seed pairing is not necessarily sufficient for repression. The degree of repression can also be influenced by adjacent AU-rich sequences, the distance between MREs and stop codons and accessibility of the 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Our results demonstrate that even sites that violate the pairing rules above can still serve to mediate silencing provided the presence of multiple weak sites. This finding further challenges prediction algorithms by increasing the number of sites that serve as <italic>bona fide</italic> targets.</p><p>We previously showed that targeting of <italic>sufu</italic> by <italic>miR-214</italic> is via three weak MREs and we extend that observation here to show that <italic>disp2</italic> is similarly regulated through the cooperative action of three weak MREs. For all three <italic>disp2</italic> sites, there are gaps and G:U base pairs within the seed region and the pairing with the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>miR-214</italic> is even weaker. Individually, these sites are not effective targets but, surprisingly, in combination, can lead to silencing as effective as perfect sites. A different observation was made previously in an invertebrate model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), where multiple weak sites were not found to act combinatorially, concluding that weak sites, which by themselves cannot mediate silencing do not do so in combination. This suggests that the rules for miRNA&#x02013;mRNA recognition are not absolute and that the mechanisms of silencing may be slightly different between species. Based on our study, an additive model does not accurately reflect silencing and instead, a synergistic model most closely approximates the combined effects of multiple weak MREs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grant GM 075790 to J.G.P.
