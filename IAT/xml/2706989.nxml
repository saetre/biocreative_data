Recent studies have shown an increasing number of ciliary genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of PKD. In this study, the Gli-similar3 (<italic>glis3</italic>) gene was identified as the causal gene of the medaka pc mutant, a model of PKD. In the pc mutant, a transposon was found to be inserted into the fourth intron of the <italic>pc/glis3</italic> gene, causing aberrant splicing of the <italic>pc/glis3</italic> mRNA and thus a putatively truncated protein with a defective zinc finger domain. <italic>pc/glis3</italic> mRNA is expressed in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules and ducts of the pronephros and mesonephros, and also in the pancreas. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of <italic>pc/glis3</italic> resulted in cyst formation in the pronephric tubules of medaka fry. Although three other <italic>glis</italic> family members, <italic>glis1a</italic>, <italic>glis1b</italic> and <italic>glis2</italic>, were found in the medaka genome, none were expressed in the embryonic or larval kidney. In the pc mutant, the urine flow rate in the pronephros was significantly reduced, which was considered to be a direct cause of renal cyst formation. The cilia on the surface of the renal tubular epithelium were significantly shorter in the pc mutant than in wild-type, suggesting that shortened cilia resulted in a decrease in driving force and, in turn, a reduction in urine flow rate. Most importantly, EGFP-tagged pc/glis3 protein localized in primary cilia as well as in the nucleus when expressed in mouse renal epithelial cells, indicating a strong connection between pc/glis3 and ciliary function. Unlike human patients with <italic>GLIS3</italic> mutations, the medaka pc mutant shows none of the symptoms of a pancreatic phenotype, such as impaired insulin expression and/or diabetes, suggesting that the pc mutant may be suitable for use as a kidney-specific model for human <italic>GLIS3</italic> patients.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common heritable kidney condition in humans. It is characterized by the appearance of fluid-filled cysts in the renal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, with pleiotropic lesions sometimes occurring in other organs, such as the liver, the retina and the pancreas (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Igarashi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). Recent studies have proposed that renal cilia, which are immotile organelles projecting from the renal epithelium into the lumen of the nephric tubule or duct, play a crucial role in cyst formation. Animal models such as <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> and <italic>Kif3a</italic> mutant mice, which have atypically structured cilia in the renal tubule, have cystic kidneys (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Yoder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), suggesting that normally structured renal cilia are required for the maintenance of tubular lumen morphology. Mutations in <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic>, which encode polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively, are responsible for most cases of PKD in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Hughes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Mochizuki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Both polycystins localize in the primary cilia and evoke cellular responses to mechanostimuli of cilia, such as an increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Pazour1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Yoder2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings imply that primary cilia bearing the polycystin-1/-2 complex function as mechanosensors of renal flow, sensing the rate of flow and thereby initiating the ciliary signal, which gives rise to the cellular response and the regulation of lumen size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Nauli1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Nauli2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous reports have suggested that PKD pathogenesis is associated with aberrant cell proliferation as well as altered planar cell polarity in the renal tubular and ductal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Yoder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Fischer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Hildebrandt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies of zebrafish and medaka PKD mutants have revealed that the ciliary beating motion is required on the surface of the renal epithelium for the generation of urine flow in the pronephric duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-KramerZucker1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Omran1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, in fish, a low urine flow rate is thought to lead to cyst formation. The role of the cilia in PKD pathogenesis differs in fish and mammals: the cilia in fish are motile and actively induce urine flow, whereas in mammals, the cilia merely serve as passive sensors of urine flow.</p><p>The medaka pc mutant is a piscine mesonephric model of PKD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Mochizuki2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, meaning that the mutant develops typical PKD symptoms such as swollen renal tubules, fluid-filled cysts, and abdominal enlargement, all of which are inherited in an autosomal and recessive manner. The PKD phenotype in the pc mutant becomes histologically apparent soon after the completion of pronephric development (several days after hatching). As the mesonephros develops, the condition becomes more apparent, and, by the end of the animal's life, the abdomen has become severely distended. Although our previous findings revealed that pc mutants have cilia on the surface of the renal tubular epithelium, we did not determine whether these cilia are normal in terms of structure and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Mochizuki2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. While PKD patients and other animal models are known to have multiple disorders in which organs other than the kidney are affected, including retinal degeneration, hepatic fibrosis, <italic>situs inversus</italic>, and cystic disease in the pancreas or the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Bisgrove1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Hildebrandt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, medaka pc mutants do not develop notable pleiotropic lesions in addition to PKD. Given that PKD is a late-onset condition that progresses at a moderate rate in pc mutants, the medaka pc mutant has a relatively long life when compared with zebrafish pronephric models of cystic kidney, such as vHnf1, <italic>double bubble</italic>, and <italic>oval</italic> (<italic>polaris/IFT88/osm-5</italic>) mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Hostetter1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Liu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The combined features of the medaka pc mutant show that it is a good clinical model of the human form of the disease.</p><p>In this study, we identified Gli-similar 3 (<italic>glis3</italic>) as the causal gene of the pc mutant by positional cloning. Human <italic>GLIS3</italic> was recently identified as the gene responsible for a neonatal diabetes syndrome associated with congenital hypothyroidism, congenital glaucoma, hepatic fibrosis and polycystic kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Senee1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we provide evidence that clearly indicates that a mutation in the <italic>pc/glis3</italic> gene causes PKD in medaka.

Physical mapping positioned the pc locus between the two markers 201K4F and 174E15R. The BAC MF001SSA174E15 contains the pc locus. (C) Distribution of genes predicted by Genscan. The 174E15 BAC insertion was sequenced using the shotgun method. Five genes, similar to <italic>glis3</italic> (blue), <italic>RFX3</italic> (pink), <italic>SMAD4</italic> (light green), <italic>BMP10</italic> (green) and <italic>catenin arvcf-2ABC</italic> (yellow), respectively, were predicted in this region. (D) Structure of the <italic>pc/glis3</italic> gene. The <italic>pc/glis3</italic> gene consists of 10 exons, with the third exon alternatively spliced to produce two different mRNAs with two different presumptive start codons. The positions of the start and the stop codons are indicated by arrows below the diagram of the gene structure. The arrowhead indicates the insertion point (5261/5726). (E) Structure of the insertion in the pc mutant. By comparing the sequences of the pc mutant cDNA and the pc genome, regions behaving as exons were identified for the pc locus. Three exonic sequences, p7, p8 and p9, were found at least twice in the pc mutant mRNA. In the pc genome, this fragment was found in the insertional region indicated by the arrowhead in (D). The sequence of the 3&#x02032; region of the insertion (dotted line) is unknown. (F) Sequence of the insertion point at the pc locus. A transposon-like sequence (&#x0003e;10 kb) was inserted into the fourth intron (3&#x02032; to the 5261 nucleotide of the 5726 bp intron). Like the insertion in the medaka rs-3 mutant, this insertion in the pc mutant contained 18 bp inverted repeats (blue) with 4 bp (TTAA in orange) duplications at the ends. Internal sequences of approximately 300 bp, with homology to the rs-3 transposon, were found adjacent to the 18 bp repeats at both ends (AB491224, AB491225). The arrowhead indicates the insertion point (WT) and the boundary of the transposon-like insertion and the innate sequence (pc). The other internal region of the insertion (&#x0003e;10 kb) is shown as a dotted line. (G) Predicted structures of WT and mutant pc mRNAs and proteins. The structures of mRNA (upper) and protein (lower) are shown for the WT and pc mutants. WT mRNA is transcribed from 10 exons. The third exon is alternatively spliced (light blue). The pc mutant mRNA lacks the 3&#x02032; region corresponding to exons 5&#x02013;10. Instead, it has a different 3&#x02032; tail that is specific to the pc mutant (dark blue). The regions depicted in light green and orange indicate the sequences encoding the zinc fingers and the nuclear localization signal, respectively. The other exons are depicted in blue. Alternative splicing of exon 3 appeared to produce two distinct N-terminal domains, with the short form lacking the light-colored N-terminus. Zinc fingers are depicted as green boxes. The pc mutant protein lacks part of the second zinc finger motif and all three zinc fingers thereafter. The diamond-shaped region indicates a predicted nuclear localization signal. Other regions of the pc/glis3 protein are colored gray. The white box of the pc mutant protein corresponds to the amino acids produced from the pc insertional sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006299.g001"/></fig><p>We then used BAC walking to construct a physical map with BAC clones that covered the pc locus.

However, unlike the 9&#x0002b;0 arrangement of mammalian renal cilia, the cilia in medaka are organized in a 9&#x0002b;2 arrangement, the same arrangement as that usually found in motile cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Yoder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-KramerZucker1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Mochizuki2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, in the present study we found that medaka renal cilia are motile, beating in a circular motion and having an undulating appearance (data not shown).

Our present data show that cilia were significantly shorter and urine flow rate was reduced in the pc mutant. We speculate that the abnormally short cilia of renal epithelial cells may not be able to generate the driving force required for normal rates of urine flow, possibly leading to urine accumulation and subsequent cyst formation. Urine accumulation or cyst formation may cause the secondary phenotype of elevated cell proliferation in the tubular and ductal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006299-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Despite the existence of inter-species differences in the architecture and motility of renal cilia, our results indicate that having cilia of sufficient length is crucial for maintaining lumen size in the renal tubules and ducts.

The mutation found in <italic>pc/glis3</italic> of the medaka pc mutant was caused by a large transposon inserted at a position corresponding to the second zinc finger, which we predict would result in a defective zinc finger motif and the absence of the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006299-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>).

These lines of evidence, together with our results, suggest that the C-terminal domain of pc/glis3 is crucial for the proper function of this protein in the kidney. Despite the allele-specific manifestation of cyst formation in human patients, our finding that <italic>pc/glis3</italic> causes PKD in medaka has clearly shown that loss of GLIS3 function can lead to renal cyst formation across species.</p><p>Transcripts of <italic>pc/glis3</italic> were observed to be abundantly expressed in the beta cells of medaka in this study. However, no mutant phenotypes were found in the pancreatic tissues of pc mutants. Conversely, human <italic>GLIS3</italic> mutations cause neonatal diabetes. Further studies are required to explain the functional differences in the pancreas between medaka and humans. Notably, there are fundamental differences in the nutritional requirements of humans and fish; for example, amino acids rather than glucose are the most important insulinotropins in fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006299-Andoh1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, the pathogenesis of diabetes may differ markedly in mammals and fish. However, if it is assumed that members of the <italic>glis</italic> family have similar activities, the overlapping expression of the different <italic>glis</italic> family members in the pancreas but not in the kidney might preclude the occurrence of pancreatic phenotypes in the pc mutant. Ultimately, this difference in phenotype between mammals and medaka would position the pc mutant as a kidney-specific disease model of human <italic>GLIS3</italic> mutations.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified the medaka pc gene, an ortholog of human <italic>GLIS3</italic>, as a gene causing cystic kidney. The protein encoded by the gene is possibly required for normal motility of cilia located on the renal tubular and ductal epithelium and thus also for the generation of normal urine flow in medaka. To better understand the function of <italic>pc/glis3</italic> in the kidney and its role in PKD pathogenesis, comparative studies of the involvement of pc/glis3 in ciliary motility in fish and ciliary mechanosensitivity in mammals should be undertaken.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006299.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Analysis of pc/glis3 mRNA expression (A) RT-PCR of wild-type (WT, left) and the pc mutant (right) pc/glis3 mRNA. pc/glis3 mRNA was not detectable in the pc mutant using the PCR primers <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GTTTGAAGGCTGCAAGAAGGCATT-3&#x02032;</named-content> (sense) and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTTGCGTAACTGTCGCTCTTG-3&#x02032;</named-content> (antisense), which would amplify the 3&#x02032; region of the transcript (271 bp).
