There are three well described polymorphisms that are associated with increased protein production in experimental systems: a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat <italic>(CA simple sequence repeat 1 &#x0005b;CA-SSR1&#x0005d;)</italic> in intron one (lower number of repeats) and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region, &#x02212;216 (G/T or T/T) and &#x02212;191 (C/A or A/A). The objective of this study was to examine distributions of these three polymorphisms and their relationships to each other and to <italic>EGFR</italic> gene mutations and allelic imbalance (AI) in non-small cell lung cancers.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We examined the frequencies of the three polymorphisms of <italic>EGFR</italic> in 556 resected lung cancers and corresponding non-malignant lung tissues from 336 East Asians, 213 individuals of Northern European descent, and seven of other ethnicities. We also studied the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene in 93 corresponding non-malignant lung tissue samples from European-descent patients from Italy and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 250 normal healthy US individuals enrolled in epidemiological studies including individuals of European descent, African&#x02013;Americans, and Mexican&#x02013;Americans. We sequenced the four exons (18&#x02013;21) of the TK domain known to harbor activating mutations in tumors and examined the status of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles (presence of heterozygosity, repeat number of the alleles, and relative amplification of one allele) and allele-specific amplification of mutant tumors as determined by a standardized semiautomated method of microsatellite analysis. Variant forms of SNP &#x02212;216 (G/T or T/T) and SNP &#x02212;191 (C/A or A/A) (associated with higher protein production in experimental systems) were less frequent in East Asians than in individuals of other ethnicities (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001). Both alleles of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> were significantly longer in East Asians than in individuals of other ethnicities (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001). Expression studies using bronchial epithelial cultures demonstrated a trend towards increased mRNA expression in cultures having the variant SNP &#x02212;216 G/T or T/T genotypes. Monoallelic amplification of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> locus was present in 30.6&#x00025; of the informative cases and occurred more often in individuals of East Asian ethnicity. AI was present in 44.4&#x00025; (95&#x00025; confidence interval: 34.1&#x00025;&#x02013;54.7&#x00025;) of mutant tumors compared with 25.9&#x00025; (20.6&#x00025;&#x02013;31.2&#x00025;) of wild-type tumors (<italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.002). The shorter allele in tumors with AI in East Asian individuals was selectively amplified (shorter allele dominant) more often in mutant tumors (75.0&#x00025;, 61.6&#x00025;&#x02013;88.4&#x00025;) than in wild-type tumors (43.5&#x00025;, 31.8&#x00025;&#x02013;55.2&#x00025;, <italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.003). In addition, there was a strong positive association between AI ratios of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles and AI of mutant alleles.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The three polymorphisms associated with increased EGFR protein production (shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> length and variant forms of SNPs &#x02212;216 and &#x02212;191) were found to be rare in East Asians as compared to other ethnicities, suggesting that the cells of East Asians may make relatively less intrinsic EGFR protein. Interestingly, especially in tumors from patients of East Asian ethnicity, <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were found to favor the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1,</italic> and selective amplification of the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> occurred frequently in tumors harboring a mutation. These distinct molecular events targeting the same allele would both be predicted to result in greater EGFR protein production and/or activity. Our findings may help explain to some of the ethnic differences observed in mutational frequencies and responses to TK inhibitors.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Masaharu Nomura and colleagues examine the distribution of<italic>EGFR</italic> polymorphisms in different populations and find differences that might explain different responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Most cases of lung cancer&#x02014;the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide&#x02014;are &#x0201c;non-small cell lung cancer&#x0201d; (NSCLC), which has a very low cure rate. Recently, however, &#x0201c;targeted&#x0201d; therapies have brought new hope to patients with NSCLC. Like all cancers, NSCLC occurs when cells begin to divide uncontrollably because of changes (mutations) in their genetic material. Chemotherapy drugs treat cancer by killing these rapidly dividing cells, but, because some normal tissues are sensitive to these agents, it is hard to kill the cancer completely without causing serious side effects. Targeted therapies specifically attack the changes in cancer cells that allow them to divide uncontrollably, so it might be possible to kill the cancer cells selectively without damaging normal tissues. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGRF) was one of the first molecules for which a targeted therapy was developed. In normal cells, messenger proteins bind to EGFR and activate its &#x0201c;tyrosine kinase,&#x0201d; an enzyme that sticks phosphate groups on tyrosine (an amino acid) in other proteins. These proteins then tell the cell to divide. Alterations to this signaling system drive the uncontrolled growth of some cancers, including NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Molecules that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR (for example, gefitinib) dramatically shrink some NSCLCs, particularly those in East Asian patients. Tumors shrunk by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often (but not always) have mutations in EGFR's tyrosine kinase. However, not all tumors with these mutations respond to TKIs, and other genetic changes&#x02014;for example, amplification (multiple copies) of the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene&#x02014;also affect tumor responses to TKIs. It would be useful to know which genetic changes predict these responses when planning treatments for NSCLC and to understand why the frequency of these changes varies between ethnic groups. In this study, the researchers have examined three polymorphisms&#x02014;differences in DNA sequences that occur between individuals&#x02014;in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene in people with and without NSCLC. In addition, they have looked for associations between these polymorphisms, which are present in every cell of the body, and the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene mutations and allelic imbalances (genes occur in pairs but amplification or loss of one copy, or allele, often causes allelic imbalance in tumors) that occur in NSCLCs.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers measured how often three <italic>EGFR</italic> polymorphisms (the length of a repeat sequence called <italic>CA-SSR1,</italic> and two single nucleotide variations &#x0005b;SNPs&#x0005d;)&#x02014;all of which probably affect how much protein is made from the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene&#x02014;occurred in normal tissue and NSCLC tissue from East Asians and individuals of European descent. They also looked for mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase and allelic imbalance in the tumors, and then determined which genetic variations and alterations tended to occur together in people with the same ethnicity. Among many associations, the researchers found that shorter alleles of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> and the minor forms of the two SNPs occurred less often in East Asians than in individuals of European descent. They also confirmed that <italic>EGFR</italic> kinase mutations were more common in NSCLCs in East Asians than in European-descent individuals. Furthermore, mutations occurred more often in tumors with allelic imbalance, and in tumors where there was allelic imbalance and an <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation, the mutant allele was amplified more often than the wild-type allele.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The researchers use these associations between gene variants and tumor-associated alterations to propose a model to explain the ethnic differences in mutational frequencies and responses to TKIs seen in NSCLC. They suggest that because of the polymorphisms in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene commonly seen in East Asians, people from this ethnic group make less EGFR protein than people from other ethnic groups. This would explain why, if a threshold level of EGFR is needed to drive cells towards malignancy, East Asians have a high frequency of amplified <italic>EGFR</italic> tyrosine kinase mutations in their tumors&#x02014;mutation followed by amplification would be needed to activate EGFR signaling. This model, though speculative, helps to explain some clinical findings, such as the frequency of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations and of TKI sensitivity in NSCLCs in East Asians. Further studies of this type in different ethnic groups and in different tumors, as well as with other genes for which targeted therapies are available, should help oncologists provide personalized cancer therapies for their patients.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040125">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040125</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>US National Cancer Institute information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung">lung cancer</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment">cancer treatment</ext-link> for patients and professionals</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007194.htm">MedlinePlus encyclopedia entries</ext-link> on NSCLC</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=2787">Cancer Research UK information</ext-link> for patients about all aspects of lung cancer, including treatment with TKIs</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer">lung cancer</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor">EGFR</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefitinib">gefitinib</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Nomura M, Shigematsu H, Li L, Suzuki M, Takahashi T, et al.

For analysis of repeat allele lengths and relative ratios, instrumentation and reagents from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California, United States) were utilized. The reverse primer was labeled with TAMRA fluorescent dye (6-FAM) at the 5&#x02032; end. The 25-&#x003bc;l PCR reaction mixture contained 100 ng of genomic DNA, 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer containing 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM of each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1.25 units of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). After an initial denaturalization step at 95 &#x000b0;C for 12 min, samples were cycled 35 times as follows: 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 60 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 30 s. The final extension was at 72 &#x000b0;C for 20 min. The size of the products (about 80 bp) was confirmed by electrophoresis on 2&#x00025; agarose gels. After PCR, 1 &#x003bc;l of the product plus 0.5 &#x003bc;l of Genescan 500 ROX molecular weight standard were denatured in 12 &#x003bc;l of Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems) and separated with a Prism Genetic Analyzer and analyzed by Gene Scan Analysis software 3.1 (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Examination of the resultant traces demonstrated that biallelic (heterozygous) samples showed two sets of waves and two peaks, while the monoallelic (homozygous) samples showed a single set of waves and one peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The highest peak reflects the repeat number of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> allele as determined by the size marker, while the preceding waves (stutter bands) represent PCR-induced artifacts. In samples without AI the shorter peak appears artificially larger as a result of preferential PCR amplification. In non-malignant lung tissue the alleles were presumed to be of equal size, and their ratios were used as a correction factor for this artificial discrepancy.</p><p>The degree of the amplification of each allele was indicated by the area under the peak as determined by software provided by the instrument's manufacturer. The relative ratios (AI ratios), termed LOH score in previous reports, of the two peaks (shorter peak area under the curve to longer peak area under the curve) in tumor samples were calculated as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The AI ratio was calculated thus: AI ratio &#x0003d; (T1 &#x000d7; N2)/(T2 &#x000d7; N1), where T indicates tumor, N indicates normal, 1 indicates the area under the peak for the shorter allele, and 2 indicates the area under the peak for the longer allele.</p><p>As either peak could be increased in relative size, AI cases were divided into shorter allele dominant (SAD) or longer allele dominant (LAD) cases. We used the definitions of these two categories as determined previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. SAD cases are defined as cases in which the adjusted AI ratio was greater than 1.27, and LAD cases were those in which the adjusted AI ratio was less than 0.79. For LAD cases, the formula results in ratio values less than unity. Therefore, the ratio was inverted for LAD cases, allowing the AI ratios to reflect the relative size of the longer allele, irrespective of which allele was increased in relative size. We confirmed the previous finding that the ratios of the areas under the curve for the two alleles in constitutional DNA on repeat testing or from different individuals are relatively constant. From an analysis of constitutional DNA from over 500 healthy individuals and cancer patients, we determined that the mean ratio of the two alleles in non-malignant tissues was 1.3, resulting from artificial preferential amplification of the shorter allele (data not shown). For tumor samples lacking corresponding non-malignant tissue, the AI was determined by the formula AI ratio &#x0003d; T1/(T2 &#x000d7; 1.3).</p><p>The primers for investigation of selective amplification of the mutant or wild-type (WT) allele of exon 19 in-frame deletions and the exon 21 point mutation L858R were designed as follows: 5&#x02032;-TCA CAA TTG CCA GTT AAC GTC T-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-CAG CAA AGC AGA AAC TCA CAT C-3&#x02032; (reverse) for exon 19, and 5&#x02032;-ATG AAC TAC TTG GAG GAC CGT C-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-TGC CTC CTT CTG CAT GGT ATT C-3&#x02032; (reverse) for exon 21. Each forward primer was labeled with TAMRA fluorescent dye (6-FAM) at the 5&#x02032; end. The conditions for PCR were the same as for <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> except for the annealing temperature (57 &#x000b0;C for exon 19 and 61 &#x000b0;C for exon 21). The PCR products of exon 21 were cut by the restriction enzyme Sau96I (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States) and analyzed. The size of each product (about 142 bp for mutant alleles of exon 19, 158 bp for the WT allele of exon 19, 100 bp for mutant the allele of exon 21, and 150 bp for the WT allele of exon 21) was also confirmed by electrophoresis in 2&#x00025; agarose gels.</p><p>The ratio (mutant allele/WT allele) to define amplification of each mutant allele, exon 19 in-frame deletion or the L858R point mutation, was determined by ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves using the definitive value of AI, 1.27 (data not shown). The definitive ratios for exon 19 and 21 were 0.82 (sensitivity 70&#x00025;, specificity 68&#x00025;) and 0.2 (sensitivity 90&#x00025;, specificity 90&#x00025;), respectively, and the combined definitive ratio was 0.47 (sensitivity 70&#x00025;, specificity 61&#x00025;). We used these ratios as cut-off values to determine whether the mutant allele was amplified. Because of the presence of various amounts of non-malignant cells in the tumor samples, amplifications of the WT allele could not be determined with certainty.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Real-Time PCR for the Expression of <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA</title><p>cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 2 &#x003bc;g of RNA from cell lines using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States).

These data permitted us to presume that the polymorphism frequencies in patients with lung cancer follow the pattern of the general population, and we can combine the data from healthy individuals and patients with NSCLC for individuals of European descent, which is the dominant ethnicity of the US, Italy, and Australia populations in this study. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in this study for the frequencies of all three polymorphisms between individuals of European descent in the US versus in Italy, nor between East Asians in Japan versus in Taiwan (data not shown).

As expression in normal epithelial cells is low or not detectable in the absence of ligand, the HBECs were cultured in EGF-containing medium (5 ng/ml). Expression in the HBECs was relatively low, with a narrow range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The lung cancer lines, grown in the absence of added ligand, showed considerable variability of expression.

Similar data have been reported recently from another group &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. For cases with AI of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> (see below) or of the mutant allele, no differences in patient survival were noted (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>AI of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> Alleles</title><p>The degree of amplification of each allele was reflected by the relative area under the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and the AI was determined by the ratio of shorter to longer <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles in informative cases where two alleles were of different length. Among 450 tumor cases where the corresponding non-malignant lung tissues were available, there was no difference in the presence of homo- or heterozygosity of allele length or in the repeat length of each allele between tumor and non-malignant tissues (data not shown). These findings permitted us to analyze all 556 cases using the tumor tissues alone. For the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles, 376 (68&#x00025;) of 556 cases were informative. The informative rate was similar to that in other previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in our study the informative rate was not consistent across ethnicities: there was an informative rate of 62.8 &#x00025; (211/336) in East Asians and 75.0&#x00025; (165/220) in other ethnicities. Of the 376 informative cases, we excluded cases with mutations other than deletions in exon 19 or the L858R mutation in exon 21 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12) as well as patients of ethnicities other than East Asians and individuals of European descent (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) and Asians in the US (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 3). Of the remaining 356 NSCLC cases of East Asian or European descent, 263 had the WT <italic>EGFR</italic> gene and 95 had the mutations in exon 19 or exon 21.</p><p>For these 356 cases, we determined the ratios of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles as previously described in the Methods section. AI, defined by an allelic ratio greater than 1.27 or less than 0.79, was present in 109 (30.6 &#x00025;) of the cases but was significantly more frequent (<italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.002) in cases with mutant tumors (44.4&#x00025;, 34.1&#x00025;&#x02013;54.7&#x00025;) than in those with WT tumors (25.9&#x00025;, 20.6&#x00025;&#x02013;31.2&#x00025;), and in East Asians (35.6&#x00025;, 29.0&#x00025;&#x02013;42.2&#x00025;) than in individuals of European descent (23.8&#x00025;, 17.0&#x00025;&#x02013;30.6&#x00025;) (<italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.019) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040125-t007">Table 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0040125-sd007">Dataset S3</xref>).</p><p>The 109 cases with AI were also divided into SAD or LAD.

Also, in East Asians the SAD frequency was significantly higher (<italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.001) in tumors with the exon 19 or exon 21 mutation than in those without mutations (82.4&#x00025;, 69.6&#x00025;&#x02013;95.2&#x00025;, versus 41.0&#x00025;, 25.6&#x00025;&#x02013;56.4&#x00025;). This difference, however, was not observed in patients of European descent.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>AI of Mutant to WT Allele</title><p>For cases with the deletions in exon 19 or the L858R mutation in exon 21, the AI of the mutant allele was determined by the mutant/WT allele ratio. A flow chart describing the process of case selection and exclusion is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g004">Figure 4</xref>. These mutant cases gave us an opportunity to examine the association between AI in amplification of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> repeats and AI in the ratio of mutant to WT alleles. Specifically, we wished to determine, in cases having both forms of AI, whether the mutant form was selectively amplified in association with selective amplification of the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic>. As described in the Methods section, we devised methods to determine the ratios of mutant to WT alleles for the two most frequent mutations, deletions in exon 19 and the L858R mutation in exon 21, which together account for &#x0223c;85&#x00025; of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in NSCLC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Of the 109 cases with mutations (in exon 19 or L858R), sufficient DNA was available from 76. Of these 76 samples, 32 (42.1&#x00025;) tumors had selective imbalance involving the mutant allele. The ratio of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles was utilized to determine whether AI was present and, if present, which of the two alleles was preferentially overrepresented. Of these 32 samples having AI of the mutant allele, 26 (81.3&#x00025;) also had AI of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic>. In addition, a positive correlation between AI ratios of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> and mutant/WT ratios was observed in tumors having either form of mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The linear correlation was tested using Pearson's correlation and found to be significant. However, because of the possibility that the observed strong correlation might be driven by extreme values given the small sample size of the available cases, we used a nonparametric test instead to compare mutant/WT ratios between those with SAD and those without. As expected, for all the mutations under study, the cases with SAD had higher mean mutant/WT ratios than those without SAD. These findings agreed with our hypothesis that in cases demonstrating <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> imbalance, the mutant allele was more frequently increased in relative copy number compared to the WT allele.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we examined the frequency of three germline polymorphisms in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene in healthy individuals of different ethnicities, and in non-malignant and malignant lung tissue from patients with NSCLC. We found ethnic-related differences in polymorphism frequencies consistent with previous reports, indicating that the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> and the minor forms of SNPs &#x02212;191 (C/A or A/A) and &#x02212;216 (G/T or T/T) are significantly less frequent in East Asians than in individuals of European descent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, we noted a relationship between the presence of the short form of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> and the minor forms of the SNPs. The published data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; and our observations regarding <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA expression in HBECs suggest that the shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> allele lengths and the variant forms of the &#x02212;191 and &#x02212;216 polymorphisms are associated with increased intrinsic gene expression. However, most of the data in the literature are from the results of transfection studies or tumor cell lines, and thus may not reflect the state of normal epithelial cells. As sections of non-malignant lung contain only a small minority of epithelial cells, a study of adjacent non-malignant lung tissues from resected cases or peripheral blood cells would not yield meaningful data. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we studied 11 cultures of immortalized HBECs. These cultures show minimal genetic changes. In the presence of ligand stimulation, we demonstrated a trend for increased mRNA expression in lines having the SNP &#x02212;216 G/T or T/T genotypes, consistent with published data. The published reports and our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cells of individuals of East Asian ethnicity express less <italic>EGFR</italic> protein constitutively than cells of individuals of other ethnicities. However, final experimental proof for this hypothesis is still lacking.</p><p>Amplification of the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene is relatively common in lung and other cancers, and may be associated with mutations of the TK domain in lung cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; or of the extracellular domain in glioblastomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Two recent reports describe a correlation between copy numbers of the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and response to TKIs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study we used allelic size differences in the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> repeat polymorphism to determine AI of the gene. AI was observed in 30.2&#x00025; of informative cases, a frequency comparable to increased copy number as detected by FISH analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. AI was significantly more frequent in East Asians and occurred nearly twice as frequently in mutant cases than in WT cases. A relationship between increased copy number by FISH analysis and mutation has also been described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. While there were no significant differences in the frequencies of either the shorter or longer allele being involved in the imbalance for all of the cases or for all of the mutant cases, in mutant cases arising in East Asians, the shorter allele was twice as likely to be preferentially amplified as the longer allele.</p><p>Finally we determined whether the mutant allele was selectively amplified in tumors having both mutation and imbalance. For tumors having deletion mutations in exon 19 or the L858R point mutation in exon 21 (together accounting for 86.5&#x00025; of all mutations) we devised methods for determining the ratio of mutant to WT alleles. Of 76 cases examined, 42.1&#x00025; demonstrated imbalance of the mutant allele. This figure is consistent with our finding of an overall AI (from analysis of the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> alleles) percentage of 45.3&#x00025; in mutant cases, and suggests that in mutation-containing tumors having AI, the mutant allele is the one that is usually amplified. Having found, by separate analyses in mutant cases, that both the shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> allele and the mutant allele were selectively amplified, we performed a correlation of these two forms of imbalance and demonstrated a strong positive association.</p><p>Incorporation of our findings and previously published data form the basis of a hypothesis suggesting a close relationship between <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> length, SNP &#x02212;191 polymorphism, and SNP &#x02212;216 polymorphism and <italic>EGFR</italic> gene amplification. As mentioned above, all three of these polymorphisms (shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> length and the variant forms of the two SNPs) are reported to be associated with increased <italic>EGFR</italic> production, and they were rarely observed in East Asians. These findings suggest that the cells of most East Asians make less <italic>EGFR</italic> protein than do the cells of individuals of other ethnicities. If a certain critical level of <italic>EGFR</italic> is required to drive the cell toward a malignant phenotype, mutations of the TK domain and autonomous activation of downstream signaling may target East Asians, the subgroup with possibly lower intrinsic protein production. Also, we found in East Asians (but not in individuals of European descent) that mutations target the shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> allele (suggestive of greater protein production) followed by allele-specific amplification of the mutant allele. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040125-g005">Figure 5</xref>, three events target the same allele: (a) shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> repeat length, (b) activating mutation, and (c) selective amplification of the mutant allele. These interactions favor greater protein production in mutant tumors. A similar observation was made in glioblastomas, which frequently contain a mutation or splicing variant resulting in loss of much of the extracellular domain of <italic>EGFR</italic>. The variant form of the allele frequently demonstrated allele-specific amplification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. As previously mentioned, FISH technology has been used to demonstrate that <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification and mutation often, but not invariably, occur together &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040125-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The three polymorphisms associated with increased EGFR protein production (shorter <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> length and the variant forms of SNPs &#x02212;216 and &#x02212;191) were found to be rare in East Asians as compared to individuals of other ethnicities, suggesting that the cells of East Asians may make relatively less intrinsic EGFR protein. Interestingly, especially in tumors from patients of East Asian ethnicity, <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were found to favor the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1,</italic> and selective amplification of the shorter allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> occurred frequently in tumors harboring a mutation. These distinct molecular events targeting the same allele would both be predicted to result in greater EGFR protein production and/or activity. These findings may reveal what underlies some of the ethnic differences observed in mutational frequencies and responses to TKIs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation into Japanese by Masaharu Nomura</title><p>(27 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd002"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S2</label><caption><title>Translation into French by Masaharu Nomura</title><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd003"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S3</label><caption><title>Translation into German by Masaharu Nomura</title><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd004"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S4</label><caption><title>Translation into Spanish by Masaharu Nomura</title><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd005"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><title>Ethnic Differences in Polymorphisms</title><p>(37 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd005.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd006"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><title>Relationship between the Three Polymorphisms and <italic>EGFR</italic> Mutations</title><p>(55 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd006.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sd007"><label>Dataset S3</label><caption><title>Mutations Target the <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> Allele Having the Lower Number of Repeats</title><p>(48 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040125.sd007.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040125-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>The Prognosis of Patients Based on the Average Length of the Shorter Allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic></title><p>Overall survival curves for patients having a short allele of <italic>CA-SSR1</italic> under versus over the average length (17.5).
