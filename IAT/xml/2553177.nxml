Of note, the impact of Natalizumab as measured by decrease of CD49d SFI on T cells directly correlates with the presence of neutralizing antibodies against Natalizumab: one patient in our cohort showed an initial decrease of CD49d immunoreactivity at M1, followed by a return to baseline at M6 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003319.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

To assess transmigration of CD4&#x0002b; T cells we used fibronectin coated Boyden chambers, a well characterized experimental set-up to assess transmigration mediated by interaction of VLA-4 on the T cell surface with its alternative binding partner, the CS-1 fragment of fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Niino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Prat1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

To find out whether Natalizumab might favour the migration of Tregs, we assessed the percentage of Foxp3&#x0002b; T cells at baseline and within the migrated fraction. A selective blockade of non-regulatory CD4&#x0002b; compared to Tregs should have resulted in an enrichment of Foxp3&#x0002b; T cells within the migrated fraction.

To allow a direct comparison of the suppressive capacity of MS patient derived Tregs before and after initiation of Natalizumab therapy we had to rely on frozen PBMC samples to conduct functional suppression assays.

Sequential flow cytometrical analysis demonstrated that a 3 day culture period was necessary for the CD25 surface expression to fully recover, thus allowing the distinction of regulatory and non-regulatory T cells. Several methods of cell purification were evaluated to guarantee a high purity of Tregs. However, neither magnetic cell purification using a commercially available Treg purification kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany), nor fluorescence activated cell sorting for the CD4&#x0002b;CD25<sup>high</sup> population yielded the desired purity as demonstrated by intracellular staining for Foxp3 on purified T cell subsets (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003319.s002">Figure S2a</xref>). However, the additional staining for the recently described marker CD127 (IL-7 receptor) distinguishing Tregs from non-regulatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Liu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Seddiki1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and gating on the CD4&#x0002b;CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> population helped to consistently isolate highly pure (&#x0003e;95&#x00025;) Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs by fluorescence activated cell sorting (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003319.s002">Figure S2b</xref>). Using this protocol, purity of the CD4&#x0002b;CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> T regulatory cells as assessed by Foxp3 expression was comparable between cryopreserved PBMC and freshly isolated cells.

Regulatory T cells recently emerged as key players in orchestrating adaptive immune responses and balancing immune tolerance versus autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-BaecherAllan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Valencia1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. A role in the immune surveillance of parenchymal organs including the CNS is assumed as recent studies have suggested that Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs are capable of migrating into the CNS under inflammatory conditions and may actively modulate the function of effector cells within the target organ itself. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), peripherally expanded Tregs are found to accumulate within the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Korn1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs were demonstrated to be enriched in the CSF of MS patients contributing to the hypothesis that natural Tregs may be actively &#x0201c;recruited&#x0201d; to the site of inflammation in MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Feger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Venken1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>VLA-4 has been identified as a crucial molecule in T cell trafficking across the blood-brain barrier and VLA-4 blockade by Natalizumab efficiently inhibits migration of T effector cells into the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Stuve3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It is well perceivable that differential effects of Natalizumab on the migratory capacity or functional properties of non-regulatory and Foxp3&#x0002b; T regulatory cells would have implications for CNS immunosurveillance.</p><p>Natalizumab was found to preferentially bind to T effector cells, due to a lower expression of the target molecule (alpha-4 integrin) on Tregs. This could either indicate a stronger impact of a given dose of the mAB on Tregs or they could be less prone to Natalizumab effects since other, yet unidentified molecules, might be dominant in the control of Treg trafficking. It has been suggested that instead of absolute levels of alpha-4 integrin, it is rather the relative loss of functional VLA-4 under therapy which dictates differential effects of Natalizumab on immune cell subsets<sup>13</sup>. In line with the literature Natalizumab therapy resulted in a marked loss of alpha-4 integrin (CD49d) immunoreactivity on all T cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Niino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Stuve2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the relative decrease of functional alpha-4 integrin was less pronounced in Tregs in comparison to Foxp3 negative T cells suggesting that Natalizumab may preferentially block the migration of T effector cells and thus favour the extravasation of Tregs. To test this hypothesis we chose a simplified but well characterized model system to assess migration of T cells mediated by interaction of VLA-4 with its alternate binding partner, the CS-1 fragment of fibronectin. This experimental model has previously been used for analyzing alpha-4 integrin mediated transmigration of lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Prat1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Uhm1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and was found to closely and highly reliably reflect the effects of VLA-4 blockade on T cell trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Niino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Albeit the relative loss of functional VLA-4 was significantly lower on Tregs, Natalizumab treatment did not &#x0201c;favour&#x0201d; the transmigration of Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs. Still, due to the limitations of the chosen <italic>in vitro</italic> model system our data need to be interpreted carefully. Certainly, the best way to test our hypothesis would have been a detailed CSF analysis in patients under treatment, thereby comparing the frequency of Tregs within the CSF before and after initiation of therapy (e.g. at 6 or 12 months). However, we refrained from attempting this for both technical as well as medical-ethical reasons. Under VLA-4 blockade CSF cell counts are markedly diminished in treated patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Stuve3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Foxp3 cells represent a minority within the CD4 T cell populations, conclusions from flow cytometrical analysis would have been based on extremely low number of Tregs cells. Furthermore, no patient in our cohort underwent lumbar puncture for medical reasons under the prospective study period.</p><p>It has been suggested that the loss (and regain) in functional VLA-4 under therapy may be a useful biomarker to monitor individual responses to Natalizumab therapy which hold true in our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Niino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The loss of alpha-4 integrin expression was well sustained at the end of the monthly dosing interval, even after receiving only 1 infusion of Natalizumab (300 mg i.v.). Although being based on a single observation, the finding that persistent neutralizing antibodies seem to abrogate the functional loss of VLA-4 under therapy strengthens the potential role of this biomarker in monitoring Natalizumab therapy and warrants further investigations.</p><p>We challenged the influence of Natalizumab on T suppressor frequency and function. Tregs play a key role in the mechanisms of autoimmunity, a loss of Treg suppressor function seems to play a critical role in MS disease pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Feger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Haas1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Viglietta1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-McFarland1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Contemporary immunomodulatory drugs such as interferons and glatiramer acetate have been suggested to mediate their beneficial effects &#x02013; at least partially - via modulation of Treg frequency and/or suppressive function, thereby augmenting the corollary of reconstituting Treg function as a therapeutic aim in MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Hong1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Bluestone1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, direct effects of Natalizumab on the homeostasis of Tregs and their immunobiological functions appear feasible. Our data clearly show, that the frequency of Foxp3&#x0002b; T cells as well as mRNA for FOXP3 within the peripheral blood of patients was unaffected by therapy, excluding that the beneficial effects of Natalizumab are largely due to quantitative changes in the regulatory T cell population. Tregs derived from MS patients were found to be poor suppressors corroborating previously published data on a dysfunction of Tregs in RRMS by several groups including ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Feger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Haas1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Viglietta1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Neither in vitro VLA-4 blockade nor in vivo Natalizumab treatment restored the impaired function of Tregs in suppression assays using anti-CD3/CD28 coated bead as a stimulus. Previously Natalizumab was reported to elicit costimulatory effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Niino1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, before analyzing its effects on Treg mediated suppression, we had to exclude that VLA-4 blockade interferes with T effector cell proliferation which would have biased the outcome of suppression assays. In our hands a saturating dose of Natalizumab neither enhanced nor diminished the proliferation of DC stimulated T cells. According to the literature costimulatory effects of anti-VLA-4 are subject to an inverse dose-dependency: very low doses of anti-VLA-4 (0,1 &#x000b5;g/ml) strongly enhance PBMC proliferation, while this effect seems to be diminished when higher doses of the mAb are employed. In our study we used 20 &#x000b5;g/ml which is within the range of serum trough levels of Natalizumab treated patients and saturated Natalizumab binding sites on T cells according to our own observations. To ensure the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our findings we did not employ lower doses which may explain the lack of effects of Natalizumab on T effector cell proliferation in our experiments. Accordingly, we challenged whether Natalizumab may influence the outcome of immune responses by modulating DC Treg interactions. Although we observed a weak tendency towards an improvement of Treg function under therapy, a level of significance was not reached.</p><p>One has to mention that it may not be the entire Foxp3&#x0002b; population of T regulatory that is dysfunctional in MS. A lot of research effort is currently put into identifying markers that may characterize a specific subset among Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs that is impaired in MS. Borsellino and colleagues recently reported a subpopulation of Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs with potent suppressive function identified by expression of the ectonucleotidase CD39. Although the overall frequency of Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs did not differ between healthy donors and MS patients, numbers of this specific subset were greatly reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Borsellino1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarily, Haas et al. have reported reduced numbers of a subset of naive Tregs that they defined as recent thymic emigrants by the expression of CD31. Lack of this subset was compensated for by increased numbers of memory Tregs in MS patients, suggesting that this dysequilibrium in the homeostatic composition may account for the impaired suppressive function of Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs in MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003319-Haas2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Albeit merely speculative, Natalizumab effects on a subset of Foxp3&#x0002b; Tregs may have accounted for the positive trend observed in our DC-based suppression assays. Further studies unravelling Treg dysfunction by characterization of impaired subsets are eagerly awaited.</p><p>Summarizing, this is the first study prospectively analyzing the effects of Natalizumab therapy on frequency and function of regulatory T cells. Analysis of the impact of Natalizumab on immune cell function is essential not only for understanding its mechanisms of actions but also to clarify its role in the pathogenesis of progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy. We further add to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of Natalizumab by demonstrating that unlike other immunomodulatory drugs the beneficial therapeutic effects of the monoclonal antibody are largely independent of alterations in Treg frequency or function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Clinical Samples</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Ethics committee Wuerzburg) and written consent was obtained from all participants (Nr. 155/06).

After 96 hours the percentage of proliferating responder cells as reflected by CFSE dilution was assessed by flow cytometry.
