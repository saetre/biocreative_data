To characterize the catalytic mechanism of glucose phosphorylation by GK, we combined molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, experimental mutagenesis and enzymatic kinetic analysis on both wild-type and mutated GK. Our three-dimensional (3D) model of the GK-Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATP-glucose (GMAG) complex, is in agreement with a large number of mutagenesis data, and elucidates atomic information of the catalytic site in GK for glucose phosphorylation. A 10-ns MD simulation of the GMAG complex revealed that Lys169 plays a dominant role in glucose phosphorylation. This prediction was verified by experimental mutagenesis of GK (K169A) and enzymatic kinetic analyses of glucose phosphorylation. QM/MM calculations were further used to study the role of Lys169 in the catalytic mechanism of the glucose phosphorylation and we found that Lys169 enhances the binding of GK with both ATP and glucose by serving as a bridge between ATP and glucose. More importantly, Lys169 directly participates in the glucose phosphorylation as a general acid catalyst. Our findings provide mechanistic details of glucose phorphorylation catalyzed by GK, and are important for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of MODY.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucokinase (GK) is a glycolic enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the first step of glycolysis.

The catalytic mechanism of GK holds the most critical information for understanding the relation between the mutations in the MODY gene and GK regulation activity. This fundamental question remains unanswered, however, due to the lack of an accurate structural model for the complex of GK with ATP, glucose and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (GK-Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATP-glucose complex). In particular, an important residue in the binding pocket, Lys169, can undergo mutation (K169N) in MODY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Gloyn2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and its functional role remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we report a study of the catalytic mechanism of GK by combining molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, experimental mutagenesis and enzymatic kinetic analysis. The atomic structure of the glucose phosphorylation catalyzed by GK in aqueous solution was studied using protein substrate conformations obtained from the MD simulation. The simulation results are in agreement with the recent findings of mutagenesis experiments and related kinetic studies. MD simulations further revealed that Lys169 may play an essential role in both ligand binding and GK catalytic process. The computational prediction was verified by additional experimental mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. Based on these results, we propose an atomistic catalytic mechanism of GK for glucose phosphorylation using QM/MM calculations.

Such a study, however, needs an accurate structural model for the whole catalytic environment of GK, i.e. the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the complex of GK with ATP, glucose and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (GK-Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATP-glucose complex, designated as GMAG complex hereinafter). Accordingly, a 3D structural model of GMAG complex was constructed based on the crystal structures of GK and several other hexokinases by using molecular modeling. Following this, the dynamic conformation change of the catalytic site of GK was investigated by using MD simulations. Furthermore, the modeling and simulation results were validated using mutagenesis and enzymatic kinetic assays. Encouraged by the compatible results from theoretical prediction and experiments, we explored the GK catalytic mechanism for the glucose phosphorylation based on a stable conformation of GMAG complex derived from the MD simulations by using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>3D Model of the GK-Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATP-glucose (GMAG) Complex</title><p>The crystal structure of human GK had not been available until 2004 due to the high flexibility of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Kamata2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it is easy for ATP to transfer its terminal phosphate to glucose <italic>in situ</italic>, making it difficult to gain accurate structural information of the catalytic environment of glucose inside GK, which plays a critical role in understanding the catalytic and regulation mechanisms of GK.

The reliability of these GK catalytic models is therefore questionable. On the basis of the crystal structures of GK, now available, we built up a structural model for the GMAG complex (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Method</italic></xref> section for detail).

Among these residues, Lys169 plays a significant role, because it forms H-bonds with both ATP and glucose. This indicates that Lys169 contributes to the binding of GK with either ATP or glucose or both. Computational simulations demonstrated that both ATP and glucose are able to bind to the wild-type GK, and neither ATP nor glucose can bind to the GK<sub>K169A</sub> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006304.s002">Table S2</xref>). Indeed, the experimental mutagenesis and enzymatic kinetic assay validated the computational prediction, i.e. the mutant of K169A could not bind to ATP and glucose and its enzymatic activity is completely lost (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006304-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The QM/MM calculations on the mechanisms of glucose phosphorylation catalyzed by both GK and GK<sub>K169A</sub> mutant further revealed the role of Lys169 in catalysis. During the phosphorylation process of glucose, in addition to enhancing the binding of ATP and glucose with GK, Lys169 also acts as a general acid catalyst, providing a proton to protonate the O<sup>&#x003b3;3</sup> atom of ATP; at the same time Asp205 acts as a general base catalyst, extracting the proton from the &#x02013;O<sup>6</sup>H group of glucose (Scheme 1). On the other hand, ATP and glucose bind to the GK<sub>K169A</sub> mutant with a different model than with the wild-type GK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006304-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006304-g004">4</xref>), whereby the phosphorylation of glucose adopts a different mechanism (Scheme 2). The QM/MM calculated activation energy of Scheme 2 is &#x0223c;14 kcal/mol higher than that of Scheme 1. This suggests that the GK<sub>K169A</sub> mutant has significantly reduced catalytic activity than its wild-type form. The calculated result is in good agreement with our mutagenesis data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006304-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the QM/MM result also indicates that Asp205 of GK loses its function as a general base catalyst in the glucose phosphorylation when Lys169 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006304-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The agreement between computation and experimental results validates the essential role of Lys169 in the phosphorylation of glucose. In summary, Lys169 plays at least three functional roles in the metabolism of glucose: (1) it enhances the binding of GK to both ATP and glucose; (2) it bridges ATP and glucose together; and (3) it acts as a general acid catalyst and directly participates in glucose phosphorylation. These results are important for understanding the catalytic mechanism of GK and the cause of the pathogenic mechanism of MODY due to the GK mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Zelent1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Printz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, the main aim of calculating the binding free energy was to address the influence of mutations to the binding affinity. Site-directed mutation may not result in dramatic conformational changes for the protein and it was assumed that entropy contributes little to the relative binding free energy for the binding of mutant in comparison with the wild-type protein. Therefore, in this study, &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>binding</sub> (without term of -T&#x00394;S) was estimated to address the mutation effect to of the binding free energy.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>QM/MM Calculation</title><p>QM/MM calculations were performed by using a two-layered ONIOM method encoded in the Gaussian03 program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Frisch1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The ONIOM method is a hybrid computational method developed by Morokuma and coworkers that allows different levels of theory to be applied to different parts of a molecular system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Dapprich1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006304-Vreven3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In the two-layered ONIOM method, the molecular system under study is divided into an inner layer and an outer layer. The inner layer consists of the most critical elements of the system, and the rest of the system comprises the outer layer. In the terminology of Morokuma and co-workers, the full system is called &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; and is treated with a low level of theory. The inner layer is termed &#x0201c;model&#x0201d; and is treated with both the low level of theory and a high level of theory. The total ONIOM energy <italic>E</italic><sub>ONIOM</sub> is given as following:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006304.e006"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>E</italic>(high, model) is the energy of the inner layer (plus the link atoms) at the high level of theory, <italic>E</italic>(low, real) is the energy of the entire system at the low level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0006304.e007.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> theory, and <italic>E</italic>(low, model) is the energy of the model system at the low level of theory. Thus, the ONIOM method allows one to perform a high-level calculation on just a small, critical part of the molecular system and incorporate the effects of the surrounding elements at a lower level of theory to yield a consistent energy expression on the full system.</p><p>The minimized structure optimized using the AMBER Parm99 force field was further optimized at the ONIOM (B3LYP/6-31G&#x0002a;: Amber) level. The quantum mechanics (QM) region includes the &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;-phosphate group of fully unprotonated ATP, four water molecules including two coordinated water molecules, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion, the hydroxymethyl group (&#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;O<sup>6</sup>H) of glucose, the methyleneammonium group (&#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;N<sup>&#x003b6;</sup>H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>3</sub>) of Lys169 and the anionic carboxymethyl group (&#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;COO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) of Asp205 for a total of 40 atoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006304.s008">Figure S6</xref>). The QM region was calculated by using the density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional and 6&#x02013;31G&#x0002a; basis set. The remainder of the system (MM region) was treated by using the AMBER Parm99 force field. A total of 7,147 atoms were included for the QM/MM calculations by using the ONIOM module as implemented in Gaussian 03. The electrostatic interactions between the QM and MM regions were calculated by using the electronic embedding method, which treats the polarization of the QM region by the MM region with scaled partial atomic charges of MM atoms, and the response of QM region with Merz-Singh-Kollman scheme for charge fitting so as to produce the changing partial charges of the QM atoms. The charge for the QM region was &#x02212;1, and the charge for the MM was 1, therefore the total system remained neutral.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Expression, Purification and Kinetic Analysis on GK and Its K169A Mutant</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) host strain M15 was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).

Packed cells were suspended in Buffer A plus 1 mM PMSF (Phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride), after sonication treatment on ice, the mixture was centrifuged to yield a clear supernatant, which was loaded onto a column with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). The column was washed with 8&#x02013;10 column volumes of Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and eluted with Buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole), then the soluble hLGK2 fractions were pooled separately and dialyzed against Buffer D (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) to remove imidazole.
