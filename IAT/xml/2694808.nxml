Temperature-dependent regulation of <italic>virF</italic>, the master regulator of TTSS synthesis, is believed to occur at the transcriptional level. We recently demonstrated, however, that TTSS synthesis also involves post-transcriptional regulation of the synthesis of InvE, a target of <italic>virF </italic>and key regulator of TTSS synthesis. The mRNA levels of <italic>invE </italic>(<italic>virB</italic>) are stable at 37&#x000b0;C, but mRNA stability markedly decreases at low temperatures where the TTSS synthesis is tightly repressed. Deletion of <italic>hfq</italic>, which encodes an RNA chaperone in Gram-negative bacteria, results in the restoration of expression of <italic>invE </italic>and other TTSS genes at low temperature due to an increase in the stability of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA.

First, the expression InvE protein was tightly repressed under low osmotic growth conditions, even though <italic>invE </italic>mRNA transcripts were readily detectable. Second, under low osmotic conditions, <italic>invE </italic>mRNA was rapidly degraded, whereas deletion of <italic>hfq</italic>, which encodes an RNA chaperone, resulted in increased <italic>invE </italic>mRNA stability and the production of InvE protein.

The expression of TTSS is regulated in response to environmental stimuli, such as changes in salt concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and growth temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This response to environmental factors is appropriate for the life cycle of <italic>Shigella</italic>, in which the expression of virulence genes is required for invasion and propagation in the host intestinal tract, but might be a potential burden for survival in the natural environment.</p><p>The genes that encode the components of TTSS in <italic>Shigella </italic>are located on the virulence plasmid, and are controlled by two regulator proteins, VirF and InvE (VirB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. VirF, an AraC-type transcriptional regulator, activates the transcription of <italic>invE </italic>(<italic>virB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. InvE is a homologue of a plasmid-partitioning factor, ParB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and possesses DNA binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. InvE activates the transcription of the <italic>mxi</italic>-<italic>spa </italic>and <italic>ipa </italic>genes, which encode the components of TTSS, through competition with the global repressor H-NS, a histone-like DNA binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we reported that the temperature-dependent expression of TTSS is controlled at the post-transcriptional level, through the regulation of InvE synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The mRNA of <italic>invE </italic>is highly stable at 37&#x000b0;C, but stability decreases significantly at 30&#x000b0;C where the TTSS synthesis is tightly repressed. Deletion mutants of <italic>hfq</italic>, which encodes an RNA-binding protein in Gram-negative bacteria, restores the expression of <italic>invE </italic>and other TTSS genes at low temperature due to the increased stability of the <italic>invE </italic>mRNA.</p><p>To date, a detailed mechanism of osmolarity-dependent regulation of TTSS expression has yet to be elucidated. In the current study, we examined whether osmotic-dependent changes in TTSS expression involved post-transcriptional regulation. We present several lines of evidence that <italic>invE </italic>expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level during TTSS synthesis in <italic>Shigella</italic>, and that the RNA chaperone Hfq plays a key role in regulating <italic>invE </italic>mRNA stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Osmolarity and TTSS expression</title><p>The expression of TTSS in <italic>Shigella </italic>is markedly reduced in low-salt LB medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether the critical factor for the decreased expression of TTSS in LB medium is low osmolarity or low-salt concentration. We analysed the expression of TTSS in the presence of several different osmolytes, but similar osmotic pressures. There was a difference in the growth rate of <italic>S. sonnei </italic>in LB medium in the absence (doubling time, 42.1 minutes) and presence (doubling time, 30.6 minutes) of 150 mM NaCl. To control for differences in growth rate in LB medium, we used yeast extract and nutrient broth (YENB) medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], since growth rate in YENB in the absence (doubling time, 32.2 minutes) and presence (doubling time, 31.4 minutes) of 150 mM NaCl was similar at 37&#x000b0;C. The osmotic pressure of YENB medium without and with 150 mM NaCl was 96 &#x000b1; 3 and 397 &#x000b1; 3 mOsm/kg&#x02022; H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. When 150 mM NaCl was replaced with 155 mM KCl, the osmotic pressure was 391 &#x000b1; 2 mOsm/kg&#x02022; H<sub>2</sub>O, whereas when NaCl was replaced with 260 mM sorbitol, osmotic pressure was 384 &#x000b1; 1 mOsm/kg&#x02022; H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>To monitor the expression of TTSS, we measured the expression of the effector protein IpaB and the regulatory molecule InvE. The expression of IpaB and InvE was tightly repressed in low osmotic conditions, whereas in the presence of either 150 mM NaCl or 155 mM KCl, the level of both proteins increased to a similar extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A linear relationship was observed between salt concentration and the levels of InvE and IpaB (data not shown), which indicated that there is no threshold for the effective induction of TTSS synthesis. In the presence of 260 mM sorbitol, the levels of both InvE and IpaB were approximately 50% lower than in the presence of NaCl and KCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When the concentration of sorbitol was increased to 520 mM, InvE and IpaB levels increased to the level of the NaCl and KCl growth conditions. These results indicated that in addition to salt concentration, osmolarity regulates the expression of TTSS, although the optimum concentration for maximum induction differed among osmolytes (see discussion).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A.

In an attempt to determine the mechanism of regulation of <italic>virF </italic>transcription, we performed a reporter gene assay in which the expression of <italic>lacZ </italic>was driven by the <italic>virF </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

The production of InvE protein was almost completely repressed under conditions of low osmolarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, &#x003b1;-InvE), whereas under the same conditions, there was a significant level of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA detectable by RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <italic>invE </italic>mRNA). Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the amount of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA in the absence of NaCl was 9.5 &#x000b1; 1.6% of the level in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. We carried out a reporter gene assay to examine the expression of <italic>invE </italic>at both the transcriptional and translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In low osmolarity, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in wild-type <italic>S. sonnei </italic>that expressed the transcriptional fusion gene <italic>invETx-lacZ </italic>was moderately decreased, to 28.9% of that seen in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Graph 2).

These results indicated that the expression of InvE protein is repressed in the absence of salt, a condition under which genes for at least two regulatory proteins are still transcribed, albeit at reduced levels.

The levels of InvE and IpaB were slightly lower in the absence of NaCl than in the presence of NaCl. Both proteins gradually degraded over time after rifampicin treatment, but the rate of degradation was essentially the same in the presence or absence of NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). By comparison, <italic>invE </italic>mRNA decayed within 10 minutes (min) after rifampicin treatment, and the rate of decay was much faster in low NaCl than in 150 mM NaCl (see below). These results indicated that InvE protein is metabolically stable once it is synthesized.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of Hfq in the post-transcriptional regulation of InvE synthesis</title><p>Previously, we showed that the RNA-binding protein Hfq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] is involved in the temperature-dependent regulation of <italic>invE </italic>expression, and that this regulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We next examined the expression of InvE in an <italic>hfq </italic>deletion mutant strain of <italic>S. sonnei </italic>(strain MS4831) under low osmotic conditions. As in the case of temperature-dependent regulation, the level of expression of InvE and IpaB in an <italic>hfq </italic>mutant strain in the absence of NaCl was approximately 33% of that seen in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> lane 1), which suggested that Hfq is involved in the osmolarity-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of InvE and IpaB synthesis. Real-time analysis of <italic>virF </italic>mRNA in the <italic>hfq </italic>mutant in the absence of NaCl indicated that the level of expression of <italic>virF </italic>was 36.5 &#x000b1; 4.5% of that seen in the wild-type strain in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, which suggested that the level of <italic>virF </italic>transcription in the <italic>hfq </italic>mutant parallels the level of InvE protein synthesis. Thus, in the absence of Hfq, the level of InvE protein in low osmotic conditions correlated with the level of <italic>virF </italic>and <italic>invE </italic>transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, graph 1 and 2). To confirm these results, we introduced an Hfq expression plasmid, pTrc-hfq, into the <italic>hfq </italic>deletion mutant. Ectopic expression of Hfq in the mutant strain resulted in the repression of InvE expression in low osmotic conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 3), and abolished the expression of InvE and IpaB even in physiological osmotic conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 5).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>A.

Previously, we demonstrated that the temperature-dependent expression of virulence-related genes is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level, and that the RNA chaperone Hfq is involved in the translational control of virulence gene mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. At that time, however, precise details on the mechanism of osmolarity-dependent regulation of virulence gene expression in <italic>Shigella </italic>were unavailable.</p><p>The expression and synthesis of TTSS is controlled by the VirF-InvE regulator cascade. The expression of TTSS is markedly reduced by low osmolarity due to the repression of InvE synthesis. In the current study, several lines of evidence indicated that the repression of InvE occurs mainly at the post-transcriptional level: 1) there were significant, albeit low levels of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA in cells under low osmotic conditions, whereas InvE protein was barely detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref><italic>invE </italic>mRNA); 2) expression of the translational fusion gene <italic>invE-lacZ </italic>was fully repressed under low osmotic conditions, whereas expression of the corresponding transcriptional fusion gene was only partially repressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Graphs 2 and 3); 3) in an arabinose-inducible promoter system, production of InvE protein decreased under low osmotic conditions even in the presence of sufficient amounts of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>); 4) in the absence of the RNA chaperone Hfq, the amount of InvE protein correlated with the level of <italic>virF </italic>transcription, even in low osmotic conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>); 5) InvE production was reduced upon over-expression of Hfq protein, even in physiological osmotic conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>); and 6) the stability of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA decreased under low osmotic conditions in the wild-type strain, but was increased in the <italic>hfq </italic>mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The synthesis of TTSS is induced in response to changes in osmolarity. While several osmolytes were able to induce TTSS synthesis, the response was weaker with the non-salt osmolyte sorbitol. Differences in TTSS synthesis in response to different osmolytes might be due to differences in permeability or influx through the bacterial membrane. Under physiological conditions, the contribution of non-salt osmolytes is likely to less relevant, because carbohydrates are almost completely absorbed in the ileum before reaching the colon, where infection and propagation of <italic>Shigella </italic>takes place. In the colon, Na<sup>+ </sup>ions and water are actively absorbed, and K<sup>+ </sup>ions are passively secreted, leading to an induction of TTSS synthesis. However, we did not observe significant differences in the expression of TTSS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and invasion (data not shown) in the presence of the two ions, which indicates that the trigger for TTSS induction is ionic strength, and not the nature of the ionic species.</p><p>In prokaryotes, the regulation of gene expression takes place mainly at the level of transcription. In the expression of a set of genes, however, regulation takes place at any one of several post-transcriptional stages, including the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, through a variety of mechanisms. We propose a model for the post-transcriptional repression of InvE expression in which the association of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA with the RNA chaperone Hfq controls mRNA stability. Recently, it was suggested that an iron-regulated small RNA, RyhB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], plays a regulatory role in <italic>invE </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that an interaction between <italic>invE </italic>mRNA and an as-yet unidentified RNA is involved in the temperature- and osmotic pressure-dependent activation of InvE synthesis. To date, various mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of translation initiation through the modulation of RNA structure, including the structure of the initiation codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For example, the temperature-dependent formation of a secondary structure within the 5'-untranslated element of the heat-shock operon mRNA of the plant bacterium <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum </italic>has been shown to regulate the level of translation of that mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In case of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA, a change of the signal that represents thermodynamic alteration of the structure was actually detected in circular dichroism spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] for the 140 nucleotides <italic>invE </italic>RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the characteristics of the binding of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA to Hfq in low-salt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and low-temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] conditions are consistent with an opening of the secondary structure of the RNA through the binding of multiple Hfq molecules. Of note, the pattern of binding of <italic>invE </italic>RNA to Hfq in low-salt buffer was remarkably similar to that seen in low temperature conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. That indicates that the distribution of RNA-Hfq interaction strength upon the ionic circumstance exists in a similar range, which is defined by the thermodynamic distribution of Hfq binding between 30&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C. To date, specific molecular sensors of low osmotic conditions or mild temperature change have not been identified. Our results suggest that low osmotic conditions evoke a decrease in intracellular ionic strength, resulting in a similar effect on the strength of the RNA-Hfq interaction as that of decreased temperature. This raises the interesting possibility that post-transcriptional regulation itself represents a sensing system for changes in temperature and osmotic pressure.</p><p>The lack of active translation of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA could result in its destabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In fact, one of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation is the regulation of mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The degradosome is a well-characterized mRNA degradation system that consists of RNaseE, as well as Hfq (46). We examined the role of RNaseE in TTSS synthesis using a deletion mutant (&#x00394;<italic>rne</italic><sub>701&#x02013;892</sub>) of the C-terminal region of RnaseE and <italic>E. coli rne-3071</italic><sup>ts </sup>strain N3431 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] carrying expression plasmids for <italic>virF</italic>, <italic>invE </italic>and TTSS genes (pJK1143 and pJK1142, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. TTSS synthesis was unaffected in either of the two strains (data not shown), which indicates that an as-yet unidentified degradation pathway involving Hfq likely plays a role in the degradation of <italic>invE </italic>mRNA.</p><p>Similar to other bacterial species, <italic>hfq </italic>mutants of <italic>S. sonnei </italic>and <italic>S. flexneri </italic>exhibited decreased virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>. If the up-regulation of virulence gene expression due to <italic>hfq </italic>deletion leads to efficient antigen presentation for the host immune-system, then the <italic>hfq </italic>deletion is a potentially viable candidate for the development of a more effective <italic>Shigella </italic>vaccine, one that goes beyond the serotype-specific effects seen in current vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In fact, a <italic>Shigella hfq </italic>mutant is currently under evaluation for use as a vaccine in the guinea pig model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. <italic>Shigella </italic>can survive in a range of environmental conditions, such as low osmotic pressure and low temperature, where strict repression of virulence gene expression is required. The development of a bi-functional sensing system for osmolarity and temperature represents an important adaptation for survival by this organism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes in TTSS synthesis in response to osmotic pressure in <italic>Shigella </italic>involve in part the transcriptional regulation of the master regulator <italic>virF</italic>.
