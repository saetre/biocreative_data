Three open reading frames (ORF) have been identified. One ORF encodes a protein which has homology to a human small nuclear riboprotein, while the remaining two are genes which have been identified previously, SIT4 and SPO12. SIT4 is known to have a role in the cell cycle but the nature of the interaction between SIT4 and dbf2 is unclear. SPO12 has until now been implicated exclusively in meiosis. However, we show that SPO12 is expressed during vegetative growth, moreover it is expressed under cell cycle control coordinately with DBF2. SPO12 is a nonessential gene, but it becomes essential in a DBF2 delete genetic background. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the cell cycle of SPO12 delete cells revealed a small but significant delay in mitosis. Therefore, SPO12 does have a role during vegetative growth and it probably functions in mitosis in association with DBF2.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0108-a" xlink:role="5619"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0109-a" xlink:role="5620"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0109-b" xlink:role="5620"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0109-c" xlink:role="5620"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5617"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5618"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5619"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5620"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5621"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5622"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5623"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
