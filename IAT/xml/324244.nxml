We also elucidated the aminoacid sequence of the 40 N-terminal and 7 C-terminal aminoacids of the purified immunity protein. From analysis of the data obtained we were able to locate the immunity gene between 11.7 and 14.5% on the Clo DF13 map, and to determine the complete aminoacid sequence of the immunity protein. It was observed that the Clo DF13 immunity gene encodes an 85 aminoacid protein and is transcribed in the same direction as the cloacin gene. These experimental data support our model, presented elsewhere, which implicates that the cloacin and immunity genes of Clo DF13 are coordinately transcribed from the cloacin promoter. We also present DNA sequence data indicating that an extra ribosome binding site precedes the immunity gene on the polycistronic mRNA. This ribosome binding site might explain the fact that in cloacinogenic cells more immunity protein than cloacin is synthesized. The comparison of the complete aminoacid sequence of the Clo DF13 immunity protein, with the aminoacid sequence data of the purified, comparable Col E3 immunity protein revealed that both proteins have extensive homologies in primary and secondary structure, although they are exchangeable only to a low extent in vivo and in vitro. It was also observed that a lysine residue was modified in immunity protein isolated from excreted bacteriocin complexes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0039-a" xlink:role="4354"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4349"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4350"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4351"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4352"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4353"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4354"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4355"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4356"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4357"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4358"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4360"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4361"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4362"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00436-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4363"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
