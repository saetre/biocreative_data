In the most well-understood &#x0201c;canonical&#x0201d; Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors induces &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus, where it complexes with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes. In addition to the canonical pathway, evidence for several other Wnt signaling pathways has accumulated, in particular for Wnt5a, which has therefore been classified as a noncanonical Wnt family member. To study the alternative mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal, we purified the Wnt5a protein to homogeneity. We find that purified Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a protein&#x02013;induced canonical Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner, not by influencing &#x003b2;-catenin levels but by downregulating &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;induced reporter gene expression. The Wnt5a signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase Ror2, is pertussis toxin insensitive, and does not influence cellular calcium levels. We show that in addition to its inhibitory function, Wnt5a can also activate &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the presence of the appropriate Frizzled receptor, Frizzled 4. Thus, this study shows for the first time that a single Wnt ligand can initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of two distinct receptors. Based on these and additional observations, we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates Wnt signaling output. In this model, signaling by different Wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by the Wnt proteins themselves but by receptor availability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Understanding signaling by Wnt proteins has been hampered by a history of conflicting data.

The necessity of precise regulation to prevent the inappropriate activation of Wnt signaling is underscored by the fact that misregulation of several components of the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway leads to tumorigenesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate Wnt signaling is of critical importance. </p><p>Wnt proteins are found in all metazoan organisms and as many as 19 mammalian homologs are known (Wnt home page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html">http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html</ext-link>). While homologs have a high degree of sequence similarity, expression of different Wnt proteins can lead to vastly different developmental outcomes. In the most well-understood &#x0201c;canonical&#x0201d; Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, in the absence of a Wnt ligand, the main mediator of the signal relay, &#x003b2;-catenin, is bound in a cytosolic protein complex containing Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product (APC), glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;), and other proteins. Axin and APC serve as scaffolding proteins that enable GSK-3&#x003b2; to phosphorylate &#x003b2;-catenin, thereby targeting it for ubiquitination by &#x003b2;TrCP (beta-transducin repeat&#x02013;containing homologue protein) and subsequent degradation in the proteasome. Cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels are thus kept low in the absence of ligand stimulation. Wnt protein binding to cognate Frizzled (Fz) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor&#x02013;related protein (LRP)5/6 coreceptors leads to the activation of the Dishevelled (Dvl) protein, which then inhibits GSK-3&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin. Cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin protein becomes stabilized and newly synthesized &#x003b2;-catenin is able to accumulate and then translocate to the nucleus where binding to T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors leads to the activation of target gene expression &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Prior to the discovery of the Fz and LRP coreceptors, Wnt proteins were classified into two functional groups based on the observation that ectopic expression of some Wnts, such as Wnt1 and Wnt3a, is sufficient to induce a secondary dorsal-ventral axis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and morphologically transform C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cells, whereas expression of &#x0201c;Wnt5a class&#x0201d; Wnts, including Wnts 4, 5a, and 11, is not sufficient &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b004">4</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. One hypothesis for how the structurally similar, although functionally distinct, extracellular Wnt ligands trigger different developmental outcomes is that the two classes of Wnts signal via different intracellular pathways. Indeed, experiments in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos using mRNA injection to activate Wnt signaling have suggested that expression of Wnt5a stimulates intracellular calcium (Ca <sup>2+</sup>) flux leading to the activation of Ca <sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;dependent effector molecules such as calcium/calmodulin&#x02013;dependent kinase II (CamKII), nuclear factor associated with T cells (NFAT), and protein kinase C (PKC) in a pertussis toxin (PTX)&#x02013;sensitive manner &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b009">9</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, due to the lack of active soluble Wnt5a protein, direct activation of &#x0201c;Wnt/Ca <sup>2+</sup>&#x0201d; pathway signaling in mammalian cell culture systems has not been fully investigated. </p><p>In addition to activating alternative signaling pathways, Wnt5a may also inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Early experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos showed that coexpression of <italic>X</italic>Wnt5a with <italic>X</italic>Wnt8 abrogates the ability of <italic>X</italic>Wnt8 to induce a secondary axis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b013">13</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Wnt5a knockout mice show increased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the distal limb, indicating that Wnt5a may inhibit &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, experiments from Ishitani et al. have shown that Wnt5a-induced Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux blocks canonical signaling downstream of &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization by inhibiting TCF-mediated transcription in a PTX-sensitive manner &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b016">16</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. As Wnt5a heterozygous mice develop myeloid leukemias and B-cell lymphomas, an intriguing hypothesis is that Wnt5a serves as a tumor suppressor in part by preventing excess Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>While most Wnt signaling has been attributed to the activation of Fz receptors, an alternative possibility is that Wnts carry out their diverse roles by signaling via different receptors. One such receptor is Ror2, an orphan tyrosine kinase possessing an extracellular cysteine-rich Wnt binding domain (CRD) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b020">20</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Wnt5a and mRor2 have overlapping expression patterns, their knockout phenotypes are similar, and recently mRor2 has been shown to act synergistically with Wnt5a to activate Jun kinase &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b023">23</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, Wnt5a may be mediating its inhibitory role through the activation of this novel receptor. </p><p>There are conflicting data in the literature regarding the mechanism by which Wnt5a and other so-called noncanonical Wnt protein signals. To understand how signals like Wnts influence cells, one must discriminate between early and late effects and measure those effects in a concentration-dependent manner. To that end, we have purified active Wnt5a protein and established quantitative assays for signaling. We show for the first time that soluble Wnt5a protein is able to directly inhibit canonical Wnt signaling. Treatment of cells with purified protein over short time intervals is sufficient to inhibit the activation of the TCF/LEF-driven luciferase reporter SuperTopFlash (STF). The inhibition observed is dose responsive, occurs downstream of &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization, and is PTX insensitive. We also show that an alternative Wnt receptor, Ror2, is required for Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of canonical signaling and that the extracellular, cysteine-rich Wnt binding domain and intracellular, cytoplasmic domain are crucial for the receptor's inhibitory function. Whereas Wnt5a protein is usually associated with noncanonical Wnt signaling, we show that Wnt5a can activate Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the presence of Fz 4 and LRP5. Based on these and other observations, we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates Wnt signaling output, suggesting a new layer of regulatory complexity in the Wnt signaling cascade with important implications in development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purification of Wnt5a Protein: Evidence that It Is Cleaved from a Precursor</title><p>We purified the Wnt5a protein from cells overexpressing the mouse <italic>Wnt5a</italic> gene using methods derived from those developed for other members of the Wnt family with several modifications (Figure1A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Throughout the purification, we followed the Wnt5a protein using an antibody that detects Wnt5a on a Western blot. Later steps in the purification were also monitored by activity assays (see below). To unambiguously identify the purified protein as the product of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> gene, we determined the amino-terminal sequence. We found that the mature protein starts with a sequence IIGAQPLCSQLAGLSQGQKKL, a sequence beginning 62 amino acids downstream from the predicted initiator methionine of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and 24 amino acids from the predicted signal cleavage site between amino acids 37 and 38 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. While all Wnt proteins contain signal sequences required for secretion from cells, generally they are not internally cleaved at a site downstream from the signal sequence.

We presume that the protein, like Wnt3a, is modified by the covalent attachment of a palmitate, but we have not examined this further. Significantly, the cysteine residue that is modified by palmitoylation in Wnt3a is conserved in Wnt5a, even after the internal cleavage of the protein. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Purified Wnt5a Protein Inhibits Canonical Wnt Reporter Activation</title><p>Standard readouts for the activity of various Wnt family members include an increase in the level of the &#x003b2;-catenin protein and the activation of reporter genes, in particular, the Topflash reporter that contains TCF binding sites upstream of a luciferase transgene.

As shown in Figure1B, Wnt3a protein treatment induces a 100-fold increase in reporter activation and a linear dose response when the concentration is lowered. In accordance with other groups, we observe that Wnt5a protein by itself does not lead to the activation of the STF reporter in 293 cells, nor does it alter levels of &#x003b2;-catenin protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g001">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g002">2</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

Using a concentration of Wnt3a protein within the linear range of reporter activation (50 ng/ml), Wnt5a protein was added to cells concomitantly with Wnt3a. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, Wnt5a elicits a dose-responsive decrease in Wnt3a-mediated reporter activation. </p><p>Wnt5a protein inhibits Wnt3a signaling at the earliest time points following reporter activation. When cells are pretreated with Wnt3a protein for 1 or 3 h prior to Wnt5a treatment, Wnt5a can inhibit Wnt3a-induced reporter activation within 1 h of exposure ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). In addition, Wnt5a pretreatment of cells for 8 h followed by washing has no effect on either Wnt3a-induced STF reporter activation or Wnt5a-mediated inhibition, suggesting that Wnt5a does not induce the accumulation of an inhibitory factor ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). These data taken together indicate that purified Wnt5a protein is sufficient to rapidly inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in a potentially post-translational fashion. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Wnt5a Does Not Affect &#x003b2;-Catenin Protein Stabilization</title><p>One possible explanation for the observed abrogation of reporter activation is that Wnt5a protein competes with Wnt3a for Fz receptor binding sites.

In both of these models, &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels should be reduced following concomitant Wnt5a treatment compared to Wnt3a protein treatment alone; in the former case, signal transduction is blocked at the level of the receptor, whereas in the latter, any &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilized due to Wnt3a signal activation should be appreciably degraded by the opposing effects of Wnt5a. </p><p>To assess the levels of accumulated &#x003b2;-catenin protein, we prepared cytosolic extracts from 293 cells treated for 3 h with Wnt3a protein, Wnt5a protein, or both. Cellular fractionation is necessary to ensure that only cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilized due to active Wnt signaling is observed as opposed to the relatively stable membrane-associated pool of &#x003b2;-catenin protein. Although a particularly low dose of Wnt3a protein (10 ng/ml) was used in this analysis to ensure that subtle differences in &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels could be discerned, no appreciable reduction in &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), even when concentrations of Wnt5a protein (200 ng/ml) sufficient to inhibit the STF reporter 5-fold were used. These data show that the Wnt3a signal is initiated in the presence of Wnt5a protein, indicating that Wnt5a does not efficiently compete with Wnt3a for receptor binding sites. </p><p>To determine whether Wnt5a treatment inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear entry, cell-staining experiments were performed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The 293 cells treated with vehicle or Wnt5a protein alone display a membrane-associated staining pattern (arrowheads) consistent with &#x003b2;-catenin's role in cell adhesion. By contrast, cells treated with Wnt3a protein alone appeared brighter than vehicle-treated cells, with &#x003b2;-catenin observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei (arrows). No significant difference in &#x003b2;-catenin signal intensity or localization was observed when cells were treated with Wnt3a in combination with Wnt5a protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The observation that Wnt3a-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization and nuclear entry appear unaffected by Wnt5a treatment suggests that upregulation of <italic>Siah-2,</italic> and subsequent degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin, is not the primary mechanism of Wnt5a protein-mediated inhibition of gene transcription in these cells. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Wnt5a-Mediated Inhibition of Canonical Signaling Is Not Associated with Wnt-Stimulated Ca <sup>2+</sup> Flux </title><p>Past studies in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos have suggested that overexpression of Wnt5a can trigger intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux, leading to the activation of Ca <sup>2+</sup>-dependent effector molecules such as CamKII &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts probed for &#x003b2;-catenin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) shows that while Wnt5a has no effect on cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin levels in the parental 293 cell line, Wnt5a can induce modest &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation in cells stably expressing a FLAG-tagged mFz4 construct (293Fz4). These results are in accordance with observations by Umbhauer et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; that coinjection of <italic>X</italic>wnt5a RNA with <italic>X</italic>fz4 RNA leads to the synergistic activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin target genes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal caps. </p><p>We next tested whether Wnt5a could activate the STF reporter in 293Fz4 cells. Neither Wnt5a protein treatment at high doses nor transfection of Wnt5a DNA into cells expressing mFz4 could activate the STF reporter. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, when LRP5 is coexpressed with mFz4, Wnt5a protein is able to activate the luciferase reporter. Thus, Wnt5a can activate TCF/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling given the expression of the appropriate receptors. Interestingly, Wnt5a is unable to activate the STF reporter in 293Fz4 cells transiently transfected with LRP6, indicating the specificity of the Wnt5a/Fz4/LRP5 signaling complex (unpublished data). </p><p>To determine whether Wnt5a protein can inhibit Wnt3a-mediated STF reporter activation in 293Fz4 cells, 293 and 293Fz4 cells were transiently transfected with the STF reporter and then treated with Wnt proteins over the course of 24 h. Whereas Wnt5a protein potently inhibits the STF reporter in parental 293 cells, Wnt5a no longer inhibits Wnt3a-induced reporter activation in 293Fz4 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This effect was specific to mFz4, as stable expression of mFz8 was not sufficient to abrogate Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of STF reporter activation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Additionally, Wnt5a does not stabilize &#x003b2;-catenin protein in the presence of mFz8 (unpublished data). Thus, specifically in the context of mFz4 and LRP5 expression, Wnt5a is unable to inhibit Wnt3a-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin signaling and instead induces &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation and STF reporter activation. </p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>An Alternative Wnt Receptor, mRor2, Mediates Wnt5a's Inhibitory Activity</title><p>One explanation for why Wnt5a is unable to inhibit Wnt3a-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin signaling when mFz4 is overexpressed is that in 293Fz4 cells, increased mFz4 receptor binding sites may titrate available Wnt5a protein away from an alternative receptor carrying out its inhibitory function. To investigate this hypothesis, we turned to the orphan receptor mRor2, a single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase with proposed kinase-dependent and -independent activities &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. mRor2 is an appealing candidate receptor mediating Wnt5a's inhibitory activity because Wnt5a and mRor2 have overlapping expression patterns, their knockout phenotypes are similar, and mRor2 has been shown previously to act synergistically with Wnt5a to activate Jun kinase &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b022">22</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, CAM-1, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> Ror2 homolog, has been shown to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling&#x02013;mediated cell migration, although the Wnt ligand mediating this inhibition remains to be determined &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>To determine whether Wnt5a mediates its inhibitory effects through the mRor2 receptor, 293 cells stably expressing the full-length mRor2 receptor (293mRor2) were treated with Wnt proteins over the course of 24 h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, Wnt3a protein treatment robustly activates the STF reporter in the presence of mRor2. However, at every time point measured, Wnt5a protein-mediated inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is synergistically enhanced by mRor2 overexpression as compared to the parental cell line (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). </p><p>We next assayed whether mRor2 was carrying out its inhibitory function through direct binding to Wnt5a. Two variants of the extracellular cysteine-rich Wnt binding domain (CRD) of mRor2 were cloned in frame amino-terminal to an immunoglobulin heavy chain domain (IgG) as previously described and expressed in 293 cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. One variant is comprised of the Ror2 CRD alone cloned downstream of an exogenous signal sequence (Ror2 CRD-IgG); the other variant utilizes the endogenous Ror2 signal sequence and possesses the full amino terminus of the Ror2 protein ending at the carboxyl terminus of the CRD (Ror2 NT CRD-IgG). The secreted mRor2 CRD-IgG fusion proteins were then purified from conditioned media, bound to protein A beads, and tested for their ability to bind to purified Wnt proteins. The Smoothened receptor is a Fz family member that possesses a CRD domain but, rather than playing a role in Wnt signaling, it functions exclusively Hedgehog signal transmission. As a negative control, purified Smoothened (Smo) CRD-IgG protein was also bound to beads and assayed for Wnt binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g005">Figure 5</xref>B shows that Wnt5a protein specifically binds to the purified Ror2 and Fz4 CRD domains, whereas only background binding to the Smoothened CRD occurs. Wnt3a protein shows specific binding only to the Fz4 CRD-IgG protein (unpublished data). </p><p>We next utilized a Ror2 deletion construct that lacks the extracellular cysteine-rich Wnt-binding domain (mRor2&#x00394;CRD) to determine whether the CRD domain was necessary for Wnt5a signal transmission. When transiently transfected into 293 cells in conjunction with the STF reporter, mRor2&#x00394;CRD does not enhance Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of the STF reporter ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Thus, the CRD domain binds directly to Wnt5a and is required for Ror2 to transduce Wnt5a's inhibitory activity. </p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Expression of mRor2 Is Required for Wnt5a-Mediated Inhibition of Canonical Signaling</title><p>We next tested whether increased mRor2 expression was necessary to shift the balance of Wnt5a-mediated activation versus inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in cells overexpressing mFz4. 293 and 293Fz4 cells were transiently transfected with the STF reporter and mRor2 and then treated with the indicated Wnt proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>A shows that Wnt5a-induced reporter activation in the presence of mFz4 and LRP5 is abrogated when mRor2 is expressed. In addition, while Wnt5a protein is unable to inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the presence of mFz4, as compared to parental 293 cells, mRor2 overexpression synergistically enhances Wnt5a's ability to inhibit the reporter gene in both cell lines. Once again, inhibition of Wnt3a-mediated reporter activation was observed only in the presence of Wnt5a; mRor2 expression alone did not reduce Wnt3a-mediated reporter activation, indicating that the inhibitory activity is dependent on the presence of Wnt5a. </p><p>Wnt5a's inhibitory activity was also tested in another cell line, mouse L cells. Whereas Wnt5a protein treatment in parental 293 cells robustly inhibits the Wnt3a-mediated activation of the STF reporter, Wnt5a treatment has little to no inhibitory affect in L cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). To assess whether this is due to reduced expression of mRor2, L cells were transfected with mRor2 and then treated with Wnt proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, when mRor2 is overexpressed, Wnt5a protein potently inhibits the Wnt3a-induced reporter activation in L cells. Again, mRor2 expression has no inhibitory effect on Wnt3a-stimulated reporter activation in the absence of Wnt5a. Although Wnt5a is able to activate the luciferase reporter in L cells stably expressing mFz4 and transiently transfected with LRP5, mRor2 cotransfection effectively inhibits Wnt5a's canonical signaling ability ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). </p><p>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to ascertain the expression of Ror2 in 293 and L cells. A specific Ror2 transcript in the L cell sample did not emerge until after 40 cycles of amplification, indicating that Ror2 is expressed in almost immeasurably low abundance in L cells. Quantification of the real-time data revealed that Ror2 transcripts were over 700 times more abundant in 293 cells than in L cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). mRor2 expression thus appears to be required for Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in mouse L cells. </p><p>It has been proposed that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> Ror protein CAM-1 has tyrosine kinase&#x02013;independent functions &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and that <italic>Xenopus X</italic>Ror2 can function in the absence of its cytoplasmic domain &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. We thus created a membrane-tethered variant of mRor2 (mRor2-GPI) to assay whether mRor2 could still function in the absence of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Expression of mRor2-GPI reduced Wnt5a's ability to inhibit Wnt3a-induced STF reporter activation when transfected into 293 cells as compared to cells transfected with the reporters alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). In addition, when Ror2-GPI was transfected into cells in conjunction with wild-type mRor2, mRor2-GPI blocked wild-type mRor2&#x02032;s enhancement of Wnt5a-mediated inhibition, suggesting that the membrane-tethered variant of mRor2 serves as a dominant negative. The fact that expression of mRor2-GPI alone did not enhance Wnt5a-mediated inhibition indicates that the cytoplasmic, and potentially the transmembrane, domain is required for mRor2 to carry out its inhibitory function. </p><p>To assess the role the mRor2 transmembrane domain plays in mediating the Wnt5a signal, we created a mRor2 construct that contains the endogenous extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protein but lacks the cytoplasmic domain (Ror2-TM). We find that similar to the mRor2-GPI construct, expression of Ror2-TM was sufficient to inhibit wild-type mRor2&#x02032;s ability to enhance Wnt5a signaling ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). Unlike the mRor2-GPI construct, however, the mRor2-TM construct did not reduce Wnt5a's ability to inhibit Wnt3a-induced STF reporter activation when transfected into 293 cells alone. Western blot analysis indicates that wild-type mRor2 expression is unaffected by cotransfection with mRor2-GPI or mRor2-TM, further strengthening the idea that these constructs serve as dominant negative variants of mRor2. These data taken together suggest that mRor2 does not simply present Wnt5a to another receptor but rather that Wnt5a binding initiates Ror2-induced cytoplasmic signaling events. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Due to early overexpression studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, the Wnts were grouped into various classes based on their canonical Wnt signaling ability without regard for the cellular context in which they were overexpressed. Receptor expression, however, clearly plays a role in determining signaling output; when coexpressed with the appropriate Fz receptor, the prototypical &#x0201c;noncanonical&#x0201d; Wnt, <italic>X</italic>Wnt5a, can signal in a canonical fashion to induce the formation of a secondary axis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Whereas some have argued that the lack of functional interaction with LRP distinguishes Wnt5a from so-called canonical Wnts in mammalian cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, previous studies and our present work confirm that Wnt signaling output is not intrinsically related to the Wnt protein itself but rather due to a combination of factors including receptor availability &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Several controversies exist in the literature today regarding the mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal. Much of the conflicting data, however, can be attributed to the variety of cellular and organismal systems studied coupled with the previous lack of soluble, active Wnt proteins. In the case of Wnt5a, for example, one report has shown that overexpression of Wnt5a inhibits canonical signaling by promoting the degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, we found that, in accordance with other groups, Wnt5a protein treatment has no affect on &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels but rather inhibits canonical Wnt signaling at the level of TCF transcription &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Although our data are in agreement with Wnt5a overexpression studies by Ishitani et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; with respect to the inhibition occurring downstream of &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization, we found that Wnt5a does not stimulate Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux and that Wnt5a-mediated inhibition is not sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. These data effectively eliminate G protein&#x02013;mediated activation of calcium signaling as the primary mechanism of Wnt5a-mediated inhibition. </p><p>Fz receptor signaling capabilities have also often been debated. Previous studies pertaining to Fz4&#x02032;s role in the disease familial exudative vitreoretinopathy have suggested that the Fz4 receptor does not mediate Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling but rather elicits intracellular calcium flux that subsequently activates downstream calcium effector molecules &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, we show here that in multiple cell lines, Fz4 allows Wnt5a to specifically <italic>activate</italic> TCF/Lef transcription in the presence of LRP5 and that mFz4 expression does not enhance calcium flux ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The true signaling capabilities of the Fz4 receptor may have been previously overlooked due to the use of an inappropriate Wnt ligand in the analysis, Wnt1 as opposed to Wnt5a. Additionally, as calcium signaling capabilities were attributed to Fz4 in the absence of exogenous ligand stimulation, it remains to be seen whether Wnt ligands are required for Fz-mediated Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux. </p><p>We observe that when mFz4 is overexpressed alone, Wnt5a protein treatment is sufficient to induce &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization but not STF reporter activation. It is possible that Wnt5a does not activate a transcriptional response when mFz4 is expressed alone in 293 cells due to the endogenous expression of mRor2. In addition, coreceptor expression and heterodimerization following ligand stimulation have previously been shown to enhance ligand binding and signal transduction in other systems &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. As Wnt5a-induced &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization in cells expressing mFz4 is less robust than Wnt3a-induced stabilization, overexpression of both mFz4 and LRP5 may be necessary for full potentiation of the canonical signal resulting in transcriptional activation. Furthermore, previous reports have suggested that the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin and Wnt signal transduction are separable events by showing that &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels alone do not dictate signal output but rather the phosphorylation state of &#x003b2;-catenin &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Coexpression of LRP5 may be necessary for the dephosphorylation, and hence full activation, of &#x003b2;-catenin resulting in optimal signal transduction. </p><p>The disparities between previous reports and our current observations may be due to the fact that in this study, the effects of Wnt5a could be monitored immediately following Wnt5a protein addition as opposed to several hours or cell divisions following cellular expression, thereby allowing us to separate early and late effects of Wnt5a treatment. Activation of downstream transcriptional targets of Wnt5a, such as <italic>Siah-2,</italic> may contribute to the overall Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling subsequent to the initial signaling events that we observed &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, in the proposed Wnt/Ca <sup>2+</sup> signaling model, Wnt5a-stimulated Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux leading to NLK activation is required for transcriptional inhibition &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, Wnt1 has recently been shown to inhibit &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;TCF&#x02013;mediated transcription via activation of NLK, although Wnt1 has never been shown to induce Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, Wnt5a may exert its inhibitory effects through the activation of NLK in a similar Ca <sup>2+</sup>-independent manner. Further experimentation into the mechanism by which Wnt5a inhibits canonical signaling is therefore necessary and will be addressed in subsequent reports. </p><p>In this study, we show that one Wnt ligand can function in two discreet pathways based on receptor availability ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040115-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Data in the literature suggest that this may also apply to other Wnts. For example, Wnt1 is known to activate canonical Wnt signaling through &#x003b2;-catenin and TCF and act as an oncogene &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. However, using overexpression in various cell lines, Smit et al. presented evidence that Wnt1 inhibits TCF activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Another example is Wnt11, which has been implicated in the noncanonical convergence-extension pathway in zebrafish &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent work, by contrast, demonstrates that Wnt11 is the long-sought ligand that activates the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, showing that one Wnt can activate two different pathways, possibly also by activating different receptors &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Although the ability of one Wnt ligand to function in two distinct pathways based on receptor context is novel for the Wnt field, we note that in an entirely different system, opposing effects brought about by a single ligand have also been explained by the use of different receptor classes. This example is formed by the Netrins, ligands that can either attract or repel axons depending on whether they interact with the DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) or UNC5 (UNCoordinated family member 5) families of receptors &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b054">54</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, ligands engaging multiple receptors to effect different signaling outcomes is not unprecedented in nature. </p><p>With as many as 19 mammalian homologs known, the question of whether all Wnt family members have evolved to signal in the same fashion is an important one. In this report, we address controversies in the literature regarding how one Wnt family member, Wnt5a, functions. Through quantitative kinetic analyses, we provide evidence for the first time that Wnt5a protein can directly inhibit canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and that the single-pass transmembrane receptor Ror2 is required to mediate this activity. Although Wnt5a can inhibit canonical Wnt signaling when Ror2 is expressed at detectable levels, Fz 4 and LRP5 coreceptor expression allows Wnt5a to signal in a canonical fashion. This ability of Wnt5a to toggle between two considerably diverse forms of signaling is particularly intriguing when one considers that Wnt5a has been classified as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in various cell types &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b057">57</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. While previously somewhat paradoxical, it is now clear that in the former role, Wnt5a expression may inhibit uncontrolled Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the presence of Ror2, whereas in the latter, Wnt5a could promote canonical Wnt signaling when Fz4 and LRP5 are expressed. Future study into specific receptor-ligand interactions will thus contribute to understanding the complexities of Wnt signaling. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Wnt5a purification</title><p>Wnt5a protein was purified from 6 L of media conditioned by mouse L cells stably overexpressing mouse <italic>Wnt5a</italic> (CRL-2814; American Type Culture Collection &#x0005b; ATCC&#x0005d;, Manassas, Virginia, United States) created in the laboratory as previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040115-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; with the addition of a fourth purification step.

Wnt5a has little effect on the ratio over the 15-min time course, whereas ionomycin treatment rapidly and robustly induces Ca <sup>2+</sup> flux in these cells.

Reverse transcription followed by 45 cycles of quantitative real-time amplification of 293 cell RNA reveals a robust Ror2 product that is over 700 times more abundant than that produced from RNA derived from mouse L cells. Hprt quantification serves as an internal normalization control and RNA derived from 293Ror2 and LRor2 cells serves as a positive control for the reaction. The products from the PCR analysis are displayed below the charted quantitative data.</p><p>(D) The cytoplasmic domain of mRor2 is required for its inhibitory function. Expression of a membrane-tethered variant of mRor2 possessing the extracellular domain of mRor2 fused to a GPI linkage (mRor2-GPI) reduces Wnt5a's ability to inhibit Wnt3a induced canonical Wnt signaling as well as inhibits wild type mRor2&#x02032;s ability to enhance Wnt5a-mediated inhibition.</p><p>(E) Expression of a membrane-tethered variant of mRor2 (mRor2-TM) that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of mRor2, but lacks the cytoplasmic domain, does not enhance Wnt5a mediated inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Expression of mRor2-TM reduces Wnt5a's ability to inhibit Wnt3a-induced canonical Wnt signaling when wild-type mRor2 is overexpressed. Western blot analysis shows that wild-type mRor2 levels do not change when the truncated mRor2 variants are coexpressed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040115.g006"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0040115-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model.
