In each of these disorders, called tauopathies, the accumulation of the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau is associated with neurofibrillary degeneration and dementia. The discovery of mutations in the tau gene and their cosegregation with the disease in the inherited frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 (FTDP-17) has established that abnormalities in tau protein as a primary event can lead to neurodegeneration and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Hutton <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Poorkaj <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Interestingly, these tauopathies can be biochemically differentiated by their pattern of hyperphosphorylated isoforms, the so-called bar code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Buee <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Sergeant <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Hyperphosphorylation of tau precedes its accumulation into neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) in the affected neurons in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Sahara <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Among the kinases involved in tau hyperphosphorylation, both cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase-beta (GSK3&#x003b2;) are of particular interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahlijanian <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Hamdane <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Leroy <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Patrick <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Sengupta <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).</p><p>On one hand, cell cycle events were reported during neurofibrillary degeneration and neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Busser <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Herrup &#x00026; Busser 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Husseman <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).

While more and more reports propose a protective role of tau hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Hamdane <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), tau aggregation is supposed to contribute to neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Ramsden <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Hyperphosphorylation had been shown to be reversible, while tau aggregation is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Santacruz <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to link tau pathology to cell cycle events and differentiation subsequent to neurogenesis.</p><p>In AD brains, there is an increase in proteins that are involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Jin <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). An important finding of this report was the presence of these proteins in young tau transgenic mice. The major site of adult neurogenesis, besides the subventricular zone, is the DG. It should be emphasized that at the age of 3&#x02013;6 months, fibers of the granular cell layer of the DG were immunoreactive for tau phosphorylation, but their cell bodies were relatively spared from tau pathology. Abnormal phosphorylated tau (AT100) and NFTs were mostly absent at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Schindowski <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Therefore, early molecular events, likely involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and plasticity, were detected even before the onset of somatic hyperphosphorylated tau deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Boekhoorn <italic>et al.</italic> 2006b</xref>).</p><p>From our data, it is difficult to conclude that these changes are only related to tau phosphorylation. On one hand, tau expression and/or mutation may also have an impact on neuronal physiology, such as maturation and splicing. For instance, it was described that 4-repeat tau isoforms regulate hippocampal neurogenesis and promote neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Sennvik <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Conversely, the neonatal 3-repeat isoform is present in proliferating progenitor cells and associated with DCX expression and BrdU incorporation during adult neurogenesis in the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Bullmann <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Mosch <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). TUC-4 regulation is observed in tau-positive stem cells during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Munoz-Elias <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Moreover, TUC-4 is also involved in F-actin bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rooslenbroich <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Recent data from experimental models of tauopathies suggest some relationships between actin-binding proteins and tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Blard <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Fulga <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Thus, some links may exist between TUC-4 and tau pathology through actin network and increased phase of neuronal differentiation. Nevertheless, more work is needed to find the exact relationships. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that neurogenesis, an event that is predominantly present in young adults, is dependent on factors that are mainly present in young brains, and it should be emphasized that in the present model, tau hyperphosphorylation correlates with an increased neurogenesis. Nevertheless, it had been shown that even aged brains are able to increase neurogenesis in response to an environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Kempermann <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) or cerebral lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dempsey &#x00026; Kalluri 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Gray <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kokaia &#x00026; Lindvall 2003</xref>). Neurogenesis-related proteins have also been observed in mice expressing non-mutant human tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Andorfer <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and tau mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Kuhn <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the CA1 subfield, which is the brain region with the highest density of tau phosphorylation and NFT load in aged THY-Tau22 mice, shows later massive neurodegeneration and cell loss. Cyclin D1, a marker of neuronal cell death that is elevated in AD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Busser <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), was significantly increased by 10 months when tau phosphorylation and the formation of NFT are quite advanced in THY-Tau22. Interestingly, cyclin D1 is a key molecule of neurons leaving G0 and entering G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Greene <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). p21<sup>CIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup> are related proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression by interacting with cyclin D-CDK4 complex in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">el-Deiry <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Gu <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Harper <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Polyak <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>).

The levels of cleaved caspase 3 remained undetectable, but it should be taken into consideration that cleavage of caspases is a rather short event, and therefore, their detection is difficult in a dynamic not-synchronous system such as the brain. Excitingly, cytoplasmic p21<sup>CIP1</sup> has been reported to prevent apoptosis by inhibiting activation of caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Asada <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>).
