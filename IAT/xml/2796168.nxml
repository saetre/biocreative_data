The blocking of a chemokine-receptor interaction results in a reduced inflammatory response, and represents a possible anti-inflammatory strategy, a strategy that is already employed by some virus and parasites.

Moreover it does not possess a known fold. We have also solved the structure of the complex of Evasin-1 and its high affinity ligand, CCL3. The complex is a 1&#x02236;1 heterodimer in which the N-terminal region of CCL3 forms numerous contacts with Evasin-1, including prominent &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interactions between residues Trp89 and Phe14 of the binding protein and Phe29 and Phe13 of the chemokine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>However, these interactions do not appear to be crucial for the selectivity of the binding protein, since these residues are found in CCL5, which is not a ligand for Evasin-1.

Chemokines control the migration of leukocytes through interaction with members of the G protein-coupled receptor family which possess seven transmembrane helices. The pairing of the chemokines to their receptors has been carried out, mainly by receptor binding assays, and has identified receptors that are specific (bind to a single ligand) or shared (bind more than one ligand). The association of certain receptors and ligands with disease has come from many studies of their expression in biopsy samples and body fluids, animal models and genetically engineered mice.</p><p>Dysregulation of the chemokine system can result in excessive cellular recruitment, with dramatic implications in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Gerard1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Blocking the receptor-chemokine interaction should have therapeutic value, since prevention of this directional migration represents an effective anti-inflammatory strategy.

The first to be identified, Evasin-1, was shown to bind to a subpopulation of the chemokine family, contrasting with most of the known viral chemokine binding proteins which demonstrate broad selectivity profiles. Evasin-1 is a small 94-amino acid protein which binds CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1; and CCL4/MIP-1&#x003b2; with very high affinity (0.16 and 0.81 nM, respectively), and also displays lower affinity binding (3.2 nM) to a closely related member of the CC chemokine family, CCL18/ PARC. This chemokine-binding protein does not share any relevant sequence or structural homology to any other known proteins, notably the viral chemokine-binding proteins, and moreover, is considerably smaller, being only 10 kDa compared to the viral proteins which range in size between 30&#x02013;40 kDa.</p><p>Here we present the crystal structure of a complex between the chemokine CCL3 and the small tick-derived chemokine binding protein, Evasin-1. The interactions are totally different from those described for the viral chemokine binding proteins, and may lead to an understanding of an efficient way to selectively inhibit the chemokine system. The structure of the complex provides the structural framework for the exquisite selectivity demonstrated by Evasin-1, which displays a particularly high affinity for CCL3, but has only negligible affinity for the closely related chemokine CCL5, which shares the same receptors as CCL3. The binding activity of chimeric chemokine constructs, consisting of the amino terminal region preceding the CC motif of one of these chemokines, followed by the sequence of the other, suggest that the binding modality may follow a two-step process, with the amino terminus determining the selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Architecture of Evasin-1</title><p>We have determined the crystal structure of both non-glycosylated (accession code: 3 fpr) and glycosylated Evasin-1 (accession code: 3 fpt), to 1.7 &#x000c5; and 2.70 &#x000c5; respectively. The structures are very similar, and the C&#x003b1; can be superimposed with an rmsd of 0.97 &#x000c5;, considering 83 of the 100 amino acid residues (segment aligned Asp8-Arg90). The structure of the non-glycosylated form of Evasin-1, which was determined at higher resolution, will be described below.</p><p>The crystal structure of the non-glycosylated Evasin-1 contains two molecules per asymmetric unit, monomer A (Asp5-Asp91) and monomer B (Gly10-Trp89). The terminal amino acid residues Asp5 and Asp91 for monomer A, as well as Trp89 for monomer B were modelled as alanines, as there is no unambiguous electron density for their side-chains. In both monomers, the extreme N-terminal and C-terminal regions, comprising the six-histidine tag, are flexible and were not seen in the electron density maps.</p><p>The overall structure of the Evasin-1 molecule is boat shaped, with approximate dimensions of 35 &#x000c5; &#x000d7; 20 &#x000c5; &#x000d7; 13 &#x000c5;. The largest dimension corresponds to the distance comprising the N-terminal region, which is exposed to the solvent and is involved in the chemokine binding, as shown later in the structure of the complex with CCL3. A stereo view of the overall structure of the non-glycosylated form of Evasin-1 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g001">Figure 1</xref>. This tertiary structure of Evasin-1 represents a new fold of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; type.

The four disulfide bridges consist of: Cys12-Cys33 connecting the N-terminal region of strand &#x003b2;1with &#x003b2;3; Cys29-Cys70 connecting the beginning of &#x003b2;3 with &#x003b2;6; Cys46-Cys75 connecting the strands &#x003b2;5 with &#x003b2;7 in the beta sheet &#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7 and finally Cys65-Cys84 connecting the other two strands &#x003b2;6 with &#x003b2;7 in the same beta sheet.

The first subdomain (the N-terminal subdomain) is formed by two non-contiguous segments comprising the N-terminal residues Asp5-Pro13, and the anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet formed by &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 consisting on the segment from residues Lys30-Thr39. The beta sheet formed by &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 contains a beta-hairpin of type I'. A hydrogen bond network formed by Gln31-Glu38, Asp32-Gly35, Cys33-Gly35 and Cys33-Thr36 holds this beta sheet together.</p><p>The N-terminal segment is extended through the surface of the monomer and is covalently bound to the &#x003b2;3 strand via the disulfide bridge between Cys12-Cys33, which is exposed to solvent. The N-terminal region is anchored not only by the disulfide bridge, but also by an intricate hydrogen bond network that places the N-terminal segment in an exposed and favourable position for chemokine binding. This hydrogen bond network comprises the N-terminal region interactions with &#x003b2;4 through Gly11-Glu38, Cys12-Glu38, and with &#x003b2;3 through Pro13-Gln31. Residues Gln31 and Glu38 as well as Cys33, anchors the flexible N-terminal area. The Gln31 side-chain interacts with the carbonyl atom of Pro13 and also establishes main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonds with Glu38, thereby stabilizing the beta sheet formed between &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4.</p><p>The second, C-terminal, subdomain is also composed of two non-contiguous segments comprising residues Phe14-Cys29 and Ala40-Asp91. This subdomain is composed of five beta strands (&#x003b2;1-&#x003b2;2-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7), and one alpha helix (&#x003b1;1). This subdomain undoubtedly constitutes the central core of the protein, as evidenced by the lower B-factors observed in this extended &#x003b2;-sheet. The beta strands &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 form an anti-parallel beta sheet containing a beta turn of type 1. The beta strands &#x003b2;5, &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;7 also form a twisted anti-parallel beta sheet. The two beta sheets formed by &#x003b2;1-&#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7 interact together to form the twisted beta-barrel (&#x003b2;1-&#x003b2;2-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7-&#x003b2;1), which is pointing to the alpha helix on the top. &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 are bridged through the main-chain hydrogen bond interactions between Ala17 and Thr25. Asn19 plays an important function by holding the beta turn of type I, due to the six hydrogen bonds that it makes with neighbouring residues Thr21, Gly22, Tyr23. Remarkably the ND2 atom is not involved in these interactions, which is consistent with it being a glycosylation site, an observation that is confirmed in the glycosylated structure of Evasin-1, as described later.</p><p>The &#x003b1;1 helix is positioned opposite of the twisted beta barrel vortex subdomain (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This helix is placed in a solvent exposed area and is held to the vortex through three hydrogen bonds, one between the start of the helix and the end of &#x003b2;2 Gly50-Val27, one between the middle of the helix and the C-terminal Arg55-Arg86, and one at the end of the helix and the C-terminal Met58-Arg86. The C-terminal loop points to the solvent, presenting the aromatic residue Trp89 totally exposed and located in a flexible region with a C&#x003b1; B-factor&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50.0 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, much higher than the average B-factor &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;34.8 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for the whole protein chain of monomer A (B-factor for the C&#x003b1; of monomer A &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;32.8 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, calculated with BAVERAGE from CCP4, 1994).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Glycosylated Form of Evasin-1</title><p>Three glycosylation sites were initially predicted by primary sequence analysis through a PROSITE search used for pattern identification (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org/prosite">http://www.expasy.org/prosite</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Hulo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the previously determined structure of the non-glycosylated form of Evasin-1. The unit cell contains 3 molecules per asymmetric unit: monomer A (Asp8-His95), monomer B (Gly11-Trp89) and monomer C (Asp8-Trp89). The corresponding solvent content of 67&#x00025;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Matthews1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and the glycosylation content may explain the 2.70 &#x000c5; diffraction limit of the crystals. The three crystallographic distinct molecules are very similar with a rmsd for C&#x003b1; atoms superposition of 0.68 &#x000c5; for the superposition of monomers A and B, 0.77 &#x000c5; for monomers B and C, and 0.95 &#x000c5; for monomers B and C, with the greatest differences being observed for the residues at the termini. Monomer A had the lowest overall B-factor (53.9A<sup>3</sup>) compared to the other two monomers, had the largest stretch of visible amino acids (8 to 95), and will thus be used as the reference glycosylated structure in the discussion below.</p><p>Residue Asn19 was the only one of the three predicted glycosylation sites, which displayed clear electron density for a sugar moiety. Only one saccharide unit, built as an N-acetyl D-glucosamine, could be successfully modelled into all three monomers of Evasin1-glycosylated on residue Asn19. There was some unclear electron density visible for the next monosaccharide in monomer A, and it was thus not modelled. Asn19 is at the C-terminal end of the 1<sup>st</sup> &#x003b2;-strand (&#x003b2;1) and is well exposed to solvent. There is a clear hydrogen bond interaction between the acetamide group of the glucosamine and the side chain of Thr22.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Architecture of the Complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3</title><p>In order to understand the structural basis of the chemokine binding mechanism by Evasin-1, we have crystallized the complex (accession code: 3 fpu) between Evasin-1 and a variant of the human chemokine CCL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The crystal structure was refined up to 1.9 &#x000c5; resolution, and it helps to clarify the structural features of the binding mode of a new class of chemokine binding proteins. One single complex of Evasin-1 and CCL3 crystallised in the asymmetric unit.</p><fig id="pone-0008514-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008514.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Stereo diagram of the complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3.</title><p>The Evasin-1 is colored in cyan and CCL3 in green.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0008514.g003"/></fig><p>One monomer of Evasin-1 binds one monomer of CCL3 displaying a 1&#x02236;1 stoichiometry. Upon complex formation, the N-terminal region of CCL3 interacts with both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Evasin-1. These extremities, which are not completely visible in the isolated crystal structures due to their intrinsic disorder and flexibility, become more rigid due to a network of interactions between the two proteins when the complex is formed. As a consequence, some additional secondary structure elements become visible. In the refined structure of the complex, it is possible to identify the entire Evasin-1 molecule in the electron density, as well as the CCL3 structure with the exception of the last 2 residues of the C-terminus. The crystal structure reveals the C-terminal polyhistidine tag, and includes two metal ions, modelled as Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> atom (believed to be leached from the IMAC resin during purification) and which play an important role in establishing the crystal lattice.</p><p>The overall topologies of both Evasin-1 and CCL3 in the complex are similar to the isolated crystallographic structures. The C&#x003b1; superposition of the isolated Evasin-1 (monomer A) with the respective structure in the complex gives an overall rmsd of 1.0 &#x000c5;. The C&#x003b1; superposition of the crystallographic structure of the CCL3 (J. Dias, unpublished results) and the respective structure of CCL3 in the complex also gives an overall rmsd of 1.0 &#x000c5;, considering only the C-terminal 50 amino acid residues.</p><p>The complex formation induces the stabilization of the entire N-terminal and C-terminal areas of Evasin-1 and of the N-terminal segment of CCL3, which becomes visible in the electron density maps, showing the rearrangement of both N-terminal ends upon binding. Due to interactions in the complex, the CCL3 N-terminal region (residues Ser2-Thr10) moves by almost 90 degrees with 5AlaB moving circa 20 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This difference in the structure of the free and Evasin-1 bound structure is due essentially to rotation around the Pro8-Thr9 and Thr9-Thr10 peptide bonds. Three additional secondary structure elements are formed upon binding: the &#x003b1;2 3-10 helix at the C-terminal of Evasin-1; and the &#x003b1;0 3-10 helix and &#x003b2;0 strand at the N-terminal region of CCL3. The additional CCL3 &#x003b2;0 strand interacts with the Evasin-1 &#x003b2;1 forming an antiparallel beta-sheet, which extends to Evasin-1 &#x003b2;2.

The binding mode of the small tick-derived Evasin-1 to CCL3 can be compared to that of a much larger poxvirus-encoded CC chemokine-binding protein to CCL4, a very close homologue of CCL3, since the NMR solution structure of the complex has been determined (pdb entry 2 ffk and 2 fin)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Derider1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Zhang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The CCL3 and CCL4 sequences in the complex structures are very similar, with over 60&#x00025; identity and 70&#x00025; similarity, and the structures are very similar, as can be expected, with the exception of the extreme N-termini of CCL3 and CCL4, with the main chains displaying an important difference in position between residues 1 and 10. The N-terminus of CCL4 in the vCCI:CCL4 complex closely resembles that of the uncomplexed crystal structure of CCL3 (J. Dias, unpublished results), and the important movement observed around the peptide bond between Pro8-Thr9 and Thr9-Thr10 of CCL3 in the Evasin-1:CCL3 complex remains unique. The chemokine-binding proteins are very different, however, in structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g007">Figure 7 ab</xref>), size (vCCI is 26 kDa compared to 10.4 kDa for Evasin-1), and selectivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Burns1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, but they both interact with a similar region of the chemokine ligand (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g007">Figure 7c</xref>). The complexes are thus also very different in size, shape, and also in buried surface area (2650 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for the Evasin-1:CCL3 and only 1980 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for the much larger vCCI:CCL4 complex). Whilst the region of the chemokine that interacts with the chemokine-binding protein is the same, many of the specific amino acids involved in the interactions are not. The 6 important hydrogen bonding interactions between CCL3 Thr16-Ser17-Arg18 and Evasin-1 are not reproduced in the vCCI:CCL4 complex, despite the close sequence similarity of CCL4 with CCL3 (identical except for residue 17, which is an Ala instead of a Ser). Surprisingly, vCCI does have complementary residues in the vicinity of CCL4, but the hydrogen bonds would appear to be rather weak (3.2 &#x000c5; between Asp141 O&#x003b4;2 of vCCI and the N&#x003b5; of Arg18 of CCL4 and between the O&#x003b5;1 of Glu143 and the O&#x003b3; of Thr16 of CCL4). The &#x003b2;-strand at residues 10-11 of CCL3 induced by binding of Evasin-1 is not present in the vCCI:CCL4 complex, due to the important differences in the structure of the N-terminal regions of the two chemokines. The interesting edge-to-face &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interaction observed between Phe13 of CCL3 and Phe14 of Evasin-1 is not present in the vCCI:CCL4 complex, where the corresponding hydrophobic pocket is composed, for the most part, of aliphatic hydrophobic side chains.

The important stacking interaction between Phe29 of CCL3 and Trp89 of Evasin-1 is not present in the vCCI:CCL4 complex, where the Tyr14 side chain of CCL4 is found pointing into solution, and making no contact with vCCI.

In both structures, as well as that of the complex with another chemokine, XCL1, the N-terminal areas of the chemokines were not observed in the crystal structure. The M3 proteins make no interaction with the Thr16-Ser17-Arg18 region that is so important in the case of the CCL3-Evasin-1 complex, and a tyrosine residue in CCL2 replaces the Phe13 residue in CCL3. It is interesting to note that an edge-to-face &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interaction would appear to take place between this Tyr13 and Tyr266 of M3, reinforcing the possibility that this residue plays an important role in chemokine-receptor interaction. The important stacking interaction observed between CCL3 Phe29 and Evasin-1 Trp89 is also not observed in the M3:CCL2 complex, since this part of the chemokine is not in close proximity to the M3 protein.</p><p>The examination of these three complexes, all of which contain similar chemokines of the CC sub-class, highlights the amazingly different ways in which nature has evolved binding modes to neutralize chemokines. The most striking difference amongst the chemokine binding proteins is, of course, their different sizes, and binding modes. It is interesting to note that they all contain folds that are unrelated to known protein folds. It would appear that the binding to chemokine molecules has requirements that cannot be met by the known classical protein folds commonly found in higher species.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Structural Basis for the Selectivity of Evasin-1</title><p>The tick <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>, also known as the common brown dog tick, is usually found feeding on dogs but is known to infest other mammalian species. In view of this broad host range of it is likely that Evasin-1 is also able to inhibit CCL3 from other species. We have shown that Evasin-1 is indeed able to bind to mouse CCL3 with a comparable affinity to that measured for human CCL3, but binding to CCL3 from other species has not been tested. It was therefore interesting to determine how similar the sequence of CCL3 is between species. The amino acid sequence of CCL3 is remarkably conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). For example, the Phe29 residue, which makes the stacking interaction with Trp89 of Evasin-1, is conserved in all mammalian species. The Thr16-Ser17-Arg18 region of CCL3 is less well conserved between species. The Arg18 residue is replaced by lysine in several mammalian species (notably dog), but this is a conservative substitution that should not affect the selectivity of Evasin-1, though it may affect the binding affinity. The Thr16 residue is far less well conserved in mammals, being replaced by substantially different amino acids (Ile, Val, Ala and Tyr). In fact, this is one of the least well-conserved residues in the mammalian CCL3 family, and yet would appear to play an important in the interaction between the two proteins, notably forming a hydrogen bond with the peptide oxygen of Leu9 of Evasin-1. Ser17 is also not particularly well conserved throughout the CCL3 family either, despite its side chain forming several interactions with Evasin-1. This loop cannot be responsible for the high selectivity displayed by Evasin-1.</p><fig id="pone-0008514-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008514.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Amino acid sequence alignments.</title><p>(A) Alignment of mammalian CCL3 sequences.

We were therefore surprised by the fact that modelling the sequence of CCL5 into the structure of the complexed CCL3 suggested that Evasin-1 should bind this chemokine, contrary to the experimental results, in which we were never able to demonstrate CCL5 binding by cross-linking or by surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g009">Fig. 9a</xref>). CCL5 has the two hydrophobic residues in the correct position that could bind to F14 and W89 of Evasin-1, but no binding to CCL5 was observed by the different assays we used. However our initial conclusion that the two &#x0201c;&#x003c0;-&#x003c0;&#x0201d; interactions were the major binding forces appeared to be incorrect, since the mutation of these hydrophobic residues to Ala had only a small impact on the affinity for CCL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g009">Fig. 9b</xref>). It should be noted that the affinity of the WT and the F14AW89A Evasin-1 proteins was measured on immobilized chemokine for a direct comparison, which consistently results in significantly lower affinities (results not shown). Mutation of these two residues had no impact on k<sub>on</sub>, but did affect k<sub>off</sub>, suggesting that they play a role in the stability of the complex, rather than in the selectivity of the binding protein for CCL3.</p><fig id="pone-0008514-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008514.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>The N terminus of CCL3 is involved in the selectivity of Evasin-1 binding.</title><p>Upper panels: sensograms obtained for binding experiments, lower panels: kinetic parameters relative to binding experiments.

This was unexpected since the full-length CCL5 did not show any affinity towards Evasin-1. Furthermore, the opposite chimera, CCL5/CCL3, did not bind at all, thus illustrating the importance of the amino terminal region. Moreover, the fact that the affinity is unchanged for the &#x00394;4 form of CCL3, the truncated form found in biological fluids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Cocchi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> indicates that the selectivity resides in the 6 residues immediately preceding the CC motif. These 6 amino acids are, not surprisingly, highly conserved amongst the CCL3 of different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008514-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). Of the six amino acids immediately upstream of the CC motif, <sup>4</sup>ADTPTA<sup>10</sup>, Asp6, Thr7 and Pro8 are extremely highly conserved in all mammalian species and play an immediately identifiable role in the structure of the complex; the side chain of Asp6 forming important hydrogen bond interactions with the side chain of Arg90 from Evasin-1, the main chain carbonyl of Thr7 by interacting with the main chain nitrogen of Trp90 of Evasin-1, and it would thus appear that Evasin-1 recognizes its target chemokine through this sequence, and subsequently binds the rest of the protein.</p><p>The major difference in the N-terminal amino acid sequence of CCL5 when compared to CCL3 is the lack of a residue equivalent to the Pro8 in CCL3. An insertion has to be made in the alignment of the two sequences, since the residues Asp6 and Thr7 are conserved, and both make important contributions to the complex interface. The lack of this residue could therefore be responsible for the lack of affinity of Evasin-1 for CCL5. The K<sub>a</sub> for the CCL3/CCl5 chimera is reduced 3-fold compared to CCL3, while the K<sub>d</sub> is not particularly affected, suggesting that CCL5 may play a negative role in the binding event, whilst not unduly influencing the stability of the complex. It is thus probable that the preferred ligand for Evasin-1 is actually CCL3 in which the amino terminus serves as the &#x0201c;address&#x0201d; but that Evasin-1 is capable of binding closely related family members albeit with a slower on-rate, since the body of the chemokine will compensate for the remainder of the binding interactions. It should be noted that these hypotheses are drawn in an attempt to explain the exquisite and perplexing selectivity of this binding protein and remain to be substantiated with experimental evidence. However, this current hypothesis is not supported by the affinity of Evasin-1 towards CCL18, since the sequence of the N-terminus of this chemokine bears no resemblance to that of CCL3. However, CCL18 was apparently derived through gene duplication of the CCL3 gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Tasaki1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and whilst the structure of this protein is unknown, there may be other structural features in CCL18 that explain its affinity for Evasin-1.</p><p>There is evidence that ticks produce different chemokine binding proteins at different times during the feeding cycle, in contrast to the more non-selective strategy employed by viruses. The reason for this is open to speculation, but may be associated with the fact that ticks harbour a large genome (&#x0003e;1&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> bases) with the potential of encoding multiple CK binding proteins, unlike viruses, which are limited by much smaller genomes. Nevertheless it is of interest that although both Evasin-1 and Evasin-3, which are distinct in terms of structure and sequence, are both small proteins (&#x0003c;10 kDa) similar in size to protein binding scaffolds such as single chain camelid antibodies, named nanobodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Roovers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> or scaffolds such as ankyrins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Binz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Binz2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> etc, that are increasingly being developed as protein therapeutics. Parasites such as ticks have apparently developed this strategy before mankind, and the novelty of this chemokine-binding fold may reveal features for neutralization of important immunomodulatory proteins such as chemokines that could help us design improved biological therapeutics. We are currently investigating the importance of the different residues in the interaction between Evasin-1 and CCL3, and the role this plays in the selectivity of Evasin-1, by site-directed mutagenesis of both partners. Information gained from such studies may enable the design of Evasins with defined chemokine binding specificity that could be therapeutically useful in inflammatory and infectious diseases, and cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Baculovirus Production of Evasin-1</title><p>Evasin-1 was expressed in insect cells and purified by chromatography as described elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008514-Frauenschuh2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.
