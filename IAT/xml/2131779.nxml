The question arises as to whether or not the positive correlation between CEA/CEACAM6 levels and tumors points to an instrumental role for these molecules in cancer. This question has significance for the clinical interpretation of CEA and CEACAM6 levels in tumors and for the development of CEA-targeted therapies. In spite of the fact that CEA and CEACAM6 are normally up-regulated as differentiation proceeds during the movement of colonocytes up colonic crypts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Scholzel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Ilantzis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, experiments with various model systems <italic>in vitro</italic>, including cultured human colorectal carcinoma colonocytes, have shown that if CEA and/or CEACAM6 are inappropriately up-regulated in cells with division potential <italic>prior</italic> to differentiation, differentiation is blocked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Eidelman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Rojas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, cell polarization and tissue architecture are disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Ilantzis2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and anoikis/apoptosis is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Duxbury1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Ordonez1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The structural requirements for CEA's differentiation-blocking ability have been shown to be self-associating external domains linked to a CEA-specific GPI anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Screaton2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the former to effect clustering and the latter to provide activation specificity following clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Taheri1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. CEA occupies membrane microdomains (membrane rafts), which tend to cluster as the CEA cell surface density increases as it does in many cancers (see above). CEA external domain mutants deficient in self-binding have no effect on differentiation but become effective immediately after antibody-mediated cross-linking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Taheri1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, within 5 minutes after cross-linking, integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, a cell surface heterodimeric receptor affecting cell-extracellular matrix/cell-cell interactions involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Giancotti1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, becomes activated and co-localizes with CEA in larger membrane structures; rapid localization in low density membrane microdomains of ILK, AKT and MAPK and phosphorylation of AKT and MAPK are also observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-CamachoLeal1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, presumably because all of these elements occupy the same membrane rafts as CEA. Similarly, antibody-mediated cross-linking of CEACAM6 activates integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in a pancreatic cancer cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Duxbury2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrin activation and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways have been reported by other groups to have the same effects observed here on differentiation and anoikis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Stupack1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Guo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These results are thus consistent with the instrumental model of CEA and CEACAM6 in tumorigenesis.</p><p>The above results utilized various <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems involving CEA/CEACAM6 transfectants and could therefore have given findings that do not apply <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this important caveat and to examine effects on tissue architecture in a valid setting, it was decided to construct transgenic mice containing human genes for CEA and CEACAM6. Mice do not possess GPI-anchored CEA family members, having only analogs of human TM-anchored CEACAM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Zimmermann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, making this experiment appropriate.

These mice, however, lacked CEACAM6 that is usually co-overexpressed with CEA in cancers, had transgene expression levels that could have been below those observed in human tumors and lacked upstream and downstream genomic sequences in their transgenes that could have been necessary for derangement of their expression, e.g., in colonocytes with division potential.</p><p>The above deficiencies were dealt with by creating transgenic mice containing a 187 kb insert from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that included the complete human genes for CEA, CEACAM6, CEACAM7 and CEACAM3 plus about 20&#x02013;30 kb of both upstream and downstream sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Chan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression patterns of these genes were almost identical to human patterns, showing normal expression of CEA and CEACAM6 in colorectal crypts with, unlike the CEA-only transgenics by Eades-Perner <italic>et al.</italic>, the correct gradient, i.e., higher towards the upper ends of the crypts.

Higher copy transgenics were then derived by mating the 10 copy founders to give 20 copy homozygotes and a further 2-fold increase in colonic expression. The latter expression levels were in the range observed in human colorectal carcinomas. We were thus poised to look for possible tumorigenic effects of CEA and CEACAM6 in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system that more closely approximated the human situation.</p><p>These transgenic mice showed dramatic expression level-dependent tumorigenic effects: with some variation in detail, the same changes in integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, ILK and AKT as seen in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems were observed in purified colonocytes; furthermore, the mice showed inhibition of colonocyte differentiation (at least for the goblet cell lineage) and anoikis and disruption of tissue architecture characteristic of extreme hyperplasia and dysplasia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of CEABAC Transgenic Mice</title><p>CEABAC2 and CEABAC10 transgenic mice are independent founders containing 2 and 10 head-to-tail copies, respectively, of the 187 kb genomic DNA insert of a BAC which includes the genes for human CEA, CEACAM6, CEACAM7 and CEACAM3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Chan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Appropriately elevated expression levels in colonocytes in the proliferative zone of colonic crypts would be required for this. As an approximate estimate, immunohistochemistry for CEA/CEACAM6 was performed on colonic sections from 3 week and 3 month old transgenic mice and compared with that of human colorectal carcinomas at a common stage of progression. In concordance with the immunoblot analysis, CEABAC2, CEABAC10 and CEABAC20 mice showed increasing expression levels of CEA/CEACAM6 in the transgenic colons at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001353-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the high expression level of CEA/CEACAM6 in the CEABAC20 mice was no longer restricted to the apical surface. Moreover, intracellular localization of CEA/CEACAM6 was more evident in the CEABAC20 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001353-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Here, using purified colonocytes from the transgenic mice, it was not technically possible to measure their binding to fibronectin, the major ligand of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, as an indication of its activation state. However, the cell surface level of integrin &#x003b1;5 was higher in CEABAC2 than in WT colonocytes and even higher in CEABAC10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001353-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

The former is unlikely, however, for the following reasons. First, random mutation of endogenous genes by transgenesis is an uncommon event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Rijkers1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, the probability of mutation of a gene resulting in an anticipated effect, i.e., specifically colorectal tumorigenesis, is even lower. Thirdly, to our knowledge, such dramatic tumorigenic effects have never been reported in any knockout models. Lastly and most importantly, both independently produced transgenic lines (CEABAC2 and CEABAC10), which would have different sites of integration, showed similar tumorigenic changes directly related quantitatively to expression level.</p><p>It is not clear from this work, however, which of the CEACAMs present in the CEABAC are responsible for these effects.

This suggestion is supported by previous work with several cell lines expressing a CEA mutant that is defective in self-binding. None of the molecular events, including integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 activation, or the cellular events, including inhibition of differentiation were produced by this mutant, but all these events were promptly restored by cross-linking with specific antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Taheri1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-CamachoLeal1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the tumorigenic effects were strongly gene dose dependent, which would be expected if they depended on self-binding and clustering, which would be a positive power function (at least a square function) of cell surface molecular concentration. This was most apparent in the case of the disruption of colonic tissue architecture, which was extreme in the case of the CEABAC20 mice. It is of interest that the CEABAC2 and CEABAC10 mice, which showed more moderate colonic changes, were nevertheless much more prone to produce carcinogen-induced focal colorectal tumors than WT mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Chan2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Evidence for the involvement of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 activation, previously shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, was obtained in the observation of a CEABAC dose-dependent increase in the colonocyte surface concentration of this integrin relative to WT littermates and integrin &#x003b1;2 surface concentration. We speculate that this increase is due to an initial activation of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, as observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, followed by an increase in cell surface level, a positive feedback control loop previously documented for integrins in many other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Caswell1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Bretscher1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. If so, it could imply that the colonocyte integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 molecules are not only increased in number but also in activation state, although this would obviously require direct confirmation. The CEABAC mouse colonocytes showed evidence for the activation of AKT but, in preliminary experiments, no evidence for activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway could be demonstrated, in that no nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin was seen (Chan and Stanners, unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Relevance to Human Colon Carcinogenesis</title><p>The most striking and unexpected feature of the present results is first, the magnitude of the effects, which are arguably greater than those seen for any single oncogene or inactivated tumor suppressor gene expressed in animals and second, the fact that this tumorigenic phenotype involves the entire colon in a diffuse mosaic pattern of changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001353-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001353-g007">7</xref>) in 100&#x00025; of the CEABAC20 mice.

If random mutations were required in the CEABAC20 mice, however, the neoplastic changes observed would be focal, as is the case for all other published mouse models with tumorigenic genetic alterations. The present case may bear some resemblance to that of mucin Muc2 deletion in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Velcich1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, in which relatively small non-focal increases in proliferation and decreases in apoptosis were observed in the entire gastrointestinal tract; in this case, focal carcinomas appeared later in life, presumably due to secondary mutations. This is actually the case for the CEABAC2 and CEABAC10 mice which showed a marked increase in focal carcinomas after azoxymethane treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Chan2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In the CEABAC20 mice, on the other hand, the expression level of CEA and CEACAM6 is high enough to drive the abnormal growth of colonic crypts demonstrated by the extreme cellular changes within a given crypt. This abnormal and uncontrolled growth pattern leads to a complete disruption of normal tissue architecture and a large increase in crypt length. In fact these primary changes are so dramatic in the CEABAC20 mice that any focal carcinomas would likely have little selective growth advantage and, in any case, the animals tend to die from digestive complications before about 6 months of age, thus not allowing a long term assessment. Since human colonic tumorigenesis is in fact focal, we suggest that, unlike the situation here where every cell has multiple copies of CEA and CEACAM6 genes, their over-expression itself in the adult human colon could occur by focal up-regulation in expression as observed in the carcinogen-induced colon tumors in CEABAC2 and CEABAC10 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Chan2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore propose that the increase in proliferation and inhibition of differentiation and anoikis together with the disruption of tissue architecture, induced by CEA/CEACAM6 over-expression in colonocytes, puts them in a state that is more susceptible to effects of other oncogenic lesions, thus representing a significant contribution to malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Screaton1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

The traditional view is that hyperplasia is a <italic>dead-end</italic> state that does not progress to dysplasia.

In fact, reduction of their expression has been shown to reverse some tumor phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Wirth1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Soeth1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Duxbury3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and to restore sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Duxbury4">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, as have <italic>declustering</italic> agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001353-Taheri1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.
