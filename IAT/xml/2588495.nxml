In recent years new immunodiagnostic tests for tuberculosis have been developed: the commercially available Quantiferon TB Gold In Tube (Cellestis, Carnegie, Australia) and T-SPOT TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK) ELISPOT assays both measure interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) release by sensitized T cells after stimulation with peptides of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> specific antigens - Early Secretory Antigenic Target (ESAT)-6, Culture Filtrate Protein (CFP)-10 plus TB7.7 in the Quantiferon system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Pai1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> These interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) are less influenced than the TST by factors frequently associated with childhood tuberculosis in developing countries, such as malnutrition and HIV co-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Lalvani1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Also known as CXCL10, it is a member of the CXC-chemokine family. Chemokines are a class of cytokines with chemotactic properties; they have a role in mediating leukocyte migration and activation.

Alternatively, an immunosuppressive effect of active TB, modifying cytokine responses might also explain the differences seen. It is unclear at this stage whether the background levels of IP-10 could carry a prognostic value for the development of active TB from latent TB.</p><p>We showed that IP-10 is produced in high levels following MTB antigen-specific stimulation of whole blood in both active TB and LTBI cases, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker for MTB in children. Ruhwald et al reported similar findings in adults with culture positive tuberculosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Ruhwald1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and in children with presumed latent TB infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Ruhwald2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, but there are no published data for active TB in a paediatric population. The paediatric study by Ruhwald included 97 household contacts under 15 years of age (85&#x00025;&#x0003e;5 yrs) and compared IP-10 levels in child contacts of smear positive adults with those in both smear negative contacts and a control group. A significant increase in IP-10 was found in the smear positive contact group. However, these children did not have active TB, as this study was essentially a household contact investigation. There was good correlation between the QFG-IT and IP-10 results in all groups in this study (93/120, 78&#x00025;, &#x003ba;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.64) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Ruhwald2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Age ranges in both the Ruhwald study and our own study were similar and produced comparable results for LTBI.</p><p>In our study, IP-10 was produced in significantly higher levels than IFN-&#x003b3;, in response to MTB antigens. IFN-&#x003b3; producing T-cells are known to induce IP-10 production in primary exposure to TB. In the mouse model, IP-10 is induced by IL-23 and IL-17 producing T-cells in a recall response to MTB infection in the lung, independent of IFN-&#x003b3; production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Khader1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. IL-23/IL-17 secreting T-cells are known to establish IFN-&#x003b3; producing T-cells following initiation by TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Khader1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These regulatory cytokines are likely to be key players in granuloma stabilisation and therefore latent TB; induction by both IFN-&#x003b3;-producing and IL-17-producing T-cells may explain why the levels of IP-10 are greater in latent TB than active TB.</p><p>The stimulation index indicates a positive response to the specific MTB antigens as opposed to generalised activation of cytokine- producing cells. The stimulation index of IP-10 was notably lower than that of IFN-&#x003b3;, despite the higher levels of cytokines produced. This is due to the higher background level of IP-10 in unstimulated samples, particularly noticeable in the latent TB cases as discussed above.</p><p>IP-10 levels are increased in patients with inflammatory states such as autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid disease), acute coronary syndrome, cerebral malaria and allergy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Lit1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Romagnani1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Kawamura1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-Jinquan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the control group in our study, one patient in particular was found to have very high levels of IP-10. It is probable that IP-10 is mainly a marker of inflammation and therefore too non-specific to be a stand-alone biomarker for TB infection. However it may still have a role as part of a panel of diagnostic markers.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3; is the key cytokine produced in response to TB antigens following TB exposure causing either active or latent TB and this observation forms the basis of the IGRA. However, IGRA do not distinguish between active TB and LTBI. It is interesting to note that although we found a higher IFN&#x003b3; stimulation index in LTBI than in active TB in our study, unfortunately the difference is not significant and therefore not useful as a diagnostic test. A difference in IFN&#x003b3; levels in active TB and LTBI has been noted before and some groups suggest a role for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells in suppressing IFN-&#x003b3; responses to a variety of TB antigens in active TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003901-GuyotRevol1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative hypothesis is that IFN-&#x003b3; producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are sequestered at the tissue site of infection, rather than in the blood, causing a paradoxically low level of IFN-&#x003b3; production to antigen stimulation. This may also explain the lower levels of IP-10 in active TB compared to latent TB.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, which could potentially result in a type II error in the statistical analysis. However, we think, that this is unlikely, as all of the children in each group were very well characterised, thus the results represent a trend that provides direction for further studies. The children with active and LTBI all had TST&#x0003e;15 and positive IGRA tests, hence strong evidence of mycobacterial infection. We deliberately selected these well-characterised phenotypes in order to directly compare the stimulation of IP-10 with IFN-&#x003b3; production. This could have led to bias in the IP-10 results as its production can be induced by IFN-&#x003b3;. It would be interesting to compare IP-10 and IFN&#x003b3; levels also in those children with clinically diagnosed TB and negative IGRA.</p><p>Although IP-10 does not appear to be sensitive or specific enough to supersede IGRA as tools for TB diagnosis, or to distinguish between active TB and LTBI, a number of conclusions can be drawn from our study: the supernatants of the Quantiferon Gold-In-Tube assays are a useful and robust resource for investigation of further proposed biomarkers, and we are currently investigating other cytokines as potential biomarkers to distinguish between active TB and LTBI using this sample bank. The levels of IP-10 in unstimulated blood of LTBI patients may have diagnostic and prognostic value for further investigation, and higher levels may indicate a potentially protective mechanism for the development of LTBI rather than active TB. Of course, only prospective evaluation of such a biomarker could confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
