Mice deficient in NT-3, its tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkC, or in TrkC-positive neuron-specific transcription factor Runx3 display severe ataxia associated with the absence of muscle spindles, and loss of proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) or their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ernfors1">Ernfors et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Klein1">Klein et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tessarollo1">Tessarollo et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Farinas1">Fari&#x000f1;as et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Liebl1">Liebl et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Inoue1">Inoue et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Levanon1">Levanon et al. 2002</xref>). NT-3 is expressed in the ventral spinal cord, in the developing limb buds, and in intrafusal bag fibers of muscle spindles later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Copray1">Copray and Brouwer 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Farinas1">Fari&#x000f1;as et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tojo1">Tojo et al. 1996</xref>). When sensory axons contact developing myotubes, they induce muscle spindle differentiation, forming ring-like spiral nerve endings around them. In the chicken embryo, limb ablations or anti-NT-3 antibody injections into limb buds lead to elimination of TrkC-positive neurons and decreased innervation of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Oakley1">Oakley et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Oakley2">1997</xref>). Is NT-3 only a chemotrophic survival factor for muscle sensory afferents, or does it have additional roles in the development of the proprioceptors and the establishment of the monosynaptic reflex arc? Here we provide evidence that NT-3 acts as a chemoattractant for sensory axons during the final phase of their target-directed pathfinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TrkC-Positive DRG Neurons Are Rescued in <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> Double Knockout Mice</title><p>Mice lacking proapoptotic protein Bax allow for distinguishing survival effects of neurotrophins from other effects.

We bred <italic>NT-3</italic> heterozygote and <italic>Bax</italic> knockout (KO) mice to obtain mice with double KO of both <italic>NT-3</italic> and <italic>Bax</italic> genes, and examined proprioceptive axonal projections. All <italic>NT-3</italic> and double KOs died within 48 h after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tessarollo1">Tessarollo et al. 1994</xref>). We performed TrkA/TrkC double immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Huang1">Huang et al. 1999</xref>), enabling detection of both proteins in the same sample. TrkC-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) were absent in <italic>NT-3</italic> KOs at embryonic day (E) 15. Two subsets of DRG cells expressing either TrkA or TrkC were detected in double KOs, similar to wild-type (WT) or <italic>Bax</italic> KO animals. Surprisingly, at postnatal day (P) 0, a few cells expressed TrkC even in <italic>NT-3</italic> KO animals in the <italic>Bax</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> genetic background, and some cells co-expressed TrkA and TrkC, regardless of the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In order to quantify our results, we analyzed the ratio of TrkA and TrkC immunopositive cells from four different DRGs of animals of different genotypes. At all ages studied, Bax/NT-3 double null DRGs had TrkA/TrkC ratios similar to those of Bax null DRGs, and higher than those of NT-3 null DRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). TrkC-positive neurons rescued by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion, however, failed to differentiate properly, as evidenced by the lack of expression of the proprioceptive molecular marker Parvalbumin (PV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NT-3 Is Necessary for Proper Innervation of Motor Neurons</title><p>TrkA/TrkC-positive fibers in the spinal cord could be detected at E15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). TrkA-positive fibers were restricted to and terminated in the dorsolateral spinal cord, whereas TrkC-positive fibers entered the cord dorsomedially, and descended into the ventral horns in WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ozaki1">Ozaki and Snider 1997</xref>) and <italic>Bax</italic> KO embryos. There was no detectable TrkC expression in <italic>NT-3</italic> KO spinal cord, indicating complete absence of proprioceptive fibers. In double KO spinal cord, TrkC-positive fibers entered the dorsal spinal cord and descended medially in a manner similar to that seen in WT or <italic>Bax</italic> KO cases. However, it was not possible to follow TrkC immunolabeled fibers all the way to their terminal zones in any of the cases. Next we examined the central projections of DRG axons with the lipophilic tracer DiI at P0. In WT and <italic>Bax</italic> KO pups, proprioceptive afferents entered the dorsal spinal cord and followed a medial course towards the ventral horn. They then turned laterally towards motor neurons in the lateral motor column, where they branched and terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). DiI labeling was confined to dorsal spinal cord in <italic>NT-3</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), as reported earlier, consistent with a complete absence of proprioceptive innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ernfors1">Ernfors et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tessarollo1">Tessarollo et al. 1994</xref>). In double KOs, proprioceptive afferents initially followed a trajectory similar to that of WT counterparts, but most of them failed to project all the way to the ventral cord and into the lateral motor column. Instead, they arborized near the ventral midline; some crossed the midline and extended into the contralateral ventral cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g002">2</xref>C). In order to distinguish between a role for NT-3 in initiation of motor neuron innervation and a role for maintenance, we repeated the DiI labeling at E17. Innervation patterns of E17 spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">Figure 3</xref>) were similar to those at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Dorsal horns of all genotypes were filled with DiI-labeled fibers corresponding to nerve growth factor&#x02013;dependent nociceptive axons. In WT and <italic>Bax</italic> KO embryos, proprioceptive fibers extended towards ventral horn motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">3</xref>B), whereas the ventral horns of the <italic>NT-3</italic> KO embryos were devoid of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In the <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KOs, DiI-labeled fibers entered the ventral spinal cord, but extended towards the midline instead of the ventral horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), in a pattern similar to that observed at P0. Our data point to a complete absence of proprioceptive innervation of the ventral horn of the Bax/NT-3 null spinal cord throughout the developmental stages investigated. As the sensory axons never reach motor neuron dendrites in the ventral horn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), the stretch reflex arc circuit is not established. The failure to initiate contact between sensory axons and motor neurons in the absence of NT-3 suggests a requirement for NT-3 for proper axon targeting in addition to a role in sensory axon maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>NT-3 Is Required for Proper Peripheral Innervation</title><p>In order to study peripheral innervation in double KO animals, we investigated spindle development in the gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle spindles could be identified easily in P0 WT and <italic>Bax</italic> KO animals by their characteristic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">4</xref>B). Proprioceptive fibers labeled with neurofilament-M (NF-M) antibody formed ring-like spiral endings wrapped around intrafusal bag fibers labeled with S46 antibody, specific for slow developmental myosin heavy chain protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Miller1">Miller et al. 1985</xref>). As reported earlier, there were no muscle spindles in <italic>NT-3</italic> KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ernfors1">Ernfors et al. 1994</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Bax</italic> KO animals had more spindles than WT, and spindles were in clusters similar to animals over-expressing NT-3 in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Wright1">Wright et al. 1997</xref>). Although NT-3-dependent cells were rescued, no muscle spindles were detected in the limbs of double KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">4</xref>B). Muscle spindles could be observed with TrkC antibody in WT and <italic>Bax</italic> KO animals, but not in <italic>NT-3</italic> or double KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). In both <italic>NT-3</italic> and double KO animals, NF-M-labeled fibers could be detected in muscles, thus the muscles of these animals were not completely devoid of nerve fibers. Since there were no TrkC-positive fibers in these muscles, we think that these NF-M-labeled fibers correspond to motor axons. Absence of muscle spindles might be due to a failure in initiation of differentiation by proprioceptive axons, or a failure of maturation and maintenance in the absence of NT-3. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated muscle spindle development at E15 and E17 with S46/NF-M immunostaining as well as DiI labeling. No structures with the characteristic muscle spindle shape could be detected in any of the genotypes at E15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, numerous developing spindles could be identified at E17 in WT and <italic>Bax</italic> KOs, but not in <italic>NT-3</italic> KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Bax/NT-3 double null muscles were devoid of spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), except for one spindle-like structure observed in one leg of an embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, inset, denoted by the asterisk). DiI labeling through the DRGs at E17 yielded similar results, with muscle spindles identified in parallel sections in WT and Bax null muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), but not in <italic>NT-3</italic> or double KO animals. Although DiI-labeled fibers could be detected in double null muscles, they never formed ring-like structures characteristic of muscle spindles. We also examined TrkA/TrkC expression at P0 in the tibial nerve, which carries sensory fibers to the gastrocnemius muscle as well as the skin of the lower leg. In <italic>NT-3</italic> KOs, TrkA-positive axons could be seen in the tibial nerve but there were no TrkC-positive axons; in contrast, TrkA- and TrkC-labeled axons are both present in WT, <italic>Bax</italic> KO, and double KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). These results suggest that although proprioceptive axons follow proper trajectories in distal peripheral nerves, they fail to innervate their target muscles in the absence of NT-3.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NT-3 Is a Chemoattractant for DRG Axons In Vitro</title><p>To test the hypothesis that NT-3 acts as a chemoattractant for sensory axons, we performed a series of in vitro assays. Proprioceptive axons in mice enter the gray matter in the spinal cord and advance ventrally parallel to the midline by E13 and reach the motor neurons by E15 (Ozaki and Snider 1994). We co-cultured collagen-embedded E13 WT DRG explants with NT-3-soaked sepharose beads (<italic>n</italic> = 26). Control cultures were set up using bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#x02013; or phosphate buffer saline (PBS)&#x02013;soaked beads (<italic>n</italic> = 12). DRG axons began extending towards the localized NT-3 source by the end of the first day and consistently displayed a strong chemoattraction by 3 d in vitro, whereas they did not show such preference for BSA-loaded control beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">5</xref>B). This attraction was not due to survival support of NT-3 because Bax null ganglia displayed the same chemoattraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; <italic>n =</italic> 16). NT-3 may act through either TrkC, or the p75<sup>NTR</sup>. We repeated the co-culture experiments with DRG explants derived from <italic>p75<sup>NTR</sup></italic> KO mice (<italic>n =</italic> 18). Axons of these ganglia also showed strong chemoattraction towards the NT-3 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Finally, we used diffusible TrkC receptors conjugated to IgG constant regions (TrkC-Fc) added to the medium (<italic>n =</italic> 6) to deplete soluble NT-3 from the collagen gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). In the presence of TrkC-Fc the chemoattraction was completely blocked, demonstrating that the effect we see is specific for NT-3. In order to investigate the active range of our beads, we have repeated the cultures with WT E13 DRGs by placing the beads at increasing distances from the ganglia (<italic>n =</italic> 4 each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). There was still preferred growth towards the bead at 1,200&#x003bc;m, the longest distance studied, although the number of axons and the extent of growth were not as robust. Next, we set up E13 DRG spinal cord explant cultures using NT-3-loaded beads placed at the midline at mid-spinal cord level as an ectopic NT-3 source (<italic>n =</italic> 15). Control cultures were set using PBS-loaded beads (<italic>n =</italic> 6). DiI labeling through the DRGs revealed numerous fibers entering the spinal cord at ectopic regions and growing towards the NT-3 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), surrounding the beads and forming bundles around them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">Figure 6</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">6</xref>E). In control cultures, all labeled fibers were directed towards the dorsal spinal cord and terminated there, where they normally enter the gray matter at E13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). No axons were observed around the PBS-loaded control beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">Figure 6</xref>F). Axons that normally enter the gray matter through dorsal spinal cord grow towards the midline when presented with a localized NT-3 source, and new axon growth towards the NT-3 bead is initiated from DRGs, entering the spinal cord at ectopic loci at lateral mid-spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). NT-3 is therefore capable of acting as a chemoattractant for DRG axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Relatively few studies have implicated NT-3 as a chemoattractant agent for sensory and motor axons. Previously noted chemoattractant action of the embryonic mouse maxillary process on trigeminal ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Lumsden1">Lumsden and Davies 1986</xref>) is now attributed to NT-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-OConnor1">O'Connor et al. 1999</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tucker1">Tucker et al. (2001)</xref> showed that developing sensory and motor axons in limb slice cultures preferentially grow towards neurotrophin-soaked beads instead of following their normal trajectories. Conversely, beads soaked with neurotrophin function-blocking antibodies led to reduction of sensory and motor axon growth towards the limb. In transgenic mice, which over-express NT-3 under the <italic>nestin</italic> promoter in the central nervous system, the course of the proprioceptive afferents are altered and directed towards the regions with high levels of ectopic NT-3 expression in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ringstedt1">Ringstedt et al. 1997</xref>). Ringstedt et al. considered the possibility that NT-3 may play a chemoattractant role during the innervation of ventral horns by proprioceptive afferents. However, earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function-blocking NT-3 antibody into the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Oakley1">Oakley et al. 1995</xref>) led them to discount this possibility. In that study, though, assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on NT-3-dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant (approximately 90&#x00025;) but not complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Oakley1">Oakley et al. 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ringstedt1">Ringstedt et al. (1997)</xref> argue that while central sensory axons may still navigate properly in the absence of NT-3, ectopic expression of NT-3 disrupts their targeting. Recently, another member of the neurotrophin family, BDNF, has been suggested to act as a chemoattractant for sensory axons innervating ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tessarollo2">Tessarollo et al. 2004</xref>). In a gene replacement strategy in which BDNF expression was driven by the NT-3 promoter, vestibular axons rerouted towards ectopic sources of BDNF in the cochlea that normally expressed NT-3 and were not innervated by these axons. Ectopic NT-3 supplied using osmotic pumps and adenovirus-mediated expression induce sensory axon growth during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Zhang1">Zhang et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Bradbury1">Bradbury et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Oudega1">Oudega et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ramer1">Ramer et al. 2002</xref>), and induce axonal plasticity of corticospinal axons in injured adult spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Zhou1">Zhou et al. 2003</xref>), where the sprouting axons from the intact site cross the midline towards the NT-3 source on the lesion side of the spinal cord.

It appears that peripheral NT-3 alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in <italic>NT-3</italic> KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord. However, it is unclear whether NT-3 is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals. The possibility has been raised that motor neurons may retrogradely transport NT-3 in muscle to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Chen1">Chen and Frank 1999</xref>).

They see no proprioceptive afferents in the periphery of the double knockouts and note that central proprioceptive afferents terminate in the intermediate spinal cord without extending ventrally. Their observations are based on PV immunostaining and DiI labeling of the peripheral nerves. We noted that PV immunolabeling is diminished in our <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KOs. In various manipulations of the neurotrophins it has been noted that molecular markers for proprioceptive axons such as PV or calcitonin gene-related peptide for nerve growth factor&#x02013;responsive axons are compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ringstedt1">Ringstedt et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Patel1">Patel et al. 2000</xref>), thus PV immunostaining in <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KOs cannot reveal the extent of proprioceptive axons in the periphery.</p><p>Seventy-three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be expressing TrkC RNA in the adult rat DRG, although some of these (about 10&#x00025;) may represent cutaneous innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-McMahon1">McMahon et al. 1994</xref>). Presently, it is not clear whether TrkC protein is also made by cutaneous afferents and if so at what stage in development this receptor is expressed by cutaneous axons. Based on the available evidence showing that all proprioceptive neurons are eliminated in NT-3 or TrkC null mice, we think that TrkC staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents proprioceptive axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target. Altogether, our findings suggest a role for NT-3 in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle differentiation by the proprioceptive axons.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Patel2">Patel et al. (2003)</xref> examined DiI-labeled central DRG axons in the spinal cord of three E17 and two P0 cases, and report that central proprioceptive axons stop in the intermediate laminae, never entering the ventral cord. We have examined nine <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KO cases, and often incomplete DiI labeling gives the impression that there are no axons reaching the ventral spinal cord. We have also seen cases similar to theirs (<italic>n =</italic> 4), but at higher magnification these axons did not have terminal boutons and were not completely labeled. However, with complete fills (<italic>n =</italic> 5), it was possible to trace these axons into the ventral midline and across to the contralateral side, and visualize terminal boutons at their tips (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020403-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Arber1">Arber et al. (2000)</xref> reported that members of the Ets family of transcription factors, Er81 and Pea3, are expressed by DRG neurons as well as motor neurons and their target muscle fibers. They found that in the spinal cord of <italic>Er81</italic> KO mice, ventral projections of proprioceptive axons were mostly absent, and very few axons made it to the ventral cord. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Patel2">Patel et al. (2003)</xref> note that the phenotype they observed in their <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KO mice is quite similar to that of <italic>Er81</italic> KO mice. They provide evidence that NT-3 induces Er81 expression in DRG explants in vitro. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Patel2">Patel et al. (2003)</xref> report that Er81 mRNA expression is diminished (but not abolished) in both <italic>NT-3</italic> KO and <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KO mice, while their immunohistochemistry shows much less protein expression in the double KO mice. It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells express the transcription factor Er81 and that their axons grow beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KO mice. While the phenotype of <italic>Er81</italic> KO mice is quite dramatic, and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord, it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Arber1">Arber et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Patel2">Patel et al. (2003)</xref> also present observations from islet2<sup>DTA</sup> mice, which lack a significant portion of the motor neurons in the ventral cord. In these mice PV immunostaining shows axons in the ventral horns. Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice, NT-3 secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns. However, there is no evidence showing that NT-3 mRNA or protein expressed in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from motor neurons, and there are no available data indicating that in islet2<sup>DTA</sup> mice, NT-3 expression in the ventral spinal cord is abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Yang1">Yang et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Pun1">Pun et al. 2002</xref>). Studies in embryonic mice reported NT-3 mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are expressed solely by motor neurons. In the adult spinal cord, while motor neurons express high levels of NT-3, other cells, including glia, also express it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Zhou2">Zhou and Rush 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Dreyfus1">Dreyfus et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Buck1">Buck et al. 2000</xref>). Our present results, along with those from transgenic mice with NT-3 over-expression in ectopic regions of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ringstedt1">Ringstedt et al. 1997</xref>), argue for a role of NT-3 in chemoattractant axon guidance of proprioceptive axons in the spinal cord.</p><p>Finally, in culture assays, we see a strong chemoattraction of DRG neurons to localized sources of NT-3. This response is seen in WT, Bax null and in p75 null DRG explants, and in the absence of any other neurotrophins or target-derived axon guidance molecules. Furthermore, in vitro, sensory axon response to NT-3 does not appear to be dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ringstedt1">Ringstedt et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Tucker1">Tucker et al. 2001</xref>). NT-3 is capable of attracting axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix, covering the physiological range it needs to attract axons during development. Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT-3 to developing primary sensory axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can attract and induce axonal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ulupinar1">Ulup&#x00131;nar et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ozdinler1">&#x000d6;zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ozdinler3">&#x000d6;zdinler et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Along the monosynaptic stretch reflex pathway, only Wnt-3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Krylova1">Krylova et al. 2002</xref>). Another molecule, Slit2, expressed in the midline and by motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Wang1">Wang et al. 1999</xref>) is capable of inducing axonal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Nguyen1">Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ozdinler2">&#x000d6;zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002</xref>). DRG neurons express Robo receptors, which bind to Slits, and proprioceptive axons are therefore capable of responding to Slit signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Wang1">Wang et al. 1999</xref>). Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT-3-responsive DRG axons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Nguyen1">Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001</xref>), but causes ectopic branching and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Ozdinler2">&#x000d6;zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002</xref>). Thus, Slit2 might also be involved in terminal branching of propioceptive axons in the ventral cord and in the midline branching observed in our double KOs.</p><p>Lack of PV expression in <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> KO mice suggests that PV expression might be responsible for proper axon targeting and muscle spindle differentiation. Presently we cannot completely rule out this possibility. However, no defects in axon pathfinding along the monosynaptic reflex arc or in muscle spindle differentiation have been noted in PV KO mice, which develop normally and show no apparent changes in their behavior or physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020403-Schwaller1">Schwaller et al. 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that axonal targeting defects in <italic>Bax/NT-3</italic> double KO mice cannot be simply due to lack of PV expression in proprioceptive cells.</p><p>Our present results suggest that NT-3 acts as a short-range axon guidance cue for proprioceptive axons centrally and peripherally, as they navigate to their targets using other axon guidance cues. In its absence, these axons terminate in inappropriate loci. However, NT-3 may not be the only molecule that plays a role in targeting and terminal branching of sensory axons in the ventral spinal cord. NT-3 most likely acts cooperatively with other axon guidance molecules or by regulating expression of yet to be identified proprioceptive neuron-specific receptors/ligands for numerous axon guidance cues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Generation of double KOs.</title><p>We crossed <italic>Bax</italic> KO females on a C57BL/6 background (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States) to <italic>NT-3</italic> heterozygote males on a 129 Sv background to generate double heterozygote animals.

In control cultures fibers extend along the dorsal spinal cord, where they normally enter the gray matter at E13.

NT-3 also initiates axon growth from the DRGs, entering the spinal cord at ectopic lateral loci, growing towards the bead, surrounding the bead, forming nerve bundles, and branching around it.</p><p>Scale bar, 175 &#x003bc;m (A and B), 100 &#x003bc;m (C&#x02013;F).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020403.g006"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest.</bold> The authors have declared that no conflicts of interest exist.</p></fn><fn id="n2" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> BG and RE conceived and designed the experiments.
