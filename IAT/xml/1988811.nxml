Given the essential nature of <italic>GATA-2</italic>, the factors required for its hematopoietic expression are likely to play an important role in the initial stages of hematopoietic development. Although a few growth factors that affect <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], little is understood about the regulation of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>in hematopoietic tissues. Recent studies showed that <italic>Oct-1</italic>, <italic>GATA</italic>, and <italic>Evi1 </italic>factors and their binding sites were involved in regulating <italic>GATA-2 </italic>hematopoietic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, these binding sites are located in the proximal region of the promoter and are unlikely sufficient in directing hematopoietic expression of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>since several lines of evidence have shown that the regulatory elements required for <italic>GATA-2 </italic>hematopoietic expression are located many kilobase pairs (kbp) upstream of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In fact, to fully rescue hematopoietic development in <italic>GATA-2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mice, constructs containing over one hundred kbp of genomic sequence are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We have previously utilized bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which can accommodate inserts containing several hundred kbp of genomic DNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], to study regulation of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>in hematopoietic cells.

Using multiple GFP reporter modified BAC clones, containing varied amounts of upstream and downstream genomic sequence, we have demarcated a distal genomic region that regulates hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression in transgenic zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we describe the identification and functional studies of two highly conserved non-coding sequence elements within this genomic region.

The conserved non-coding sequences found 12.9 kb and 10 kb, respectively, upstream of the <italic>GATA-2 </italic>start codon were inserted into <italic>Tol2</italic>-transposon cassettes proximal to a <italic>GATA-2 </italic>minimal promoter/GFP fusion generating a series of construct combinations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G~L</xref>). These constructs were flanked by the <italic>Tol2 cis</italic>-acting elements, which are required for genome integration of the construct.

This approach, which typically produces at least 40% germline transgenic zebrafish, resulted in multiple stable transgenic zebrafish lines for each construct analyzed.</p><p>In zebrafish transgenic embryos carrying the Up1-mp/GFP construct (N = 3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>), no ICM-specific expression was observed; however, strong fluorescence was detected in the heart at 24 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).

In four independent transgenic zebrafish lines, we found that Up2a can drive GFP expression in the ICM although less fluorescence was observed than in the Up2 transgenic and Up2a transgenic zebrafish embryos also had non-specific GFP expression in the notochord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). We also obtained several lines of transgenic zebrafish carrying a GFP expression vector in which both non-coding sequence elements were linked to <italic>GATA-2 </italic>minimal promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>); GFP expression in the ICM and the heart was observed at 24 hpf (data not shown). GFP expression was undetectable in five independent transgenic zebrafish lines carrying <italic>GATA-2 </italic>minimal promoter construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p><p>Conservation of the non-coding sequence, Up2, in five vertebrate species suggests functional conservation. To determine whether this enhancer element is active in mammalian hematopoietic cells, we performed transient transfection assays with a construct containing Up2. We transfected two human myeloid leukemia cell lines (KG-1 and K562) and a non-hematopoietic mammalian cell line NIH 3T3, with the mp/GFP, Up2-mp/GFP and the Up2a-mp/GFP constructs along with a CMV &#x003b2;-galactosidase plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. In myeloid cell lines, we observed increased GFP expression and this activity was stronger with the entire Up2 compared to activity of the minimal promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Transfection with the Up2a element also showed increased GFP expression but this activity was less than that of the Up2. In both cases, the differences were found to be statistically significant when compared to the minimal promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). No GFP expression was observed in NIH3T3 cells; &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression was observed in this cell line indicating that Up2 and Up2a enhancer activities are specific to hematopoietic cells. Finally, we generated a reporter construct containing the mouse Up2 linked to GFP and analyzed its activity in transient transgenic zebrafish assays. As shown in Supplementary Table S (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), mouse and zebrafish Up2 showed a similar enhancer activity to direct hematopoietic expression of GFP.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Conservation of Up2 enhancer activity and transacting factors</bold>.

Multiple transcription factor binding sites including those for AML1a, GATA-2, GATA-3, En-1, FAC1, HNF-1, E2F-1, LMO2, ARP-1 and HOXA3 were identified. Constructs carrying mutations on the binding sites for transcription factor AML-1, E2F-1, ARP-1, LMO2 and HOXA3 were generated and injected into zebrafish embryo for transient assays of hematopoietic GFP expression. Under a condition that is statistically significant, 19.49% (n = 318), 21.79% (n = 335) and 22.09% (n = 335) of the embryos injected with construct carrying mutation in E2F-1, LMO2 and HOXA3-A binding site, respectively, showed transient hematopoietic GFP expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These percentages are significantly lower than that of embryos injected with the control Up2 construct (35.2%). Other constructs did not show any significant differences (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Supplementary Table S).</p><p>EMSA showed that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, proteins of transcription factors E2F-1 and HOXA3 specifically formed the protein-DNA complexes with the probes containing LMO2 and HOXA3-A binding sites present in Up2, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). With the anti-E2F-1 antibody, a super shift was observed while there was no super shift with a non-specific antibody. The shifted band was not observed with the probes containing a mutation in the E2F-1 and HOXA3-A binding site, respectively.</p><p>The function of E2F-1, LMO2 and HOXA3 binding sites were further analyzed in the germline transgenic zebrafish embryos carrying the described base change mutations in the same Up2-mp/GFP construct context. A base change mutation in E2F-1 binding site showed increased non-specific expression in muscle and notochord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>) and less severe but notably reduced expression in hematopoietic cells. Mutation within LMO2 and HOXA3-A binding sites resulted in almost elimination of GFP expression in hematopoietic cells, showing a mosaic GFP positive pattern in less than 10% of hematopoietic cells compared to Up2-mp/GFP wild type construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3L</xref> and see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2). As a control, mutation within the ARP-1 binding site showed no effect on GFP expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>). These results revealed that integrity of these putative LMO2 and HOXA3-A binding sites is required for proper regulation of <italic>GATA-2/GFP </italic>expression in hematopoietic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Due to important roles of GATA-2 in hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a number of previous studies have been carried out to analyze the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and transcription factors that regulate hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression. Transcription factors GATAs, Oct1 and Evi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and distal <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequence elements appear involved in regulating its hematopoietic expression as revealed by transgenic animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The evolutionary conservation of non-coding sequences indicates that they have important biological functions, including developmental regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We used comparative genomics to identify three highly conserved non-coding sequences in the genomic regions flanking <italic>GATA-2 </italic>in the fugu, mouse, rat, human, and zebrafish genomes. One conserved element is located downstream, and two others, Up 1 and Up2, are located upstream of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>in a genomic region that, we showed in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], is required for hematopoietic expression of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>in transgenic zebrafish. In this study we show that Up1 specifically directs GFP reporter gene expression in heart and Up2 is required for hematopoietic regulation of <italic>GATA-2</italic>. The enhancer activity of Up1 in heart should represent an authentic activity since <italic>GATA-2 </italic>is expressed in the mouse heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] as well as weakly expressed in embryonic zebrafish heart as detected by whole mount mRNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (unpublished data).</p><p>Transgenic zebrafish carrying the Up2-mp/GFP construct expressed GFP strongly in hematopoietic tissues, showing that Up2 is sufficient to drive hematopoietic-specific gene expression. In addition, BAC clones having a deletion of Up2 did not drive hematopoietic gene expression whereas deletion of Up1 had no impact on hematopoietic gene expression, suggesting that Up2 is also necessary for regulating <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression in hematopoietic tissues. In transfection analyses, we also found that hematopoietic Up2 enhancer activity is conserved in mammalian cells. Similarly, mouse Up2 enhancer has directed higher expression in zebrafish hematopoietic cells as shown by transient assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, and see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Supplementary table S), suggesting that function of Up2 is conserved between zebrafish and mammals. The tissue-specific expression in zebrafish appears to require elements that repress gene expression since deleting Up2b results non-specific expression of GFP in notochord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). Interestingly, we have also observed this in the regulation of the zebrafish <italic>GATA-1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Up2 contains several known consensus binding sites including those for AML1a, GATA-2, GATA-3, En-1, FAC1, HNF-1, E2F-1, LMO2 and HOXA3. Among these factors, HOXA3, AML1a, E2F-1, ARP-1, LMO2 and GATA-1/3 are likely to be involved in regulating hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression since expression of the others has not been observed in hematopoietic tissues. Several HOX genes have recently been shown to be necessary for cdx4-mediated specification of hematopoietic cell fate during vertebrate embryogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Since specification of hematopoietic cell fate precedes hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression, HOXA proteins are good candidates for <italic>GATA-2 </italic>regulation. E2F-1 and AML1a are also potential regulators of hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression. <italic>E2F-1 </italic>mouse mutants have defects in hematopoietic progenitor cells that result from impeded cell cycle progression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. AML1, also known as Runx1, contributes to both transcriptional activation and repression in cell type-specific hematopoietic gene expression; <italic>AML1 </italic>knock-out mice lack fetal liver-derived hematopoietic cell clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, associated with chromosomal translocation, <italic>AML1 </italic>is involved in several types of acute myeloid leukemia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. ARP-1 is a regulator of gene switching from embryonic to fetal globins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. LMO2 forms transcription factor complexes with SCL and GATA factors in erythroid and hematopoietic progenitor cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. GATA transcription factor binding sites found in Up2 may be involved in auto-regulation of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression by GATA-2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or <italic>trans</italic>-regulation by other GATA factors. GATA-1 and GATA-2 double knockdown in zebrafish did not eliminate initial expression of <italic>GATA-2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (also, personal communication from Zon LI, Children's Hospital, Boston). Similarly, <italic>GATA-2 </italic>promoter driven GFP expression were not affected in <italic>GATA-2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>or <italic>GATA-3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>null mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We therefore focused on analyzing function of binding sites for other non-GATA factors within up2. From the transgenic embryos injected with a series of site-specific mutagenesis constructs of other potential transcription binding sites contained in Up2, we demonstrated that the mutations in putative E2F-1, LMO2 and HOXA3-A binding sites decreased hematopoietic GFP expression. There are two high affinity HOXA3 binding sites in Up2 region. Mutation of the HOXA3-B binding site did not affect the hematopoietic expression of the GFP reporter gene, neither in transient nor in transgenic zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, this HOXA3-B site is not conserved from zebrafish to mammals. Thus, we consider the HOXA3-A binding site is the conserved functional site. Although mutations in the LMO2, E2F-1 and HOXA3-A binding sites all affect GFP expression in hematopoietic cells, LMO2 and HOXA3 sites appear playing a bigger role in positive regulation of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>whereas E2F1 site is more involved in restricting <italic>GATA-2 </italic>from expression in non-hematopoietic cells. Further analysis of their corresponding transcription factors by genetic and molecular approaches may lead to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression in hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Up2 is located near at 10 kb 5' of start codon in both the zebrafish and mouse <italic>GATA-2 </italic>gene. Previously, Kobayashi-Osaki et al. showed that a 26 base genomic sequence element located immediately 5' upstream of the conserved mouse up2 is essential for embryonic hematopoietic expression of <italic>GATA-2</italic>/GFP in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, five of six GATA binding sites scattered in a genomic region of 336 bp, which encompass the up2 element, are critical for <italic>GATA-2</italic>/GFP expression in transgenic mouse. These observations, in addition to implicating roles of GATA factors in regulating hematopoietic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression, conceivably validate the necessary function of up2 in mouse. However, since expression of <italic>GATA-2/GFP </italic>is not affected in either <italic>GATA-2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>or <italic>GATA-3</italic><sup>-/- </sup>null mouse mutant as well as <italic>GATA-2 </italic>expression is not affected when both <italic>GATA-1 </italic>and <italic>GATA-2 </italic>are down regulated in zebrafish, other factors may play more essential roles in initiating embryonic <italic>GATA-2 </italic>hematopoietic expression. Our studies suggest that factors binding to putative HOXA3, LMO2 and E2F1 binding sites may be good candidates for such function. It is worth noting that the core sequence of HOXA3, LMO2 and GATA binding sites share high sequence similarity. Therefore the true identity of transcription factors binding to these sites <italic>in vivo </italic>remains as a subject of further investigation. Finally, mouse transgenic analysis suggests that a putative necessary enhancer for complete hematopoietic expression is located between 100&#x02013;150 kb 5' of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It would be interesting to determine in transgenic mouse if Up2 is also necessary by deletion analysis of BAC or YAC constructs. If yes, it would suggest that mouse needs additional enhancer located even further away to facilitate function of Up2 element in directing hematopoietic expression of <italic>GATA-2</italic>. <italic>GATA-2 </italic>regulation in mouse and zebrafish may certain differences reflecting evolutional divergence between the two species. Nonetheless, Up2 is conserved in sequence and genomic location and is functionally important in zebrafish.</p><p>Although we focus on analyzing regulation of <italic>GATA-2 </italic>gene expression the approach described here, drawing on embryological, genetic, molecular and computational methods, is generally applicable for rapidly identifying functional distal <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences that regulate embryonic gene expression in vertebrates. In particular, we have established a transgenic line that expresses Tol2 transposase in germ cells, providing the transposase maternally eliminates the need to co-inject transposase mRNA. This simplified <italic>Tol2 </italic>transposon-mediated transgenesis approach allows generation of multiple stable transgenic zebrafish lines with non-mosaic expression of the GFP reporter gene.
