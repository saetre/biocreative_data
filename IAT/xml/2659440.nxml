Central to the cytoskeletal dynamics in these protrusive structures, commonly involving formation of lamellipodia or filopodia, is the highly regulated actin cytoskeleton assembly, controlled by a dynamic balance between the addition of ATP-bound G-actin to the plus (i.e. &#x0201c;barbed&#x0201d;) end of a filament, the dissociation of ADP-actin from the minus end of the polymer, and the retrograde flow of the actin filament bundle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Le1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Pollard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In this process there is tight coupling to the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis capacity of individual actin subunits in the F-actin filament. Ultimately, the dynamic sheet and finger-like shape alterations that are characteristic for lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions are determined by branching, cross-linking and bundling of the linear actin filaments. The tight spatial and temporal control of the formation and dissipation of these higher-order structures involves a broad set of actin-binding proteins, like filamins, Arp2/3, cofilin, profilin and capping proteins, all regulating specific steps of actin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Mattila1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-dosRemedios1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Another CK, the brain-type isoform (CK-B, expressed in a range of cell types), may have similar roles in fueling of ATP-dependent cytoskeletal processes in non-muscle cells like oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, macrophages, osteoclasts and tumor cells, Functionally, CK-B is connected to spatial memory acquisition and behavior, development of the hippocampus, functioning of hair bundle cells in the auditory system, phagocytosis and bone resorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Chang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Shin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that the subcellular distribution of CK-B partially overlaps with that of dynamic actin in protrusion-active cortical areas of astrocytes and fibroblasts, but not with static F-actin of stress fibers in these cells. CK-B activity in astrocytes and fibroblasts directly facilitates actomyosin-driven motility, as demonstrated by cell spreading and migration assays.

This result corroborates the astrocyte migration data and underscores that our findings on CK-B effects can be extrapolated to other cell types. Interestingly, anchoring of CK-B to membranes (MYR-CK-B), thereby mimicking the change in distribution that occurs naturally in motile cells with CK-B, had a clear stimulatory effect on motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005030.s006">Video S2</xref>).

As indicated above, this latter effect could be even underestimated, because overall enzymatic activity in cells with MYR-CK-B was 30&#x00025; lower than in cells with native CK-B. Enzymatic activity of CK-B was indispensable since cyclocreatine completely blocked the gain in migration capacity in both CK-B expressing cell pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g006">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005030.s007">Video S3</xref>) without overt effects on viability or proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005030.s001">Figure S1</xref>). It is of note here that the directionality of cell movements, being the ratio of the direct distance from start to end point to the total migrated distance, was similar for all tested cell lines (data not shown). Thus, migratory capacity is increased without changing the type of cell movement. Additionally, we observed that the morphological appearance of migrating MEF-MYR-CK-B differed from that of MEF-CK-B, and displayed a more flat morphology with broad lamellipodia.

We reasoned that analyzing effects of manipulation of the intracellular spatial distribution of CK-B within the same cell would provide the most effective strategy. Therefore, we used the rapamycin dimerizer system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Castellano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and engineered pools of MEF-BAK&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells with the constructs for inducible targeting of CK-B that are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g007">Figure 7</xref>. One vector was designed for expression of FK506-binding protein (FKBP) with a MYR-anchor for targeting to membranes (MYR-FKBP). Other vectors were destined for expression of active CK-B or CK-B<sub>C283S</sub>, a catalytic-dead protein, both with N-terminal extensions consisting of the FK506-Rapamycin Binding (FRB) domain. Upon addition of Rapalog (rapamycin analog AP21967), inducible translocation of a significant fraction of cytosolic distributed CK-B and CK-B<sub>C283S</sub> to membranes occurred, as verified by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005030.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

Quantification of video data showed that cells expressing native CK-B migrated significantly faster than cells expressing the enzymatically inactive CK-B<sub>C283S</sub>, independent of Rapalog-mediated induction. Secondly, when Rapalog was added during migration of cells with enzymatically active CK-B to redirect (part of) CK-B to membranes, distances increased from 344&#x000b1;15 to 434&#x000b1;19 &#x000b5;m over the period measured (3 independent experiments, p&#x0003c;0.01). Addition of Rapalog did not alter locomotion of CK-B<sub>C283S</sub> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that covalent or interactive fusion of CK-B with FRB or FRB-FKBP does not impede CK-B intrinsic capacity to promote cell migration, and corroborate our finding that cell cortical presence of functional activity and not the mere structural presence of CK-B protein is essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Since we noted earlier that permanent targeting of CK-B to membranes changed the lamellipodium dimensions in MEFs, we also assessed whether morphological changes would be inducible with Rapalog-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g007">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005030.s004">Figure S4B</xref>).

ATP exchange and hydrolysis is thereby critically involved in the process of actin treadmilling, controlled by recycling of G-actin and the stability of F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Le1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and is also important for the activity of many actin-associated proteins. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of local ATP generation by CK-B to actomyosin dynamics by measuring spreading and motility of astrocytes and MEFs. Straightforward immunofluoresence and Western blot assays demonstrated that cultured astrocytes from mouse brain express high levels of CK-B, which corroborates findings with immunostaining and in-situ hybridization on whole mouse brain that appeared in other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Jost1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Sistermans1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, an emerging role of astrocytes as active modulators of synaptic transmission has been acknowledged. In this process, which depends on the intimate physical interactions between astrocytes and neurons, local actin-driven dynamics of astrocytic protrusions play an organizing and maintaining role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Haber1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Hirrlinger1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on this knowledge, we propose that astrocytes use a significant amount of their ATP for cytoskeletal remodeling, comparable to the ATP need for actomyosin activity in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Besides astrocytes, we also used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as archetypal motile cells for study of the localized role of CK-B in cell dynamics. Our data on recruitment of CK-B from the cytosolic pool and it's transient co-accumulation in areas with cortical F-actin but not with the less dynamic F-actin in stress fibers in both cell types support the idea that CK-B activity is generally most needed at sites where the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic. This idea was already proposed for the accumulation of CK-B in nascent phagosomes as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Kuiper1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interesting parallels can also be drawn to the fate of the muscle specific isoform of CK, CK-M, which is strategically localized in the M-band of myofibrils to support localized myosin ATPase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Wallimann2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, or is recruited to the I-band by binding to the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase and aldolase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Kraft1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. CK-B lacks essential lysine residues that are required for CK-M accumulation at the M-band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Hornemann1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, but in view of its high homology with CK-M, it is tempting to speculate that other mechanisms for recruitment may be shared between the two enzymes. Especially, the possible interaction with glycolytic enzymes capable of binding to F-actin should be studied further as several of these enzymes are enriched in lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Beckner1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and other types of dynamic cell structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-deHoog1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We know already that CK-B and CK-M have an interchangeable character with respect to recruitment in the phagocytic cup of macrophages (data not shown), but the precise mechanistic link between protrusion formation and CK-B recruitment remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The direct functional link between CK-B activity and cell shape changes was clarified by our cell spreading and migration assays, in which ablation of CK-B slowed down these processes in both astrocytes and MEFs. Overall, findings between astrocytes and MEFs were comparable, only CK-B effects on spreading were not reproduced in MEFs. Cell spreading is a complex process consisting of substrate adherence and passive-descent events, later followed by active probing of the cellular environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Cuvelier1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. These later events in spreading may be more reliant on infrastructural organization within the cell and be cell-type dependent. The observed discrepancies between the roles of soluble and anchored CK-B in spreading of astrocytes and MEFs may therefore be explained by differences in the relative importance of CK-mediated ATP supply during the early and late phases, and be not easily comparable between cell types.</p><p>Importantly, the experiments with pharmacological inhibition with cyclocreatine or substitution of native CK-B by the catalytically dead CK-B<sub>C283S</sub> in the positional swapping/tagging experiments demonstrated that the contribution of CK-B to enhanced cell migration capacity did not depend merely on its structural interference, but that its catalytic ATP-generating activity is required.</p><p>We propose that cells use CK-B to balance ATP/ADP ratios and buffer temporary demands for ATP in specialized structures with highly dynamic actin, such as lamellipodia and filopodia, to sustain optimal migration rates. The early observation that cyclocreatine was able to inhibit motility in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Mulvaney1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and the long known importance of ATP for actin polymerization and myosin force generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Pollard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Giannone1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> support this model.</p><p>One most conspicuous finding in our studies was that manipulation of CK-B location had an effect on both migratory capacity and lamellipodial morphology in MEFs. Interestingly, targeting CK-B to membranes changed the lamellipodial dimensions. Formation of lamellipodia is largely dependent on branched actin polymerization at the cell's periphery, which requires the availability of free ATP-loaded actin monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Le1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Pollard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The process of re-loading of G-actin with ATP and incorporation of actin monomers at linear-barbed or branched-ends of polymeric filaments could be the decisive step that takes advantage of local ATP generated by CK-B. Our experimental verification of this obviously speculative model showed that CK-B with a membrane anchor could indeed facilitate lamellipodia formation and stimulated cell migration. Interestingly, expression of native cytosolic CK-B had an effect on migratory capacity but did not enhance lamellipodium formation proper. This suggests that other ATP dependent migration promoting processes, which are morphologically more difficult to delineate (and therefore association with local CK-B recruitment goes undetected) may also be fuelled by CK-B. Although speculative, actin mediated adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Galbraith1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> or myosin force generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Giannone1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Gupton1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> may be examples of such directly served processes. Earlier it has been suggested that CK-B may provide bursts of site-specific high-energy phosphate for signal transduction involved in cytoskeletal reorganisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Mahajan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In this latter process association of CK-B to the C-tail of protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) is involved. Whether similar stimulating activities of CK-B at other cellular locations would also require regional accumulation of the enzyme is completely unknown.</p><p>By using the Rapalog heterodimerizer system, we were able to manipulate the localization of CK-B without altering the total cellular levels of CK-B, thus excluding effects of variation in activity levels or in genetic or metabolic background between cells in our pool. As rapamycin is reported to inhibit F-actin reorganization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Liu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, we verified that Rapalog (a chemically modified derivative of rapamycin) itself did not influence cell motility (data not shown). Our findings thus clearly indicate that migratory capacity and cell morphology are truly directly responsive to the localization of CK-B underscoring the importance that site-specific availability of ATP has for local cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>Besides CK-B, also other enzymes have been reported to act as local distributors of ATP at actin-rich structures. For example, translocation of adenylate kinase (AK1) to focal contacts sites in MEFs induced migratory capacity of these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-VanHorssen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Other regulators of nucleoside-triphosphates levels (NTPs), such as nm23-H2 and arginine kinase, translocate to actin-rich cellular protrusions and lamellipodia and regulate their dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Fournier1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Wang1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. As yet other examples, glycolytic enzymes form complexes that partition at specific subcellular locations such as pseudopodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Beckner1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Schmitz1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> and phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Garin1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and may have an energy supply role there. In Drosophila flight muscle, glycolytic multienzyme complexes provide myosin ATPases with preferential access to ATP when brought in close vicinity by physical protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Wojtas1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Different cells may therefore use different systems to fulfill the ATP needs of active actomyosin.</p><p>In summary, data presented here strongly suggest that locally generated ATP is an important regulator for actin-based cytoskeletal dynamics involved in cell extension and motility and that CK-B is a controlling enzyme in the compartmentalization of ATP availability. This model also provides a plausible explanation for our earlier findings on synaptic function and development of neural cell networks in CK-B knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Jost1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, on epithelial hair cell function in the inner ear of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Shin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and on impairment of bone remodeling activity of osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Chang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> of these mice. In an analogous study we recently showed that CK-B fuels local actin dynamics in phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Kuiper1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. All processes mentioned have in common that they are dependent on the functional integrity and timely control of actin filament nucleation, elongation and associated motor protein activity in cell cortical regions that forms ruffles or membrane tubulation areas. More research is required to investigate whether CK-B also contributes to inhomogeneity in ATP distribution and whether the precise mechanistic events that connect CK-B mediated ATP supply with actin in this axis are shared between different CK-expressing cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and generation of cell lines</title><p>Primary cultures of astrocytes were established from brains of embryonic wild type (C57BL/6&#x000d7;129Ola) or CK-B deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Jost1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> at embryonic day 17 (E17) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-deHoop1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

The MYR-localization tag was introduced 5&#x02032;-upstream of the myc-tagged CK-B and YFP by PCR using primers containing BamH1 sites to amplify a 50 bp MYR-domain segment from AK1&#x003b2; cDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005030-Collavin1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Natural start codons in the CK-B and YFP ORF were substituted by alanine codons to ensure the use of the ATP start codon of the MYR-domain. Inducible translocation of CK-B to membranes was studied using the ARGENT Regulated Heterodimerization Kit (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals), based on the rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of FKBP- and FRB-tagged proteins. The FKBP fragment (316 bp) from the pC4EN-F1 plasmid (ARIAD) was PCR-amplified, provided with EcoRI/XhoI sites, and cloned into the pLZRS-IRES-Zeo behind the MYR-myc sequence to generate the targeting construct. Subsequently, a 276 bp FRB fragment was PCR-amplified from plasmid pC4-RhE (ARIAD) with primers containing BamHI/BglII sites and cloned into the BamH1 site upstream of the myc-tagged CK-B or CK-B<sub>C283S</sub> (catalytic death mutant) sequence in vector pLZRS-IRES-Zeo. Constructs and targeting principle are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005030-g006">Figure 6 A and 6B</xref>, respectively.
