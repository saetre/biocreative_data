Here we investigate the link between diabetes and macrophage cholesteryl ester accumulation. When diabetic (<italic>db/db</italic>) mice are given cholesteryl ester intraperitoneally (IP), peritoneal macrophages (PerM&#x003a6;s) recovered from these animals showed a 58&#x00025; increase in intracellular cholesteryl ester accumulation over PerM&#x003a6;s from heterozygote control (<italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;) mice. Notably, PerM&#x003a6; fluid-phase endocytosis and large particle phagocytosis was equivalent in <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;and <italic>db/db</italic> mice. However, IP administration of CD36 and SR-A blocking antibodies led to 37&#x00025; and 25&#x00025; reductions in cholesteryl ester accumulation in PerM&#x003a6;. Finally, in order to determine if these scavenger receptors (SRs) were part of the mechanism responsible for the increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters observed in the diabetic mouse macrophages, receptor expression was quantified by flow cytometry. Importantly, <italic>db/db</italic> PerM&#x003a6;s showed a 43&#x00025; increase in CD36 expression and an 80&#x00025; increase in SR-A expression. Taken together, these data indicate that direct cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse macrophages is mediated by CD36 and SR-A, and the magnitude of accumulation is increased in <italic>db/db</italic> macrophages due to increased scavenger receptor expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>T2D is an independent risk factor for developing atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Aronson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, it has not been determined if direct cholesteryl ester uptake by macrophages and subsequent foam cell formation may be altered in the diabetic state contributing to diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p><p>The storage of cholesteryl esters in macrophages and the subsequent formation of foam cells are critical to the development of the atherosclerotic plaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-deVilliers1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Both cholesteryl ester-rich oily droplets and cholesterol-rich vesicles are found within the early fatty streak and lipid core, with cholesteryl esters more prominent in the fatty streak and advanced plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Guyton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages have been shown to directly take up both free cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Lesnik1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and cholesteryl esters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Mahlberg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> through an as yet incompletely defined mechanism, resulting in the generation of foam cells. Initially in macrophage-derived foam cell development, monocytes migrate into the arterial intima stimulated by any or all of the following: tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin-1, 6, 8, 10, 12, oxidized LDL, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, migratory inflammatory protein-1, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, RANTES, and endothelin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These monocytes then differentiate into macrophages and take up modified LDLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, which leads to the formation of foam cells through the accumulation of cholesteryl esters. LDLs are transported into lysosomes, where cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by acid hydrolase into free cholesterol. Cholesteryl ester repeatedly undergoes hydrolysis and re-esterification in the &#x0201c;cholesterol ester cycle&#x0201d; by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase and acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Brown1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Cholesterol in this process turns over with a half time of approximately 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-McGookey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The free cholesterol is exported from the cell or trapped in the cytosol as cholesteryl esters. Eventually, the accumulation of free cholesterol is toxic to the foam cell resulting in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-KellnerWeibel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> or necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, which contributes to the formation of the lipid core of the atherosclerotic plaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Ball1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Tangirala et al. demonstrated that this same lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol occurs in macrophages loaded with cholesteryl esters through direct cholesteryl ester accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Tangirala1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, foam cells can proliferate within the atherosclerotic lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Gordon1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and activated macrophages can produce growth regulatory molecules, cytokines, and chemotactic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Ross1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, leading to atheroma progression.</p><p>SRs are integral to the development of foam cells in that they mediate the uptake of modified LDLs by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Hiltunen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Greaves1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. SRs were initially identified by Goldstein et al. with the discovery that macrophages take up acetylated LDL through a specific surface binding site that does not recognize native LDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently the scavenger receptor family consists of 6 structurally distinct classes of receptors (classes A through F) that bind a range of polyanionic ligands including modified LDLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Greaves1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Scavenger receptor A (SR-A) or CD204, and CD36, a class B member, have been shown to play a major role in the uptake of modified LDLs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Silverstein1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Stangl et al. extended the role of scavenger receptors to include SR-BI mediated cholesteryl ester formation in the presence of free cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Stangl1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that the scavenger receptor system plays a role in direct cholesterol uptake. Liang et al. further characterized the relationship between scavenger receptors and uptake of modified LDLs in a model of diabetes. This group demonstrated that due to defective insulin signaling, but independent of glucose and free fatty acids, macrophages from <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice express higher levels of SR-A and CD36 resulting in elevated cellular association with acetylated and oxidized LDL and increased cholesteryl ester formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Liang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, reversal of insulin resistance in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b3; agonist, leads to decreased CD36 expression on PerM&#x003a6;s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Liang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, patients with T2D have increased CD36 expression on monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Sampson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies demonstrate a plausible role for altered expression of scavenger receptors, specifically CD36 and SR-A in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.</p><p>In summary, patients with T2D patients have an increased risk for developing atherosclerosis and the direct uptake of cholesteryl esters by macrophages following initiation of plaque development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Guyton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> represents an important mechanism for foam cell formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Mahlberg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the impact of diabetes on direct cholesteryl ester uptake by macrophages, which may play a role in plaque progression and perpetuation, has not been investigated. Therefore, we examined the hypothesis that macrophages from type-2 diabetic (<italic>db/db</italic>) mice have increased direct cholesteryl ester uptake and that this is mediated by CD36 and SR-A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>All cell culture reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) except as noted below.

Next, the role of SR-A in AcLDL was examined. The administration of anti-SR-A antibodies decreased AcLDL uptake by 50&#x00025; in <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;PerM&#x003a6;s and 48&#x00025; in <italic>db/db</italic> PerM&#x003a6;s indicating that the uptake of AcLDL is primarily mediated by SR-A rather than CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;B</xref>). These findings support work by Liang <italic>et al.</italic> which demonstrated that insulin resistance leads to increased cellular uptake with AcLDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Liang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, although, in a different mouse model of diabetes. Uptake of modified LDL by SRs and accumulation of CE is well characterized but the importance of SRs for direct CE uptake has yet to be investigated thoroughly investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Stangl1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to cholesterol deposition through lipoprotein metabolism, direct cholesterol and cholesteryl ester uptake has been demonstrated in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Lesnik1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Mahlberg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently it is uncertain whether diabetic macrophages have increased direct uptake of cholesteryl esters and how this may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, we show that PerM&#x003a6;s from <italic>db/db</italic> mice have increased uptake of cholesteryl esters at 4 hours post IP administration. McGookey <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-McGookey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> measured the half-life of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis into cholesterol and fatty acid subunits to be approximately 24 hours. Importantly, the fluorescent bodipy label is conjugated to the fatty acyl moiety of the cholesteryl ester indicating that an increase in intracellular fluorescent bodipy label at 4 hours directly relates to an increase in intracellular cholesteryl ester and not label alone. We have also confirmed that the median fluorescence of the bodipy-cholesteryl ester is linearly related to the mass of cholesteryl ester (data not shown). To confirm that cholesteryl esters were taken into the cell and not adhered to the cell surface, fluorescent microscopy was performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> demonstrates that cholesteryl esters were located intracellularly. It is possible that the cholesteryl ester injected IP formed liposomes with apoproteins present in the peritoneal fluid or interacted with other peritoneal factors that led to macrophage cholesteryl ester uptake. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, however, demonstrates that PerM&#x003a6;s from <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;and <italic>db/db</italic> mice cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> had a similar cholesteryl ester uptake profile as PerM&#x003a6;s <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, PerM&#x003a6;s directly take up cholesteryl esters independently from any intraperitoneal factors and in diabetes this uptake is increased. These findings are important because cholesteryl esters are found in fatty streaks and in the lipid core of atheromas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Guyton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> thus plaque based macrophages in diabetes may utilize this cholesteryl ester reservoir more readily to form foam cells than non-diabetic macrophages.</p><p>The next question to address was how does the diabetic state lead to increased cholesteryl ester uptake by PerM&#x003a6;s. Macrophages can ingest extracellular particles by receptor-mediated endocytosis, fluid-phase endocytosis and/or phagocytosis. In order to better define how diabetic macrophages ingest cholesteryl esters, large particle phagocytosis and fluid-phase endocytosis was examined via latex bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) uptake, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, neither of these mechanisms of ingestion differed between <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;and <italic>db/db</italic> mice. This indicated that increased cholesteryl ester uptake was likely mediated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Mahlberg <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated uptake of cholesteryl ester lipid droplets by a phagocytic process in J774 macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Mahlberg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and Stangl <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that overexpression of SR-BI led to an increase in nonlipoprotein cholesterol uptake by CHO cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Stangl1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it seemed likely that scavenger receptors may be involved in the uptake of cholesteryl esters, especially SR-BI. However, SR-BI expression was not detectable in peritoneal macrophages from either <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;or <italic>db/db</italic> mice. SR-BI was detected on macrophage like RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). Liang et al. recently demonstrated that insulin resistance leads to increased expression of CD36 and SR-A and cellular uptake of acetylated and oxidized LDL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Liang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3E</xref> supports these findings in a different animal model of diabetes. Additionally, we examined the relative contribution of CD36 and SR-A to the uptake of AcLDL in PerM&#x003a6;s from <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;and <italic>db/db</italic> mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> demonstrates that CD36 does not significantly contribute to the uptake of AcLDL in <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;PerM&#x003a6;s. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> shows that the administration of anti-CD36 specific blocking antibodies significantly decreased the uptake of AcLDL in <italic>db/db</italic> PerM&#x003a6;s. Since the same concentration of anti-CD36 antibody was able to decrease the uptake of AcLDL in the <italic>db/db</italic> PerM&#x003a6;s, it demonstrated that this antibody was effective as a blocking antibody. This finding may be an important phenotypic difference between the <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;and the <italic>db/db</italic> PerM&#x003a6;s, not only with respect to modified LDL uptake, but it may impact the innate immune response to ligands that interact with Toll-like-receptor 2 (TLR-2), since CD36 has been identified as costimulatory molecule for this TLR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Hoebe1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3C&#x02013;D</xref> extends these finding to show that CD36 and SR-A were linked to direct cholesteryl ester uptake in PerM&#x003a6;s. Furthermore, since both of these SRs are involved in direct cholesteryl ester uptake, increased expression of CD36 and SR-A observed on <italic>db/db</italic> mouse PerM&#x003a6;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000511-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>) appears responsible for their enhanced cholesteryl ester uptake by increasing the magnitude of uptake.</p><p>Lastly, the mechanism by which scavenger receptors mediate direct cholesteryl ester uptake has not been delineated. One possibility is that the cholesteryl esters interact with LDL or HDL in some fashion that then results in uptake through these already established mechanisms. However, neither co-administration of LDL nor HDL was able to reduce IP cholesteryl ester uptake by peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). This is not surprising given work done by Goldstein et al. demonstrating that unmodified LDL does not interact strongly with the scavenger receptor system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000511-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and that the HDL receptor, SR-BI, was not detected on PerM&#x003a6;s. Therefore, it appears that the scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-A mediate direct uptake of cholesteryl esters by macrophages through a mechanism distinct from LDL and HDL uptake. Although at this time more work is required to define the exact mechanism of direct cholesteryl ester uptake, our data here demonstrate that the diabetic state produces an increase in direct cholesteryl ester uptake by PerM&#x003a6;s, a finding that may prove significant in continuing the search to delineate the pathogenesis of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Janet D.
