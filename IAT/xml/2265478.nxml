While normal aging is the single greatest contributor, exposure to environmental toxins and therapeutic drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and antineoplastic agents are significant contributors. Genetic variation contributes markedly to differences in normal disease progression during aging and in susceptibility to ototoxic agents. Using the lateral line system of larval zebrafish, we developed an in vivo drug toxicity interaction screen to uncover genetic modulators of antibiotic-induced hair cell death and to identify compounds that confer protection. We have identified 5 mutations that modulate aminoglycoside susceptibility. Further characterization and identification of one protective mutant, <italic>sentinel</italic> (<italic>snl</italic>), revealed a novel conserved vertebrate gene. A similar screen identified a new class of drug-like small molecules, benzothiophene carboxamides, that prevent aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in zebrafish and in mammals.

Globally, over a third of older adults suffer from these conditions. Studies of both laboratory animals and humans reveal tremendous variation in hearing loss due to ageing as well as exogenous challenges such as ototoxic drugs and noise exposure, and show that this variability can be at least partially understood using genetic methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Gates1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Sill1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Rapid progress has been made using genetics to understand the molecular basis for congenital deafness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Friedman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but adult-onset hearing loss is poorly understood despite its overwhelming prevalence. There are several examples where genes underlying familial adult-onset hearing loss have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Inoue1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-McGuirt1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, but these are rare diseases that account for a very small fraction of the enormous variation of acquired or age-related hearing and balance problems. Understanding how hair cell death is genetically modified by intrinsic and extrinsic challenges should lead to identification of new therapeutic targets for prevention of inner ear damage.</p><p>The initial cellular basis for most hearing loss and a significant proportion of balance problems is injury and loss of the mechanosensory hair cells that reside in the inner ear and transduce mechanical signals into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the VIIIth cranial nerve. Treatments with aminoglycoside antibiotics or the cancer chemotherapeutics, cisplatin and carboplatin, often cause irreversible hearing loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Forge1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Nakashima1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> by killing hair cells. As with other forms of hearing loss, the effects of aminoglycoside exposure in humans and other outbred mammalian populations are widely variable and influenced by genetic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Versnel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, patients with mutations in mitochondrial genes, including mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA, show greatly enhanced sensitivity to aminoglycoside exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Prezant1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these mutations also have variable penetrance, and are influenced by nuclear genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Guan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in mitochondrial rRNA are consistent with a model that aminoglycoside ototoxicity is the result of effects on mitochondrial translation similar to the antibiotic effects of prokaryotic translation inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Guan2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacological approaches toward the prevention of hearing loss due to therapeutic drugs or chronic exposure to noise have centered primarily on antioxidants and cJUN kinase (JunK) inhibitors. While several studies support the idea that antioxidants or JunK inhibitors can limit aminoglycoside toxicity and cisplatin ototoxicity, the literature is complex and often the protection is dose dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Rybak1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Cheng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Target based drug discovery is limited, however, by our understanding of the cellular pathways contributing to the inner ear pathology, and by the lack of methods to do broad screening of potential candidates.</p><p>The lateral line system of aquatic vertebrates is composed of mechanosensory organs on the surface of the head and body, and is used to detect variations in water pressure. Lateral line hair cells and their underlying support cells are organized into rosette-like clusters called neuromasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-DamblyChaudiere1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Like mammalian inner ear hair cells, the lateral line hair cells of zebrafish are killed by exposure to chemicals including aminoglycosides and cisplatin in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Harris1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Ou1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

We use this approach to identify 2 new pharmacological agents and 5 new mutations that protect against aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death. We describe a screen for small drug-like molecules that protect zebrafish lateral line hair cells and validate effectiveness of these newly discovered protective compounds in the mammalian inner ear. We report the initial results of an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic screen for modulators of hair cell susceptibility to ototoxic drug exposure, including the identification of one such gene. These mutations provide an entry point for determining which molecular pathways can be modulated to alter drug response in the hair cells. Variation in these molecules may underlie differential susceptibility to drugs clinically and suggest likely points of regulation for prophylactic treatments in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Hair cells of the lateral line neuromasts in larval zebrafish form an easily identifiable rosette-like cluster that can be labeled with a variety of vital dyes and assessed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000020-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Screening was initially carried out by labeling hair cells of 5 dpf larvae with a combination of a nuclear dye and a cytoplasmic dye (Yo-Pro-1 and FM 1-43, respectively), then pretreating larvae in 96-well tissue culture plates for 1 hour to a cocktail of five compounds and then exposing them to 200 &#x000b5;M neomycin. When protection was observed, the 5 potential contributors were evaluated singly to determine the active compound. Two compounds exhibited reliable and robust protection of hair cells from neomycin.

However, the large amount of variation in hearing and balance problems resulting from environmental or age-related challenges among normal individuals is neither well documented nor well understood.

We hypothesize that alterations in unidentified components of the network of cellular pathways involved in cell death and cell survival would confer resistance to ototoxic compounds. The absence of secondary phenotypes in some of our mutants supports the idea that variation affecting drug response can exist without other outward manifestation. Identification of the human orthologs of these genes may provide candidates involved in the variability underlying human hearing and balance disorders.</p><p>Our data suggest that hair cell death after neomycin treatment can involve multiple signaling pathways. Several mutations confer only partial protection against neomycin exposure. Although in some cases this might result from mutations that cause only partial loss of function, in the case of <italic>sentinel</italic> we suspect that the mutation is a functional null. The mutation introduces a stop codon early in the coding sequence and before the highly conserved regions. In addition, mRNA levels are reduced in <italic>sentinel</italic> mutants, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay. Together these observations suggest that gene function is completely lost, while protection against hair cell loss is only partial. Similarly, only partial protection is observed after treatment with maximal doses of PROTO-1 or PROTO-2. The idea that there are several possible responses to aminoglycosides is consistent with our previous observed variations in ultrastructural changes after aminoglycoside exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Owens1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>sentinel</italic> mutation also genetically distinguishes between aminoglycoside-induced and cisplatin-induced death; mutant animals are resistant to neomycin but still sensitive to cisplatin.

Both modulators offer only partial protection against neomycin, offer no protection against cisplatin, and do not affect entry of FM1-43 or labeled aminoglycoside. Together these results suggest they work in common pathways. To test this idea, we performed epistasis experiments treating wildtype and mutant animals. While the effects of <italic>sentinel</italic> and PROTO-1 are not additive, there is a small but significant increase in protection when combined, suggesting that they may be accessing different cellular pathways to promote cell survival.

No functional information is known about any of the <italic>sentinel</italic> orthologs.

However, the function of this domain has been demonstrated in only a few of the many proteins that contain it.

Other members of this group include molecules related to intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)-related proteins associated with auditory function.

Hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line and inner ear are also ciliated, bearing a microtubule-based kinocilium in addition to the actin-based stereocilia either throughout life (lateral line and vestibular epithelia) or during development (auditory epithelia/cochlea). However, the broad distribution of <italic>sentinel</italic> mRNA and lack of hair cell functional defects in mutants suggest that the gene product does not have a role specific to hair cells.</p><p>In addition to identifying possible therapeutic approaches, unbiased small molecule screening may reveal new molecular pathways that regulate hair cell death.

Baskets were constructed from the tops of 50 ml Falcon tubes in which the center of the lids were replaced with meshing. All treatment and wash volumes are 6 ml unless otherwise indicated. Hair cells of larvae were labeled with the following dyes: 1) FM 1-43FX (n-(3,3-ammoniumpropyl-dimethyl)ammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino)styryl) pyridinium trichloride), an aminated derivative of FM1-43 (n-(3-triethylyammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino)-styryl) pyridinium dibromide Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene , OR) by immersing free swimming larvae in 3 &#x000b5;M FM 1-43FX in embryo medium for 30 or 45 s, followed by three successive rinses in embryo medium; 2) Yo-Pro-1 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) at 3 &#x000b5;M for 1 hour followed by 3 rinses to selectively stain hair cell nuclei; or 3) DASPEI (0.005&#x00025; final concentration, (2-{4-(dimethylamino)styryl}-N-ethylpyridinium iodide, Invitrogen Molecular Probes) in the final 15 minutes of the recovery period, and rinsed twice to brightly label mitochondria-rich hair cell cytoplasm.

Drug-like compounds from the Diverset E library (ChemBridge,San Diego, California), dissolved in 0.05&#x00025; DMSO to a final concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M, were aliquoted into each well. Fish were incubated at 28.5&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. Neomycin was then introduced into each well at a final concentration of 200 &#x000b5;M and fish were incubated for an additional hour. Larvae were anesthetized with MS222 for immobilization. Visual assessment of hair cell integrity was performed in vivo using an inverted epifluorescent microscope. This allowed examination of the whole animal on the side of its body facing the objective and thus rapid evaluation of many neuromasts (&#x0223c;20). In each row of the 96-well plate both positive (neomycin treated only) and negative (no neomycin) control animals were used for comparison to compound treatment. The entire plate of 96-well plate with 80 test wells and 16 positive or negative control wells was evaluated within one hour. Although intermediate responses were observed for some drugs, only those exhibiting robust protection were pursued for continued evaluation at this time.</p><p>To quantify changes in the hair cell response, hair cell survival was determined by counting the surviving hair cells from four neuromast, SO1, SO2, OC1 and O1 for 10&#x02013;20 fish (i.e. 40&#x02013;80 neuromasts).

Hybrid &#x0002a;AB/WIK carriers of the hair cell modulator were then identified and crossed to produce progeny for marker analysis. At 5 dpf larvae were exposed to neomycin as described for the initial screen. To ensure accurate phenotyping, only individuals with the highest and lowest DASPEI staining scores after 200 &#x000b5;M neomycin treatment were retained as mutant and wildtype, respectively. For bulk segregant analysis, DNA was pooled from 20 wildtype or mutant individuals. Distribution of markers was compared to DNA from fin clips of &#x0002a;AB/WIK parents and founder grandparents. Microsatellite markers for each chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000020-Shimoda1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> were amplified by PCR and evaluated for cosegregation with mutant phenotypes.
