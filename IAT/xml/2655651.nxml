A missense mutation in the <italic>Napa</italic> gene that results in the substitution of a methionine for isoleucine at position 105 (M105I) of &#x003b1;SNAP has been detected in these animals. &#x003b1;SNAP is a ubiquitous protein that plays a key role in membrane fusion and exocytosis. In this study, we found that male hyh mice with a mild phenotype produced morphologically normal and motile sperm, but had a strongly reduced fertility. When stimulated with progesterone or A23187 (a calcium ionophore), sperm from these animals had a defective acrosome reaction. It has been reported that the M105I mutation affects the expression but not the function of the protein. Consistent with an hypomorphic phenotype, the testes and epididymides of hyh mice had low amounts of the mutated protein. In contrast, sperm had &#x003b1;SNAP levels indistinguishable from those found in wild type cells, suggesting that the mutated protein is not fully functional for acrosomal exocytosis. Corroborating this possibility, addition of recombinant wild type &#x003b1;SNAP rescued exocytosis in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm, while the mutant protein was ineffective. Moreover, addition of recombinant &#x003b1;SNAP. M105I inhibited acrosomal exocytosis in permeabilized human and wild type mouse sperm. We conclude that the M105I mutation affects the expression and also the function of &#x003b1;SNAP, and that a fully functional &#x003b1;SNAP is necessary for acrosomal exocytosis, a key event in fertilization.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular transport of macromolecules is an essential process in cell physiology. Most steps of this process require apposition and fusion of membrane-bound compartments. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein &#x003b1; (&#x003b1;SNAP) is a ubiquitous protein present in all eukaryotic cells playing a key role in membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Whiteheart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It participates in the activation of SNAP receptors (SNAREs), which are membrane associated proteins necessary for membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Jahn1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. SNAREs localizing in the same compartment form cis SNARE complexes, which are inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Wickner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b1;SNAP binds to these complexes and recruits N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), an ATPase that catalyzes the disruption of the complexes rendering active monomeric SNARE proteins. Activated SNAREs in the compartments that are going to fuse form trans complexes (i.e., SNAREs in one membrane bound to complementary SNAREs in the opposite membrane) bringing the two membranes in close proximity and promoting lipid mixing and membrane fusion.</p><p>Regulated secretion requires the fusion of exocytic granules with the plasma membrane and depends on &#x003b1;SNAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Xu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Barnard1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular we have documented that this protein is necessary for acrosomal exocytosis in human sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Tomes1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The acrosome is a large membrane-limited granule that overlies the nucleus of mature sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Yanagimachi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. When in contact with the extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte -named zona pellucida-, the spermatozoon undergoes acrosomal exocytosis. This secretory process releases a set of enzymes that facilitates the penetration of the zona pellucida and exposes membrane domains in the sperm that are important for fertilization. Interestingly, in resting sperm SNAREs are engaged in cis complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-DeBlas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon initiation of the acrosomal exocytosis, &#x003b1;SNAP -in association with NSF- disassembles cis SNARE complexes that can then form trans complexes and drive membrane fusion.</p><p>Many diseases have been associated to mutations in proteins involved in intracellular transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Gissen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

A possible explanation for this observation is that the low concentrations of &#x003b1;SNAP in the testis and epididymis alter the normal maturation of the exocytic machinery of the sperm. Hence, even with a normal quantity of the protein, the sperm may be unable to exocytose. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether we could restore exocytosis by adding wild type &#x003b1;SNAP to sperm from SP mice. To this end, we set up a plasma membrane-permeabilized mouse sperm model similar to the one we routinely use for human sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Diaz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Yunes1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, upon stimulation with calcium, an additional 18&#x00025; of the cells reacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004963-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), indicating that the treatment did not inactivate the exocytic machinery.

However, the previous Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence images showed that these cells have normal levels of &#x003b1;SNAP, suggesting that the M105I mutation affects directly the function of the protein. To test this possibility, a recombinant &#x003b1;SNAP.M105I protein was produced, purified, and added to permeabilized sperm from SP mice.

Hyh mouse harboring a point mutation in the <italic>Napa</italic> gen coding for &#x003b1;SNAP is the first example of a fertility problem directly related to a factor necessary for the general mechanism of regulated secretion that is specifically affecting the acrosome reaction. Mutant mice with a mild clinical and neuropathological phenotype are able to copulate and the amount of live and motile sperm that they produce is similar to that of wild type mice; however, they have a much reduced fertility. Even when fertilization was assessed in vitro, sperm from hyh mice behave poorly as compared with sperm from wild type mice. Notwithstanding, the difference between genotypes was less dramatic in the in vitro assays than in the mating studies. Thus, other defects not assessed by in vitro fertilization might contribute to this phenotype. In this context, although SP mice present a preserved general motor activity and are able to copulate, they do have gait and equilibrium impairments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Batiz1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> that could affect the frequency and efficiency of copulation.</p><p>Acrosome reaction experiments indicate that the basic problem in sperm from hyh mice is a reduced capacity to undergo exocytosis upon stimulation with progesterone and even with a calcium ionophore. The fact that exogenous &#x003b1;SNAP can rescue acrosomal exocytosis in these cells is a strong evidence that the principal defect is a malfunction in the endogenous protein.

These observations, together with the fact that the hyh mouse presents a diminished amount of &#x003b1;SNAP in brain, have lead to the conclusion that the alteration in brain development in these animals is principally due to an insufficient amount of protein and not to a malfunction of the mutated molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Chae1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our observations in sperm point to a different mechanism. We confirmed that the mutated protein has an altered steady state distribution in several tissues; the levels of &#x003b1;SNAP in testis and epididymis were significantly lower in the mutated animals. In contrast, we found normal amount of this protein in sperm. Therefore, it was unlikely that the defect in acrosomal exocytosis was due to a decreased amount of &#x003b1;SNAP. These observations suggested that the mutated protein has some intrinsic malfunction. This was confirmed by the fact that the mutated protein was less effective in restoring exocytosis than the wild type protein when added to permeabilized sperm from hyh mouse. Moreover, the mutated protein was inhibitory when added to normal mouse and human sperm. It is worth noticing that an excess of wild type &#x003b1;SNAP is also inhibitory, but at much higher concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004963-Tomes1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.
