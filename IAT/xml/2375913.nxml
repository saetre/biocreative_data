PARP-1 might modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity leading to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins. Recently, we have shown that PARP-1 is activated during T cell activation. However, the proposed role of PARP-1 in reprogramming T cell gene expression upon activation remains largely unexplored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study we use oligonucleotide microarray analysis to gain more insight into the role played by PARP-1 during the gene expression reprogramming that takes place in T cells upon activation with anti-CD3 stimulation alone, or in combination with anti-CD28 co-stimulation. We have identified several groups of genes with expression modulated by PARP-1. The expression of 129 early-response genes to anti-CD3 seems to be regulated by PARP-1 either in a positive (45 genes) or in a negative manner (84 genes). Likewise, in the presence of co-stimulation (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation), the expression of 203 genes is also regulated by PARP-1 either up (173 genes) or down (30 genes). Interestingly, PARP-1 deficiency significantly alters expression of genes associated with the immune response such as chemokines and genes involved in the Th1/Th2 balance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides new insights into changes in gene expression mediated by PARP-1 upon T cell activation. Pathway analysis of PARP-1 as a nuclear signalling molecule in T cells would be of relevance for the future development of new therapeutic approaches targeting PARP-1 in the acquired immune response.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>T lymphocyte activation requires recognition through the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex of foreign peptides presented by self-MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells in context with co-stimulatory signals mediated by co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The concurrent ligation of these receptors initiates signal transduction pathways that lead to the induction of a complex array of kinases and phosphatases, and the downstream activation of transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B, AP-1 and NFAT which play a critical role in reprogramming gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The overall result is the proliferation, differentiation and activation of T cells. However, T cells stimulated via the TCR/CD3 complex alone do not become fully activated and can become anergic or even apoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Transcriptional changes during T cell stimulation are tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms involving not only interactions between a complex network of transcription factors and cis-regulatory DNA regions, but also epigenetic changes in chromatin structure including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in the regulation of gene expression during development and in response to specific cellular signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] working at different levels. PARP-1 belongs to a family of enzymes (PARP) that, using NAD<sup>+ </sup>as a substrate, synthesize and transfer homopolymers of ADP-ribose onto glutamic acid residues of acceptor proteins mainly involved in chromatin structure and DNA metabolism. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is terminated by the release of extensively poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (negatively charged) PARP molecules from DNA. ADP-ribose polymers are then subjected to degradation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is therefore an immediate, covalent, but transient post-translational modification of cellular proteins playing and important role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression under physiological conditions in which the integrity of the DNA is maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PARP-1 activity, responsible for almost 90% of poly(ADP-ribosy)lation in the cell, might modulate gene expression through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of its partner proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins such as transcription factors. Regulation by PARP-1 has been described for different transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], E2F-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], C/EBPalpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], YY-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], RNA polymerase II-associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and NFAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, PARP-1 and poly(ADP-rybosyl)ation play a critical role in the expression control of multiple NF-&#x003ba;B dependent genes involved in the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, different studies have analysed the effects of PARP-1 deficiency on gene expression in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], embryonic stem cell lines and liver tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] at the genome-wide level.</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that PARP-1 is activated during T cell activation, modulating the activity of the NFAT transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present study we use oligonucleotide microarray analysis to gain more insight into the role played by PARP-1 during the gene expression reprogramming that takes place in T cells upon activation with anti-CD3-stimulation alone, or in combination with anti-CD28 co-stimulation. These two stimulation conditions would allow us to analyse the role of PARP-1 in the modulation of genes upon NFAT activation under conditions in which both AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B are fully activated (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 co-stimulation) or poorly activated (anti-CD3 alone). T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 develop an overlapping transcription network with anti-CD3 stimulated T lymphocytes, but co-stimulatory signalling quantitatively alters components of the TCR/CD3 complex-induced signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, PARP-1 could synergize with different transcription factors in order to stimulate or repress gene expression in both stimulation conditions. We have identified several groups of genes, whose expression is modulated by PARP-1 either in a positive or a negative manner. Interestingly, PARP-1 deficiency significantly alters expression of genes associated with the immune response such as chemokines and genes involved in the Th1/Th2 balance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Transcriptional programs in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>vs Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells in response to antigen receptor stimulation</title><p>In order to study the role of PARP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of T cells, we have analysed the gene expression profiles in splenic T cells derived from PARP-1-wild-type (Parp-1<sup>+/+</sup>) and PARP-1-deficient (Parp-1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice under both resting and antigen receptor stimulation conditions, using oligonucleotide microarray technology. Total RNA prepared from resting or stimulated cells was purified, reverse transcribed and amplified by in vitro transcription in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides, and the labeled cRNA was hybridized on Affymetrix oligonucleotide chips (murine genome 430A 2.0) containing over 22600 probe sets representing transcripts from over 14000 well-characterized mouse genes. Only those differences in RNA abundance that were reproducible in independent experiments with different batches of cells and represented by a change of 1.5-fold or greater (p-value &#x0003c; 0.05) were considered.</p><p>At a basal level, we found 93 genes (0.66%) that differed in their expression between Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells. This percentage is quite similar to the change in the basal expression level observed between primary Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The expression of 50 of these genes in T cells was higher in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>than in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells (negatively regulated by PARP-1), while the expression of 43 genes, obviously including the Parp-1 gene itself, was lower in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>compared to Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells (positively regulated by PARP-1) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In addition, all data are deposited in the ArrayExpress database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with accession number E-MEXP-1237. We did not observe genes overlapping between the report on primary fibroblast and our present results. Similar absence of overlap has been reported recently by Ogino et al, between fibroblasts and ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

Short stimulation times have been shown to induce important changes in T cells gene expression programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CD3 stimulation modulated a significant number of early-response genes (1168) (8.3% of all genes represented in the microarray) in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells, up-regulating 755 and concomitantly down-regulating 413 transcripts, while in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells 958 of genes (6.8%) were modulated, up-regulating 656 genes and down-regulating 302 transcripts. On the other hand, CD3 stimulation in the context of CD28 co-stimulatory signal, modulated a significant number of early-response genes (1085) (7.8%) in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells, up-regulating 722 and concomitantly down-regulating 363 transcripts, while in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells 1137 of genes (8.1%) were modulated, up-regulating 669 genes and down-regulating 468 transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of PARP-1-dependent genes during early T cell activation</title><p>Transcriptional changes during T lymphocyte activation have also been characterized in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a discussion of all of the observed changes and their biological implications. However, comparison of the gene expression programs evoked by activation in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/-</sup>T cells shows that 129 early-response genes to anti-CD3 seem to be PARP-1-dependent (fold-change &#x0003e;1.5; F-test p-value&#x0003c;0.05) and regulated by PARP-1 either in a positive (higher expression in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>than in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells) (45 genes) or in a negative manner (higher expression in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>than in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells) (84 genes) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Likewise, in the presence of co-stimulation (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAbs stimulation), the expression of 203 genes is also regulated by PARP-1 either in a positive (173 genes) or in a negative manner (30 genes) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In addition, these data are listed in the Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. Interestingly, response to anti-CD3 alone resulted in a higher number of genes negatively regulated by PARP-1 than those regulated positively. However, anti-CD3 stimulation in the presence of anti-CD28 co-stimulation produces the opposite effect, favouring expression of genes regulated positively by PARP-1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results could be related with a different role of PARP-1 in the regulation of specific transcription factors involved in those signalling pathways. Thus, T cell stimulation via the TCR/CD3 complex alone seem to be sufficient for NFAT but not for optimal NF-&#x003ba;B or AP-1 activation. We have recently demonstrated that PARP-1 inhibition seems to modulate in an opposite manner NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcriptional activity in T cells, improving NFAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activities (data not shown). However, the complexity of the NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B families, together with the regulation of genes by both transcriptional factor members precludes ascribing the described PARP-1-dependent genes to a unique and direct effect on NFAT or NF-&#x003ba;B dependent transcriptional activity.</p><p>Twenty one genes were dependent on PARP-1 for response to both anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Eleven of these genes were positively regulated by PARP-1 while 4 of them were negatively regulated by PARP-1 in response to either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation. However, 4 genes (Cxcl9, Set, Pim1, and Sfrs2) were regulated positively by PARP-1 in response to CD3 stimulation alone, but the same genes were regulated negatively by PARP-1 in the presence of co-stimulation through CD28. Likewise, 2 genes (Itga6 and Parp-12) were regulated negatively by PARP-1 in response to CD3 stimulation but positively by PARP-1 in response to anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We confirmed expression changes for some genes by Real-time PCR. Although there were differences in the absolute fold-change values detected by the two methods, PCR results correlated well with the differential gene expression data produced using Affymetrix GeneChips (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression profile analysis of Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>activated T cells</bold>.

In addition, T cells purified from Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>mice were stimulated for 24 hours with anti-CD3, alone or in combination with anti-CD28 mAb, and IL-4 released in the supernatants was measured by ELISA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results verified the effect of PARP-1 deficiency on the expression levels of IL-4 obtained at the mRNA level in the microarray and Real-time PCR experiments. Overall, our data suggest an important role for PARP-1 in the regulation of IL-4 expression. IL-4 is a major Th2 effector cytokine and a key promoter of Th2 development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Th1 and Th2 cells are characterized by the types of cytokines that they produced. IFN-gamma is the hallmark of Th1 cells which are involved in the immune response against intracellular microoganisms. On the other hand, Th2 effector cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 being involved in immune response to helminth infections as well as to IgE-dependent hypersensitivity reactions. Interestingly, the expression of IFN-gamma mRNA seem to be increased in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells. Expression of several Th1 chemokines such as Xcl1, Ccl4 and Ccl9 seem to be also increased en Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells in response to anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, the absence of PARP-1 seems to bias T cell response to a Th1 phenotype. However, our microarray data did not reveal any difference in the expression of other Th2 cytokines such as IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 between Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>and Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>T cells, suggesting that PARP-1 could specifically control IL-4 gene expression which might act on Th1 differentiation by supressing IL-12bR expression and IFN-gamma secretion. Previous studies have demonstrated the requirement of Slam in IL-4 production by T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similarly, Irf4 gene expression was also found to be higher in Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>than in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells after stimulation with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Irf4 seems to enhance IL-4, but not IL-2 promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Whether PARP-1 controls IL-4 expression through an interaction with cis-regulatory elements or chromatin remodelling at IL-4 locus remains to be elucidated.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>IL-4 production in both Parp-1<sup>+/+ </sup>and Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells</bold>.

These discrepancies might be associated to side effects of the different inhibitors used in these studies. Further studies are therefore needed to determine whether PARP-1 is a new player in the epigenetic regulation of IL-4 by T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or is involved on the immune response associated with a Th2 bias. Autoinmunity seem to be associated to an immune response bised to the differentiation and activation of Th1 and/or Th17 effectors T cells. PARP-1 seems to positively control Ifi203 expression even in the absence or presence of CD28-stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and data not shown). In sharp contrast, Ifi202b was preferentially expressed in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>stimulated T cells. A high expression of Ifi202b and a low expression of Ifi203 and was also observed in B6.Nba2 autoimmune prone mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, PARP-1 could play a role in the consequence of autorecognition acting through Ifi203 and Ifi202b gene regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>T cell proliferation is impaired in the absence of PARP-1</title><p>T cell proliferation is a hallmark of T cell activation. To determine whether PARP-1-dependent transcriptional regulation influences T cell function, we analyzed the proliferation response of Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>and control T cells after in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb alone or in combination with anti-CD28 mAb. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> shows a modest, but statistically significant, decrease in T cell proliferation upon stimulation in Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>compared to control cells while T cells from both genotypes show similar susceptibility to death upon activation suggesting an intrinsic defect in proliferation in the absence of PARP-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The role of PARP-1 in apoptosis is variable, depending on the stimuli and the type of cells. Oliver et al. reported that primary bone marrow Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>cells are extremely sensitive to apoptosis induced by an alkylating agent but not by a topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 or by interleukin-3 removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, Wang et al. reported that Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>cells lymphoid cells display normal apoptotic sensitivity after treatment with various apoptotic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Thus, the reduced expression of Slamf1 and Rel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] genes in the absence of PARP-1 might be related with the reduced proliferative response of Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides new insights into the role of PARP-1 in T cell activation by modulating gene expression. Using a microarray based approach, we identified 129 genes whose expression in response to anti-CD3 stimulation is PARP-1 dependent. Likewise, expression of 203 genes upon anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation was also dependent of PARP-1. By using automatic functional annotation of PARP-1-dependent genes we identified GO terms that were significantly over-represented in each activation condition (anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 in combination with anti-CD28), including a group of genes involved in lymph immune response. Functional dissection should help to unravel the remaining mysteries of PARP-1 as a signalling molecule at the nuclear level in T cells and might be essential for future development of new therapeutic approaches targeting PARP-1 in the acquired immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The generation of Parp-1<sup>-/- </sup>mouse strain (129/Sv &#x000d7; C57BL/6J) has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Total RNA was isolated from cells by using a Rneasy Total RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (8 &#x003bc;g) was subjected to reverse transcription with Superscript (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), using a T7-(dT)<sub>24 </sub>primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. Biotinylated complementary RNA was made from 1 &#x003bc;g of cDNA and then fragmented to approximately 50&#x02013;100 nucleotides, following Affymetrix's instructions. 15 micrograms of the in vitro transcripts with appropriate controls and spikes were hybridized for 16 h at 45&#x000b0;C with constant rotation at 60 rpm to an Affymetrix MOE-430A 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which contains probes for 22600 known genes and expressed sequences tags (ESTs).
