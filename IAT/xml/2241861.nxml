TWINKLE displays striking sequence similarity to the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein (gp4), which is a bi-functional primase-helicase required at the phage DNA replication fork. The N-terminal domain of human TWINKLE contains some of the characteristic sequence motifs found in the N-terminal primase domain of the T7 gp4, but other important motifs are missing. TWINKLE is not an active primase <italic>in vitro</italic> and the functional role of the N-terminal region has remained elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that the N-terminal part of TWINKLE is required for efficient binding to single-stranded DNA. Truncations of this region reduce DNA helicase activity and mitochondrial DNA replisome processivity. We also find that the gp4 and TWINKLE are functionally distinct. In contrast to the phage protein, TWINKLE binds to double-stranded DNA. Moreover, TWINKLE forms stable hexamers even in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or NTPs, which suggests that an accessory protein, a helicase loader, is needed for loading of TWINKLE onto the circular mtDNA genome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA helicases catalyze unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), a process energetically coupled to nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. This group of enzymes is involved in processes assuring genome stability such as DNA replication, repair and recombination. Pathogenic mutations disturbing helicase function can affect these basic cellular mechanisms and lead to human disease, including cancer and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). TWINKLE is the only known DNA helicase involved in replication of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mutations in the TWINKLE gene can cause autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia (adPEO), a neuromuscular disorder associated with multiple deletions in mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). TWINKLE is a hexameric helicase that can unwind short stretches (&#x0003c;20 bp) of dsDNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Overexpression of TWINKLE variants containing amino acid substitutions in the helicase active site leads to mtDNA depletion in both human and drosophila cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Together with the mtDNA polymerase gamma (POL&#x003b3;) and the mitochondrial ssDNA-binding protein (mtSSB), TWINKLE forms a processive replication apparatus, a replisome that can synthesize ssDNA molecules of up to 16 kb, roughly corresponding to the size of the human mtDNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Homology searches revealed a striking sequence similarity between TWINKLE and the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein (gp4), a bi-functional primase-helicase required at the replication fork of bacteriophage T7 DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that gp4 assembles as both ring-shaped hexamers and heptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). ssDNA binds within the central hole of the gp4 hexamer and contributes to high processivity of translocation. The gp4 can be divided functionally and structurally into two distinct regions. The N-terminal part of the protein harbors a primase domain (residues 1&#x02013;245) and the C-terminal part possesses DNA helicase activity (residues 272&#x02013;566). A 26-amino acid linker region required for hexamer formation separates the two functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The C-terminal helicase domain includes the conserved sequence motifs characteristic of the RecA/DnaB family of replicative helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and is responsible for DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis, translocation along DNA and DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Moreover, 17 amino acids at the very C-terminus are involved in physical interactions between the helicase and T7 DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The N-terminal primase domain of gp4 comprises a functional Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger and an RNA polymerase domain that act together to synthesize ribonucleotide primers required for initiation of DNA synthesis. The primase domain also stimulates primer utilization by the T7 DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the gp4 protein and related ring helicases, TWINKLE forms hexameric complexes in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). TWINKLE can also be divided into three regions, an N-terminal primase-like domain, a short linker region and a C-terminal DNA helicase domain. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that TWINKLE is an active DNA primase in most eukaryotes, but that this activity has been lost in metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In support of this notion, we have not been able to identify a primase activity in purified human TWINKLE (unpublished data). Human TWINKLE contains primase motifs II and III, but has no discernible Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger motif (motif I), which in gp4 is involved in nucleotide sequence recognition as well as in transfer of the primer to the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Also primase motifs IV&#x02013;VI are well conserved in human TWINKLE, with the notable exception of essential amino acids involved in binding to Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Therefore, even in the absence of a primase activity, the N-terminal region still contains many conserved primase motifs and others have suggested that this region may play an important role in mtDNA replication, e.g. by stimulating primer utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In the present article, we have investigated the role of the N-terminal domain of human TWINKLE using deletion mutagenesis. We also addressed the role of TWINKY, a splice variant of TWINKLE lacking a portion of the C-terminal helicase domain. Our results revealed that the N-terminal domain is required for efficient binding to ssDNA and for the DNA unwinding activity of TWINKLE. The N-terminal domain is not absolutely required for mtDNA replisome function, but is needed for the formation of long DNA products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>TWINKLE, mtSSB, POL&#x003b3;A and POL&#x003b3;B were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A 6&#x000d7; His-tagged version of wild-type (wt) TWINKLE cloned into pBacPAK9 was used to generate the truncated forms of TWINKLE by PCR. Plasmids containing the &#x00394;1&#x02013;121, &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 and TWINKY truncated genes were sequenced and used to prepare recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus as described in the BacPAK manual (Clontech).

Both &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 and &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 could form a larger complex with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to a hexameric conformation. The stability of the &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 complex was, however, somewhat reduced since the protein peak was broader and somewhat less defined than for the wt TWINKLE protein. In contrast, TWINKY and &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 migrated with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to a monomeric conformation. We verified that our gel-filtration analysis could correctly distinguish between the different oligomeric forms of TWINKLE by using GEMMA to estimate the molecular weight of &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 and &#x00394;372&#x02013;684. In this analysis, the observed molecular weight for &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 was &#x0223c;369 kDa, in nice agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 382 kDa for a &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 protein hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The observed molecular weight for &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 was 38 kDa, in close correspondence to the predicted molecular weight of 36.9 kDa for a &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 protein monomer. Our data therefore suggest that even if the C-terminal domain is essential for oligomerization, the N-terminal domain also contributes to proper hexamerization. Since TWINKY could not hexamerize, we investigated whether it could form mixed hexamers with TWINKLE. We co-expressed the two proteins in insect cells and loaded them onto the gel-filtration column. The greatest proportion of TWINKLE eluted as a stable hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The majority of TWINKY migrated as a monomer, but a very small fraction of the protein appeared to eluate together with the wt hexamer. We conclude that TWINKY is a monomer in solution and unable to interact and form higher order stoichiometric complexes with the wt TWINKLE protein. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>GEMMA analysis of TWINKLE proteins.

EMSAs were performed with ssDNA and dsDNA probes of different lengths (15, 30 and 45-nt) and titrations were conduced with increasing amounts of protein. TWINKLE could not interact with a short 15-nt ssDNA probe, but efficiently interacted with a dsDNA probe of similar size. TWINKLE efficiently shifted longer ssDNA and dsDNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).

To stimulate ssDNA binding, all experiments were performed in the presence of ATP. We used a constant protein concentration and increased the amount of unlabeled competitor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Surprisingly, the ssDNA probe bound to TWINKLE was competed off by increasing amounts of dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;12). In contrast, the binding of TWINKLE to the dsDNA probe was unaffected by the presence of increasing amounts of the ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;6). This contrasts with the behavior of the gp4 protein, which binds tightly and preferably to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we monitored ssDNA and dsDNA-binding activities for our truncated TWINKLE variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). TWINKY and &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 did not display any ssDNA or dsDNA-binding activity. The lack of DNA-binding activity is most likely explained by the monomeric conformation of these two proteins. Other hexameric helicases are also unable to bind ssDNA in their monomeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 protein showed reduced binding to both ssDNA and dsDNA, but the effect on ssDNA was much more severe. The &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 protein bound to dsDNA with the same efficiency as wt TWINKLE, but we observed a decrease in ssDNA binding. Our experiments suggest that the C-terminal helicase domain is responsible for DNA binding, but that the N-terminal domain specifically contributes to the ssDNA-binding activity.</p></sec><sec><title>ATP hydrolysis activity of the wt and truncated TWINKLE proteins</title><p>Measurements of ATP hydrolysis were performed both in the absence and presence of single-stranded M13 DNA. The DNA-independent ATPase activity provides information about the intrinsic ability of the protein to hydrolyze ATP, whereas measurement of ATPase activity in the presence of ssDNA reflects the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). TWINKLE has a high intrinsic ATPase activity, which was stimulated about 2-fold in the presence of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Addition of linear dsDNA did not stimulate the TWINKLE associated ATPase activity (data not shown). In the absence of DNA, the &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 protein hydrolyzed ATP at a rate very similar to that of the WT protein, &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 showed a marked decrease in activity, whereas TWINKY and &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 were completely inactive. TWINKY and &#x00394;372&#x02013;684 remained inactive in the presence of ssDNA, whereas &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 and especially &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 displayed a reduced ssDNA-dependent stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The N-terminal region of TWINKLE is apparently not absolutely required for ATP hydrolysis, but deletions in this region have a strong negative effect on the levels of ATPase activity and also decrease ssDNA-dependent stimulation. This finding is consistent with the observation that both &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 and &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 have a reduced affinity for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>ATP hydrolysis by the WT and mutant TWINKLE proteins.

Thus, we examined helicase activity of the truncated TWINKLE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). To prepare the substrate used in this assay, a 60-nt oligonucleotide was annealed to M13ssDNA, to form a 20-bp duplex and a 40-nt 5&#x02032;-tail. We found that the relative unwinding activity displayed by the wt and truncated proteins was essentially proportional to the activities observed in the ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D) and in the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 protein was able to unwind DNA nearly as efficiently as the wt TWINKLE, whereas the &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 protein showed a significantly reduced helicase activity.

We decided to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain for DNA synthesis on a duplex DNA template. To this end, we formed a template for DNA replication by annealing a 90-nt oligonucleotide to a 70-nt ssDNA mini-circle. The template contained a replication fork for loading the replication machinery, a 50-bp dsDNA region and a free 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl terminus that could act as a primer for DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Once initiated, leading-strand DNA synthesis coupled to continuous unwinding of the double-stranded template could in principle progress indefinitely. We have previously reported that POL&#x003b3; can use the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl terminus on this mini-circle template and initiate DNA synthesis, but that the enzyme fails to elongate through double-stranded regions and only forms a 110-nt product. To elongate through the dsDNA region, the POL&#x003b3; requires the DNA strand unwinding activity of the TWINKLE helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In agreement with our previous observations, there was no DNA synthesis in the absence of TWINKLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lanes 1, 3 and 5). The addition of wt TWINKLE to the reaction led to a marked increase in DNA synthesis, and allowed the formation of ssDNA products of up to 10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 2). The &#x00394;1&#x02013;121 protein was able to support DNA synthesis at almost wt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 4). In contrast, &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 could only support synthesis of shorter DNA products of &#x0223c;1 kb. Addition of higher concentrations of &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 led to an increase in DNA synthesis, but had no effect on the length of the DNA products (data not shown). Addition of &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 could also severely reduce mtDNA replication in the presence wt TWINKLE, arguing for &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 being correctly folded and able to compete with the wt protein for binding to the replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Our data therefore demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of TWINKLE is required for full mtDNA replisome processivity. Reduced processivity could explain why overexpression of a related mutant in cell lines (&#x00394;70&#x02013;343) leads to a reduction of mtDNA copy number and stalling of the mtDNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Rolling-circle DNA synthesis in the presence of the different TWINKLE mutants.

As expected from our enzymatic analysis of TWINKY, the protein could not support mtDNA replisome function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;4). It was possible that TWINKY might affect mtDNA replisome function in the presence of wt TWINKLE. We therefore added increasing amounts of TWINKY to replication reactions containing wt TWINKLE. We could not detect any effect of TWINKY on the mtDNA replisome activity, which argues against a functional role for this protein isoform at the mtDNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, lanes 5&#x02013;8). In support of this notion, overexpression of TWINKY in cell lines does not compromise the activity of the endogenous Twinkle protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have attempted to identify a primase activity associated with the TWINKLE protein (data not shown). Using many different approaches, analyzing TWINKLE both in isolation and in combination with other mtDNA replication and transcription factors, we have so far failed to see any such enzymatic activities. In addition, bioinformatic analysis of mammalian TWINKLE sequences suggests that the protein has lost important protein motifs required for primase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Based on these observations, we decided to investigate whether the N-terminal region of TWINKLE may have other functional roles in mtDNA replisome function that are not related to primer synthesis.</p><p>TWINKLE binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA, but the two activities appear to be functionally distinct. Whereas C-terminal truncations affected both ssDNA and dsDNA binding, N-terminal truncations mainly affected binding to ssDNA. This finding leads us to speculate that ssDNA binding requires a larger protein surface, involving both the N-terminal and the C-terminal part of TWINKLE, whereas dsDNA binding is localized to the C-terminal helicase domain. In support of this idea, TWINKLE failed to interact with shorter pieces of ssDNA (15 nt), but could efficiently interact with dsDNA of similar length. In contrast, TWINKLE binds with similar efficiency to longer stretches of ssDNA and dsDNA (&#x0003e;30 nt or base pairs).</p><p>The existence of an ssDNA-binding region in the N-terminal region of TWINKLE has gained support from studies of structurally related proteins. Analyses of prokaryotic primases have identified catalytically important basic residues that cluster around a shallow cleft located within the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These residues form an elongated region with significant electropositive potential, which is required for binding to ssDNA. The presence of an ssDNA-binding region in the N-terminal region of TWINKLE may also explain why binding to ssDNA, in contrast to dsDNA binding, is dependent on nucleotide cofactors. In the X-ray structure of the gp4 protein, ATP binds at the interface between two monomers. This interface is created by amino acids from the linker region and the N-terminal part of the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In turn, the linker region interacts directly with amino acids in the ssDNA-binding region. This intricate web of interactions between the ATP and ssDNA-binding regions explains why nucleotide cofactors are required for gp4 binding to ssDNA. Conversely, this structural organization also explains why truncations in the N-terminal region, may affect ATPase and DNA helicase activity in the gp4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It is likely that a similar arrangement exists in TWINKLE. In support of this notion, molecular modeling of TWINKLE suggests that the positively charged ssDNA-binding surface is conserved (unpublished data).</p><p>The N-terminal region of TWINKLE is not absolutely required for DNA helicase activity. The &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 mutant can still hydrolyze ATP and unwind dsDNA, albeit at a slower rate. In fact, the mutant is capable of supporting POL&#x003b3;-dependent DNA synthesis on a duplex DNA substrate. The products are shorter than those observed for wt TWINKLE, which could be explained by the reduced helicase activity. Interestingly, a heterologous helicase was found to be unable to support POL&#x003b3;-dependent DNA synthesis on the same template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which led to the suggestion that POL&#x003b3; may interact specifically with TWINKLE at the mtDNA replication fork. In this respect, our observation that the &#x00394;1&#x02013;314 mutant can support POL&#x003b3; function is intriguing. It may suggest that if direct TWINKLE interactions are required for POL&#x003b3; function, then these interactions cannot be absolutely dependent on the primase-like domain of the protein.</p><p>Our analysis has also revealed efficient binding of TWINKLE to dsDNA. Interestingly, the bacterial ring-shaped helicase DnaB can accommodate both ssDNA and dsDNA in its central channel. It has been shown that DnaB requires a replication fork substrate in order to unwind DNA in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; direction. However, in the absence of a 3&#x02032;-tail, the DnaB protein translocates from the 5&#x02032;-ssDNA tail onto the dsDNA, encircles both strands and continues to translocate actively on the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A similar mechanism has been shown for Mcm4,6,7, the putative eukaryotic replication fork helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The translocation on the duplex DNA has been proposed to accomplish several functions, including driving branch migration of a Holliday junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This suggests that the DnaB protein may be directly involved in DNA recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have shown previously that similarly to DnaB and Mcm 4,6,7, TWINKLE requires a fork substrate for helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Furthermore, we have demonstrated in this article that TWINKLE can bind dsDNA in addition to ssDNA. To date, dsDNA translocation by TWINKLE has not been reported. However, if TWINKLE is able to translocate actively along the duplex in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; direction, this could confer additional functions to the helicase, for example in DNA recombination or repair. In future experiments, we will address these questions to clarify the molecular function of the dsDNA-binding capacity of TWINKLE.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that TWINKLE forms stable hexamers, even in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or NTP. This stable ring structure raises the intriguing question of how the TWINKLE protein loads onto the DNA under normal cellular conditions, when free ends of DNA are not available. Two different models may explain how DNA can enter the central channel of the preformed ring-shaped hexamer. According to the ring-opening model, the preformed hexameric ring must open to load onto the ssDNA, whereas in the disassembly model, helicases must disassemble and reassemble around the ssDNA. These mechanisms often require the presence of accessory proteins, termed helicase loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A ring-opening mechanism has been proposed for T7 gp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In this model, the N-terminal primase domain of T7 gp4 initially makes contact with DNA and acts as a helicase loader by holding the helicase next to the DNA before the DNA is transferred into the central channel of the hexamer. Given the similarities that exist between TWINKLE and T7 gp4, it will be of interest to investigate a possible role for the N-terminal primase related domain in the loading of TWINKLE onto DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants to M.F. from the Swedish Research Council, &#x000c5;ke Wiberg foundation, The Swedish Society of Medicine, and the Emil and Wera Cornell's foundation.
