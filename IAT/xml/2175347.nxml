Lysine 9 methylation of histone H3 is a transcriptional repression signal, mediated by a family of SET domain containing AdoMet-dependent enzymes. G9a methyltransferase is a euchromatic histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase. Here, G9a is shown to methylate other cellular proteins, apart from histone H3, including automethylation of K239 residue. Automethylation of G9a did not impair or activate the enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The automethylation motif of G9a flanking target K239 (ARKT) has similarity with histone H3 lysine 9 regions (ARKS), and is identical to amino acids residues in EuHMT (ARKT) and mAM (ARKT). Under steady-state kinetic assay conditions, full-length G9a methylates peptides representing ARKS/T motif of H3, G9a, mAM and EuHMT efficiently. Automethylation of G9a at ARKT motif creates a binding site for HP1 class of protein and mutation of lysine in the motif impairs this binding. In COS-7 cells GFP fusion of the wild-type G9a co-localized with HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3; isoforms whereas the G9a mutant with K239A displayed poor co-localization. Thus, apart from transcriptional repression and regulatory roles of lysine methylation, the non-histone protein methylation may create binding sites for cellular protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nuclear DNA in eukaryotes is packaged with histones, a basic scaffolding protein, to form chromatin. The basic unit of the chromatin is the nucleosome which consists of 147 bp of DNA superhelically wound around a histone octamer composed of two copies of each core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The N-terminal tail regions of histones in a nucleosome are unstructured in crystallography studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and are accessible for enzymatic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Indeed, histone molecules are modified at a post-translational level by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation. Methylation was shown to occur at the &#x003b5;-amino group of lysine (K) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and guanidino group of the arginine (R) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) by a variety of AdoMet-dependent, enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Both methylation and acetylation of the histone molecules are now recognized as important covalent modifications in eukaryotic chromatin, which can regulate gene expression. Histone molecules contain several K and R residues and many of them are methylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Acting individually or in combination both methylation and/or acetylation of histones, in conjunction with DNA methylation are believed to implement an epigenetic means of gene function affecting processes such as transcriptional activation, repression, heterochromatin formation, DNA replication and repair. These modifications facilitate recruitment of various regulator proteins that can recognize different covalent modifications in a sequence-dependent manner.</p><p>Chromatin modification is dynamic, and largely dependent on gene expression profile of the cell. All the chromatin modifications are well coordinated and undertaken by a number of histone modification enzymes, and the enzymes that remove those modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9) is a well-studied modification that is implicated in transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), Neurospora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) cells. H3K9 methylation is also present in transcriptionally active region of the mammalian chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The lysine residues are mono-, di- or trimethylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several lysine 9 histone H3 methyltransferases, such as SUV39H1, SUV39H2, EuHMT/GLP, SETDB1/ESET and G9a have been identified and well studied in mammals. Although the substrate specificity of these enzymes was determined by a combination of genetic and biochemical studies to be H3K9, one enzyme cannot rescue the other's function <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, the G9a knockout mouse embryos die at 8.5 days postcoitum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, G9a null embryo stem (ES) cells display altered DNA methylation in the Prader&#x02013;Willi imprinted region and ectopic expression of the <italic>Mage</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Similarly, the homozygous mutations of <italic>Eset</italic> resulted in periimplantation lethality between 3.5 and 5.5 days postcoitum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Both the mouse (Suv39h1 and Suv39h2) and human (SUV39H1 and SUV39H2) genes encode enzymes that can trimethylate histone H3 lysine 9 to create a binding site for heterochromatic protein, HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Genetic disruption of <italic>Suv39h1</italic> and <italic>Suv39h2</italic> led to severe decrease of the H3K9me3 at the pericentric heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Similar to Suv39h1, G9a is capable of H3K9 trimethylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). G9a is believed to be the euchromatic histone methyltransferase. Genetic disruption of <italic>G9a</italic> in cells led to reduction of H3K9me and H3K9me2 patterns in euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the histone methyltransferases may have roles beyond H3K9 methylation or they perform H3K9 methylation in a development specific manner. It is plausible that the known histone methyltransferases may have other substrate specificities.</p><p>In this study we have used recombinant murine G9a, and attempted to determine its substrate specificity. Surprisingly, we discovered that G9a is capable of automethylation. Mutational analyses of the target lysine residues were undertaken to determine their implication in catalysis and protein&#x02013;protein interaction. Furthermore, cellular localization studies were conducted to identify the link between G9a automethylation and heterochromatin binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, constructs and protein purification</title><p>Parental HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma) cells, Hela cells, NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

The enzyme is capable of mono-, di- and trimethylation of the target lysine residues on the amino terminal tail of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical studies suggested that the substrate recognition and sequence specificity of G9a involve seven amino acids (TARKSTG) of the histone H3 tail and that K9 methylation is impaired by S10 or T11 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In the mammalian proteome similar motifs are expected to be found in protein other than histone H3. To determine if the G9a methyltransferase is capable of methylating other cellular proteins, we incubated purified recombinant G9a enzyme with HCT116 plus tritiated AdoMet co-factor. The radioactive protein samples were separated on a SDS gel and fluorographed to visualize G9a-mediated protein methylation. Surprisingly, several prominent radioactive protein bands were visible in autoradiography after overnight exposure of the film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The apparent molecular weights of these bands were between 7 and 175 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, right panel, lane 1). Histone H3 molecules were radioactively labeled and visible at 17 kDa region as expected. Experiments with heat killed recombinant G9a in the reaction mixture or without additional G9a enzyme did not display strong radioactive bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, right panel, lanes 2 and 3). The minor bands observed in the presence of heat killed G9a and extract alone suggests the cell extracts contain other protein methyltransferases. Several signals on the autoradiograph are specific to recombinant G9a-mediated tritiated methyl group incorporation. Similar autoradiography profile was observed with HCT116 DNMT1 null, mouse 3T3 and Hela cell extracts (data not shown), suggesting G9a is capable of methylating proteins other than histone H3. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Multiple substrate specificity of recombinant G9a.

If G9a is capable of methylating itself, the tritiated methyl group will be incorporated to the protein and can be detected by fluorography. The fluorography showed a dark band coinciding with the G9afl in the SDS gel at an apparent molecular weight of 175 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;3). A small amount of insect cell histone H3 that co-purifies with G9a also was methylated, as viewed in the bottom of the gel. G9a enzyme lacking the first 633 amino acids, G9a&#x025b5;634, did not display any dark band implying that the truncated enzyme is incapable of automethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 4&#x02013;6). The G9a&#x025b5;634 with rH3 or recombinant nucleosome showed methylation of the H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;12). To demonstrate that methylation is dependent on AdoMet cofactor, we incubated G9afl with tritiated AdoMet or a combination of tritiated AdoMet and 100 fold excess cold AdoMet. If the automethylation reaction is AdoMet dependent, excess cold AdoMet will compete for the AdoMet-binding site of the enzyme and will result in incorporation of the cold AdoMet. Incorporation of cold AdoMet will render either a poor or no G9a signal on autoradiography film. Indeed, in the presence of excess cold AdoMet the autoradiography signal for G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 2 versus 3) or H3 was not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 4 versus 5). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Automethylation of G9a.

The wild type and point mutant GST fusions were purified, <italic>in vitro</italic> methylated by G9afl, and fluorographed to determine the amino acids crucial for methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Indeed K239A reduced the methylation significantly in fluorography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, lane 7). Furthermore, we measured the radioactive incorporation of each band. The GST-G9a (210&#x02013;264) displayed strong radioactive incorporation and the incorporation was impaired in GST-G9a (210&#x02013;264/K239A) suggesting K239 may be the methylated amino acids residue of G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, right panel). Deletion or mutation of amino acids between 243 and 264 also resulted in poor methylation of the GST fusion fragment. For example mutation of K243 residue [(GST-G9a (210&#x02013;246/K243A)] resulted in decrease in K239 methylation. Therefore, the surrounding amino acids at K239 may be important for automethylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectroscopic analysis of post-translational modification of G9a</title><p>To establish the authenticity of the methylated lysine residue of G9a, the tryptic fragments of the purified G9a were subjected to mass-spectroscopy analysis.

The similarity of these amino acids residues between G9a and H3 led us to investigate if G9aK239me3 would act like H3K9me3 and bind to HP1. To examine the HP1 interaction with G9a, we performed GST pull-down assay with immobilized GST-HP1&#x003b1;, GST-HP1&#x003b2; and GST-HP1&#x003b3;. A fixed amount of G9a wild type or G9amut was added to the beads and incubated for a fixed time followed by three washes to remove unbound enzymes. The bound proteins were separated on a SDS/PAGE and western blotted with anti-G9a antibody. Indeed, all the three isoforms of HP1 were able to bind strongly to the wild-type G9a that predominately contained K239me3, as compared to the G9amut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). This suggests that the K239 trimethylation creates an anchoring site for HP1&#x003b1;, HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3;, similar to H3K9me3-HP1 binding.</p><p>To validate whether the wild-type G9a associates with HP1 class of proteins in cells and if the association will be impaired by mutation of K239, we transfected GFP-G9afl or GFP-G9amut constructs into COS-7 cells and after 48 h, the cells were fixed and probed with either anti-HP1&#x003b1; or HP1&#x003b3;. HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3; have different chromatin-binding properties. HP1&#x003b1; binds predominantly to pericentric heterochromatin, whereas HP1&#x003b3; binds to both heterochromatin and euchromatin. The HP1&#x003b1; appeared as red punctate nuclear spots throughout the nucleus corresponding to the densely stained heterochromatic region except the nucleolus, which remained dark. A similar green punctate nuclear spot appeared in the nuclei of the GFP-G9afl transfected cells. Superimposition of the GFP-G9afl with HP1&#x003b1; resulted in yellow nuclear spots throughout the nucleus except the nucleolus, which remained dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B).

Various lysine modifications take central roles in conferring epigenetic control to the chromatin template during cellular processes. Recently, several histone lysine demethylases have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and it thus appears that the dynamic balance between histone lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases regulates the abundance and stability of histone lysine methylation, thus, regulating gene expression.</p><p>G9a in both human and mouse are large proteins with very distinct domains. For example, the murine G9a is &#x0223c;1263 amino acids long with amino terminus poly E repeat followed by nuclear localization signal, ANK repeat, preSET and SET domain. The SET domain is the catalytic center of the enzyme and point mutation of the conserved R1097, W1103, Y1138, R1162 and C1168 makes it catalytically impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The biological function of the entire region of the amino terminus is unknown. Deletion of amino terminus 634 amino acid residues makes the enzyme catalytically impaired but not inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that a cooperation between amino and carboxy terminus dictates the catalytic activation status of the enzyme. Lysine residues in protein undergo autoacetylation and automethylation. It is demonstrated that autoacetylation of HAT p300 facilitates its dissociation from the promoter to allow TFIID promoter occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In this study, we have reported automethylation activity of murine G9a. Till date there is one other automethylation example of histone methyltransferase, PRMT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The biological significance of PRMT6 automethylation is unknown. So why did a histone methyltransferase automethylate itself? The answer may lie in the domain that is methylated, and how a methylated and unmethylated protein interacts with their neighbors during cellular processes. We postulate that the biological consequence of G9a automethylation alone or in context of other modifications (phosphorylation), might be dictated by other proteins or physiological status of the cell. G9a automethylation at ARKT motif makes it an ideal candidate for interaction with HP1. Binding of G9a to HP1 perhaps creates a platform for recruitment of transcriptional repressor complexes such as DNMT1 and HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Indeed, DNMT1 is generally found in the pericentric heterochromatin of mammalian cells and can be loaded onto DNA between G2-M phase in a replication independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). We have also demonstrated that DNMT1 is capable of binding to G9a for coordinated histone and DNA methylation during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and transcriptional repression of <italic>survivin</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). A plausible scenario would be that the condensed pericentric heterochromatin maintains its silenced status by recruiting DNMT1-G9a-HP1 trimeric complex to maintain residual H3K9 methylation and insulating from unwanted events that may alter the repressive status. Once the H3K9me3 marks are fully established by G9a alone, or in combination with SUV39H1, it falls off and HP1 remain recruited to heterochromatin, presumably before the next cell cycle. The HP1-H3K9me3 binary complex may further recruit the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DNMT3B to direct DNA methylation of the major satellites in the endogenous C-type retrovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). A recent report also demonstrates that HP1 can mediate gene silencing via direct interaction with DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Therefore, HP1 may be a key silencing element that would be necessary to maintain intact epigenetic silencing status from generation to generation.</p><p>We have also demonstrated that G9a is capable of methylation of other proteins such as EuHMT and mAM at the amino terminus with a similar ARKT motif. Therefore, it is possible that ARKT motif methylation of other histone methyltransferases may have similar affinity for HP1 interaction. Furthermore, other cellular proteins may recognize methylated lysine on G9a. Cellular proteins with chromo, tudor, MBD and PHD domain can recognize and bind to Kme3 proteins and modulate their function(s). For example G9a and EuHMT form functional heterodimeric complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and steady-state level of G9a decreases in cells lacking EuHMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). G9a appears to be more stable in G9a/EuHMT heterodimeric complex than when expressed alone. One of the possible explanations of the mechanism of dimer formation may start from enzyme&#x02013;substrate interaction between G9a and EuHMT. If G9a methylate EuHMT, then both proteins will be in the close proximity of each other facilitating a heterodimer formation via interaction of their SET domain. This heterodimeric complex may direct H3K9 methylation of the euchromatic region. Another implication of G9a-mediated methylation of mAM may be to influence SETDB1 methylation. It is known that mAM facilitates ESET catalysis from di- to trimethyl at H3K9 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Since most of our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were carried out with peptide segments representing EuHMT and mAM, further validation with full-length mAM and EuHMT is needed.</p><p>In summary, we show that the euchromatic histone methyltransferase G9a automethylates and methylates other H3K9 methyltransferases. The methylation events by G9a create a binding site for HP1, and thus, creating another layer of silencing effector molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm726_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm726_Supplementary-figs-01554.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The HP1&#x003b1;, HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3; expression constructs were obtained from Dr Naoko Tanese, for which we are thankful.
