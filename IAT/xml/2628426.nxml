However, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of the ubiquitous auxilin 2 in HeLa cells only moderately impairs clathrin-dependent trafficking. In this study, we show that HeLa cells also express auxilin 1, previously thought to be neuron specific, and that both auxilins need to be depleted for inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular sorting. Depleting both auxilins cause an &#x0223c;50% reduction in the number of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane but enhances the association of clathrin and adaptors with intracellular membranes. CCV fractions isolated from auxilin-depleted cells have an &#x0223c;1.5-fold increase in clathrin content and more than fivefold increase in the amount of AP-2 adaptor complex and other endocytic machinery, with no concomitant increase in cargo. In addition, the structures isolated from auxilin-depleted cells are on average smaller than CCVs from control cells and are largely devoid of membrane, indicating that they are not CCVs but membraneless clathrin cages. Similar structures are observed by electron microscopy in intact auxilin-depleted HeLa cells. Together, these findings indicate that the two auxilins have overlapping functions and that they not only facilitate the uncoating of CCVs but also prevent the formation of nonproductive clathrin cages in the cytosol.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AP-1</kwd><kwd>AP-2</kwd><kwd>auxilin</kwd><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>coated vesicle</kwd><kwd>GGA</kwd><kwd>intracellular membranes</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>TGN</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cycles of coat assembly and disassembly are essential for clathrin-dependent trafficking. Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) requires the recruitment of cytosolic coat components onto membranes, where they assemble to form the coat. These coat components include clathrin, adaptors and various accessory proteins, such as dynamin, which is required for the fission event that yields the transport vesicle. Fusion of the CCV with its target membrane requires the disassembly of the coat, and results in the recycling of clathrin and other coat components back into the cytosol for further rounds of vesicle formation. It has been proposed that the ATP-dependent uncoating of CCVs is mediated by the molecular chaperone Hsc70, and its cofactors auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Auxilin 1 (DNAJC6) was first identified as a minor, tissue-specific clathrin assembly protein purified from bovine brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). A second, ubiquitously expressed isoform of auxilin, auxilin 2 (also known as cyclin G-associated kinase), was subsequently discovered. Auxilin 2 shares 50% sequence identity with the neuronal-specific auxilin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), but it has an additional serine/threonine kinase domain.</p><p>Both auxilins bind clathrin, adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Their C-terminal J domain confers the specificity for binding to Hsc70, the uncoating ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The proposed mechanism is that auxilin binds to forming clathrin-coated buds shortly before fission, where it specifically recruits ATP-bound Hsc70. Auxilin&#x02019;s J domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc70, which in turn stabilizes Hsc70&#x02019;s association with clathrin. This interaction ultimately drives the dissociation of the clathrin coat into triskelia and hence the uncoating of CCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The requirement for auxilin as well as Hsc70 in disassembling clathrin from CCVs has been demonstrated in a number of studies and was a crucial step in establishing a physiological role for Hsc70 in the uncoating reaction. These studies were performed in a variety of organisms, including yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and Drosophila, all of which express only one isoform of auxilin. Deletion of the auxilin gene in Drosophila is lethal, while mutants with reduced auxilin function show genetic interactions with Hsc70 and clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). When auxilin is depleted in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, endocytosis of yolk protein in oocytes is markedly reduced, most of the worms arrest during larval development and clathrin dynamics are altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Disruption of the yeast auxilin gene results in an accumulation of CCVs, impaired cargo delivery and slow cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Auxilin and its interaction with Hsc70 have also been shown to be critical for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the squid giant synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition to its role as a cochaperone for Hsc70 in the uncoating of CCVs, auxilin has been proposed to have functions in the recruitment of clathrin and adaptors to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), in the exchange of clathrin during pit remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), and most recently in the scission of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) to form free vesicles through its ability to bind dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>In spite of evidence from numerous systems that auxilin plays a key role in CCV dynamics, studies in mammalian cells have produced contradictory results. Knockdown of the ubiquitous auxilin 2 in HeLa cells causes only relatively mild phenotypes. Internalization of both EGF and transferrin is moderately impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and trafficking of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and its ligand cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) is also partially affected. However, no accumulation of CCVs has been observed. In addition, there is conflicting data on the effects of auxilin 2 depletion on the recruitment of clathrin and adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and on the exchange of clathrin between cytosol and membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Because all these data were obtained using transient RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of auxilin 2 in HeLa cells, it is difficult to integrate the various findings. The unexpectedly mild phenotypes also conflict with those seen in yeast, Drosophila and <italic>C. elegans</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>A simple explanation for the discrepancy between the phenotype in mammalian cells and the phenotypes in other organisms is the existence of an alternative J-domain protein that might compensate for the absence of auxilin 2. Indeed, we recently reported that both auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 are present in CCVs prepared from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In this study, we resolve the conflicting literature demonstrating overlapping roles for auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, and in the dynamics of clathrin assembly/disassembly. These results give insights into how auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 may be functioning in the brain, where both isoforms are normally coexpressed, and also provide us with a useful tool for proteomic analysis of isolated CCVs.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Auxilin 1 is expressed in numerous non-neuronal cell lines</title><p>Auxilin 1 was originally identified as a minor component of CCVs from bovine brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), and it has been reported to be a neuron-specific protein (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Genechip data support the restricted expression of auxilin 1 to brain (SymCard Expression Profile for DNAJC6; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/">http://symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/</ext-link>), as does antibody labeling of a multiple tissue western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in our recent study on the protein composition of CCVs from HeLa cells (a cervical carcinoma cell line), we found both auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 in our CCV fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Western blot analysis of a number of tissue culture cell lines reveals that several other non-neuronal cell lines also express the &#x02018;neuron-specific&#x02019; auxilin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, we found significant expression in Daudi (lymphoma) and A375 (amelanotic melanoma) cell lines and weak expression in T98G (glioma) and HCT-116 (colon epithelial carcinoma) cell lines. Thus, auxilin 1 expression is not restricted to brain-derived cells.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Auxilin 1 expression patterns</title><p>Coomassie Blue-stained commercial blots of human tissues (A) and human cell lines (B) were probed with an antibody against auxilin 1.

Hence, our data suggest that auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 are present in very similar amounts in HeLa cell CCVs.</p></sec><sec><title>Auxilin depletion inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title><p>The function of auxilin 2 has been studied using RNAi depletion, mainly in HeLa cells, and only moderate phenotypes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). We speculated that auxilin 1 might have partially compensated for auxilin 2 in these studies. To test this possibility, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the expression of both auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 in HeLa cells. For comparison, dynamin 2 was also knocked down. A 4-day protocol using two siRNA treatments efficiently depleted all three proteins by &#x0003e;90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>). To assess the effects of auxilin or dynamin depletion on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we assayed the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin or EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). In control cells incubated with fluorescent ligand for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, both transferrin and EGF are internalized into punctate structures that resemble early endosomes. Similar uptake was observed in cells depleted of either auxilin 1 or auxilin 2 alone. However, there was an inhibition in the internalization of transferrin and EGF in cells depleted of both auxilins, similar to that seen in cells depleted of dynamin 2.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Auxilin depletion blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title><p>A) HeLa cells were depleted of auxilin 1, auxilin 2, both auxilins or dynamin by siRNA.

There were only subtle reductions in the rates of uptake of transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>) or EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2D</xref>) in the auxilin 1 or auxilin 2 single knockdowns. However, in agreement with the fluorescence data, depletion of both auxilins or of dynamin resulted in an inhibition of transferrin and EGF uptake at early time-points, similar to that seen following clathrin depletion. Recovery of transferrin uptake was seen at longer times of incubation (results not shown). In addition, there was a twofold to threefold increase in the amount of transferrin bound to the plasma membrane in cells depleted of either dynamin or the two auxilins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting an accumulation of transferrin receptor at the cell surface. These results demonstrate that depletion of both auxilins in HeLa cells is required for an inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thus that auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 have overlapping functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of auxilin depletion on clathrin coats at the plasma membrane</title><p>We next investigated the effect of auxilin 1/auxilin 2 knockdown on CCP formation at the plasma membrane. Depletion of both auxilins in HeLa cells resulted in a change in cell morphology with most cells appearing more rounded, which made it difficult to assess changes at the cell surface by immunofluorescence. With this caveat in mind, we did not observe any significant alteration in the localization of AP-2, clathrin or the AP-2 accessory proteins epsin and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref> and unpublished observations) nor were there any obvious changes in cells that had been pre-permeabilized with saponin to wash out the cytosolic pool of adaptors and enhance the visualization of membrane labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). We therefore used quantitative electron microscopy (EM) to investigate clathrin coat formation at the cell surface. To distinguish plasma membrane-associated CCPs from free CCVs, cells were fixed in the presence of ruthenium red. This heavy metal stain is absorbed onto the plasma membrane where it forms an electron-dense layer visible by EM but is excluded from free CCVs that have already pinched off. Therefore, any clathrin-coated and ruthenium red-positive structures at or near the plasma membrane are defined as CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>). In cells depleted of auxilin 1 and auxilin 2, the number of shallow and curved CCPs was reduced to 45% and the number of deeply invaginated CCPs to 66%, relative to control cells. Although reduced in number, the pits appear to have normal morphology. In cells depleted of dynamin, the number of shallow and curved CCPs was reduced to 25% of control levels; however, we observed a fourfold increase in the number of deeply invaginated CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B,C</xref>). This agrees with previous studies of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant and with the proposed role of dynamin in the fission of CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Auxilin depletion causes a reduction of CCPs at the plasma membrane</title><p>A) Control cells or cells depleted of auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 were incubated with or without 0.05% saponin prior to fixation and labeled for AP-2&#x003b1;. Scale bar: 20 &#x003bc;m. B) Electron micrographs of cells depleted of auxilin 1 and auxilin 2. Cells were fixed in the presence of ruthenium red to distinguish budding CCPs, which are still connected to the plasma membrane, from pinched-off free CCVs.

As expected, there was also a reduction in the number of free CCVs in dynamin-depleted cells (36% of control levels).</p></sec><sec><title>Auxilin depletion inhibits intracellular trafficking</title><p>Depletion of auxilin 2 has been reported to affect lysosomal sorting by altering the localization of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and delaying the maturation of cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). To assess the effects of knocking down both auxilins, we performed a cathepsin D sorting assay.

Depletion of either auxilin 1 or auxilin 2 has only a small effect on cathepsin D sorting. However, depletion of both auxilins results in substantial missorting of cathepsin D, as evidenced both by the reduction in mature enzyme and by the increase in secretion of cathepsin D precursor. A similar phenotype is seen in AP-1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Auxilin depletion affects clathrin-mediated intracellular sorting</title><p>A) Control cells, cells depleted of both auxilins and cells depleted of AP-1 &#x003bc;1A were pulse-chased with <sup>35</sup>S, and both cell-associated (C) and secreted (S) cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated.

To investigate the role of auxilins in this pathway, we used a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-based assay. Control (i.e. no knockdown) and siRNA-treated cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone or GFP and Nef as a bicistronic message, and the cells were scored for GFP expression and surface MHCI.

Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) reported the loss of AP-1 and Golgi-localized &#x003b3;-ear containing ARF-binding proteins (GGA) immunostaining, while Kametaka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) reported no effect on AP-1. We used immunofluorescence to investigate the effects of an auxilin double knockdown on the localization and labeling intensity of clathrin, AP-1, GGAs and p56 (the best characterized GGA-binding partner) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). We observed relative increases in the labeling intensities of clathrin, AP-1, GGA1, GGA2, GGA3 and p56 associated with perinuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>). Using saponin pre-permeabilization to wash out the cytosolic pool of adaptors, we observed even more pronounced increases in the labeling intensities of GGAs and their binding partner p56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5B</xref>). We have previously reported that freeze thawing causes a rapid loss of GGA1 from the perinuclear region of the cell because of the lability of their association with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Treatment with saponin prior to fixation caused a similar loss of GGA and p56 immunofluorescence staining (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, in auxilin double-depleted cells, the GGAs and p56 were retained on the membrane even after saponin pre-permeabilization. These results suggest that in the absence of auxilin 1 and auxilin 2, the GGAs (and consequently their binding partner p56) associate more stably with membranes.

However, the lack of increase in cargo molecules indicates that these may be CCVs that have budded without concentrating cargo. Alternatively, auxilin double knockdown may cause the formation of membraneless clathrin&#x02013;adaptor cages that have similar fractionation properties as CCVs. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed our CCV fractions by EM. In preparations from control cells, CCVs were readily identified as spherical or ellipsoid structures of variable size with the bristle border that is characteristic of the clathrin coat in thin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9A</xref>). A membrane was clearly visible inside many of the CCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9A</xref>, arrows). In contrast, the clathrin-coated structures isolated from auxilin double-depleted cells appear to be smaller, more electron dense and more uniform in size; in addition, a membrane was rarely visible in these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9B</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that auxilin 1/auxilin 2 depletion causes a shift in the size distribution of coated structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9C</xref>). The control CCV population has a mean diameter of 84 nm, with a standard deviation (SD) of 13 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 3369). The clathrin-coated structures from auxilin-depleted cells are significantly smaller with a mean diameter of 64 nm and are also more homogeneous in size, with a SD of 9 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 2534). Similar size distributions were observed when the CCV fractions were analyzed by negative staining (unpublished data). The clathrin-coated structures from auxilin-depleted cells also tend to be more uniformly round, whereas in the control preparations, there is a higher frequency of irregularly shaped, incompletely coated vesicles, which may represent sheared-off clathrin-coated buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>).

Nevertheless, the mean diameter of clathrin-coated structures is significantly smaller in the auxilin-depleted cells than in the control cells. In addition, in control cells, the majority (67%) of the clathrin-coated structures have clearly visible membranes.

Indeed, the latter possibility may explain why even in control cells a proportion of clathrin-coated structures have no visible membrane. To determine whether the seemingly membraneless structures in auxilin-depleted cells actually have membranes outside of the plane of section, we analyzed serial sections. We found that the majority of the clathrin-coated structures in auxilin-depleted cells were contained within a single 70-nm thick section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,B&#x02032;</xref>, see arrows and inset), demonstrating that they are smaller than a CCP or bud, which can usually be followed through two or more serial sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,B&#x02032;</xref>, see arrowhead). This suggests that most of the membraneless structures observed in auxilin-depleted cells are indeed free clathrin cages.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous attempts to study the role of auxilin in mammalian cells have produced somewhat conflicting results that did not correlate with the phenotypes of auxilin inactivation in other organisms. Most of the mammalian studies were based on RNAi depletion of auxilin 2 in HeLa cells, which caused only mild defects in endocytosis and intracellular sorting, inconsistent effects on clathrin dynamics and perhaps most disappointingly no accumulation of CCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). One underlying problem with the majority of these studies has been the assumption that HeLa cells express only the ubiquitous isoform of auxilin, auxilin 2. In this study, we show that HeLa cells express not only the ubiquitous auxilin 2 but also the &#x02018;neuron-specific&#x02019; isoform, auxilin 1. This has allowed us to uncover further roles for auxilin, in addition to its well-defined role in the uncoating of CCVs, by using RNAi to deplete both isoforms.</p><sec><title>Auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 functionally complement each other</title><p>Knockdown of auxilin 2 alone has a weak inhibitory effect on endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that both auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 contribute to clathrin-mediated endocytosis because only the combined depletion of both auxilins inhibits the uptake of transferrin and EGF. We also show that both auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 contribute to the correct sorting of cathepsin D and to Nef-mediated downregulation of MHCI. In agreement with these observations, our data suggest that auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 are present in similar quantities in HeLa CCVs. Thus, auxilin 1 and auxilin 2 have overlapping functions and can substitute for each other in sorting events both at the plasma membrane and on intracellular membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Auxilin depletion has different effects on clathrin association with intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane</title><p>Auxilin has been proposed to function at various stages during the CCV cycle, including clathrin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), clathrin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and vesicle uncoating. Despite the disruption in both endocytic and TGN/endosome clathrin-mediated trafficking in cells depleted of both auxilins, the knockdown appears to have opposite effects on the association of clathrin with the plasma membrane and with intracellular membranes. In auxilin-depleted cells, there was a &#x0223c;50% drop in the number of clathrin-coated profiles at the plasma membrane, whereas there was a significant increase in clathrin and AP-1/GGA labeling on intracellular membranes. We can only speculate as to why these differences exist, but the two most likely explanations are differences in how the auxilins act on AP-1 and AP-2 or mechanistic differences in adaptor protein recruitment. For example, auxilin 2 has a serine/threonine kinase domain that is not found in auxilin 1, which is homologous to the kinase domain of adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Both auxilin 2 and AAK1 can phosphorylate the &#x003bc;2 subunit of AP-2, so it is possible that the kinase activities of AAK1 and auxilin 2 can functionally substitute for each other at the plasma membrane but not on intracellular membranes. Alternatively (or in addition), the different mechanisms employed by AP-2 and AP-1/GGAs to bind to their target membranes, involving different phosphoinositides and ARF guanosine triphosphatases, may influence the way they respond to auxilin depletion.</p></sec><sec><title>What is the function of auxilin in the CCV cycle?</title><p>If the sole function of auxilin is to act as a cofactor for Hsc70 in the uncoating of CCVs, then it might be expected that knocking down auxilin would lead to an accumulation of CCVs. Indeed, this phenotype has been reported in auxilin-depleted yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, by EM, we did not observe an accumulation of free endocytic CCVs, defined as ruthenium red-negative clathrin-coated structures within 200 nm of the plasma membrane. In contrast, we did find that CCV fractions from auxilin-depleted cells were significantly enriched in clathrin and components of the endocytic machinery, relative to CCV fractions from control cells. At first, these observations seemed to contradict each other, but several observations have led us to conclude that the clathrin-coated structures that accumulate in auxilin-depleted cells are assembled clathrin cages that are devoid of membrane. Firstly, while there is an increase in clathrin and AP-2 in CCV fractions from auxilin-depleted cells, cargo proteins such as the transferrin receptor, EGF receptor or CIMPR are not increased. Secondly, in auxilin-depleted cells, clathrin redistributes from &#x0223c;50% cytosolic to being almost completely pelletable. Thirdly, EM studies show that the mean size of purified clathrin-coated structures from auxilin-depleted cells is substantially smaller than that from control cells and similar in size to cages assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> from clathrin and AP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Most importantly, the majority of clathrin-coated structures isolated from auxilin-depleted cells appear to be devoid of membrane.</p><p>The increase in the amount of AP-2 in CCV fractions from auxilin-depleted cells correlates with the observed decrease in plasma membrane-associated CCPs. In contrast, AP-1 is not lost from intracellular membranes and does not accumulate in CCV fractions. Hence, biochemical and imaging data are consistent, all indicating that membraneless clathrin cages form in auxilin-depleted HeLa cells. This in turn suggests that in addition to its role in uncoating, a major function of auxilin is to prevent the nonproductive assembly of clathrin, as has been suggested from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>Could the formation of cages lead to a sequestration of endocytic machinery and thus cause the observed block in transferrin and EGF uptake? Probably not, given that we observed only a 50% drop in the number of CCPs. Hence, it seems more likely that the endocytic and intracellular blocks are a consequence of altered clathrin dynamics.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for <italic>in vivo</italic> self-assembly of clathrin into membraneless coats</title><p>At concentrations above &#x0223c;50 &#x003bc;g/mL, clathrin has the propensity to self-assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> into structures of 70&#x02013;125 nm, termed &#x02018;cages&#x02019; or &#x02018;baskets&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This assembly is greatly facilitated by the presence of adaptor proteins, which also cause the cages to become smaller and more uniform in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Although the formation of membraneless clathrin cages <italic>in vitro</italic> is a well-documented phenomenon, to our knowledge, free cages have never before been observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Under certain nonphysiological conditions (potassium depletion, growth in hypertonic medium and acidification of the cytoplasm), microcages have been seen to form around CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), but the structures that we observe in auxilin-depleted cells do not accumulate at the plasma membrane but are present throughout the cytoplasm. It has been suggested that the concentration of free cytosolic clathrin is too low to allow spontaneous self-assembly in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). However, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure clathrin concentration as a percentage of total cell protein in different cells and tissues, Goud et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) have arrived at estimates of 0.18 &#x000b1; 0.02% (of which 59% is unassembled) and 0.16 &#x000b1; 0.07% (of which 45% is unassembled) in Vero cells and X63Ag8 cells, respectively (HeLa cells were not included in the study). If the total protein concentration of a cell is &#x0223c;180 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), the cytosolic clathrin concentration in a typical tissue culture cell would be &#x0223c;100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/mL, which is certainly high enough for spontaneous self-assembly to occur if there were no inhibitory mechanisms in place.</p><p>Interestingly, Newmyer and Schmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) have observed that in HeLa cells overexpressing dominant-negative Hsc70, clathrin shifts from the unassembled pool to the assembled pool, as determined by subcellular fractionation, without a concomitant shift of CCV cargo molecules. This led them to speculate that in the absence of Hsc70&#x02019;s chaperoning activity, clathrin may form empty cages. However, the proposed cages were neither visualized nor isolated. In this study, we used EM to present the first direct evidence for <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly of clathrin into cages that are distinct from CCVs. In auxilin-depleted HeLa cells, small and membraneless clathrin-coated structures accumulate in the cytoplasm. These structures are smaller than CCVs from control cells and show a narrow size distribution similar to that observed for cages assembled <italic>in vitro</italic>. Their electron-dense appearance, in particular by EM tomography, suggests that they are packed with proteins. This is further supported by the biochemical fractionation data that show a greatly increased AP-2-to-clathrin ratio in CCV fractions from auxilin-depleted cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that the clathrin cages incorporate AP-2 and associated proteins at higher than normal stoichiometry. Possibly, the absence of a membrane and of cargo proteins puts fewer spatial constraints on cage formation and leads to a higher packing density of clathrin-binding proteins.</p><p>Intriguingly, it appears that AP-2 and endocytic accessory factors are preferentially packaged into the membraneless cages, relative to AP-1 and AP-1-binding proteins. We propose that at least two factors may be responsible for this striking difference. Firstly, there are many more known binding partners for AP-2 than for AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Secondly, the numerous AP-2-associated proteins form strong protein&#x02013;protein interaction networks through SH3/proline-rich domains as well as EH domains/NPF motifs, whereas this is not the case for the known AP-1-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Hence, although both AP-1 and AP-2 and their binding proteins may initially be recruited to the membraneless clathrin cages, the stronger and more extensive interaction network of AP-2 will outcompete the AP-1 network, resulting in a skewed AP-2 to AP-1 ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and outlook</title><p>In this study, we have shown that HeLa cells express both isoforms of auxilin and that these are functionally complementary in both endocytosis and intracellular clathrin-mediated trafficking. In view of these findings, the existing discrepancies between the mammalian and nonmammalian auxilin literature are likely to be resolved. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that in the absence of auxilin, clathrin and adaptor proteins assemble into membraneless cages in intact HeLa cells, shedding light both on a novel role for auxilin and on clathrin assembly dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, auxilin depletion causes the accumulation of clathrin cages that are selectively packed with endocytic adaptors and accessory factors. Hence, auxilin knockdown provides a convenient tool for specifically increasing the yield of AP-2-associated proteins during biochemical fractionation and will facilitate future proteomic investigations of the endocytic clathrin machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and blotting</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against auxilin 1 (which also recognizes auxilin 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and GGA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) were kind gifts from Sanja Sever (Harvard Medical School) and Juan Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health), respectively, and those against GGA1, GGA2, p56, SNX9, clathrin, AP-2&#x003b1;, AP-2&#x003b2;2, AP-3&#x003bc;3 and CIMPR were raised in house and have already been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).

Cells plated onto 96-well Nunclon Surface plates were co-stained using 4&#x02032;-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a sheep polyclonal antibody against TGN46, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a variety of proteins of interest, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-sheep immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The camera was automated to identify cells using the DAPI channel, to mask a region of interest using TGN46 labeling (object identification using the Isodata Threshold method), to correct for background locally within each field and then to measure the average fluorescence intensity in the Alexa 594 channel. For each condition, 5000 objects of interest were quantified spread over 10-well repeats, which equates to at least 2500 cells (where not all TGNs were defined by a single mask).
