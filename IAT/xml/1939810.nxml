(TCR&#x003b6;) chain is a master sensor and regulator of lymphocyte responses. Loss of TCR&#x003b6; expression has been documented in infectious, inflammatory, and malignant diseases, suggesting that it may serve to limit T-cell reactivity and effector responses at sites of tissue damage. These observations prompted us to explore the relationship between TCR&#x003b6; expression and effector function in T cells. We report here that TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> lymphocytes are enriched for antigen-experienced cells refractory to TCR-induced proliferation. Compared to their TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> counterparts, TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells share characteristics of differentiated effector T cells but use accessory pathways for transducing signals for inflammatory cytokine gene expression and cell contact-dependent pathways to activate monocytes. TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells accumulate in inflamed tissues in vivo and have intrinsic migratory activity in vitro. Whilst blocking leukocyte trafficking with anti-TNF therapy in vivo is associated with the accumulation of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells in peripheral blood, this T-cell subset retains the capacity to migrate in vitro. Taken together, the functional properties of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells make them promising cellular targets for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The acquisition of immune responsiveness is mediated through the assembly, expression, and function of antigen receptors at the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> In T lymphocytes, the antigen T-cell receptor (TCR) is a multiple subunit complex comprising clonotypic, disulfide-linked &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; antigen recognition chains devoid of signaling motifs associated with the invariant chain subunits CD3&#x003b3;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003f5;, and TCR&#x003b6;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> These invariant chains assemble in the mature TCR/CD3 complex as noncovalently linked CD3&#x003b3;&#x003f5; and CD3&#x003b4;&#x003f5; heterodimers and disulfide-linked TCR&#x003b6;&#x02013;&#x003b6; homodimers and transmit signals inside the cell following TCR ligation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs contained within their extended intracytoplasmic tails.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> These phosphotyrosine motifs form docking sites for Syk family tyrosine kinases, such as &#x003b6;-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70), which in turn couple the antigen receptor complex to transmembrane adaptor proteins and downstream signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup></p><p>The TCR&#x003b6; subunit differs in its genetic organization, chromosomal localization, and domain structure from the CD3&#x003b3;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003f5; invariant chains. Thus, in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells the 16-kDa TCR&#x003b6; chain subserves a unique role in TCR/CD3 complex assembly by associating with newly synthesized hexameric &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003f5;&#x003b4;&#x003f5; complexes resulting in the transport and expression of mature &#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003f5;&#x003b4;&#x003f5;&#x003b6;<sub>2</sub> complexes to the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, metabolic labeling and pulse chase experiments have demonstrated that de novo synthesis of TCR&#x003b6; is rate-limiting, thereby regulating the amount of TCR/CD3 complex expressed at the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> In NK cells, the TCR&#x003b6; chain may form homodimers or heterodimers with the Fc&#x003f5;R common &#x003b3; chain signaling subunit, which in turn may form signaling complexes with several activating receptors, including NK cell protein 46 (NKp46), NKp30, and the low-affinity IgG receptor Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> In light of these crucial functions the TCR&#x003b6; chain could be viewed as a master regulator and sensor of innate as well as adaptive immune responses. It follows from this that aberrations in its expression or function should have profound effects on immune function.</p><p>The events leading to the down-regulation of TCR/CD3 complex expression on serial ligation by peptide/MHC complexes are well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> Less well understood are the molecular mechanisms for the sustained down-regulation of TCR&#x003b6; observed in chronic bacterial, HIV, and mycobacterial infections, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and in solid tumor and hematologic malignancies (reviewed by Baniyash<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup>). That this phenomenon is associated with so many diverse pathologies has raised the possibility that down-regulation of TCR&#x003b6; may serve to attenuate T-cell activation at sites of tissue damage, thereby limiting the effects of unbridled T-cell reactivity and pathologic effector responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Whilst this model is entirely consistent with a central role for antigen in driving autoimmune inflammatory activity, it implies that chronically activated T cells rendered hyporesponsive to TCR engagement through loss of TCR&#x003b6; expression should play a less prominent role in the established phase of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p><p>To gain further insight into the immunobiology of T cells expressing low levels of TCR&#x003b6; (hereafter, TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup>), we explored the relationship between loss of TCR&#x003b6; expression and T-cell function. Our results shed light on the nature of persistent effector responses of T cells that become refractory to antigenic restimulation during the evolution of immune responses.

Both antibodies recognize phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated forms of the TCR&#x003b6; chain, implying that any loss of signal is not due to activation-induced phosphorylation of the &#x003b6;-chain polypeptide (data not shown). As expected, staining of PBLs from healthy donors defined distinct lymphocyte subsets, including populations of CD3<sup>+</sup>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>+</sup> cells, CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>+</sup> cells, and a double-negative population of monocytes and B cells that do not express TCR&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and data not shown). We documented a relationship between TCR&#x003b6; and CD3&#x003f5; expression, with TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> T cells expressing the highest levels of CD3&#x003f5;, and TCR&#x003b6;<sup>intermediate</sup> or TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells expressing levels of surface CD3&#x003f5; that for some donors were at least an order of magnitude lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

To this end, we stained healthy donor PBLs with antibodies specific for CD45RA or CD45RO to define subsets of na&#x000ef;ve and memory T cells, respectively, and then compared the expression of these markers on TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> and TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cell subsets. Histogram plots from a representative experiment, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, demonstrated enrichment of CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> population and many CD45RO<sup>+</sup> T cells residing within the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> subset. Nevertheless, there was considerable overlap between subsets, findings supported by analysis of multiple donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Indeed, as many as 40% of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> T cells expressed CD45RO, whereas a similar proportion of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells expressed CD45RA. More extensive phenotyping failed to demonstrate uniform loss of CD62L or CCR7 expression on all TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells when compared to the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> subset, indicating that low expression of TCR&#x003b6; does not define differentiating effector memory T cells per se, but rather analysis of TCR&#x003b6; expression might provide additional functional information besides that provided by conventional cell surface phenotyping.</p><p>To examine the functional consequences of TCR&#x003b6; expression on TCR responsiveness, we stained fresh PBLs from healthy donors with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and tracked the proliferative capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in response to stimulation with OKT3, or OKT3 and anti-CD28 in combination. At the indicated times cells were harvested, stained for TCR&#x003b6; expression, and analyzed by CFSE dye dilution. Although little proliferation was detected within the first few days of TCR stimulation, dividing T cells could be detected at subsequent time points, and these were uniformly TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A arrows). In contrast, the majority of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>intermediate</sup> and TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells failed to proliferate throughout the period of stimulation. Note that populations of nonproliferating TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, representing less than 10% of the total, were observed at day 4 but not at subsequent time points. The reasons for this are unknown, although it is conceivable that these T cells undergo programmed cell death after nonproductive TCR engagement. By day 6, expression of TCR&#x003b6; in proliferating cells declined progressively with each cycle of cell division. Although this result was predicted, the extent to which proliferation was restricted to a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing high levels of TCR&#x003b6; was unexpected. These findings could not be explained by suboptimal levels of TCR stimulation, because higher concentrations of OKT3 and anti-CD28 antibodies induced similar patterns of proliferation with respect to TCR&#x003b6; expression.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cell subset is enriched for antigen experienced T cells</bold>.

To test this directly, we analyzed fresh PBLs from HLA-B*0702<sup>+</sup> CMV-reactive donors after stimulation with specific CMV peptide and tracked antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with fluorescent HLA-B7/p65 MHC-peptide tetramers. In a representative experiment, the proportion of tetramer-positive T cells increased from less than 3% prior to stimulation to almost 10% after 8 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). By gating on TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> and TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T-cell subsets, we confirmed that the majority of peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reside within the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> population after 8 days of stimulation (1.27% tetramer-positive TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> cells versus 26.4% tetramer-positive TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C); note the downward shift in tetramer staining consequent on down-regulation of the TCR complex after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B-C right panels). Together these experiments demonstrated that TCR&#x003b6; staining can be used to identify populations of tetramer-positive T cells that have undergone productive engagement with specific antigen and suggest that circulating &#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells represent polyclonal populations of antigen experienced lymphocytes in vivo.</p><p>A characteristic feature of effector T cells is their capacity to produce cytokines. Current paradigms of T-cell differentiation suggest that T cells undergo a complex series of epigenetic events to acquire stable transcriptional competence for cytokine gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> These events depend on signals integrated from both the antigen T-cell receptor and cytokine receptors that induce the expression and activation of lineage-specific transcription factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></sup> We therefore explored whether TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells that had already engaged antigen in vivo were competent for cytokine gene expression when compared to TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> cells from the same donor. To test this, fresh PBLs were stimulated in vitro for 6 hours with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. This stimulus, in contrast to anti-TCR antibodies, allowed us to assess competence for cytokine gene expression by activating T cells through pathways independent of TCR&#x003b6; expression. Monensin was added to cultures for the last hour of stimulation prior to harvesting and staining using specific antibodies for CD3&#x003f5; and TCR&#x003b6; in combination with the indicated anticytokine antibody.

By contrast, the dominant IL-10&#x02013;producing cell subset was found to reside within the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), indicating that cytokine expression in general was not confined to the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> subset.

However, the proliferative responses of T cells to TCR engagement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> indicated that the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> subset was refractory to membrane proximal TCR signals. To define alternative signaling pathways of effector function, we prepared bulk populations of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells by stimulating elutriated T cells with inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, which down-regulates TCR&#x003b6; in murine T cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> using a combination of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; sufficient to support T-cell differentiation in vitro in the absence of specific antigen and accessory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></sup> After 7 days of cytokine stimulation a significant proportion of T cells were TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> (67.3% compared to 12.2% for unstimulated T cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We then tested the capacity of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-10 either in the absence of stimulation or following costimulation by CHO cell transfectants expressing CD80 or CD86; CHO cells expressing empty vector were used as a negative control. In the absence of CHO cells, stimulation with the cytokine cocktail alone was sufficient to induce IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Whilst costimulation with CHO/vector cells reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production by TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells, stimulation with CHO cells expressing either CD80 or CD86 was equally efficient in augmenting IFN-&#x003b3; production.

Monocytes or T cells alone produced little or no TNF-&#x003b1;, whereas LPS stimulation induced abundant TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C right panel). Although coculture of fixed TCR&#x003b6;<sup>+</sup> cells with monocytes failed to elicit TNF-&#x003b1; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C left panel), cytokine-stimulated TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells induced monocytes to produce TNF-&#x003b1; in a dose-dependent fashion when T cell&#x02013;monocyte ratios were increased from 3:1 to 7:1. TNF-&#x003b1; production was attenuated when T-cell&#x02013;monocyte contact was blocked with a Transwell insert (data not shown). These data demonstrated that although TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells are relatively refractory to TCR-induced proliferation, they are by no means senescent or inert, being capable of inflammatory cytokine expression in response to cytokine receptor or costimulatory signals. TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells are also potent activators of monocytes through cell contact-dependent pathways.</p><p>This effector phenotype, being reminiscent of RA synovial T cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> prompted us to compare expression of TCR&#x003b6; in paired PB and SF T cells from patients with an acute flare of inflammatory arthritis who attended a clinic. TCR&#x003b6; expression profiles were notable in several respects. First, a significant proportion of SF T cells had negligible levels of TCR&#x003b6; expression, equivalent to that detected in the CD3&#x003f5;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double-negative cell population, and yet surface expression of CD3&#x003f5; was spared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Second, although the numbers of CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>+</sup> NK cells were lower in SF than in PB, expression of TCR&#x003b6; was also reduced. Furthermore, lower numbers of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells were detected in PB of patients with an acute disease flare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). This was associated with accumulation of the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> subset in SF when compared to PB from the same patient (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .03), suggesting selective migration of these effector cells to inflamed joints and their exit from the circulating pool; increased numbers of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells in RA synovial tissue (ST) was consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). If circulating TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells represented populations of antigen-experienced effector cells captured prior to their migration to inflamed joints, then blocking cell migration should lead to accumulation of this subset in blood. We took advantage of the fact that TNF blockade inhibits leukocyte trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref></sup> by tracking PB TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells in 17 patients with chronic, active RA (DAS28 &#x02265; 5.1) before and after treatment with anti-TNF. We documented considerable variability in expression of PB TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T-cell numbers following anti-TNF therapy. However, when data were stratified according to validated EULAR clinical response criteria we found that at 30 weeks the best clinical outcomes were associated with an accumulation in the percent CD3<sup>+</sup>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells at 14 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C); this relationship held true for CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas no such association was found between clinical response to anti-TNF and other cellular parameters, such as total lymphocyte counts, or the percent CD3<sup>+</sup> or CD45RO<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not shown).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells are enriched at sites of inflammation and accumulate in PB after treatment with anti-TNF in a subset of patients</bold>.

Ethics precluded further investigation in patients, and so we opted to study transendothelial migration of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T-cell subsets in vitro. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that by 24 hours about 20% to 25% of PBLs from healthy donors migrate across TNF-stimulated endothelial monolayers cultured in the Transwell. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that cells migrating to the lower chamber expressed lower levels TCR&#x003b6;. This was true for both T-cell and NK cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), and the expression profiles for upper and lower chambers were quite comparable to those we had observed for PB and SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Transmigration did not perturb TCR&#x003b6; expression because the proportions of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> and TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells were similar to those in PB cultured for the same period in the absence of endothelial cells or Transwell, nor was it dependent on proliferation because CFSE fluorescence of migrating and nonmigrating T cells was comparable (data not shown). Even though there are many more TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> than TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells in the population added to the upper chamber, a much higher proportion of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells migrated when compared to their TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> counterparts (&#x0223c;70% versus 30%), differences more striking for CD4<sup>+</sup> than CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Migration of PBLs could be further enhanced by the addition of CXCL-10, CCL5, or CXCL-12 to the lower chamber, chemokines known to be up-regulated in RA synovial joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> Subset analysis revealed enhanced migration of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> T cells in the presence of CXCL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), whereas the migratory profiles of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells were substantially higher and barely augmented in the presence of exogenous chemokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Indeed, for the TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> subset transmigration in response to CXCL-12 was reduced when compared to cells migrating in the absence of exogenous chemokine. Taken together, these results suggest that antigen-experienced TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells have likely acquired in vivo the propensity to migrate in part through expression of chemokines and their cognate receptors at the cell surface.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells exhibit enhanced migratory capacity in vitro</bold>.

Even though their accumulation in inflamed tissues appears consistent with this, we cannot yet account for the heterogeneity of this TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> population. This subset will include populations of T cells that have very recently engaged antigen, perhaps explaining their refractoriness to TCR restimulation, but also T cells in which loss of TCR&#x003b6; expression persists over time. Our data seem consistent with this because during an acute inflammatory response TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> cells are depleted from the PB compartment and enriched in inflamed tissue; TNF blockade reverses this. Furthermore, transendothelial migration experiments demonstrated an enhanced propensity for circulating TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells to migrate when compared to their TCR&#x003b6;<sup>bright</sup> counterparts, implying that migration is associated with, and perhaps even facilitated by, loss of TCR&#x003b6; expression in peripheral lymphoid organs. We suggest that on migration to tissues in vivo this subset would be exposed to an inflammatory milieu where hypoxia, reactive oxygen intermediates, depletion of essential nutrients, inflammatory cytokines, and activated cells of myeloid lineage each contribute to chronic down-regulation of TCR&#x003b6; expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> Therein, aberrant TCR signals and their functional sequelae may be perpetuated.</p><p>We still do not fully understand which extracellular cues sustain the effector function of TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells and how these apparently dysfunctional cells contribute actively to pathogenic processes, besides the apparent imbalance of TCR-dependent arrest of cell motility and competing chemokinetic &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; signals promoting adhesion and migration. One possibility is that TCR&#x003b6;-deficient TCR/CD3 complexes are capable of transmitting signals to induce and sustain inflammatory cytokine gene expression through compensatory up-regulation of the Fc&#x003f5;RI&#x003b3; signaling subunit, as first described in intraepithelial lymphocytes of TCR&#x003b6;-deficient mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> Indeed, T cells from TCR&#x003b6;-deficient mice are fully competent to differentiate into IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing Th1 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup> a finding consistent with the enrichment for IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; expression in human TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, the relative absence of IL-10&#x02013;expressing T cells in the same population could point to an intrinsic requirement for intact TCR signaling to maintain immune homeostasis through the generation or function of regulatory T-cell subsets, as suggested in studies of patients with diabetes treated with anti-CD3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></sup> Appropriate antigen-dependent expansion of adaptive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells from a pool of differentiating effector T cells might fail for the same reason. An alternative possibility is that the chronic phase of effector function is maintained independently of antigen stimulation, as suggested by experiments in which TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells produce IFN-&#x003b3; following engagement of costimulatory pathways, while at the same time stimulating monocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF through cell contact-dependent pathways. Moreover, attenuation of TCR&#x003b6;-dependent signaling will perturb pathways of antigen-dependent activation-induced cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> It follows from this that TCR&#x003b6;<sup>dim</sup> T cells would persist in tissues over extended periods of time, further amplifying effector pathways mediated through cell contact with infiltrating macrophages, B cells, and resident stromal cells.
