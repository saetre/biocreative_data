A cell therapy using human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells as substitution for degenerated dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons has been developed and showed promising prospect in clinical treatment of PD, but the exact mechanism underlying this therapy is not fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of this therapy are related to the trophic properties of RPE cells and their ability to synthesize DA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We evaluated the protective effects of conditioned medium (CM) from cultured RPE cells on the DAergic cells against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and determined the levels of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released by RPE cells. We also measured the DA synthesis and release. Finally we transplanted microcarriers-RPE cells into 6-OHDA lesioned rats and observed the improvement in apomorphine-induced rotations (AIR).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report here: (1) CM from RPE cells can secret trophic factors GDNF and BDNF, and protect DAergic neurons against the 6-OHDA- and rotenone-induced cell injury; (2) cultured RPE cells express L-dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and synthesize DA; (3) RPE cells attached to microcarriers can survive in the host striatum and improve the AIR in 6-OHDA-lesioned animal model of PD; (4) GDNF and BDNF levels are found significantly higher in the RPE cell-grafted tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings indicate the RPE cells have the ability to secret GDNF and BDNF, and synthesize DA, which probably contribute to the therapeutic effects of RPE cell transplantation in PD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which affects approximately 1% population over the age of 60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The most motor symptoms of this disease are caused by dysfunction of the nigro-striatal pathway. DAergic neurons in the substantial nigral pars compacta (SNc) project axons to striatum; when PD patients display symptoms, more than half of the DAergic neurons in the SNc are lost. In the last two decades, several different sources of DAergic cells as transplantation therapy have been tried in animal models and in patients with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. RPE cell transplantation has been applied in experimental and clinical studies for its capability of producing L-dopa as intermediate product of melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. RPE cell transplantation therapy has many advantages: it does not require immune suppression, the cells are relatively easy to obtain, and the procedure has minimal ethic concern, which make this approach attractive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>RPE cells are melanin containing cells that constitute a monolayer between the neural retina and the choroid. In RPE cells, tyrosine is catalyzed by tyrosinase to L-dopa that is polymerized to form melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is hypothesized that L-dopa in the RPE cells can be converted into DA in the terminates of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons and provide DA to nigro-striatal system directly after RPE cells are transplanted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, such assumption has yet to be verified.</p><p>RPE cells play a key role in maintaining the normal function of retina and can express several neurotrophic factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pigment-derived epithelial factor (PEDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which nourish the neurosensory retina and also probably provide trophic effects on the host DAergic neurons.</p><p>In the present study, we attempt to determine whether the neurotrophic effects of RPE cells play a role in restoring the function of nigrostriatal system in the transplanted model of PD, and to examine whether RPE cells have the ability to synthesize and release DA in the cultures. Our works provide the first evidence that RPE cells can secrete the neurotrophic factors GDNF and BDNF, and synthesize DA, which probably contribute to their beneficial effects of RPE cells transplantation in animal model of PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human RPE cells were obtained from the RPE Cell Bank at the Shanghai 1<sup>st </sup>Hospital.

RPE cell transplantation is a promising therapy as shown in preliminary clinical trial. In the present study, we attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of this therapy by determining: whether RPE cells exert protective effects on DAergic cells when challenged by neurotoxins; whether RPE cells can produce and release DA. Our results indicate that 1) RPE cells can express and secrete GDNF and BDNF and protect DAergic cells against neurotxoins-induced injury; 2) RPE cells can express DDC and synthesize DA; 3) RPE cells attached to microcarriers can survive in the host striatum and produce high level GDNF and BDNF after transplantation; and 4) RPE cells transplantation produce a statistically significant improvement of AIR.</p><p>In the previous transplantation studies, microcarriers were used to increase the survival of grafted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, microcarriers provide a substrate to which the cells can establish a basal lamina and thus create a more favorable microenvironment. Furthermore, cells attached to beads may alter the immunogenic properties of cells, which may prevent the recognition and immunological surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our experiments, we used cytodex 3 which consists of a thin layer of denatured collagen chemically coupled to a matrix of cross-linked dextran, and these microcarriers facilitate the survival of transplanted RPE cells.</p><p>We demonstrate that RPE cells can provide trophic effect on DAergic cells, which may be one of the possible mechanisms underlying RPE cell therapy. Previous studies had showed that RPE cells expressed several neurotrophic factors such as PEDF, PDGF, EGF, and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Our results elucidate that RPE cells can secrete BDNF and GDNF and these two factors play important role in the neurotrophic effects of RPE cells. Although RPE cells can express PEDF, it accounts for only a portion of the neurotrophic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate that GDNF and BDNF in RPE-CM contribute for the most part of trophic effect. We also demonstrate that GDNF and BDNF are expressed by grafted RPE cells.</p><p>Besides the neurotrophic effect of RPE cells, we document that RPE cells can express DDC and produce DA. L-dopa is a precursor of DA, and can be synthesized by RPE cells as an intermediate product of melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. DDC, an enzyme to convert L-dopa to DA, is found in the RPE cells in our study. However, the depolarization-induced DA release is not detected in the cells, indicating that the DA release machinery as seen in most excitable cells is not present in the RPE cells. It's possible that RPE cells may have other mechanism to transfer DA throughout the membrane. Previous report by Dalpiaz et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] showed that DA could permeate the membrane of RPE cells, and this permeation seems to be mediated by organic cation transporter 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The ability of DA synthesis in RPE cells suggests RPE cells transplantation may be one of the advantages for the cell replacement therapy to treat advanced PD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RPE cells not only replenish L-dopa as elucidated by previous study, but can also synthesize DA and neurotrophic factors which protect the intrinsic neurons after transplantation. These findings make this cell replacement a more viable and promising therapy for PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The studies were designed by MM and WL and were performed by MM, XL, and XF.
