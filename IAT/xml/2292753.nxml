Here, we have demonstrated an in vitro reconstitution of the central step of DNA strand exchange during HR. Our system consists entirely of homogeneously purified proteins, including Rhp51, the two mediators, and replication protein A (RPA), which reflects genetic requirements in vivo. Using this system, we present the first robust biochemical evidence that concerted action of the two mediators directs the loading of Rhp51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) precoated with RPA. Dissection of the reaction reveals that Rad22 overcomes the inhibitory effect of RPA on Rhp51-Swi5-Sfr1&#x02013;mediated strand exchange. In addition, Rad22 negates the requirement for a strict order of protein addition to the in vitro system. However, despite the presence of Rad22, Swi5-Sfr1 is still essential for strand exchange. Importantly, Rhp51, but neither Rad22 nor the Swi5-Sfr1 mediator, is the factor that displaces RPA from ssDNA. Swi5-Sfr1 stabilizes Rhp51-ssDNA filaments in an ATP-dependent manner, and this stabilization is correlated with activation of Rhp51 for the strand exchange reaction. Rad22 alone cannot activate the Rhp51 presynaptic filament. AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, induces a similar stabilization of Rhp51, but this stabilization is independent of Swi5-Sfr1. However, hydrolysis of ATP is required for processive strand transfer, which results in the formation of a long heteroduplex. Our in vitro reconstitution system has revealed that the two mediators have indispensable, but distinct, roles for mediating Rhp51 loading onto RPA-precoated ssDNA</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Homologous recombination promotes genetic diversity in the next generation and serves as a driving force for evolution. It also provides efficient machinery for repairing DNA damage such as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination involves DNA exchange between homologous chromosomes, which is mediated by evolutionarily conserved proteins called recombinases. It is thought that a recombinase binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form a nucleoprotein filament called the presynaptic filament, and that this higher order structure engages in a search for homologous DNA sequences. Once a homologous duplex is found, the presynaptic filament initiates strand exchange. However, when ssDNA regions are created, they are immediately covered by replication protein A (RPA), thereby inhibiting recombinase filament formation even under conditions in which homologous recombination is appropriate. Previous studies suggested that mediator proteins help load recombinases onto ssDNA, and further studies showed that at least two mediators function together in a single recombination pathway. How these mediators coordinate recombinase loading has been unclear. We have addressed this question by reconstituting an in vitro strand exchange reaction with purified proteins including a fission yeast recombinase, Rhp51, two mediators, Rad22 and the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, and RPA. Our results indicate that Rad22 orchestrates the loading of Rhp51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA by acting as a scaffold for nucleating the recombinase filament, whereas the other mediator, Swi5-Sfr1, stabilizes and activates the filament.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A test tube reconstitution of the strand exchange reaction provides further evidence that the two mediators cooperatively promote the nucleation of active recombinase-ssDNA filaments, creating a higher order structure for recombination.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kurokawa Y, Murayama Y, Haruta-Takahashi N, Urabe I, Iwasaki H (2008) Reconstitution of DNA strand exchange mediated by Rhp51 recombinase and two mediators.

It is also an important mechanism for repairing DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and restarting stalled DNA replication forks. Accordingly, HR is essential to the preservation of genome integrity; defects in HR result in hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents and chromosomal aberrations. One conspicuous example of the role of HR in genome integrity is cancer prevention via the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, both of which interact with the Rad51 recombinase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Genetic analyses of DSB repair and mitotic and meiotic HR in the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> have revealed a major pathway for HR that is under the control of proteins in the Rad52 epistasis group &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The Rad51 recombinase belongs to the Rad52 group and plays a key role in HR: Rad51 forms nucleoprotein filaments with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), referred to as presynaptic filaments, and promotes strand exchange with donor DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. A series of analyses suggested that the assembly pathway for Rad51 on ssDNA in vivo is spatiotemporally regulated by replication protein A (RPA) and other Rad52 epistasis group proteins, such as Rad52 and Rad55&#x02013;57 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. RPA immediately binds to ssDNA regions once they are formed (e.g., by the resection of DSB ends or by stalled replication forks). Rad51 alone cannot bind to RPA-coated ssDNA, as RPA has higher affinity for ssDNA than does the Rad51 recombinase. Rad52 assists in loading Rad51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA and in assembling the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. The Rad51 paralogs Rad55 and Rad57, which form a heterodimer, assist Rad51-mediated filament assembly and/or stabilize the filament, leading to efficient strand exchange &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

The stimulation of Rhp51-mediated strand exchange is closely related to its ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity, which is enhanced by the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. The Swi5-Sfr1 complex does not enhance the binding of Rhp51 to ssDNA per se. On the other hand, the mediator enhances the binding of Dmc1 to ssDNA. The molecular bases of the different effects of Swi5-Sfr1 on the two recombinases are still unknown.</p><p>An important issue emerged from our previous study. The Swi5-Sfr1 complex cannot efficiently overcome the inhibitory effect of RPA when RPA is bound to ssDNA prior to Rhp51 binding. This observation is consistent with the observation that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex does not appreciably affect the ssDNA binding capacity of Rhp51. However, the canonical definition of a recombination mediator is that it is an ancillary factor that overcomes the inhibitory effect of RPA on a recombinase.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> Rad52 protein has been shown to interact directly with both RPA and Rad51 and to promote Rad51 filament formation by mediating the displacement of prebound RPA from ssDNA, leading to effective strand exchange mediated by Rad51 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is possible that Rad22 acts exclusively to overcome the inhibitory effect of RPA and that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex acts exclusively to activate Rhp51 filaments. Thus, the concerted actions of these two mediators, Rad22 and the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, would direct the loading of Rhp51 onto ssDNA, leading to efficient strand exchange.</p><p>The work described here addresses this hypothesis with an in vitro system that we have established, which reconstitutes the early central step of homologous recombination. We found that Rad22 overcomes the inhibitory effect of RPA on strand exchange mediated by Rhp51-Swi5-Sfr1, as predicted. However, Swi5-Sfr1 is still essential for strand exchange, and both Rad22 and Swi5-Sfr1 are required for full reaction efficiency. In-depth analysis indicates that the two mediators work concertedly, but not exclusively, by different effects on Rhp51 to form the active filament required for effective DNA strand exchange. In addition, we have shown that the Swi5-Sfr1 mediator stabilizes and activates Rhp51-ssDNA filaments in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas Rad22 is not involved in Rhp51 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rad22 Overcomes the Inhibitory Effect of RPA, but Not of Bacterial ssDNA Binding Protein, on Strand Exchange Mediated by Rhp51-Swi5-Sfr1</title><p>We first determined whether purified Rad22 can overcome the inhibitory effect of RPA on strand exchange mediated by Rhp51-Swi5-Sfr1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows a schematic diagram of the Rhp51-mediated three-strand exchange assay used in this study, in which pairing of a (&#x0002b;) strand DNA (circular ssDNA &#x0005b;css&#x0005d;) with a homologous linear duplex DNA (linear dsDNA &#x0005b;lds&#x0005d;) derived from &#x000f8;X174 phage generates a joint molecule (JM) that is converted to nicked circular DNA (NC) and linear ssDNA products by strand exchange. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Rad22 was bacterially expressed and purified as described in Materials and Methods.

The reactions were started by combining the two mixtures and incubating at 37 &#x000b0;C for 120 min. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, the results clearly indicate that this protocol allows fully efficient reactions initiated from RPA-coated ssDNA and that Rad22 is essential, since reaction efficiency was substantially decreased if it was omitted (compare lanes 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

If this is correct, either or both of the two mediators may function to displace RPA from ssDNA to facilitate the loading of Rhp51, thereby leading to efficient presynaptic filament formation for the strand exchange reaction. In addition, once the correct filament is formed, it should be stabilized to protect against further RPA binding to ssDNA, since the thermodynamic equilibrium favors RPA binding to ssDNA. Either or both of the two mediators may be involved in this stabilization, as well.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we set up pull-down assays in which the conditions were the same as for the strand exchange reaction. We first performed a titration experiment of RPA to css-bound beads (css beads) (10 &#x003bc;M nucleotides).

In the absence of adenine nucleotides, Rhp51 did not bind to ssDNA, indicating that the ssDNA binding activity of Rhp51 requires an adenine nucleotide.

The Swi5-Sfr1 complex alone promoted Rhp51 loading onto ssDNA in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). About 22&#x00025; and 16&#x00025; of the input Rhp51 were pulled down with ssDNA in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNP, respectively. Reactions containing ADP or ATP&#x003b3;S or lacking an adenine nucleotide only weakly supported Rhp51 loading (about 5&#x00025; of the input Rhp51 was pulled down).</p><p>Incubation with Rad22 alone allowed a small amount of Rhp51 to be pulled down (about 10&#x00025;) in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ATP, ADP, ATP&#x003b3;S, or AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). The amounts of Rhp51 that were pulled down were not significantly affected by the absence or presence of the nucleotide cofactor, or by the type of nucleotide in this case. Budding yeast Rad52 associates with RPA-ssDNA to accelerate the Rad51-mediated displacement of RPA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. However, since the binding of Rhp51 to ssDNA required an adenine nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">3</xref>C), the detection of Rhp51 in the pulled-down ssDNA protein complexes may reflect Rhp51 bound to Rad22 that is associated with preformed RPA-ssDNA complexes, rather than the direct binding of Rhp51 to ssDNA. The very low level of Rhp51 pulled down in the presence of ADP and ATP&#x003b3;S in the absence of Rad22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">3</xref>E, lanes 4 and 5) suggests that this basal level of Rhp51 is dependent on Rad22. We also observed Rhp51&#x02013;Rad22 and Rad22&#x02013;RPA interactions in the absence of an adenine nucleotide with an immunoprecipitation assay (unpublished data); similarly, tight Rad51&#x02013;Rad52 and Rad52&#x02013;RPA interactions have been reported for budding yeast and human cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations also support the notion that the small amount of Rhp51 pulled down when Rad22 alone is included is due to the basal level of Rhp51 that binds to Rad22, which in turn is associated with RPA bound to css beads.</p><p>When Rad22 and Swi5-Sfr1 were present, Rhp51 was loaded onto ssDNA (39&#x00025; of input) in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). The amount of Rhp51 loaded under these conditions was much higher than with Swi5-Sfr1 alone or with Rad22 alone, indicating that the two mediators function synergistically to promote Rhp51 loading onto ssDNA. Interestingly, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, but not ATP&#x003b3;S, supported Rhp51 loading under these conditions. Small amounts of pulled-down Rhp51 were detected in the absence of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>G, lane 2) and in the presence of ADP or ATP&#x003b3;S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>G, lanes 4 and 5). These low levels are likely due to Rhp51 associated with ssDNA through the Rad22&#x02013;RPA interaction, as mentioned above.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Rhp51 Displaces RPA from ssDNA</title><p>We next examined which protein factor is directly involved in displacing RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>). RPA was first incubated with css beads. ATP, Rhp51, and/or the two mediators were then added. The mixtures were pulled down, and proteins in the bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Neither Rad22 nor Swi5-Sfr1 could displace RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">4</xref>C). Only high amounts of Rhp51 could displace RPA at a detectable level, indicating that Rhp51 per se, but not the mediators, is an intrinsic factor that displaces RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Swi5-Sfr1 stimulated Rhp51-dependent RPA displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>F), whereas Rad22 alone stimulated displacement only modestly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). See also the graphs of the amounts of displaced RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>H) and bound Rhp51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). At low protein concentrations, Rad22 appeared to assist the loading of Rhp51 onto ssDNA at a considerably high level, as judged by the amount of Rhp51 in the bound fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). However, since the RPA levels in the unbound fractions increased only slightly when Rad22 was also included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>H), the observed increase of Rhp51 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>I may be due to Rhp51 bound to RPA-coated css beads via Rad22. It has been reported that Rad22 interacts with both Rhp51 and RPA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, and the ternary complex can also be detected in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation (unpublished data). However, RPA displacement mediated by Rhp51 with Swi5-Sfr1 was further stimulated by coincubation with Rad22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figure 4</xref>G). This synergistic effect was robust; three independent experiments yielded the same results. Therefore, these results again indicate that the two mediators function coordinately to assist in the displacement of RPA. In the absence of ATP, RPA displacement did not increase from basal levels, even in the presence of all the protein components in a 4-fold excess relative to their concentrations in the standard reaction (unpublished data), indicating that RPA displacement requires ATP. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Rhp51 per se is a displacing factor, since neither Rad22 (unpublished data) nor Swi5-Sfr1 is an ATP-binding protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pbio-0060088-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Rhp51 Per Se Is a Factor That Displaces RPA from ssDNA, and the Two Mediators Synergistically Facilitate This Reaction</title><p>RPA-saturated ssDNA beads were prepared by incubating immobilized ssDNA with RPA (1 &#x003bc;M) and then removing excess RPA by washing the beads with a buffer.

In addition, the recovery of Rhp51 was adenine nucleotide-independent (unpublished data).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, Swi5-Sfr1 stimulated the ATPase activity of Rhp51, but this stimulation was less than that observed when RPA-free ssDNA was used as a cofactor (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g006">6</xref>D).

This synergistic stimulation of Rhp51 ATPase activity is consistent with the coordinated action of these two mediators in DNA strand exchange. In a control experiment, we constructed and purified an Rhp51 Walker B box mutant protein (D to N alteration; Rhp51D244N). The behavior of Rhp51D244N during purification by chromatography was the same as that of the wild-type protein (unpublished data). The mutant did not produce any detectable levels of phosphate generated by ATP hydrolysis. Coincubation of Swi5-Sfr1 with Rhp51D244N did not increase the level of hydrolyzed phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). This result indicates that the ATPase activity stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1 is indeed that of the wild-type Rhp51 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates an in vitro reconstitution of the central step in eukaryotic HR. Our system consists entirely of purified components, including recombinase, RPA, and the Rad22 and Swi5-Sfr1 mediators, and it reflects the genetic requirements for these components in vivo. Using this system, we present for the first time robust biochemical evidence that the two mediators function in a concerted manner to form the active Rhp51 filament. Dissection of the reaction uncovered several of the molecular details of strand exchange. First, Rad22 overcomes the inhibitory effect of RPA, but not of SSB, in strand exchange mediated by Rhp51-Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, Rad22 negates the need for a strict order of addition of protein components, indicating that it coordinates strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, even in the presence of Rad22, Swi5-Sfr1 is essential for Rhp51-mediated strand exchange, highlighting the different fundamental properties of the two mediators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Although the molecular functions of the two mediators are distinct (see below), they function synergistically to promote Rhp51 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, Rhp51, but not Rad22 or the Swi5-Sfr1 mediator, displaces RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g005">5</xref>). We previously showed that Swi5-Sfr1 stimulates the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rhp51 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we demonstrated that Rad22 does not affect the ATPase activity of Rhp51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Most important, Swi5-Sfr1 renders Rhp51 resistant to RPA attack in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), suggesting that Swi5-Sfr1 stabilizes the presynaptic filaments of the recombinase. Since this stabilization is ATP-dependent, Swi5-Sfr1 stimulates the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rhp51, and the mediators stimulate strand exchange mediated by Rhp51. Thus, these mutual relationships strongly suggest that the induced stabilization of the Rhp51 filament reflects a structural/functional alteration upon activation. In contrast, Rad22 is not involved in Rhp51 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g007">Figure 7</xref>F). Based on these results, we propose a model for the early step of the strand exchange reaction involving Rhp51 and the two mediators. Rad22 recruits Rhp51 to RPA-coated ssDNA. Rad22 and Swi5-Sfr1 collaborate in displacing RPA and loading Rhp51 onto ssDNA, but the displacing factor itself is Rhp51, and displacement requires the ATP binding activity of Rhp51. Swi5-Sfr1 activates Rhp51 recruited to RPA by Rad22 to form and stabilize/activate the presynaptic filament in an ATP-dependent manner, promoting processive strand exchange.</p><p>Localization of budding yeast Rad51 to DSB sites requires Rad52 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Although experimental data on whether Rhp51 focus formation is dependent on Rad22 functions are not yet available, at least to our knowledge, this is widely believed to be true as well for fission yeast, based on similarities between the two systems. However, the contribution of Rad22 to our in vitro strand exchange reaction was relatively small. In contrast, the influence of the other mediator, Swi5-Sfr1, is much stronger than that of Rad22. Our results indicate that substoichiometric amounts of Rad22 are optimal to overcome the RPA inhibitory effect on strand exchange (1 to 5&#x0223c;10 ratio of Rad22 to Rhp51; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). This is similar to what has been seen for budding yeast Rad52 in strand exchange &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that Rad22 may only transiently interact with the Rhp51 nucleoprotein filament. Such transient interactions likely mediate assembly of the Rhp51 filament. However, Rad22 (and presumably Rad52) may have (an)other uncovered function(s) involved in the overall in vivo strand exchange reaction. Based on chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Wolner and coworkers suggested that Rad51 binds first, followed by Rad52 and Rad55, to a single DSB site in budding yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. This result apparently contradicts the genetic dependency of Rad51 focus formation on Rad52. Wolner et al. proposed that only the stable binding of Rad51 is detectable by chromatin immunoprecipitation, reflecting the assembly of a nucleoprotein filament catalytically competent for strand invasion. Indeed, Arai et al. have demonstrated that a stoichiometric complex of Rad52 with Rad51 is required for the efficient formation of D-loops via strand invasion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. The strand exchange system we used in this study does not include a strand invasion step, accounting for the small amounts of optimal concentration and a lower dependency on Rad22. An apparent strong dependency on Swi5-Sfr1 may be valid only for a three-strand exchange reaction using a long DNA substrate, an assay that mimics the strand transfer reaction but which does not include strand invasion. Further study will be needed to reveal functional differences between the two mediators in D-loop formation.</p><p>We propose here a two-phase activation mechanism of Rhp51 filament formation. Rhp51 is the only component with ATPase activity among the proteins used in our assay, and this activity enables the protein to bind to ssDNA in an adenine nucleotide-dependent manner. However, Rhp51 alone cannot efficiently promote strand exchange; instead, it requires Swi5-Sfr1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the first phase of activation is one in which Rhp51 is activated to bind ssDNA. Swi5-Sfr1 then further activates ATP-bound Rhp51 to make it catalytically competent for strand exchange. In the second phase of activation, the Swi5-Sfr1 mediator also renders the Rhp51 filament resistant to attack by RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g007">Figure 7</xref>A).</p><p>The ATPase activities of Rad51 proteins from budding yeast and human cells are dependent on the presence of ssDNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, the Rhp51 ATPase is considerably efficient in the absence of ssDNA, and the presence of ssDNA does not enhance its activity. Binding of human Rad51 to DNA can occur in the absence of ATP, but budding yeast Rad51 requires ATP for DNA binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Rhp51 also requires adenine nucleotides for ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These observations indicate that Rad51 properties relevant to ATPase and DNA binding are not universal, and variations may be related to the apparent differences in activation mechanisms for strand exchange. Budding yeast and human Rad51 proteins can carry out a robust strand exchange reaction in the absence of a Swi5-Sfr1-type mediator in vitro. Human Rad51 is already activated for the first step because it can bind ssDNA without ATP. Once ATP is included in the reaction, human Rad51 may be further activated to the catalytically competent state. Budding yeast Rad51 requires ATP to bind DNA, implying that the first stage is similar to that of Rhp51. Once Rad51 binds to ssDNA, its ATPase activity is stimulated, indicating that the second phase of activation readily occurs without a Swi5-Sfr1&#x02013;type mediator. In other words, the basal level of activation of the first phase is higher in human Rad51, and the second phase is higher in budding yeast Rad51. This idea can reconcile the apparent differences among the three recombinases.</p><p>Interestingly, under biochemical conditions that slow ATPase activity, such as the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, strand exchange mediated by human Rad51 is enhanced &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. However, activation by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> holds only for human Rad51, not for budding yeast Rad51 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; or fission yeast Rhp51 (unpublished data). The presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> attenuates the disassembly of Rad51 from ssDNA, resulting in stable filaments on ssDNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, Swi5-Sfr1 stimulates the Rhp51 ATPase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; and stabilizes the filament in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060088-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We cannot explain why these two opposing effects lead to a stimulation of strand exchange, although the differences in the basal-level status of yeast and human Rad51 proteins may be a key to this issue.</p><p>AMP-PNP, but not ATP&#x003b3;S, induces a similar stabilization of Rhp51 that is independent of Swi5-Sfr1. Although Rhp51 binding to AMP-PNP is thought to mimic the transient ATP-bound form during ATP hydrolysis, the AMP-PNP&#x02013;bound and ATP-bound Rhp51 forms are qualitatively different. The AMP-PNP&#x02013;bound form of Rhp51 must be locked in a unique activated state with Swi5-Sfr1, which presumably represents the second phase of activation, since the ATP-bound Rhp51 filament itself is not sufficient for strand exchange. Importantly, AMP-PNP cannot support processive strand exchange. Both the Swi5-Sfr1&#x02013;activated ATP-bound form and the AMP-PNP&#x02013;bound form are competent states that promote homologous pairing and the transient formation of a three-strand intermediate. However, hydrolysis of ATP is required for the subsequent steps of consecutive strand transfer from duplex DNA to ssDNA that result in the formation of a long heteroduplex. Swi5-Sfr1 promotes both of the states that permit homologous pairing and consecutive strand transfer by stimulating the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rhp51. The enhancement of the Rhp51 ATPase activity by Swi5-Sfr1 is not due to an increased ADP&#x02013;ATP exchange rate, but rather to an enhanced turnover rate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. A rapid turnover between the first and the second stages might promote efficient strand exchange. The precise mechanism by which Swi5-Sfr1 induces activation of the Rhp51 filament remains to be clarified in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Proteins.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Rhp51 was purified as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060088-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.
