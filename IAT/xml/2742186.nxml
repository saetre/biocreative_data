When the mitotic cohesin subunit Mcd1 is substituted for Rec8 in Pds5-depleted cells, chromosomes still hypercondense, but synapsis of sister chromatids is abolished.

Duplicated sister chromatids are associated along their length from S phase through metaphase, a process called sister chromatid cohesion. In both mitosis and meiosis, sister chromatids are condensed into rod-shaped structures before cohesion dissolution at anaphase. In meiosis, homologue synapsis, which is a unique chromosome morphogenetic process whereby homologues become juxtaposed along their length, is required for homologue disjunction. Synapsis is mediated by a tripartite synaptonemal complex (SC) located between juxtaposed homologues. The SC is composed of two lateral elements (LEs), which form along the length of each homologue, and a central element (CE) that is between the LEs and appears to connect them. From budding yeast to humans, SC formation and disassembly are believed to play a pivotal role in meiotic recombination and genome integrity (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Sister chromatid cohesion is largely the result of the activity of the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Losada et al., 1998</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces</italic><italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the four subunits of cohesin are called Smc1, Smc3, Mcd1/Scc1, and Scc3/Irr1 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). A meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, Rec8, largely replaces Mcd1 to form the predominant form of cohesin during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). Mutational analysis shows that sister chromatid cohesion is required for proper chromosome structure, including homologue SC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Revenkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). Cohesin itself is a major component of the chromosome axis, which provides a platform for LE formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eijpe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Revenkova et al., 2001</xref>). Remarkably, despite the orders of magnitude difference in chromosome size between yeast and humans, the distance between two LEs of an SC is &#x0223c;100 nm in both, suggesting a fundamentally conserved mechanism of SC formation and structure (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). Consistent with this view, components comprising both the LE and CE are functionally conserved among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>). Together, these observations support the idea that cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion establishes a chromosome foundation required for the formation of higher order chromosome structures, including SCs. These data also raise an interesting question: why does an SC not form between sister chromatids?</p><p>After cohesion is established, its maintenance is facilitated by cohesin-associated factors. One such factor is called Pds5/Spo76/BIMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Denison et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Heemst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panizza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). Both genetic and biochemical studies have confirmed that Pds5 is required primarily for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stead et al., 2003</xref>). Pds5 coimmunoprecipitates with cohesin and colocalizes with cohesin on chromosomes at cohesin-associated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panizza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>). Despite this colocalization, the distinct roles of Pds5 and cohesin are evident because they are not mutually dependent for chromosomal binding. Pds5 localization to chromosomes requires cohesin, whereas cohesin localization to chromosomes does not depend on Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Losada and Hirano, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In meiosis, Pds5 mediates homologue interactions that facilitate SC formation and meiotic recombination in a timely manner, demonstrating a role for chromosome structural dynamics in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Storlazzi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Because <italic>PDS5</italic> is an essential gene in most organisms, studies have used thermosensitive alleles or partially functional alleles of <italic>PDS5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Heemst et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panizza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stead et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The only exception is the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, in which <italic>pds5</italic>-null strains are viable, but vegetative cells exhibit defects in cohesion maintenance after arrest in G2/M phase and increased chromosome loss rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). More pronounced defects were seen during fission yeast meiosis in which chromosomes showed hypercompaction, a <italic>pds5</italic> mutant phenotype not observed in any other experimental system with thermosensitive <italic>pds5</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). The peculiar features of fission yeast meiosis, such as the absence of SC formation, may explain why Pds5 has a unique role in chromosome compaction. Alternatively, previous work with <italic>pds5</italic> thermosensitive alleles may not have completely abrogated Pds5 activity.</p><p>Using a molecular approach, we created a meiosis-conditional <italic>pds5</italic> allele in which Pds5 is depleted completely and specifically during meiosis in budding yeast. This organism has well-defined meiotic processes similar to those of other eukaryotes and an abundance of characterized chromosomal markers, including LE components Red1 and Hop1 and the CE component Zip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rockmill and Roeder, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hollingsworth and Byers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sym et al., 1993</xref>). Like previous work in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), this study reveals only minor defects in cohesion, indicating that sister chromatid cohesion is largely intact in the absence of Pds5. We also find that meiotic cells without Pds5 are largely blocked at a pachytene-like stage. In contrast to previous work with a thermosensitive <italic>pds5</italic> allele, we find that homologues fail to synapse and become hypercondensed when Pds5 is depleted. In addition, an SC-like structure forms between sister chromatids in these mutant cells. Finally, our data indicate that Pds5 inhibits SC formation between sister chromatids by specifically modulating the activity of the meiotic cohesin Rec8.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pds5 colocalizes with Rec8 on meiotic chromosomes in a cell cycle&#x02013;dependent manner</title><p>We investigated the role of Pds5 in meiotic chromosome morphological changes. First, we used an affinity-purified antibody against yeast Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Noble et al., 2006</xref>) to monitor Pds5 levels by conducting immunoblots in cells induced to undergo synchronous meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Pds5 is present in cells at all stages of the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stead et al., 2003</xref>) but is not detected in cells entering meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, t = 0). Pds5 is detected at low levels 2 h after meiotic entry and reaches peak levels by 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This time frame corresponds to meiosis I, from premeiotic S phase through metaphase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Pds5 is no longer detected after 12 h of induction, as cells have exited meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). These data show that Pds5 is degraded as a prelude to meiotic entry, is resynthesized during early meiosis when sister chromatid cohesion is established and homologue pairing occurs, and is degraded late in meiosis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of Pds5 protein level and localization to chromosomes during meiosis.</bold> (A) Immunoblot analysis of Pds5 in wild-type (WT) and <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells during meiosis.

Early in meiosis I, Pds5 colocalizes with the cohesin subunit Rec8 along the entire length of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top). A similar pattern was previously seen with epitope-tagged Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). During anaphase I, Pds5 is predominantly localized to the centromeric region of the chromosome, as indicated by the chromosome colocalization with Rec8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom). This observation contrasts with a previous one that epitope-tagged Pds5 is not detectable during anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). We also find that Pds5 is not detectable on chromosomes in cells that have exited meiosis (unpublished data). This pattern is identical to that observed for Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). The dynamic pattern of Pds5 localization to meiotic chromosomes is directly correlated with the times when Pds5 is present in cells as assayed by immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to perform a high resolution analysis of Pds5 association with chromosomes in staged pachytene cells by deleting the <italic>NDT80</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). We assayed four representative chromosomal regions: two centromeric loci (<italic>CEN1</italic> and <italic>CEN3</italic>) and two chromosome arm loci (<italic>CARC3</italic> and <italic>CARL2</italic>). Cohesin binds robustly at these loci during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>). Rec8 cohesin also robustly binds these loci during meiosis, except for <italic>CARL2</italic>, which has a very low level of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>). During meiosis, we found that both Pds5 and Rec8 were highly enriched at loci near centromeres and present at lower levels at arm loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Therefore, Pds5 and Rec8 colocalize to chromosomes during meiosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Pds5 is required for meiotic cell progression beyond prophase I</title><p>Because Pds5 is degraded before meiotic entry, we were able to generate a meiosis-conditional null allele of <italic>PDS5</italic>, which depletes Pds5 only during meiosis. To construct this allele, we replaced the endogenous promoter of <italic>PDS5</italic> with a mitosis-specific promoter from <italic>CLB2</italic> to create <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic>. This allele expresses <italic>PDS5</italic> in vegetative cells but is completely repressed during meiosis. Consequently, Pds5 is absent from cells undergoing meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells appear normal in cell viability and cell cycle progression during vegetative growth (unpublished data). To address whether Pds5 is required for meiotic nuclear division, we induced <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells to undergo synchronous meiosis and monitored chromosome segregation by fluorescence microscopy. Meiotic nuclear division is largely absent in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This observation is similar to that observed with the thermosensitive allele <italic>pds5-1</italic> at a nonpermissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). About 90% of <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells have only a single aster of microtubules, which is indicative of a prophase I arrest, whereas only 10% of mutant cells form a short bipolar spindle, which is indicative of metaphase I, a ratio that persisted even after 12 h of induction of meiosis (unpublished data). Therefore, when Pds5 is absent, the vast majority of cells are arrested before metaphase I.</p><p>To further investigate the role of Pds5, we examined whether chromosome association of meiotic cohesin (shown with Rec8) depends on Pds5 using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and ChIP. In wild-type cells at pachytene, Rec8 localizes along the entire length of meiotic chromosomes, forming linear rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, top; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810107/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). In <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> meiotic cells, chromosomes are strikingly compacted into short rods, as shown by both Rec8 and DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). Our finding that Rec8 localizes to chromosomes when Pds5 is absent confirms previous data generated with the <italic>pds5-1</italic> mutant allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), but the highly compacted rods are a novel phenotype not previously observed in budding yeast. High resolution mapping by ChIP revealed that Rec8 associates with chromosomes at four representative chromosome regions in a similar manner in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells staged at pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and not depicted). Consistent with the aforementioned result, similar levels of Rec8 are detected by immunoblotting in wild-type and <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells during meiosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810107/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). As in wild-type cells, the LE components Red1 and Hop1 were localized to meiotic chromosomes in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S1 B), but in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells, Red1 and Hop1 formed short rods similar to those of Rec8. These results indicate that Pds5 is required for regulation of axial length but not for loading of meiotic cohesin Rec8, Red1, or Hop1 to chromosomes.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Pds5 mediates chromosome morphological changes during meiosis.</bold> (A) Chromosome morphology at meiotic prophase I.

In wild-type cells at pachytene, a pair of homologues forms two prominent parallel lines heavily stained by silver, which correspond to the two LEs of an SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Each LE is formed by one chromosome consisting of sister chromatids. Therefore, the width of the SC is judged by the distance between the two LEs, which in wild-type cells is &#x0223c;103 &#x000b1; 9 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 24). In <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells, we observed that 8 out of 15 cells have 16 or more identifiable short stretches of SC-like structures in spread nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). LEs were symmetrical, and their ends appeared open and even. The observed SC-like structures were therefore less likely to be formed by either nonhomologous chromosome pairing or the folding back of the same chromosome. The width of the SC-like structure on each chromosome in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells is &#x0223c;107 &#x000b1; 13 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 26), which is not statistically different from the width of the SC formed between homologues in the wild-type cells.

The shorter SC is consistent with the increased axial compaction found in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). These results suggest that SCs can form between sister chromatids in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells, which implies that Pds5 normally functions to inhibit this intersister SC formation.</p><p>To provide further evidence for intersister SC formation, we examined meiosis in haploid yeast cells. The use of haploids eliminates homologues and halves the chromosome number, simplifying the assessment of intersister SC formation. We forced haploids to enter meiosis and assayed for SC formation. In wild-type haploids, only minimal SCs form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), which are believed to be between nonhomologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loidl et al., 1991</xref>). The failure of SC formation in wild-type haploids leads to accumulation of SC components in a polycomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, top). In contrast, large polycomplexes rarely accumulate in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> haploids, and most cells show &#x0223c;16 short Zip1-staining rods, which is the haploid chromosome number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, bottom). If SC formation in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> haploids were a consequence of nonhomologous chromosome pairing, the number of Zip1 rods would have been reduced to as few as eight.

To test this idea, we first asked whether cohesin activity is required for the phenotypes we observed in <italic>P<sub>CLB2</sub>PDS5</italic> cells. In the absence of meiotic cohesin Rec8, meiotic chromosomes fail to establish a linear chromosome axis regardless of whether Pds5 is present or absent (Fig. S4 C).

Only small amounts of the mitotic cohesin subunit Mcd1 are present as cells enter meiosis, and this protein is no longer detected 4 h after induction of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>MCD1</italic> promoter is repressed during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chu et al., 1998</xref>).

When Pds5 is absent, most cells are arrested at prophase I with highly compacted chromosomes, and an SC-like structure forms between sister chromatids. Cohesion between sisters is largely intact, as only small amounts of precocious sister separation are observed. DSBs form but are not fully resolved, indicating that DSB repair is defective. Our work significantly extends previous observations of the role of Pds5 in formation of meiotic chromosome structure. These novel observations may arise because our experiments involved a meiotic <italic>pds5</italic>-null allele, whereas previous studies involved thermosensitive <italic>pds5</italic> alleles. These thermosensitive alleles make mutated proteins that still bind to chromosomes and therefore retain residual Pds5 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Storlazzi et al., 2008</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>Previous work in budding yeast indicated that Rec8 promotes SC formation and homologue synapsis because neither of these events occurs when Mcd1 replaces Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>). We show that Pds5 serves an important inhibitory role because when Pds5 is absent, SCs form between sisters rather than homologues. This intersister SC formation requires Rec8 because when Mcd1 replaces Rec8 in Pds5-depleted cells, no SCs form. These data are consistent with the idea that Pds5 restrains the SC-promoting activity of Rec8. This reasoning seems at odds with the situation in vertebrates, where intersister SCs form when <italic>REC8</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). This result suggests that vertebrate Rec8 serves as an inhibitor, much as Pds5 does in yeast. One possibility is that yeast and vertebrate cells prevent SC formation between sisters by distinct mechanisms. Alternatively, vertebrates also contain other meiosis-specific cohesins, such as SMC1&#x003b2; and STAG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prieto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Revenkova et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, deleting vertebrate <italic>REC8</italic> could generate meiotic cohesin with a reduced affinity for Pds5 to relieve the inhibition of intersister SC formation, but these other meiosis-specific subunits could also provide cues for SC formation or have acquired the roles entirely. Further experiments assessing the chromosomal binding of one or both Pds5 orthologues in vertebrates and the consequence of their absence can distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>A remarkable feature of meiotic recombination is its preference for using homologues as repair templates during DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haber, 2000</xref>). This distinction must be made to ensure that DSBs promote synapsis between homologues rather than the more proximal sister chromatid. One model posits that fusion of sister chromatid axes removes the choice so that only the homologue presents a target for exchange and SC formation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). In such a model, Pds5 could be directly required for axial fusion or could promote it by modulating the activity of other chromosomal factors, such as cohesin. Indeed, our EM analysis of the chromosome axis in Pds5-depleted cells suggests that sister axes are apart. Similarly, sister axes are often split in <italic>Sordaria</italic><italic>macrospora</italic> cells bearing a thermosensitive allele of <italic>spo76-1/pds5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Heemst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Storlazzi et al., 2003</xref>). This splitting provides two sister axes in close proximity and, therefore, a potential substrate on which DSBs can nucleate intersister SC formation. During homologue pairing, discrete loci initiate SC formation simultaneously along the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zickler, 2006</xref>). Localized sister chromatid and axial separation is thought to be part of the process used for homologue exchange (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). Paradoxically, localized sister separation would seem to provide a sister template to compete with the homologue for pairing rather than promoting it. One solution to this paradox is that axial separation is a consequence of localized dissolution of cohesion, but the separated sisters are then blocked for cohesion reestablishment. We propose that Pds5 exerts its inhibitory function at this step. Cohesin may remain bound but in a form that is inhibited for cohesion reestablishment, as was previously proposed for the regulation of S phase cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guacci, 2007</xref>). Work from both budding and fission yeast shows that Pds5 serves as an inhibitor to cohesion establishment by opposing the action of the conserved establishment factor Eco1 on cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>). This result could explain how Pds5 acts as an inhibitor of cohesion and, as such, potentially of intersister SC formation even after sister axial splitting occurred as part of homologue exchange.</p><p>One might expect that sister chromatid exchange would increase in <italic>pds5</italic>-null cells at the expense of homologue exchange because SCs form between sisters rather than homologues. Previous work on <italic>pds5</italic> thermosensitive alleles suggested that Pds5 serves to bias recombination toward interhomologue exchange rather than intersister exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Heemst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Storlazzi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kateneva and Dresser, 2006</xref>), which is also consistent with such an expectation, but we do not see evidence for such a shift because the level of unequal sister chromatid exchange remains low in Pds5-depleted cells compared with that in the wild type (unpublished data). Moreover, we find that DSBs are not completely repaired in Pds5-depleted cells in budding yeast, suggesting that intersister SC formation alone is insufficient to promote sister chromatid exchange/repair. Cohesin is essential for efficient repair of DSBs in vegetative cells (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Given that Pds5 interacts with cohesin to modulate cohesin function, the impairment of DSB repair in the absence of Pds5 during meiosis is not surprising. In addition, only part of the machinery necessary for sister exchange may be set up for intersister SC formation in <italic>pds5</italic>-null cells, possibly leading to the persistence of DSBs.</p><p>A model for chromosome structure in which chromosome condensation is regulated by cohesin was first proposed more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>). It posits that cohesin binds at intervals along the chromosome arms, creating DNA loops between cohesin-binding sites that can be compacted. In this model, higher cohesin density forms smaller loops, whereas lower cohesin density forms larger loops, which would result in lesser and greater axial compaction, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>). Experimental data consistent with this view came from studies of meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). In both budding and fission yeast cells lacking Pds5, meiotic chromosomes hypercondense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; this study). In fission yeast <italic>pds5</italic> mutants, Rec8 still binds chromosomes, but the binding sites are more widely spaced, a result that is consistent with the idea that loop size is inversely proportional to axial condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). In budding yeast, cohesin binding to chromosomes appears to be normal, but sister chromatid cohesion is partially lost (this study; unpublished data). Importantly, chromosomes still hypercondense in Pds5-depleted cells when ectopically expressed Mcd1 replaces Rec8. These data suggest that cohesin is required to provide an axial template to permit proper chromosome compaction. In vertebrate cells, chromosomes become hypercondensed when the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit SMC1&#x003b2; has been deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Revenkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike budding yeast, vertebrate cells have high levels of mitotic cohesin, and REC8-containing meiotic cohesin is still present in cells lacking SMC1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). Because these complexes bind chromosomes, one or both types of cohesin are probably able to serve as axis templates and permit loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). The reduced cohesin activity in vertebrates that leads to a partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion could mimic a yeast Pds5 depletion phenotype, resulting in axial hypercompaction and the formation of heterogeneous chromatin loops.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are diploids isogenic to SK1, except the <italic>sir2&#x00394;</italic> strains, which are haploids (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810107/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).
