For unknown reasons, at some point in childhood or adolescence, the body's own immune system starts attacking and destroying the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. Once the majority of islet cells are destroyed, patients can no longer produce insulin to regulate their blood sugar and must depend on strict diets and insulin injections. Scientists are trying to understand the early events during the development of the disease. There are two fundamentally different kinds of cell death in cells of higher animals and humans, called apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis (also called programmed cell death) is an organized, clean way in which cells die without spilling their contents and without causing an inflammatory immune response. They are simply gobbled up by other cells that serve as the body's garbage collectors. Necrosis, on the other hand, is a more messy process and one that does activate the immune system and cause local inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The scientists who did this study are interested in the early stages of islet cell death. Specifically, they wanted to know whether islet cells during the early events of autoimmune diabetes die via apoptosis or necrosis. Earlier experiments to address this question had yielded no clear-cut results.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>All the experiments for this study were done in cultured cells in the laboratory. For the most part, the researchers used rodent islet cells, and then they confirmed the crucial finding in human islet cells. They grew the cells under conditions that resembled, to the best of their knowledge, the early stages of diabetes, which caused some of the cells to die. They then did a variety of tests to see whether that cell death was through apoptosis or necrosis, and the results showed that the latter was the case. They also identified some of the key factors involved in promoting and executing the necrosis process.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Does This Mean?</title><p>One must always be careful to extrapolate from laboratory results like these. With this caveat, the results suggest that early in the development of diabetes cells die by necrosis, and they point to some of the key factors involved. These are important results that will inform future studies toward the goal of understanding autoimmune diabetes well enough to prevent or stop its development.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Find More Information Online?</title><p>The following Web sites provide information on autoimmune diabetes.</p><p>MedlinePlus pages on type 1 diabetes:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000305.htm" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000305.htm</ext-link></p><p>Web site of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=101982" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=101982</ext-link></p><p>Pages on type 1 diabetes from the Canadian Diabetes Association:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/type1.asp" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/type1.asp</ext-link></p><p>Type 1 diabetes pages from the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=213575" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=213575</ext-link></p><p>UK National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/index.htm" ext-link-type="uri">http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/index.htm</ext-link></p><p>American Diabetes Association Web site:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.diabetes.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.diabetes.org</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings indicate that IL-1 induces &#x003b2;-cell necrosis and support the hypothesis that macrophage-derived cytokines may participate in the initial stages of diabetes development by inducing &#x003b2;-cell death by a mechanism that promotes antigen release (necrosis) and islet inflammation (HMGB1 release).</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Results from rodent and human cells suggest that necrosis of &#x003b2;-cells plays a role in the early stages of type 1 diabetes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin-dependent diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by selective destruction of insulin-producing &#x003b2;-cells found in pancreatic islets of Langerhans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

Alone or in combination with interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1 has been shown to stimulate &#x003b2;-cell expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the resulting production of nitric oxide impairs &#x003b2;-cell oxidation of glucose to CO<sub>2</sub>, reduces the activity of the Krebs cycle enzyme aconitase, and reduces islet ATP levels by more than 4-fold &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent on &#x003b2;-cell depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, events that are mediated by the inhibition of ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels due to the accumulation of ATP that is produced by mitochondrial oxidation of glucose to CO<sub>2</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The targeted disruption of mitochondrial oxidation resulting in the reduction of cellular levels of ATP is one mechanism by which nitric oxide impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The damaging actions of cytokines on &#x003b2;-cell function appear to be selective for &#x003b2;-cells, as IL-1 fails to impair the ability of &#x003b1;-cells to oxidize glucose to CO<sub>2</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is a highly organized, energy-dependent process that is characterized by caspase activation, the ordered cellular degradation of proteins and organelles, and maintenance of plasma membrane integrity.

Treatment with IL-1 resulted in morphological changes that included cell swelling and the appearance of holes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), changes that are consistent with a necrotic form of cell death. Nitric oxide appears to be responsible for the morphological changes induced by IL-1, as NMMA attenuated RINm5F cell swelling and the formation of cytoplasmic holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The morphological changes in RINm5F cells undergoing apoptosis were strikingly different from the alterations induced by IL-1.

This morphological analysis of the effects of IL-1 on RINm5F cell viability suggests that cytokine-induced &#x003b2;-cell death is not caused by classical apoptotic mechanisms and may occur by necrotic mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>IL-1 Stimulates &#x003b2;-cell DNA Damage in a Nitric Oxide-Dependent Manner</title><p>The TUNEL assay is commonly used to detect DNA damage in cells, and the results have frequently been used as evidence to support an apoptotic pathway of cell death. Using the TUNEL assay, the effects of IL-1 on the integrity of RINm5F and rat islet cell DNA were examined. In this assay, DNA strand breaks were detected by the incorporation of fluorescein dUTP (green fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and nuclei were visualized by co-staining with DAPI (blue fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g004">Figure 4</xref>) or colocalized with insulin-containing islet cells (using a CY3-conjugated secondary antibody; red fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Representative fluorescent micrographs indicate that the morphology of TUNEL-positive RINm5F cells following treatment with IL-1 is significantly different from the morphology of cells treated with the apoptosis inducer camptothecin. While TUNEL staining in most RINm5F cells treated with IL-1 appeared uniform throughout the nuclei and colocalized with DAPI staining, there were a number of RINm5F cells in which the TUNEL staining appears to spill out of the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g004">4</xref>C, white arrows), indicating a loss of nuclear membrane integrity.

Camptothecin-induced TUNEL and DAPI staining appears more intense and punctate, indicating that chromatin condensation has occurred.</p><p>Similar to RINm5F cells, treatment of rat islets for 48 h with IL-1 resulted in DNA damage in &#x0223c;50% of islet cells, and over 95% of this DNA damage was found in &#x003b2;-cells, as determined by immunolocalization of TUNEL-positive cells with insulin-containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). IL-1-induced DNA damage was prevented by NMMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), indicating that nitric oxide is primarily responsible for the DNA damage observed in rat islet cells treated with IL-1. IL-1-induced DNA damage was compared with damage caused by the apoptosis inducer staurosporine. Treatment of rat islets for 48 h with staurosporine resulted in TUNEL-positive staining in &#x0223c;50% of islet cells, and this DNA damage was observed in both insulin-containing and non-insulin-containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

Taken together, these findings suggest that IL-1 stimulates DNA damage in &#x003b2;-cells, and that nitric oxide is a primary mediator of this damage.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, IL-1 stimulates the release of low levels of HMGB1 by RINm5F cells, which is first apparent following a 24-h incubation, with higher levels released following a 48-h incubation. In a similar manner, IL-1 stimulated the release of HMGB1 by rat islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). NMMA attenuates IL-1-induced HMGB1 release by both rat islets and RINm5F cells, indicating that nitric oxide is a mediator of &#x003b2;-cell necrosis.

Treatment of human islets with this cytokine mixture stimulated a &#x0223c;7 fold increase in nitrite production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g010">Figure 10</xref>A), and nitric oxide production correlated with high levels of iNOS expression (unpublished observation). Importantly, under conditions in which human islets produce nitric oxide, HMGB1 accumulated in the supernatant of these islet cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g010">Figure 10</xref>B). HMGB1 release appears to be dependent on the production of nitric oxide, as the iNOS selective inhibitor AG attenuated the production of nitric oxide and the release of HMGB1 by human islets. The apoptosis inducer staurosporine failed to stimulate the production of nitric oxide or release of HMGB1. Alone, neither IL-1, TNF, nor IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated nitric oxide production, iNOS expression, or the release of HMGB1 from human islets following a 24- or 48-h incubation (unpublished data), providing evidence that the increased production of nitric oxide by human islets in response to the combination of cytokines is required for the release of HMGB1 by human islets. Overall, these findings are consistent with the effects of IL-1 on rat islets and RINm5F cells, in that they provide direct evidence that nitric oxide mediates the release of HMGB1, a marker of necrotic cell death, by human islets in response to cytokine treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by an inability to regulate blood glucose levels due to the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells.

In support of this model, previous studies have shown that feeding rodents a diet deficient in essential free fatty acids, known to deplete resident macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;, attenuates diabetes induced by the chemical toxin streptozotocin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d; and the natural progression of diabetes in BB rats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, a number of studies have shown that the local release of IL-1 by activated intraislet macrophages in rodent and human islets leads to &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and damage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this report we have evaluated the cellular mechanisms by which the macrophage-derived cytokine IL-1 kills &#x003b2;-cells. Using three different methods to evaluate cell viability, MTT oxidation, neutral red uptake, and TUNEL staining (DNA damage), we show that IL-1 induces &#x003b2;-cell death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g001">Figures 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Nitric oxide appears to be one mediator of &#x003b2;-cell death, as NOS inhibition attenuated cell death in response to IL-1, and nitric oxide, supplied exogenously using donor compounds, reduced &#x003b2;-cell viability. The mechanism by which IL-1 stimulates &#x003b2;-cell death is both morphologically and biochemically different from known inducers of apoptosis. Morphologically, IL-1-induced &#x003b2;-cell death is characterized by cell swelling and diffuse TUNEL staining&#x02013;changes indicative of the loss of membrane integrity, or necrosis. In response to inducers of apoptosis, the morphology of dying &#x003b2;-cells differs drastically from the effects of IL-1. Apoptosis induction results in cell shrinkage and tight, punctate TUNEL staining, consistent with the form of cell death that we have observed with known inducers of apoptosis. To investigate biochemical mechanisms responsible for &#x003b2;-cell death, we evaluated the effects of IL-1 on caspase-3 activation and PS externalization (annexin staining). Caspase-3 activity was chosen because it the executioner caspase activated by initiator caspases involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. While many reports have suggested that IL-1 induces &#x003b2;-cell death by apoptosis, we show that IL-1 fails to activate caspase-3 or to stimulate annexin V staining in islets or RINm5F cells. In contrast, known apoptosis inducers stimulated 6- to 9-fold increases in caspase-3 activity and significantly increased annexin V staining on RINm5F cells and rat islet cells. The lack of RINm5F cell and islet caspase activity following treatment with IL-1 is not surprising, as IL-1 stimulates &#x003b2;-cell production of nitric oxide, and nitric oxide has been shown to inhibit caspase activity by S-nitrosation of the active site cysteine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Since these findings suggest that the macrophage-derived cytokine IL-1 does not induce apoptosis, we sought to identify whether IL-1 kills &#x003b2;-cells by necrosis. The morphological changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and the diffuse TUNEL staining in RINm5F cells and rat islet cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g005">5</xref>) induced by IL-1 treatment are consistent with a necrotic type of cell death. To provide biochemical evidence in support of IL-1-induced &#x003b2;-cell necrosis, the effects of this cytokine on the release of HMGB1 from &#x003b2;-cells was examined. HMGB1 is a chromatin-binding protein that functions to distort the double helix, allowing proper physical interactions between transcription factors and chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent studies have shown that HMGB1 is released from cells dying by necrosis, but it remains tightly bound to chromatin in cells undergoing apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b044">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we show that IL-1 stimulates HMGB1 release from RINm5F cells and rat islets in a nitric oxide-dependent manner, and that HMGB1 release is not affected by the inhibition of caspase activity. These findings suggest that IL-1-induced HMGB1 release is mediated, at least in part, by nitric oxide, a conclusion further supported by the ability of nitric oxide to directly stimulate HMGB1 release by RINm5F cells and rat islets. Importantly, under conditions in which RINm5F cells or islets have been forced to undergo apoptosis, HMGB1 was not released. Overall, this morphological and biochemical evidence supports &#x003b2;-cell necrosis as the primary mechanism by which IL-1 induces &#x003b2;-cell death, and that this death pathway is mediated, in part, by nitric oxide.</p><p>While IL-1 is sufficient to inhibit the function and to induce the death of rat &#x003b2;-cells, alone, the exogenous addition of IL-1 does not inhibit the function or induce death of human &#x003b2;-cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. A combination of the cytokines IL-1, TNF, and IFN-&#x003b3; is required to impair human &#x003b2;-cell function and induce islet cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Treatment of human islets for 24- or 48-h with IL-1 + IFN-&#x003b3; + TNF results in inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and mitochondrial aconitase activity, effects attenuated by the iNOS inhibitors NMMA and AG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the local release of IL-1 by intraislet macrophages in response to TNF + IFN-&#x003b3; + LPS treatment results in inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is attenuated by inhibitors of iNOS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. These findings support a role for nitric oxide as a mediator of cytokine-induced &#x003b2;-cell damage in human following exposures of 24 and 48 h. In contrast, extended incubation (for 6&#x02013;9 d) of human islets with IL-1 + TNF + IFN-&#x003b3; has been reported to inhibit insulin secretion and induce &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis in a nitric oxide-independent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. The latter findings have led to speculation that human islets are less sensitive to nitric oxide than are rodent islets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparisons of cellular responses to cytokines across species are complicated by the genetic background of each species. This is especially true when using human islets in which the genetic background is different for each individual human islet preparation. In contrast, studies with rodent islets are usually performed with a specific strain of rat or mouse. Importantly, Nerup and coworkers have shown that the ability of IL-1 to inhibit &#x003b2;-cell function and to induce iNOS expression varies in three different rat strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. These findings suggest that the genetic background, even within a given species of animal, contributes to the islet response to cytokines. Taking this into account, we have evaluated the effects of IL-1, TNF, and IFN-&#x003b3; on nitric oxide production and HMGB1 release by human islets. In three of five preparations, the combination of cytokines stimulated HMGB1 release by human islets by a mechanism that was sensitive to inhibition by the iNOS inhibitors AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030017-g010">Figure 10</xref>) and NMMA (unpublished data). Importantly, in two human islet preparations the combination of cytokines failed to stimulate HMGB1 release and also failed to stimulate nitric oxide production or iNOS expression. The reason for this lack of response to cytokines in two of the human islet preparations is unknown; however, it has been reported that elevated levels of heat-shock protein 70 attenuate the ability of &#x003b2;-cells to express iNOS and produce nitric oxide, and the strain differences in response of rat islets to IL-1 have been reported to be associated with differences in levels of heat-shock protein 70 expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b067">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Taking this into account, our findings suggest that when human islets produce sufficient levels of nitric oxide in response to cytokines, one consequence is the release of HMGB1. In contrast, when human islets fail to respond to cytokines by producing nitric oxide, they also do not release HMGB1.</p><p>HMGB1 is not only a marker of cells undergoing necrosis, but it is also immunologically active. It has been shown to bind to Toll2 and Toll4 receptors and to activate nuclear factor &#x003ba;B-dependent gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b070">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;, and antagonists of HMGB1 have been shown to attenuate sepsis in animal models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;. It is well established that necrotic cells release immunological adjuvants that activate APCs and that amplify and sustain T cell-dependent immune responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b074">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, Rovere-Querini et al. showed that necrotic HMGB1-deficient cells have a reduced capacity to activate APCs, and that HMGB1 neutralization attenuates the ability of supernatants derived from necrotic wild-type cells to activate APCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. HMGB1 also appears to enhance primary antibody responses to soluble antigens and to enhance cytotoxic lymphocyte responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. While caution should be exercised when extrapolating in vitro findings to mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, it is tempting to speculate on the potential role of intraislet macrophage activation as a precipitating event in the development of autoimmune diabetes. In previous studies, we have shown that the 10&#x02013;15 resident macrophages found in islets, when activated, produce IL-1 to levels sufficient to inhibit &#x003b2;-cell function in a manner similar to that occurring with the exogenous addition of this cytokine to islets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030017-b078">78</xref>&#x0005d;. We now show that, at these same concentrations, IL-1 kills &#x003b2;-cells by necrotic mechanisms that are associated with the release of the immunological adjuvant HMGB1&#x02013;a molecule known to augment APC activation and cytolytic responses of T cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Colleen Bratcher for expert technical assistance.
