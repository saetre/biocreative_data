Endothelium of the cerebral blood vessels, which constitute the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, strictly controls adhesion and trafficking of leukocytes into the brain. Investigating signaling pathways triggered by the engagement of adhesion molecules expressed on brain endothelial cells, we previously documented the role of ICAM-1 in activation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of several actin-binding proteins and subsequent rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. In the present study, we show that, whereas PECAM-1 is known to control positively the trans-endothelial migration of leukocytes via homophilic interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, PECAM-1 engagement on brain endothelial surface unexpectedly counteracts the ICAM-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. We present evidence that the PECAM-1-associated tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for ICAM-1 signaling, suggesting that its activity might crucially contribute to the regulation of ICAM-1 signaling by PECAM-1. Our findings reveal a novel activity for PECAM-1 which, by counteracting ICAM-1-induced activation, could directly contribute to limit activation and maintain integrity of brain vascular endothelium.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adhesion molecules</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>ICAM-1</kwd><kwd>PECAM-1</kwd><kwd>signaling pathways</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Leukocyte extravasation into tissues involves a complex set of adhesion molecules at the surface of leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Tethering or rolling of leukocytes is followed by their firm adhesion to endothelium, their locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schenkel <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) at the endothelial surface, which itself precedes diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Butcher 1991</xref>). In the central nervous system, brain endothelial cells are joined by continuous tight junctions, constituting the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB), which strictly limits leukocyte infiltration, as well as drug access to the cerebral compartment. Nevertheless, in pathological situations, such as multiple sclerosis, viral or bacterial infections, numerous activated lymphocytes, monocytes or neutrophils can cross the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Carson <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Engelhardt 2006</xref>).</p><p>On the endothelial apical surface, ICAM-1 is a key player in firm adhesion and locomotion steps. In addition, PECAM-1, which is expressed in endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils and specific T lymphocyte subsets, is directly involved in diapedesis via homophilic interactions between migrating leukocytes, particularly monocytes/neutrophils and endothelial intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Muller <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>). Paradoxically, however, gene deficiency for PECAM-1 was recently found to increase the number of activated leukocytes crossing the BBB, suggesting that PECAM-1 might play a more complex role in leukocyte extravasation than previously recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Graesser <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p><p>These adhesion molecules have been well documented as signal transducers in leukocytes and endothelial cells, in as much as leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells as well as antibody cross-linking were shown to activate multiple signaling pathways in both cell types. Using brain endothelial cell lines, we previously provided evidence that ICAM-1 antibody cross-linking led to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, protein kinase C activation, phosphorylation of cortactin and other actin-binding proteins by the Src tyrosine kinase, activation of RhoA GTPase, and subsequent rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Durieu-Trautmann <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Greenwood <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Carman and Springer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Shaw <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Millan <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Besides, PECAM-1 has been abundantly documented as a signaling receptor which can transduce either inhibitory or stimulatory signals with cell-specificity, such as inhibition of the antigen receptor signaling in T lymphocytes or stimulation of the intracellular calcium level in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Newman <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Newman and Newman 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, no evidence to our knowledge has emerged on how the two activated signaling pathways coupled to ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 are integrated by endothelial cells and to what extent they might contribute in a sequential and coordinated manner to the endothelial response to leukocyte adhesion. In the present study, we addressed the question of a putative cross-talk between these two signaling pathways by sequential antibody cross-linking of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 at the surface of endothelial cells: this experimental approach has been shown by us and others to mimic leukocyte interaction with endothelial cells and to allow the biochemical analysis of endothelial response to leukocyte adhesion. The rat brain endothelial cell line RBE4 was used here as a robust model of brain microvascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Schweitzer <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hoffmann <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>); We report in the present study that PECAM-1 engagement unexpectedly down-regulated ICAM-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. The functional relevance of this finding is discussed in terms of regulation of BBB integrity in inflammatory situations.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Abs and reagents</title><p>Mouse mAb to rat ICAM-1 (clone 1A29), Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II (OX6) and Transferrin receptor (OX26) were purchased from Serotec (Wiesbaden, Germany).

Similar results were observed using HBMECs (not shown). To further assess a functional role for SHP-2 in ICAM-1-coupled signaling pathways, we established endothelial cell lines stably expressing a dominant negative form of SHP-2 (Dn-SHP-2) or the wild type enzyme (WT-SHP-2) as a control; for technical reasons, HBMECs were used in this approach. Following antibody cross-linking of ICAM-1, we observed that expression of Dn-SHP-2 abolished the ICAM-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3b</xref>, lane h), pointing to SHP-2 as a positive regulator of the Src-cortactin pathway in endothelial cells.

Moreover, these findings suggest that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, as an upstream mediator of both PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 signaling pathways, might be a key player in the cross-talk identified here between these pathways.</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that, beyond its ability to contribute to the formation of &#x0201c;docking&#x0201d; sites for circulating leucocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barreiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Carman <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), ICAM-1 behaves as a signal transducer, activating multiple signaling pathways in endothelial cells. ICAM-1 signaling in endothelial cells thus appears to participate in the trans-endothelial migration of leucocytes to inflammation sites. We previously identified multiple signaling pathways activated in rat brain endothelial cell lines, following ICAM-1 cross-linking or leukocyte adhesion. In particular, we demonstrated activation of the tyrosine kinase Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Etienne <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Adamson <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Etienne-Manneville <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). In spite of the short C-terminal domain of ICAM-1, which comprises 27 amino acids in rat and 28 amino acids in human, biochemical studies have demonstrated that ICAM-1 is capable of binding a number of intracellular proteins in endothelial cells: the actin-binding protein &#x003b1;-actinin, the microtubule-associated &#x003b2;-tubulin, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ezrin, a linker between integral membrane proteins and the actin-cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Federici <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Celli <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that SHP-2 might associate with tyrosine phosphorylated ICAM-1, even though ICAM-1 does not contain a <italic>bona fide</italic> SHP-2 binding site, such as a consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pluskota <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). In the present study, the moderate amount of SHP-2 bound to ICAM-1 (compared with SHP-2 bound to PECAM-1) following antibody cross-linking may be related to a very low level of ICAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (not detected here or in a previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Greenwood <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>)) or may reflect interaction with a putative non-conventional motif in the ICAM-1 cytoplasmic domain. Alternatively, interaction between ICAM-1 and SHP-2 might be indirect, via an unidentified protein linker.</p><p>SHP-2 is known as an upstream mediator of multiple signaling pathways, but contrasting data in various cell systems present it either as a negative or a positive regulator of RhoA and other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pluskota <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lacalle <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kontaridis <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Here we showed that a dominant negative form of SHP-2 (Dn-SHP-2) or calpeptin inhibition of SHP-2 enzymatic activity largely inhibited the ICAM-1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and actin stress fiber formation. These results, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, clearly establish that SHP-2 is positively involved in ICAM-1 signaling in endothelial cells, upstream of the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin as well as RhoA-mediated actin cytoskeleton rearrangements.</p><p>PECAM-1 has been convincingly shown to transduce inhibitory signals in a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, through SHP-2 binding to a tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Masuda <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Henshall <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Patil <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cicmil <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gratzinger <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jackson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Newman and Newman 2003</xref>). The results of the present study showed that PECAM-1 engagement concomitantly induced SHP-2 binding to PECAM-1 and blocked the SHP-2-dependent phosphorylation of cortactin and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton evoked by ICAM-1. This is to our knowledge the first evidence that PECAM-1 engagement can negatively regulate the signaling pathways coupled to another leukocyte adhesion molecule in endothelial cells. This observation strongly suggests that leukocyte adhesion and transmigration trigger in endothelial cells a complex set of interconnected positive and negative signalings which cooperate for controlling the dynamics of endothelial response. Although our study cannot firmly establish a direct role for SHP-2 in PECAM-1-coupled inhibition of ICAM-1 signaling, it is tempting to speculate that activated PECAM-1, by efficiently recruiting SHP-2, may sequester it away from ICAM-1 and inhibit RhoA and Src activation. This hypothesis is in line with the interpretation proposed for PECAM-1 inhibition of growth factor or antigen receptor signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Newman <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Newman and Newman 2003</xref>). Alternatively, other proteins involved in the maintenance of endothelial junction integrity such as &#x003b2;- or &#x003b3;-catenin, PLC-&#x003b3;, which are also known to interact with the cytosolic domain of PECAM-1, might be involved in the regulatory loop identified here between ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ilan and Madri 2003</xref>). However, we did not observe in the present study any detectable association between PECAM-1 and &#x003b2;- or &#x003b3;-catenin (not shown).</p><p>We and others provided compelling evidence that ICAM-1-induced signaling and subsequent actin cytoskeleton remodeling was directly involved in the process of trans-endothelial migration of activated leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Durieu-Trautmann <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Greenwood <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Carman and Springer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Shaw <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Millan <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of ICAM-1 coupled signalling pathways, using Rho kinase inhibitors or calcium chelators, largely prevented the migration of activated lymphocytes across RBE4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Adamson <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Etienne-Manneville <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibition of Rho GTPases with protein prenyltransferase inhibitors prevented leukocyte recruitment to the CNS and attenuated clinical signs of disease in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Walters <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Complementary experiments demonstrated that the ICAM-1-induced Src-cortactin pathway is essential for trans-endothelial migration of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2006</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that leukocyte adhesion promotes the remodeling of the apical endothelial plasma membrane into projections that surround adherent leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Carman and Springer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Shaw <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barreiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Doulet <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). These structures, referred to as endothelial docking structures or transmigratory cups, are essential to promote firm adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes through paracellular as well as transcellular routes. Formation of these docking structures results from the dynamic redistribution of several adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 and actin polymerization. The current study strongly suggests that PECAM-1 engagement during paracellular extravasation of leukocytes, which has been well-documented to contribute to leukocyte diapedesis, may also regulate this process by limiting the ICAM-1 induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, downstream of the formation of docking structures. Future studies will aim at evaluating the functional relevance of these findings, by evaluating the role of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain and associated signaling in regulation of leukocyte transmigration across brain endothelial cells. In addition, because PECAM-1 is not present in endothelial docking structures, it will be necessary to identify the cellular compartments where the signalling cross-talk reported here may take place. It can be hypothesized that caveolae or caveolin-rich microdomains may facilitate the functional interaction between ICAM-1- and PECAM-1 signalings in as much as PECAM-1 is present in these structures whereas ICAM-1 was recently shown to be recruited in similar structures following antibody cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Millan <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Viegas <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Further experiments will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We sincerely thank Dr Sylvie Cazaubon and Dr Clara Nahmias for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript and the Wellcome Trust for a programme grant to JG.
