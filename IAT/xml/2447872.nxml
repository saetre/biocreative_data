This phenotype is not dramatic, as indicated by the limited differences observed in the LD50 between knock out and wild-type mice. However, this result is meaningful as indicated by its reproducibility in several mouse models and in several genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, the same phenotype is observed in a knock out model and in a model of mice carrying a mutation homologous to the main Human CD associated mutation (1007 fs). This mutation is usually considered as a loss of function mutation in Human while it has been associated with an over stimulation of the IL-1&#x003b2; pathway in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Maeda1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

These observations suggest that Nod2 has a special role in the intestine as also indicated by the association between NOD2 mutations and CD. Indeed, the intestinal phenotype of Nod2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is characterized by an increased KC secretion and a stronger infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils and finally by a lower bacterial count. In parallel with the lower bacterial cell count, we found less apoptotic damages in the mucosa and a limited bacterial dissemination associated with a better survival.</p><p>If Nod2 is a susceptibility gene for <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, it also mediates protection against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to know if the observed resistance toward Yersinia infection could be seen with another enteropathogenic strain, we analysed the survival curves after intragastric inoculation by 5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>.

Thus, the negative role of Nod2 observed after <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection appears to be the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>Our data suggest that <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic><underline>m</underline>ay interact with Nod2 signalling pathways. The ability of <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> to multiply in PPs and to spread to deeper tissues is dependent on a plasmid that is common to all <italic>Yersinia</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Cornelis1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This virulence plasmid (pYV) encodes a type III secretion apparatus and several secreted proteins called Yersinia outer proteins (Yops). Given the intracellular localization of Nod2, the effector Yops seem to be good candidates when searching for bacterial components able to interact with Nod2 signalling. The Yop effectors have been shown to interfere with several signal transduction pathways within eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Stainier1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, paralyzing phagocytosis, cell migration, NF-&#x003ba;B activation and other functions that are required for innate and adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Heesemann2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies are now necessary to identify how <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> is able to interact with Nod2 signalling.</p><p>Because NOD2 is a susceptibility gene for CD, the impact of our observations for CD patients is questionable. Several lines of evidence indicate that PPs may be important areas for the occurrence of CD lesions. A spatial relationship between CD and PPs is supported by the observation that CD lesions mainly occur in areas rich in lymphoid follicles including the distal ileum and the colon. In addition, Fujimura et al. have shown that the inaugural CD lesions are centered by lymphoid follicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Fujimura1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional studies are now needed to further study the role of lymphoid tissues for the pathogenesis of CD.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that several data support a link between <italic>Yersinia</italic> species and CD. First, the clinical presentation of CD and Yersiniosis are both characterized by ileitis or ileocolitis with granulomas and in some cases by reactive arthritis.

On days 6 and 10, loosely adherent cells were collected and replated in fresh medium. Bone marrow-derived macrophages BMMP were prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002769-Jackson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, cells obtained from the bone marrow were cultured for 5 to 6 days in DMEM medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FCS (Dominique Dutscher, Brumath, France), 10&#x00025; L-cell-conditioned medium, 100 U of penicillin ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 100 &#x000b5;g of streptomycin ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a concentration of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>Eighteen hours prior to infection, cells were washed with DMEM medium without antibiotics and were incubated in medium with 10&#x00025; FCS and 5&#x00025; L-cell-conditioned medium. Bacteria from fresh selective agar plates were inoculated into 2 ml LB medium with selection antibiotics and incubated over-night at 26&#x000b0;C with shaking. The number of bacteria was deduced of the optical density measure at 600 nm. 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria were then added into 2 ml of complete cell culture medium without antibiotics and incubated 30 min at 26&#x000b0;C. After a temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C, bacteria were then added to cell cultures at a calculated MOI of 10 in 12 well plates. To facilitate bacterial adhesion to the cells, the plates were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min. After 120 min, gentamycin (30 &#x000b5;g/ml) was added in order to kill extra-cellular bacteria. At 3 hours and 6 hours postinfection, the infected macrophages were washed gently three times with PBS and lysed by incubation in 0.5 ml of 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS. After incubation for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C, the lysates were removed and the wells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of PBS, and the lysates and rinses from each well were pooled. The number of released viable bacteria was determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions on selective LB agar. For cytokine analyses supernatants were harvested 6 h after infection and cytokines were analyzes using commercially available Elisa Assays (BD Bioscience) according to manufacturer's instructions. For counts of cell death, cells were stained with 0.04&#x00025; Trypan blue and counted in a hemocytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two group comparisons were performed using unpaired t-test for data with Gaussian distribution and Mann-Whitney test if distribution was not Gaussian. Survival times were analyzed using Kaplan-Meyer curves and comparisons were performed using the Log-Rank test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA) and SAS 8.02 (SAS, Cary, N.C., USA) software packages for PC. A value of P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
