Structurally, the tight junction is comprised of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins that are thought to assemble into stable complexes to determine function. In this study, we measure tight junction protein dynamics in live confluent Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney monolayers using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and related methods. Mathematical modeling shows that the majority of claudin-1 (76 &#x000b1; 5%) is stably localized at the tight junction. In contrast, the majority of occludin (71 &#x000b1; 3%) diffuses rapidly within the tight junction with a diffusion constant of 0.011 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Zonula occludens-1 molecules are also highly dynamic in this region, but, rather than diffusing within the plane of the membrane, 69 &#x000b1; 5% exchange between membrane and intracellular pools in an energy-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that the tight junction undergoes constant remodeling and suggest that this dynamic behavior may contribute to tight junction assembly and regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: FLIP, fluorescent loss in photobleaching; MBCD, methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin; PA, photoactivable; TER. transepithelial resistance; ZO, zonula occludens.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The epithelial tight junction, or zonula occludens (ZO), separates apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains and serves as a selectively permeable barrier to regulate paracellular diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farquhar and Palade, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claude and Goodenough, 1973</xref>).

ZO-1, the first tight junction protein identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevenson et al., 1986</xref>), includes three tandem PDZ protein interaction domains that mediate binding to other plaque and transmembrane tight junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beatch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haskins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebnet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezprozvanny and Maximov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamazaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanning et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, ZO-1 and the structurally related proteins ZO-2 and -3 interact with perijunctional filamentous actin both directly and indirectly through other proteins such as &#x003b1;-catenin and cingulin, thereby anchoring the tight junction to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajasekaran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itoh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cordenonsi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wittchen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanning et al., 2002</xref>). Claudins bind ZO-1, -2, and -3 via a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>). The importance of this interaction is demonstrated by the association of a ZO-2 mutation that reduces claudin binding with familial hypercholanemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlton et al., 2003</xref>) as well as a study of cells lacking ZO-1 and -2, which fail to recruit claudins and do not develop barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Umeda et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Together with the functional importance of claudin&#x02013;ZO-1/-2 interactions, the multitude of interactions among tight junction proteins demonstrated by in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitic and Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cordenonsi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kale et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Itallie and Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2005</xref>) has led to the hypothesis that the steady-state tight junction is a large complex maintained by abundant protein cross-links. By analogy, this model is supported by a recent study of the adherens junction that demonstrates that epithelial cadherin, &#x003b1;-catenin, and &#x003b2;-catenin form a stable complex with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). However, only one study has directly assessed the dynamic behavior of tight junction proteins in the absence of external stimuli. That work concluded that fluorescent-tagged claudin-1 expressed in fibroblasts is not mobile within the tight junction&#x02013;like strands that develop in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the tight junction is widely viewed as a static structure under steady-state conditions.</p><p>Our study of fluorescent tight junction fusion proteins expressed in epithelial monolayers raised the possibility of occludin flow within the tight junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>). Although this observation could represent the flow of tight junction protein complexes, as occurs for cadherin&#x02013;catenin complexes at the adherens junction, it could also suggest that binding interactions at the tight junction are far more dynamic than previously thought. Therefore, we directly assessed protein dynamics within the tight junction and now show that tight junction proteins are highly dynamic in resting steady-state epithelial monolayers. Each protein studied displays distinct dynamic behavior, reflecting different mechanisms of protein movement. These data demand that our current model of tight junction molecular structure be revised and may provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms that allow rapid tight junction remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The multiprotein complex within the tight junction is dynamic at steady state</title><p>We recently reported the generation and validation of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 fluorescent fusion proteins using EGFP and monomeric RFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>). Each of these fusion proteins is accurately targeted to the tight junction and localizes with the corresponding endogenous protein, as assessed biochemically and morphologically at steady state and in response to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>). Moreover, expression of these fusion proteins does not disrupt normal function either in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>) or in vivo (unpublished data). Therefore, we conclude that these fluorescent fusion proteins are suitable tools for analysis of tight junction protein dynamics in live cells.</p><p>Time-lapse imaging of confluent MDCK epithelial cell monolayers expressing fluorescent-tagged occludin frequently demonstrated small fluctuations in fluorescent intensity despite stable barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>). Although such fluctuations were not seen in fixed monolayers, they could potentially represent imaging artifacts as a result of slight movements of live cells within the z plane. To distinguish between artifact and actual movement of occludin within the tight junction, occludin dynamics were assessed by monitoring FRAP in confluent monolayers with established intercellular junctions. These experiments show that the majority of tight junction&#x02013;associated occludin is available for exchange; the mobile fraction is 71 &#x000b1; 3% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). This observation was unexpected because occludin interacts with many proteins at the tight junction, and the generally accepted model of steady-state tight junction structure is of a highly stable multiprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzalez-Mariscal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seth et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Individual tight junction proteins display distinct FRAP behaviors in polarized epithelia.</bold> (A) EGFP-occludin, &#x02013;claudin-1, &#x02013;ZO-1, and &#x02013;&#x003b2;-actin were studied by FRAP.

To determine whether tight junction proteins remain bound to one another during exchange, the mobility of ZO-1, which binds directly to occludin, was assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuse et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Similar to occludin, 69 &#x000b1; 5% of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 is available for exchange (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). However, unlike occludin, ZO-1 exchanges more rapidly, with a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of only 119 &#x000b1; 21 s. Thus, despite well-characterized binding interactions between ZO-1 and occludin, these data suggest that there is a continuous and rapid dissociation of the majority of each of these proteins from one another within fully assembled steady-state tight junctions.</p><p>The unexpected differences in FRAP kinetics between ZO-1 and occludin prompted investigation of the exchange kinetics of claudin-1 and tight junction&#x02013;associated &#x003b2;-actin. Claudin-1 has a small mobile fraction of 24 &#x000b1; 5% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Thus, in contrast to occludin and ZO-1, only a minority of tight junction&#x02013;associated claudin-1 undergoes exchange at the tight junction. Consistent with reports that actin is highly dynamic at cell&#x02013;cell contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>), the majority of junction-associated &#x003b2;-actin exchanges rapidly with a mobile fraction of 98 &#x000b1; 6% and a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 106 &#x000b1; 18 s. Remarkably, the combination of mobile fraction and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of fluorescent recovery is unique for each of these four representative proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>Recent work suggests that interactions between claudin proteins and ZO-1 or -2 are necessary for tight junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Umeda et al., 2006</xref>) and that the stability of steady-state tight junction function increases with the duration of postconfluent monolayer culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang and Goodenough, 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the aforementioned distinct FRAP behaviors may differ if studied shortly or at prolonged intervals after confluence. To assess this, FRAP behaviors of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1, and &#x003b2;-actin were measured in monolayers 1, 3, and 10 d after confluence, representing steady-state kinetics present in newly formed (1 d), assembled (3 d), and older, stable (10 d) MDCK monolayers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). At 1 d after confluence, the increased ZO-1 mobile fraction and decreased &#x003b2;-actin <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, both relative to values at 3 d, suggest that the assembling tight junction is highly dynamic. Although the tight junction is far more stable at 3 d after confluence, there is an increase in dynamic behavior 10 d after confluence that is manifested as reduced <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for both occludin and tight junction&#x02013;associated &#x003b2;-actin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Although the significance of this late increase in exchange rates is not clear, it is possible that the structure of the fully mature tight junction is specially modified to allow rapid regulation and fine-tuning of function. In any case, these data demonstrate that in stark disagreement with prevailing models of the tight junction, the multiprotein complex within the tight junction is highly dynamic at steady state.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table I.</label><caption><title>The dynamic behavior of tight junction proteins changes after confluence</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top">Postconfluent<break/>time</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top">Mobile<break/>fraction</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>d</italic></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>%</italic></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>s</italic></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top">Occludin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="char" char="." valign="top">1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top">74 &#x000b1;

To assess the effect of cholesterol depletion on occludin exchange, monolayers were treated with methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (MBCD). This reduced TER by 45 &#x000b1; 1% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and also sharply reduced the occludin mobile fraction from 73 &#x000b1; 4 to 18 &#x000b1; 2% (P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol depletion had no effect on ZO-1 FRAP behavior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Because MBCD treatment affects both membrane fluidity and vesicular traffic, these data suggest that occludin may recover by mechanisms that require these processes.</p><p>To further characterize the general mechanisms of occludin and ZO-1 exchange, FRAP behavior was assessed in metabolically depleted monolayers. Reduction of cellular ATP levels by 65 &#x000b1; 5% had no effect on occludin FRAP dynamics, although TER decreased by 56 &#x000b1; 2% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In contrast, ATP depletion reduced the ZO-1 mobile fraction to 36 &#x000b1; 6% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>) and the &#x003b2;-actin mobile fraction to 19 &#x000b1; 4% (not depicted). These findings show that occludin and ZO-1 dynamics require distinct factors. Furthermore, the differential regulation of occludin and ZO-1 dynamics by these treatments supports the conclusion that occludin and ZO-1 do not form stable complexes at the tight junction.</p></sec><sec><title>The primary mechanism of occludin exchange is diffusion within the plasma membrane</title><p>Although fractions of the occludin and ZO-1 available for exchange are similar, the differences in <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and sensitivity to perturbations that alter membrane function or metabolic energy content suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in the observed FRAP behaviors of these proteins. To preliminarily determine the mechanism of occludin recovery at the tight junction, an &#x0223c;10-&#x003bc;m segment of the tight junction was bleached, and recovery was monitored in the center and edges of this region. Fluorescent recovery began at the edges; the center of the bleached region recovered only after a lag of &#x0223c;500 s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Because total occludin content within the tight junction is constant at steady state and fluorescent recovery represents the recruitment of unbleached occludin molecules into the bleached region, this suggests that occludin moves by diffusion within the membrane. Two separate approaches were used to directly assess occludin movement at steady state. First, the fluorescent loss in photobleaching (FLIP) technique was used to continuously bleach a small region of the tight junction. Consistent with occludin diffusion within the membrane, loss of fluorescence occurred most rapidly in areas directly adjacent to the bleached region, whereas fluorescence loss occurred more slowly at greater distances from the bleached region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). A complementary experiment made use of an occludin construct containing photoactivatable (PA) GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, occludin fluorescence was activated at two tight junction regions. Although total tight junction fluorescence remained constant after activation, occludin fluorescence decreased progressively in areas of activation and increased in adjacent regions of the tight junction, demonstrating occludin exchange between these areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These data confirm that a principal mode of occludin exchange is diffusion within the membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Occludin diffuses within tight junction.</bold> (A) EGFP-occludin&#x02013;expressing cells within confluent monolayers were studied by FRAP after photobleaching elongated tight junction regions.

This is critical, as occludin has frequently been reported in cytoplasmic vesicles, and endocytic removal of occludin from the tight junction correlates with barrier loss in response to a variety of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furuse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lapierre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ye et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clayburgh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwarz et al., 2007</xref>). Intracellular occludin-containing vesicles are readily seen within transfected monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>). However, fluorescent intracellular vesicles were not apparent after activation of tight junction&#x02013;associated PA-GFP&#x02013;occludin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting that at steady state, large quantities of occludin do not routinely leave the tight junction to be concentrated in cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition, FLIP analysis showed that continuous photobleaching of the entire intracellular region, sparing the tight junction, only slightly diminished tight junction&#x02013;associated occludin fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Thus, the recognized intracellular pool of occludin does not exchange rapidly with tight junction&#x02013;associated occludin at steady state. As an additional test of this conclusion, the guanine exchange factor inhibitor brefeldin A, which blocks multiple exocytic and endocytic processes, was applied to monolayers. Brefeldin A did not inhibit occludin FRAP at the tight junction (unpublished data), confirming that intracellular pools of occludin are not transported to the tight junction at rates sufficient to explain the observed occludin FRAP. However, brefeldin A treatment decreased epithelial barrier function progressively over 2 h, suggesting that membrane traffic may be important to the maintenance of tight junction integrity. Collectively, these data show that the observed occludin FRAP behavior occurs primarily by diffusion within the membrane and that delivery of occludin from an intracellular pool participates either to a minor extent or not at all.</p></sec><sec><title>Tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 exchanges with an intracellular ZO-1 pool</title><p>As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, although ZO-1 and occludin display similar mobile fractions at the tight junction, ZO-1 fluorescence recovers more rapidly than does occludin. Thus, experiments similar to those used to assess the mechanisms of occludin recovery were used to determine the mechanisms of ZO-1 recovery at the tight junction. In contrast to the results obtained with occludin, similar rates and extents of fluorescent recovery were seen at the center and edges after bleaching an extended &#x0223c;10-&#x003bc;m region of the tight junction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In addition, FLIP analysis showed that continuous bleaching of a small region of the tight junction resulted in only limited fluorescence loss in adjacent and distant regions of the tight junction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These data suggest that ZO-1 does not recover by diffusion within the membrane but by exchange with a separate pool. This was unexpected, as it is difficult to detect intracellular ZO-1 pools immunohistochemically. Although some nuclear EGFP&#x02013;ZO-1 is present in subconfluent monolayers, which is consistent with a study of nuclear ZO-1 in undifferentiated epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottardi et al., 1996</xref>), only faint intracellular fluorescence is detectable in cells expressing EGFP&#x02013;ZO-1. FLIP analysis with continuous intracellular bleaching was used to evaluate the presence or absence of intracellular ZO-1 pools. This maneuver resulted in progressive decreases in tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). As these experiments were performed only on confluent monolayers where no nuclear ZO-1 is detected, the intracellular pool of ZO-1 is likely cytoplasmic. Tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 fluorescent loss measured by FLIP occurs with a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 89 &#x000b1; 17 s, similar to the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 119 &#x000b1; 21 s for exchange measured by FRAP. Therefore, these data demonstrate that a large fraction of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 exchanges continuously with an intracellular pool. These studies also show that a small nonexchangeable pool of ZO-1 exists at the tight junction. The interactions that anchor this subset of ZO-1 at the tight junction are not defined, but this nonexchangeable pool increases between 1 and 3 d after confluence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that anchoring is related to the process of tight junction maturation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 exchanges with an intracellular pool.</bold> (A) EGFP&#x02013;ZO-1&#x02013;expressing cells within confluent monolayers were studied by FRAP after photobleaching elongated tight junction regions.

To assess the mechanisms of claudin-1 exchange, FLIP experiments similar to those described for occludin and ZO-1 were performed. Continuous bleaching of a small region of the tight junction showed rapid loss of claudin-1 fluorescence in the immediately adjacent area but not at more distant regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This is consistent with the limited mobile fraction observed in the initial claudin-1 FRAP experiments and suggests that claudin-1 also exchanges by diffusion within the tight junction. Continuous intracellular photobleaching had no significant effect on tight junction&#x02013;associated claudin-1 fluorescence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), suggesting that exchange between the tight junction and intracellular claudin-1 pools is minimal during the interval of these experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Limited claudin-1 exchange occurs by diffusion within the tight junction.</bold> (A) EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1&#x02013;expressing cells within confluent monolayers were studied by continuous photobleaching of a region of the tight junction.

Although the majority of ZO-1 at the tight junction is exchangeable, the mobile fraction is &#x0223c;70% in monolayers with fully assembled tight junctions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that a small but significant fraction of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 is nonexchangeable. Therefore, it is possible that the immobile pool of tight junction&#x02013;associated claudin-1 is anchored by binding to nonexchangeable ZO-1 molecules. To explore this possibility, an EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal YV motif necessary for PDZ binding was expressed in MDCK cells. Although trafficking of EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> to the tight junction is defective, localization to cell contact sites does occur in some cells. Remarkably, tight junction&#x02013;associated EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> displayed a mobile fraction of 13 &#x000b1; 2%, which is significantly lower than that of wild-type EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1 (P &#x0003c; 0.05).

In contrast, the exchange of lateral membrane&#x02013; and tight junction&#x02013;associated occludin is necessary for the simulations to accurately model the physical observations, suggesting that this exchange does contribute to FRAP and FLIP behaviors and that lateral membrane occludin may diffuse more rapidly than tight junction occludin. An immobile fraction is not necessary for the accurate modeling of occludin dynamic behavior, suggesting that the observed immobile fraction may reflect technical limitations rather than physical retention.</p><p>The <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of claudin-1 recovery in small area FRAP experiments was similar to that of occludin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, claudin-1 exchange was modeled with a diffusion constant of 0.011 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is identical to that used for occludin. An immobile fraction representing 60% of total claudin-1 was included to model the large immobile fraction observed experimentally. This model accurately simulates small (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>) and large (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>) area FRAP experiments. As an alternative to a large claudin-1 immobile fraction, models in which the diffusion constant for claudin-1 was reduced were developed. These were able to display recovery at 600 s but did not accurately represent the experimentally determined <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of claudin-1 recovery. Moreover, the model including a large claudin-1 immobile fraction accurately simulated FLIP experiments bleaching tight junction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 G</xref>) and intracellular regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 H</xref>). Thus, the simulation suggests that tight junction&#x02013;associated claudin-1 and occludin recover by diffusion within the membrane at similar rates. However, in contrast to occludin, claudin-1 has a prominent immobile fraction.</p><p>As suggested by the physical data, ZO-1 could not be modeled by simple diffusion within membrane compartments. The physical observations that prevented such modeling were that (1) recovery within different parts of photobleached areas occurred uniformly; (2) overall recovery rates after bleaching large and small areas were identical; and (3) tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 fluorescence decreased after continuous intracellular photobleaching. To model the dynamic behavior of ZO-1, the exchange between tight junction and intracellular pools was allowed to occur as described by the following equation: <inline-formula><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[10pt]{article} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pmc} \usepackage[Euler]{upgreek} \pagestyle{empty} \oddsidemargin -1.0in \begin{document} \begin{equation*}{\mathrm{J}}_{{\mathrm{ZO-1}}}=({\mathrm{K}}_{{\mathrm{f\hspace{.167em}ZO-1}}}{\times}[{\mathrm{ZO}}-1]_{{\mathrm{cyt}}})-({\mathrm{K}}_{{\mathrm{r\hspace{.167em}ZO}}-1}{\times}[{\mathrm{ZO}}-1]_{{\mathrm{TJ}}}).\end{equation*}\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula> This required 60% of ZO-1 to be cytosolic, with the remaining 40% localized to the tight junction and divided into exchangeable and nonexchangeable pools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). This model accurately simulated small (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 I</xref>) and large (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 J</xref>) area FRAP experiments. The model also predicts the observed small 9% decay in regions adjacent to the photobleached region in FLIP experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 K</xref>) as well as the large decreases in tight junction fluorescence seen in intracellular FLIP experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 L</xref>). Therefore, this model accurately simulates all observed ZO-1 behavior on the basis of exchange between tight junction and intracellular pools without any diffusion within the tight junction. Notably, a nonexchangeable pool at the tight junction is required to accurately model ZO-1 behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The explosion in recognized tight junction&#x02013;associated proteins and identification of interactions between these proteins has led to the widespread agreement that the tight junction is a complex of multiple cross-linked proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>). This has led to the development of a model in which assembled tight junctions in intact steady-state epithelia are static and is consistent with observations of stable structure and barrier function over time.</p><p>However, relatively little direct evidence supports this view. For example, behavior of fluorescent-tagged claudin proteins has been studied to only a limited degree in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. In the latter, which do not form tight junctions, claudin proteins assemble into long fibrils within the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2003</xref>). Although these strands interact with one another and frequently move within the plasma membrane, FRAP analysis showed that claudin-1 within these strands is immobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2003</xref>). This observation lent support to the belief that proteins within the tight junction are immobile or static.</p><p>The data presented here directly contradict the static model of tight junction structure. One piece of evidence supporting this conclusion is that each of the tight junction&#x02013;associated proteins studied displays distinct dynamic behaviors and mechanisms of exchange. Approximately 70% of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 and occludin are each present within the mobile fraction. This might imply that they traffic as a complex. However, subsequent investigation demonstrated that the rates and mechanisms of exchange differ for these proteins. Therefore, they do not exchange in complex with one another. Although only 24% of claudin-1 is in the mobile fraction, a number far greater than that suggested by experiments in fibroblasts, it should be noted that this also indicates that the majority of tight junction&#x02013;associated claudin-1 resides within an immobile pool. The interactions that anchor claudin-1 at the tight junction remain to be determined, but the experiments using claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> suggest that stable binding between claudin-1 and PDZ domains of ZO-1, -2, and other tight junction proteins are not required. In fact, interaction between the claudin-1 C terminus and PDZ domains may promote claudin-1 exchange within the tight junction, as claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> has a smaller mobile fraction than wild-type claudin-1. Consistent with the conclusion that interactions with endogenous full-length claudin or other proteins stabilizes EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> at the tight junction, a previous study has shown that claudin-1&#x02013;EGFP, in which EGFP placement at the C terminus obstructs interactions with ZO-1, displays limited exchange within the tight junction&#x02013;like strands that develop in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, interactions between the claudin-1 C terminus and PDZ domains are important in directing claudin-1 to localize at the tight junction, as claudin-1<sup>&#x00394;YV</sup> protein trafficking to cell contact sites was clearly defective.</p><p>The data clearly demonstrate that the majority of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and &#x003b2;-actin do not remain bound to one another at steady state. How can a model of tight junction structure be developed to accommodate these new data? One point that must be considered is that 31% of tight junction&#x02013;associated ZO-1 does not exchange over the course of these FRAP and FLIP experiments. Together with the mathematical modeling of ZO-1 behavior, which required the inclusion of a nonexchangeable pool to accurately simulate the physical data, these data suggest that a stable pool of ZO-1 exists at the tight junction. Although the functional differences between exchangeable and nonexchangeable ZO-1 and the relevance of these pools to tight junction function remain to be determined, the studies of general perturbations, including temperature modulation, cholesterol chelation, and ATP depletion, make it clear that any relationships between FRAP behavior and barrier function must be complex and dependent on many factors. Similar questions may be asked about occludin diffusion within the tight junction membrane, although controversy remains regarding the function of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furuse et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakakibara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Itallie and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong and Gumbiner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Mrsny, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schulzke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). It is also likely that the constant movement of proteins within the tight junction and the observed exchange of these proteins with extra-tight junction pools are important to the rapid structural and functional responses to stimuli. In the absence of such plasticity, it is perhaps hard to understand how barrier function can be modified in minutes.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here show that each of the proteins studied is surprisingly dynamic at the tight junction and that these dynamics are kinetically distinct as a result of different mechanisms of exchange. These results demand that the prevailing model of tight junction structure be revised to incorporate the idea that interactions between tight junction proteins are transient and characterized by continuous engagement and release. Future characterization of the structural domains and elements that control the dynamic behaviors of tight junction proteins promises to finally provide molecular characterization of tight junction regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b2;-actin and EGFP&#x02013;claudin-1 constructs were generated as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen and Turner, 2005</xref>).

Monolayers were transferred to bicarbonate-free HBSS supplemented with 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, at 37&#x000b0;C and mounted on a custom-designed temperature-controlled stage (Brook Industries) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min to allow equilibration. Confocal scanning light microscopy was performed by using a microscope system (TCS SP2 AOBS; Leica) with a 63&#x000d7; NA 1.40 oil immersion objective and a pinhole between 1 and 2 AU. EGFP fusion proteins were excited using the argon 488-nm laser line and emission gated between 490 and 530 nm. FRAP experiments were performed using the FRAP module of confocal software (Leica). A region of interest to be bleached was defined, and maximum laser power at the appropriate wavelength for an empirically determined number of iterations was used to bleach signals. Bleaching time was usually &#x0003c;10 s, resulting in bleaching throughout the full thickness of the tight junction. After bleaching, images were taken within the same focal plane at regular intervals (between 2 and 30 s) to monitor fluorescence recovery.</p><p>To test the continuity of different cellular pools of tight junction proteins, FLIP experiments were performed using the FLIP module of the confocal software. Observation and photobleaching were performed in the same scan for different regions of the scanning field. Continuous scanning was performed with no delay between scans for 5&#x02013;15 min. For tight junction bleaching, a small area at the tight junction was continuously bleached at full laser power. For intracellular bleaching, a large area that encompasses &#x0223c;80% of the intracellular area at the tight junction level was continuously bleached at full laser power. In either case, the remainder of the field was observed using the laser at &#x0223c;10% power.</p><p>For inhibitor experiments, monolayers were treated with appropriate drugs in HBSS for 1 h before use.
