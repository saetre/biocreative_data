Kimura, that the rate of molecular evolution will be inversely related to the level of functional constraint. But the application of this principle would not be interpretable without a corresponding understanding of gene structure and organization (i.e., the genetic code and its degeneracy, the signals for initiation and termination of translation, intron/exon junction sequences, etc.). Knowledge of equivalent scope and depth does not exist for <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory sequences. These sequences often contain docking sites for transcription factors (TFs), but the number of binding sites and the spacing between them vary, and binding-site sequences are often degenerate to the point that they can only be characterized probabilistically. Even more striking is the lack of data relating functional evolution of gene expression to <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory sequence evolution. There are good reasons to expect the two may be only weakly correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b02">2</xref>]: De novo binding sites can readily evolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b03">3</xref>]; individual TFs often bind at multiple locations and may be exchangeable, and the spacing between binding sites can rapidly evolve. Thus, despite recent progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b05">5</xref>], rules have yet to be elucidated for the functional molecular evolution of this critically important component of the genome.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>even-skipped (eve)</italic> produces seven transverse stripes along the anterior&#x02013;posterior (A&#x02013;P) axis of a blastoderm embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Expression of these early stripes is regulated by five distinct <italic>cis-</italic>elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The best studied of them, the stripe 2 enhancer (S2E), contains multiple binding sites for five TFs, the activators bicoid and hunchback, and the repressors giant, Kruppel, and sloppy-paired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b08">8</xref>]. Maternal deposition of bicoid mRNA in the anterior pole of the egg regulates expression of the other gap genes, which are expressed in broad A&#x02013;P diffusion gradients. Spatiotemporal control of <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 expression is brought about through the integration of these graded signals by the S2E.</p><p>We previously used a reporter transgene assay to investigate <italic>eve</italic> S2E functional evolution in three <italic>Drosophila</italic> species in addition to <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> The sister taxa <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. yakuba</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b09">9</xref>] are separated by approximately 5 million years ago (MYA), while the ancestor they share with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> existed approximately 10&#x02013;12 MYA. In contrast, <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> is a member of a different group and is believed to have split from the <italic>melanogaster</italic> clade approximately 40&#x02014;60 MYA. As expected for a trait as ontogenetically important as primary pair-rule stripe formation, the temporal progression of <italic>eve</italic> stripe expression is nearly identical among the species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">1</xref>D). This functional conservation of gene expression, however, is not reflected in patterns of sequence conservation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2</xref>). Instead, S2E sequences from these species are substantially diverged, including large insertions and deletions in the spacers between known factor-binding sites, single nucleotide substitutions in binding sites, and even gains or losses of binding sites for the activators bicoid and hunchback.</p><p>Yet despite these evolved differences, reporter transgene analysis showed that spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression driven by S2Es of all four species are indistinguishable when placed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b10">10</xref>], indicating that evolved changes in the enhancer have had little or undetectable impact on spatiotemporal control of gene expression. But further experiments with native and chimeric S2Es of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> showed that this functional conservation required coevolved changes in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; halves of the enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b11">11</xref>], suggesting compensatory (i.e., adaptive) evolution. This functional evidence for adaptive substitution, together with indications that levels of gene expression might also differ among the four species' S2Es, raises questions about whether these orthologous enhancers are indeed functionally identical. To overcome limitations inherent in functionally interpreting the overlap of a reporter and native gene expression, here we report results of an in vivo complementation assay to investigate S2E performance. This approach allows us to put the functional equivalency hypothesis to a rigorous test.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Strategy and Proof of Principle</title><p>First, we created a fly line, <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E,</italic> in which the native <italic>eve</italic> S2E was deleted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We then attempted to complement, that is, rescue this lethal mutation with the introduction of a transgene, denoted <italic>S2E-EVE,</italic> containing an <italic>eve</italic> S2E from one of the four species <italic>(D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta,</italic> or <italic>D. pseudoobscura)</italic> linked to a functional <italic>eve</italic> promoter and coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This allowed us to compare both viabilities and developmental consequences among lines differing only in the evolutionary source of their S2E. By genetically manipulating rescue-transgene copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), effects of EVE abundance on viability and development could also be investigated.</p><p>We created the <italic>eve</italic> S2E deficiency mutant by removing a 480-bp fragment corresponding to the minimal stripe 2 element (MSE; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) from a 15-kb cloned copy of the <italic>eve</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b12">12</xref>]. A transgene containing the complete fragment is capable of rescuing <italic>eve</italic> null mutant flies to fertile adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b12">12</xref>]. <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> is functionally a null allele for stripe 2, as evidenced by the expression of the segment polarity gene, <italic>engrailed (en).</italic> Establishment of <italic>en</italic> 14-stripe pattern is a complex process that includes involvement by <italic>eve</italic> early stripes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b14">14</xref>]. <italic>Eve</italic> stripe 2 corresponds to parasegment 3, which is bordered by <italic>en</italic> stripes 3 and 4. We hypothesized that these <italic>en</italic> stripes might be developmental indicators of early <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 expression. Indeed <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> embryos lacking a functional S2E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">3</xref>F) produce a short parasegment 3 and vestigial <italic>en</italic> stripe 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). This defect alone is almost certainly a lethal condition.</p><p>Transgenes containing precisely orthologous S2Es from each of the four species linked to the <italic>D. melanogaster eve</italic> promoter and coding region were introduced onto the third chromosome. The fragment we chose to investigate is 692 bp in length in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It contains the central MSE, and every other previously identified TF-binding site in the S2E region. Notably, this fragment contains completely conserved sequences at its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends in all four species, thus ensuring that we could compare precisely orthologous fragments. As expected, all four <italic>S2E-EVE</italic> transgenes express a single early <italic>eve</italic> stripe in the expected spatial location (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">Figure 1</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">1</xref>H).</p><p>Having created the <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> chromosome line and the <italic>S2E-EVE</italic> rescue third chromosome lines, we could then produce flies carrying <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E; S2E-EVE</italic> in a doubly balanced configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Crossing this line with itself or with another line carrying an independent copy of the same S2E allowed us to estimate relative survival to adulthood of offspring carrying one or two copies of the rescue transgene. <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> homozygotes are embryonic lethal, whereas flies carrying two copies of the <italic>D. melanogaster S2E<sub>mel</sub>-EVE</italic> transgene in an <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> genetic background rescue approximately 34% of flies to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This is approximately the same rescue percentages found for the same genotype (<italic>P[EVEG84],</italic> R13), which contains the wild-type <italic>eve</italic> locus (including the native S2E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b12">12</xref>]. This implies that the fragment we used to drive stripe 2 <italic>eve</italic> expression is complete and that it can function normally when removed from its native context. Importantly, our negative control, <italic>S2E<sub>0</sub>-EVE,</italic> does not rescue, indicating that the rescue transgene requires this enhancer to drive <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Functional Equivalence of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> S2Es</title><p>We evaluated the ability of <italic>S2E-EVE</italic> rescue constructs to complement the embryonic lethal <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> deletion by estimating survival to adulthood, based on a genetic design used extensively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolutionary genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b15">15</xref>]. Viability measurements were made by crossing two independent lines of each rescue transgene to reduce potential recessive fitness effects caused by the site of rescue-transgene insertion. Offspring with two copies of the transgene are doubly hemizygous; few deleterious effects of transgene insertion were observed in these flies (compare, for example, <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E, R13/CyO; S2E-EVE/S2E-EVE</italic> versus <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E, R13/CyO; S2E-EVE/TM3</italic> survivors in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Rescue abilities of S2Es from different species can be compared quantitatively because the viability of each <italic>S2E-EVE</italic> transgene is calculated relative to a standard genotype present in every cross.</p><p>S2Es from the four species exhibited large differences in rescue abilities that follow neither a phylogenetic trend nor net sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The S2E of the most distantly related species, <italic>D. pseudoobscura,</italic> is completely conserved at only three of 18 TF-binding sites identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and is missing two of them entirely (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2</xref>). It is also nearly 25% longer due to insertions and deletions in the spacers between binding sites. Yet in terms of rescue ability it is indistinguishable from the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> S2E.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Functional Divergence of S2Es from Closely Related Species</title><p>Given the complete functional conservation of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> S2E, we were surprised to discover the failure of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> transgene to restore viability in <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> homozygotes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The inability of the doubly hemizygous <italic>S2E<sub>ere</sub>-EVE</italic> genotype to rescue cannot be due to deleterious effects of transgene insertion, because the presence of each single transgene has minimal impact on viability (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Two additional independent transformants were also investigated, neither of which produced viable adult flies. We conclude, therefore, that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> sequence, although precisely orthologous to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> S2E fragments, is nonfunctional when placed in a <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> embryonic context.</p><p>The <italic>D. yakuba's</italic> S2E also exhibits a rescue defect in that two copies of the rescue transgene are required for robust rescue.

A smaller dosage effect on viability of approximately 20% is seen with the S2Es of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <italic>D. pseudoobscura.</italic> Since the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 must be the same for flies carrying one or two copies of a transgene, <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 expression level alone must have a measurable influence on fitness.</p><p>As expected, embryos carrying one or two copies of either the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> or the functionally equivalent <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> S2E rescue transgene exhibit a wild-type <italic>en</italic> staining pattern, indicating a normal parasegment 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g005">5</xref>I).

The inability to drive normal <italic>en</italic> expression provides further evidence that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E is a weak (or nonfunctional) enhancer in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> genetic background.</p><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. yakuba</named-content> S2E also exhibits an <italic>en</italic> phenotype that correlates with its ability to rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g005">5</xref>E). With two copies of the enhancer present, embryos exhibit a robust <italic>en</italic> stripe 4, indistinguishable from wild-type.

Some of these embryos survive to adulthood since we do observe one-copy adults in our viability experiment, albeit at a lower than expected percentage. Although adult flies are superficially &#x0201c;normal,&#x0201d; we can observe subtle morphological defects (mouthparts and thoracic structures) in the segments corresponding to parasegment 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Differences in <italic>eve</italic> S2E Expression Levels</title><p>To test whether differential gene expression might be the critical functional difference between the S2Es, we quantified <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 protein in early embryos.

We also developed a PCR method to ascertain the genotype of individually stained embryos.</p><p>We validated the quantification procedure by comparing <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 expression levels in embryos carrying zero, one, or two copies of the S2E in its native position in a wild-type <italic>eve</italic> locus&#x02014;that is, <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E/EVE&#x00394;S2E, EVE&#x00394;S2E/Cy,</italic> and <italic>Cy/Cy</italic> embryos, respectively, and a homozygous <italic>w1118</italic> line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">Figure 3</xref>G).

Unexpectedly, a weak early stripe 2 (estimated to be approximately 20% of the wild-type level) can be detected in <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> homozygotes; we do not know what drives this stripe.</p><p>Normalized stripe 2 expression in early embryos carrying S2Es from <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> is consistent with adult viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E-driven <italic>eve</italic> expression is too weak to observe statistically significant expression comparing embryos containing zero, one, or two copies of the rescue transgene.

Therefore, the major functional evolutionary difference between these enhancers is likely to reside in their activation strengths.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Evolution of Enhancer Structure&#x02013;Function</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> S2E rescue transgene, and its considerably diverged <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> ortholog, each restore complete <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 biological activity when placed in a genetic background lacking a native S2E. The DNA fragment we investigated, therefore, entails both the biological and evolutionary units of enhancer function.

The rescue experiments reported here extend this finding by showing that the two orthologs are in fact biologically indistinguishable. These new results reinforce our contention that the phenotypic character&#x02014;early stripe 2 expression&#x02014;must be under stabilizing selection. The character itself remains unchanged over evolutionary time despite substitutions in nearly all the TF-binding sites, the gain and loss of some of them, and considerable change in the spacing between sites. This suggests to us that unlike proteins, where functional conservation usually means selective constraint on important amino acids (such as the active site of an enzyme), enhancers have a more flexible architecture that allows modification, and perhaps even turnover, of their &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; sites. Dissimilarities in the structure&#x02013;function of enhancers and proteins result in different emergent &#x0201c;rules&#x0201d; of molecular evolution.</p><p>But the fact that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> S2Es are biologically indistinguishable does not necessarily imply that enhancer function has been evolutionary static. Rather, the similar biological activities appear to be the result of convergence. In particular, phylogenetic analysis of S2E sequences indicates that the bcd-3 binding site in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> was acquired only recently in the lineage leading to <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). (There are also lineage-specific deletions in the spacers flanking both sides of the bcd-3 site in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> lineage, which shift the proximal and distal repressors giant and Kruppel binding sites, respectively, closer to this bicoid site. These length changes may have coevolved to enable or increase local repression of this novel activator site.) The bcd-3 site was shown by Small et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b06">6</xref>] to be required for MSE stripe expression. It seems likely, therefore, that the ancestral S2E lacking this binding site would not properly activate stripe 2 expression in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Perhaps the sensitivity of the enhancer (or more precisely, the fragment investigated) to activator signals has oscillated over evolutionary time, in which case the similarity between the two distantly related species' S2Es would be an example of functional convergence.</p><p>The fact that the S2E fragment from <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> is essentially unresponsive to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> morphogen-gradient environment, but the precisely orthologous segment from <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content>) responds properly, proves that this fragment must contain evolved differences of <italic>functional significance</italic> between the species. The lack of biological activity of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> transgene in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> should perhaps come as no surprise, however: Its lower sensitivity to activation may represent the ancestral state of the enhancer. What is surprising is the rapidity with which these functional differences evolve.</p><p>Phylogenetic footprinting of distantly related species can readily identify strongly conserved motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b19">19</xref>] but runs the risk of not detecting enhancers that have retained their function but have evolved structurally. To overcome this, a technique called phylogenetic shadowing&#x02014;the comparison of noncoding sequences among closely related species&#x02014;has recently emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b09">9</xref>]. Our results show that there is no necessary relationship between enhancer phylogenetic (or sequence) relatedness and functional similarity. Closely related species cannot be assumed to be more functionally conserved than distantly related species in enhancer structure&#x02013;function.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Why Is the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E Transgene Not Functional in <italic>D. melanogaster?</italic></title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> produces a native early <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2. Why then does the S2E fragment from this species not produce a robust early stripe when placed in <italic>D. melanogaster?</italic> The first possibility is that the fragment we investigated no longer contains a functional enhancer and has been replaced by an equivalent enhancer somewhere else in the <italic>eve</italic> locus. This possibility can easily be ruled out: The overall architecture of the <italic>eve</italic> locus, including all of its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; enhancers, is well conserved, and there is no new cluster of the appropriate TF-binding sites that could act as a S2E. Another unlikely possibility is that the locus has been duplicated, and the fragment we investigated has become functionally inert (i.e., equivalent to a pseudogene). There is no indication of a duplicated <italic>eve</italic> locus in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> genome, and all features of the <italic>eve</italic> locus (including its S2E) are intact and do not indicate any degeneration.</p><p>This leads us to conclude that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> fragment used in our experiments contains the S2E. We can consider three additional possibilities. The first is that this fragment is no longer the complete biological unit, that is, novel binding sites have evolved in this species distal or proximal to this fragment, which have become assimilated into the active enhancer by a process we call accretion. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows, <italic>patser,</italic> a binding-site prediction program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b20">20</xref>] identifies a single potential bicoid-binding site 135 bp upstream of Block-A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), the distal end of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E transgene. This potential site contains an unconventional bicoid-binding motif, T<bold>CAATC</bold>CC. The next closest potential binding site is another 350 bp further upstream and also has an unconventional binding-site sequence ( A<bold>CAATC</bold>GG). So, although we cannot rule out the possibility that these are biologically active sites that contribute to S2E activity, they are relatively distant from the recognized S2E (and other bicoid sites), and their sequences do not have the consensus core motif ( <bold>TAATC</bold>). Future experiments will allow us to formally test whether this enhancer has physically expanded. If so, this would be the first documented case for accretion, the adaptive expansion of an enhancer. </p><p>The second possibility is coevolution between the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E and its promoter region, such that it is not capable of driving transcription properly from a <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> promoter. We also view this as unlikely for several reasons. First, prior to designing these experiments, we investigated this issue with the core promoters and S2Es of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. virilis</named-content> (which is an outgroup to the species studied). We could detect no difference in spatial or temporal expression of each S2E with either promoter (Ludwig, unpublished data). Second, the core promoter regions of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> are highly conserved, including complete preservation of both the TATAA and the GAGA site. Indeed there are only four nucleotide differences (and no indels) between the species in a 150-bp stretch containing these sites. Finally, one might expect most functional changes in the core promoter to be pleiotropic, given the presence of more than a dozen other separable enhancers in the <italic>eve</italic> locus, and therefore to be selected against. </p><p>The final possibility is that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> S2E fragment does contain the entire biological enhancer, but that the <italic>trans</italic>-acting environment&#x02014;the morphogen gradients to which the enhancer responds&#x02014;differ between the species, causing the enhancers to have evolved to accommodate the differences. In other words, the sensitivity, or set point, of the binary (on&#x02013;off) switch function has coevolved with the <italic>trans</italic>-acting environment in order for the S2E to maintain the appropriate response to evolved activation inputs. This hypothesis implicates, in particular, evolutionary shifts in the bicoid and/or hunchback activator gradients. As noted above, there has been a lineage-specific addition of the functionally required bcd-3 binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b06">6</xref>] in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> that is not present in any of the other species. Second, there is also a lineage-specific loss of the hunchback-1 (hb-1) site in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> (which may be present in its sister taxon, <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. yakuba</named-content>). We propose that the lack of sites for these activators, and the presence of a species-specific six-base-pair insertion in the overlapping hb-2/kr-2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) reduces the ability of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> enhancer to respond to the activator gradients of <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic></p><p>This hypothesis predicts stronger activator gradients in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> than in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Although we have not yet investigated this possibility directly, we note that native <italic>eve</italic> blastoderm stripes do not reside in the same physical locations in embryos of the two species, but rather are displaced posteriorly in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. erecta</named-content> compared to <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g001">1</xref>C). A similar effect can be mimicked in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> with the addition of extra copies of <italic>bicoid</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b21">21</xref>], which shifts the morphogen gradient posteriorly.</p><p>The possible independence of spatiotemporal and rheostat activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b22">22</xref>] relates to a long-standing issue in evolutionary genetics&#x02014;whether developmental constraints are &#x0201c;tunable&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b23">23</xref>]. One school holds that features of development are strongly canalized and that deviation from this path will be strongly selected against. An opposing school holds that these developmental constraints can always be overcome by selection. The <italic>eve</italic> S2E may exhibit elements of both an immutable developmental constraint and a smoothly evolving trait. Primary pair-rule stripes, such as those laid down by <italic>eve</italic> in developing blastoderm embryos, establish the positional landmarks that will eventually demarcate segmental identities in the fly. This complex functional network established by gap and pair-rule gene expression imposes strong constraints on spatiotemporal patterns of regulatory gene expression. The S2E must, for example, produce a stripe equidistant from stripes 1 and 3, and at a specific location with respect to other pair-rule genes.</p><p>The potential for evolutionary change in the S2E set point or output, on the other hand, may be much less constrained. Genetic variability in the gain and loss of binding sites, polymorphism in binding sites leading to variation in TF binding, and modulation of TF interactions through changes in spacing between binding sites should allow for nearly continuous fine-tuning of these functions. Enhancers should be able to adapt to change in their <italic>trans</italic>-acting environment. Why might the <italic>trans</italic>-acting environment for the S2E be evolving? Residing at the head of the hierarchal cascade driving the formation of the A&#x02013;P axis, perhaps the bicoid morphogen gradient is less constrained than the expression of downstream genes that are more deeply embedded in the interaction network. Or, perhaps there has been natural selection acting on traits such as egg shape, size, or ovariole morphology, leading to changes in the bicoid-diffusion gradient. Egg number and size are, after all, fundamental evolutionary trade-offs. With a properly designed genetic experiment it should be possible to test these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Enhancer Evolution in Relation to Speciation</title><p>Postmating isolation is the final step in the speciation process because it involves genetic changes between incipient species that cause hybrid inviability or infertility.

The attractiveness of this hypothesis lies in the fact that there must be many more <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory modules in a eukaryotic genome than there are encoded proteins. Thus there is ample opportunity for the coevolution of enhancers and <italic>trans</italic>-factors to produce lethal interactions in hybrids, which may explain the abundance of lethal interactions between closely related species.</p><p>The regulation of development is often modeled as a logic circuit, with <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory sequences functioning as switches controlling information flow.

The dependent variables analyzed were ratios of the measured fluorescence in stripe 2 (P2) over stripe 3 (P3) after adjusting the measured background in the separating trough (T2), in general form: Y = (P2 &#x02212; T2)/(P3 &#x02212; T2). These variables were derived for the middle 25%, 50%, and 75% of the stripes, but all yielded similar results, and we report on the 75% case. For every embryo we documented a DV index, indicating its degree of rotation along the dorsal&#x02013;ventral axis (divided into five categories, dorsal, dorsal&#x02013;middle, middle, middle&#x02013;ventral, and ventral). In addition we placed the embryos into a series (five classes) around cellularization corresponding to approximately 45 min of development, when the EVE stripes originate and take form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030093-g003">3</xref>E). The series is based on classes 4&#x02013;8 for the 14th cleavage cycle available on the FlyEx Web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flyex.ams.sunysb.edu/flyex/">http://flyex.ams.sunysb.edu/flyex/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030093-b34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4a10"><title>ANOVA on EVE expression</title><p>Mixed-model ANOVA was fitted in SAS v8.2 (2002; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, United States) with the main effects of &#x0201c;dose,&#x0201d; that is, how many copies of rescue construct; &#x0201c;species,&#x0201d; designating the origin of the S2E; and a &#x0201c;DV index,&#x0201d; which accounts for orientation, along the dorsal&#x02013;ventral axis, of measured embryos.

We also applied a generalized linear model to the least square mean of the phenotypic values for each embryo. Again results were in accord (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030093-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">S2</xref>).

The mixed model was constructed in the same way, adding &#x0201c;experiment&#x0201d; as a term. All stocks were constructed to have the same genetic background, and we predicted that individuals homozygous for the <italic>EVE&#x00394;S2E</italic> in both datasets would have similar expression. This was corroborated by ANOVA with a reduced mixed model, F<sub>(1, 52.54)</sub> = 1.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.20, <italic>n</italic> = 71.
