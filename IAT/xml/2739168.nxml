Following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, membrane lipid degradation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, glutamate excitotxicity and calcium overload are the major initial events that induce inflammation and cellular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Excess release of calcium and glutamate results in phospholipid hydrolysis and the release of arachidonic acid (AA) via phospholipase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Phospholipids are major lipid components crucial for membrane integrity and synaptic function. Degraded lipids compromise not only the structural integrity of the cellular membrane but also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), overwhelming the antioxidant system in the neurovascular unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>ROS, generated through several cellular pathways following IR, have been implicated in neuronal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Increased vulnerability of the brain to lipoxidative mediators following IR injury contributes to secondary injury and impairment of brain functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Glutathione (GSH), an endogenous antioxidant that reduces ROS levels, plays a central role within the finely tuned network of antioxidant systems that respond to insult. GSH responds to oxidative stress through its peroxide scavenging functions via glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Accordingly, the GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) provided neurovascular protection following IR injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], supporting the potential of reducing ROS strategy for stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the effects of lipoxidative load on the mechanisms of pro-inflammatory enzymes, like phospholipases A2 (PLA2s), and their modulation for therapeutic purposes has gained significant recent attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Among the different types of PLA2s, secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) play an important role in neuroinflammation due to their non-specific nature to phospholipid substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) will specifically release AA; while sPLA2 does not have this specificity of fatty acid too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Due to their accessibility in the circulation and in the tissues, sPLA2s activity leads to generation of several potent mediators of inflammation. The products of sPLA2, free fatty acids (FFA) including AA and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), are the most crucial bioactive lipid metabolites. AA, which induces oxidative stress during its metabolism, leads to either cell proliferation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type in which it is metabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. AA also regulates downstream signaling pathways of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which is involved in the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, released free AA either acts as a second messenger or it is further metabolized by relevant enzymes to generate eicosanoid signaling molecules like prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These, in turn, set the stage for oxidative and peroxidative damage to cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports have shown that sPLA2s are active before secretion from the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and can be re-internalized into cells viacaveolae in which localized Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations may be sufficiently high to permit lipid turnover. Induction of sPLA2 triggers activation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) via its receptor mediated internalization into the cytosol and regulates the invasiveness of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. MMPs have been reported to aggravate IR injury through hemorrhagic transformation and BBB disruption in the acute phase of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Membrane lipid degradation by sPLA2 and the consequent lipoxidative metabolism have been documented as crucial toxic mechanisms involved not only in IR injury but also in other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], making these processes potential therapeutic targets for neurovascular protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Increased expression of sPLA2 has been reported in cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and sPLA2 inhibition provides protection against ischemic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Among different subtypes of sPLA2, group IIA has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and inhibition of this sPLA2 has been reported to reduce lesion volume following IR injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the role of sPLA2 and its metabolic products in BBB disruption is not understood.</p><p>A selective inhibitor of sPLA2 IIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA) is a non-toxic AA analog with IC<sub>50 </sub>values in the range of 6&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M. DEDA has been documented to reduce sPLA2 activity significantly and decrease carotid artery ischemia-evoked release of glutamate and aspartate in the cerebral cortex when administered after injury in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Treatment with DEDA has shown no effect on physiologic parameters, including blood pressure, pH and blood gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, it significantly reduced levels of lipid metabolites including LPC and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Recently, we documented the therapeutic potential of DEDA against the psychosine-mediated cellular toxicity implicated in the pathology of Krabbe disease, a demyelinating neurodegenerative disease. Inhibition of sPLA2 by DEDA reduced the levels of AA and LPC, resulting in the survival of oligodendrocytes after treatment with psychosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These studies indicate the potential of DEDA to reduce the sPLA2-derived lipoxidative exacerbations so deleterious in the neurovascular unit following IR injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p>Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate was purchased from Mediatech, Inc.

They were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight) and an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg). A rectal temperature probe was introduced, and a heating pad was used to maintain the body temperature at 37&#x000b0;C. Right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded as described by Longa et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The animals were euthanized by decapitation under deep anesthesia with a pentobarbital overdose (150 mg/kg) at the specified time period of reperfusion to harvest brain for biochemical estimations or for immunohistochemical examination.

Studies have shown that modulation of PLA2 and/or PLA2-derived products, including AA and LPC, has attenuated IR injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DEDA, an sPLA2 inhibitor, attenuates IR injury through modulation of BBB functions. The two important forms of PLA2s, cPLA2 and sPLA2, are calcium dependent and located in the cytosol. They cleave membrane phospholipids at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position to yield FFA/AA and LPC. Earlier reports documented that IR injury activates these enzymes from a very early stage, continuing for several days, mainly due to increased calcium overload, which causes oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Recent studies have shown the importance of sPLA2 in IR injury since it has both a tissue localized and a circulatory existence. Activation of sPLA2 leads to enhanced release of free AA and accumulation of LPC, neither of which occurs under normal circumstances. Released AA produces bioactive lipid mediators through its lipoxidative metabolisms. AA-derived oxidative lipid metabolites and LPC cause BBB leakage, endothelial dysfunction and brain edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Under normal conditions, the PLA2 enzymes help to maintain membrane composition and thus membrane integrity. However, PLA2s produce excessive amount of FFA/AA and LPC under pathological condition. A high amount of accumulated LPC, as observed in IR injury (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), may cause electrophysiological disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and hence membrane dysfunction. Post-ischemia treatment with AA aggravates IR-induced BBB leakage and water retention, enhancing oxidative stress through depletion of GSH and increasing MDA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. IR is accompanied by generation of ROS/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and inflammation. Several reports show the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory therapy after IR injury. Most are based on the inhibition of LOX and COX-2 enzymes, thus preventing the conversion of AA to prostaglandins. However, studies on AA confirm that it has direct deleterious effects itself during IR injury through other mechanisms as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, inhibiting enhanced AA/LPC release may be a more effective therapeutic strategy over those that retard AA conversion to other inflammatory mediators. Elevated concentrations of FFA also contribute to enhanced expression of monocytes and their adhesion to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], which may lead to BBB leakage. In the present study, we observed the inhibitory effect of DEDA on sPLA2 activity, which is responsible for excessive FFA/AA and LPC release during IR injury.</p><p>In ischemic conditions, the initial injury in the core area is caused mainly by necrotic neuronal cell death due to the lack of oxygen and the depletion of energy. The cellular death during reperfusion is primarily apoptotic in nature, which is also an energy dependent process. This apoptosis expands the core injury, converting the penumbra previously amenable to therapeutic intervention into a larger and permanently damaged infarct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. AA has been reported to promote apoptotic cell death by enhancing caspase-3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. On the other hand, accumulated LPC acts like a detergent and helps to make the membrane more soluble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The BBB is a neurovascular system mainly composed of endothelial and astroglial cells with a basal lamina. It is highly discriminatory, and has selective permeability inside the brain. These traits of the BBB suggest that the combined effect of AA and LPC may be disruptive, and disruption of BBB is one of the major causes of secondary injury. In this disruption, unwanted cells, debris and water transmigrate across and infiltrate the BBB, which finally leads to vasogenic edema, a prominent cause of mortality following IR injury.</p><p>Our findings show that DEDA significantly reduced the infarct size and improved neurologic score (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). This effect may occur through inhibition of FFA/AA and LPC release (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> clearly indicates that, even though DEDA down regulated PLA2 activity, it did not have any significant effect on the expression of PLA2 at mRNA levels (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of IR injury is complex and multi-factorial. Among these factors is oxidative stress, which regulates neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. An imbalance in the oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis can be observed by studying GSH level. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;B</xref> shows that IR injury resulted in oxidative stress; excessive AA may be one of the major culprits, as PLA2 is activated within minutes following stroke in different cell type including reactive astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On one hand, AA weakens the endogenous antioxidant system represented by GSH levels; on the other hand, it enhances formation of lipid metabolites, which further interact with various proteins, thus forming protein carbonyl. Carbonylation of proteins makes them inaccessible to specific enzymes by altering their identity and hence hindering their function and degradation. Supporting the efficacy of DEDA, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;B</xref> shows that treatment with DEDA significantly attenuated the oxidative stress due to IR injury. To further confirm the relationship between excessive AA and oxidative stress, we studied an in vitro model by treating the neuronal cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and AA. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> shows that there is significantly increased AA release, possibly resulting from activation of PLA2 due to oxidative stress. DEDA significantly attenuated the altered release of AA. Furthermore, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B&#x02013;D</xref> shows that AA and other lipid metabolites like 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) induced morphological changes and depleted GSH. GSH plays significant role in stroke and its restoration by its precursor NAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or by CDP-choline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] is associated with neurovascular protection. These findings show that the induction of oxidative stress occurs through lipid metabolites, and this phenomenon helps to activate PLA2, contributing to secondary injury. It also confirms that DEDA may provide protection in IR injury by reducing oxidative stress through modulation of PLA2 activity and excessive AA release. However, DEDA clearly does not have direct antioxidant properties to combat oxidative stress.</p><p>Earlier reports documented that AA leads to BBB dysfunction and edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]; it is possible that exogenously accumulated LPC with a membrane-lytic activity may play a synergistic role with AA. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;B</xref> shows EB leakage inside the brain as a marker of BBB disruption and dysfunction. This compromised BBB integrity leads to edema due to an influx of water and other contents (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Inhibition of PLA2 activity by DEDA in the acute phase significantly reduced BBB leakage and edema formation. BBB leakage and edema formation may have life-threatening consequences, worsening neurologic outcomes. Preservation of BBB integrity by DEDA treatment indicates that the use of a PLA2 inhibitor in the acute phase of IR injury may have favorable therapeutic outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study found that release of FFA/AA and LPC are among the few critical earlier events of IR injury. Excessive release of AA and LPC by sPLA2 leads to BBB dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn, cause secondary injury. Moreover, induction of sPLA2 and the consequent accumulation of LPC and AA-metabolites may compromise membrane integrity following IR injury. Therefore, an inhibition of sPLA2 by DEDA or other pharmacological means may protect BBB integrity and provide significant therapeutic benefits following stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>AA: Arachidonic acid; BBB: Blood brain barrier; COX: Cycloxygenase; DEDA: 7,7'-Dimethyl eicosadienoic acid; EB: Evan's blue; FFA: Free fatty acids; GC: Gas chromatography; GPx: Glutathione peroxidase; GST: Glutathione S-transferase; GSH: Reduced glutathione; 4-HNE: 4-Hydroxynonenal; HPTLC: High performance thin layer chromatography; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: Hydrogen peroxide; IR: Ischemia-reperfusion; LOX: Lipoxygenase; LPC: Lysophosphatidylcholine; MCAO: Middle cerebral artery occlusion; MDA: Malondialdehyde; MPO: Myeloperoxidase; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; PC: Protein carbonyl; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; RNS: Reactive nitrogen species; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; sPLA2: Secretory phospholipases A2; TCA: Trichloro acetic acid; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; Veh: Vehicle.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>This study is based on an original idea of MK and IS.
