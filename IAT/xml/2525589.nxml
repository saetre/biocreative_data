Mice deficient for <italic>twist2</italic> or haploinsufficient for both <italic>twist1</italic> and <italic>twist2</italic> succumb to severe systemic inflammation, demonstrating the central role of Twist proteins in the regulation of inflammation. <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>twist2</italic> are expressed by fibroblasts and macrophages, and expression is promoted by TNF-&#x003b1; and type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The involvement of Twist expression by fibroblasts and macrophages in the control of inflammation is probable, but has not been investigated in detail so far.</p><p>T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes are potent inducers of inflammation. This has been demonstrated by adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes in murine models of Th1-associated inflammatory diseases such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In these models, the induction of inflammation in a particular tissue by Th1 lymphocytes is dependent on restimulation by the cognate antigen in that tissue. Induction of inflammation by Th1 cells is mediated by expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;, the latter being a hallmark of Th1 differentiation. IFN-&#x003b3; also induces expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL9, -10, and -11, attracting Th1 cells specifically to inflamed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Th cells with the capacity to recall IFN-&#x003b3; expression, i.e., Th1 memory cells, are detectable in chronically inflamed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The role of Th1 cells in the development and maintenance of chronic inflammation is less clear. Anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; therapy has been shown to be beneficial in various Th1-associated inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). However, a regulatory role for IFN-&#x003b3; has also been demonstrated, based on the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and of IL-12 in antigen-presenting cells, in turn increasing the IL-10 synthesis of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits the differentiation of naive Th cells into proinflammatory Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate specific autoregulation of Th1 cells by the transcription factor <italic>twist1</italic>. Expression of <italic>twist1</italic> in Th cells is induced by IL-12/STAT4, NF-&#x003ba;B, and NFAT, and thus is specific for Th1 cells. Th1 effector memory (EM) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) show increased transient reexpression of <italic>twist1</italic> upon T cell receptor engagement. <italic>Twist1</italic> reduces the functionality of Th1 cells by attenuating expression of IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3;. Th cells isolated from chronically inflamed gut tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) and synovial fluid of patients with spondyloarthropathies or rheumatoid arthritis are imprinted to express high levels of <italic>twist1</italic>, which indicates a history of repeated restimulation and an involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, i.e., delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and antigen-induced arthritis, expression of <italic>twist1</italic> by Th1 cells regulates Th1-mediated inflammation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>Twist1</italic> is transiently expressed in repeatedly activated Th1 cells</title><p>To define transcriptional changes during Th1 memory cell differentiation, we compared the global gene expression of murine Th1 cells, which were activated with antigen once or repeatedly at 6-d intervals. Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup> T lymphocytes expressing the transgenic DO11.10 TCR specific for OVA were activated in vitro with splenic APCs and the cognate peptide OVA<sub>327-339</sub> under conditions that induce functional differentiation into Th1 cells, i.e., addition of IL-12 and blocking antibodies specific for IL-4. The transcriptional profiles of once- and four-time&#x02013;stimulated Th1 cells were compared using high-density DNA microarrays.

Expression was further enhanced 3 h after polyclonal stimulation either with PMA and the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ionophore ionomycin, or with CD3- and CD28-specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). When determined 3 h after restimulation with anti-CD3/-CD28 antibodies, expression of <italic>twist1</italic> was close to the detection limit in naive Th cells. Expression increased &#x0223c;15-fold during the first Th1-polarizing stimulation, another 10-fold during the second stimulation, and another 3-fold during the third stimulation, reaching the maximum level after the fourth stimulation and remaining stable thereafter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). With PMA/ionomycin restimulation, maximum levels of <italic>twist1</italic> mRNA were reached after two rounds of stimulation. In Th1 cells, upon anti-CD3/-CD28 restimulation, <italic>twist1</italic> mRNA expression was up-regulated within the first hour, reaching maximum levels after 3 h, and decreasing again thereafter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

Genetic haploinsufficiency of both <italic>twist1</italic> and <italic>twist2</italic> results in fatal systemic inflammatory immunopathology in mice, which die before day 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In this study, we show that <italic>twist1</italic> is expressed in Th1 EM cells. Its expression is induced by IL-12 via STAT4 and TCR signaling, activating NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B. Expression of <italic>twist1</italic> follows TCR stimulation transiently and increases upon repeated stimulation. Thus, imprinting for enhanced <italic>twist1</italic> expression is a hallmark of repeatedly restimulated Th1 memory cells.</p><p>The proximal promoter of <italic>twist1</italic> contains phylogenetically conserved binding sites for NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B, and STAT proteins. Both NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B have to bind to the promoter of <italic>twist1</italic> in Th cells to induce expression, i.e., <italic>twist1</italic> is expressed only by activated Th cells. In the initial activation of naive Th cells, NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B cannot induce transcription of <italic>twist1</italic> on their own, but require concerted binding of activated STAT4 to the promoter of <italic>twist1</italic>. Of all costimulatory signals involved in the lineage differentiation of murine Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells, only IL-12 was able to induce transcription of <italic>twist1</italic>. Neither IL-4, in Th2 polarization, nor IL-6, TGF-&#x003b2;, and IL-23 in Th17 polarization, could induce expression of <italic>twist1</italic>. Of the Th1-polarizing signals, IL-12/STAT4, but not IFN-&#x003b3;/STAT1, is required to induce <italic>twist1</italic> expression. T-bet is not involved. STAT4 is required only in the original stimulation, to imprint the gene for reexpression. This imprinting is evident from the increased reexpression upon stimulation with TCR signals alone, in the absence of IL-12, and it is reflected in the acetylation and trimethylation of H3 histones at the <italic>twist1</italic> promoter region, as is shown here. The requirement of NFAT for induction of <italic>twist1</italic> expression in Th1 cells distinguishes control of <italic>twist1</italic> expression in Th cells from its control in fibroblasts, where TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is sufficient to induce expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In activated macrophages, type I IFNs induce the expression of <italic>twist1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and they express both <italic>twist</italic> genes, i.e., <italic>twist1</italic> and <italic>twist2</italic>, whereas activated Th1 cells exclusively express <italic>twist1.</italic> In Th lymphocytes, <italic>twist1</italic> expression is not induced by type I IFNs. Addition of IFN-&#x003b1; during the primary activation of Th cells in the absence of IL-12 did not suffice to induce <italic>twist1</italic> expression (Fig. S9, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072468/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072468/DC1</ext-link>). These findings provide evidence that expression of the antiinflammatory <italic>twist</italic> genes is controlled by type I IFNs and TNF-&#x003b1; in fibroblasts and macrophages in innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and is controlled by antigen and IL-12 in Th cells in adaptive immune responses; i.e., <italic>twist</italic> expression is induced by those cytokines controlling the induction of inflammatory immune responses.</p><p>In this study, we have identified <italic>twist1</italic> as a gene that is differentially expressed by Th1 cells versus Th2 cells, comparing the transcriptomes of once and repeatedly restimulated murine Th1 and Th2 cells generated in vitro from bona fide naive Th cells. Expression of <italic>twist1</italic> increases upon repeated restimulation in vitro in Th1 cells, whereas it is not induced even in repeatedly restimulated Th2 or Th17 cells. Accordingly, in Th cells isolated ex vivo, <italic>twist1</italic> expression is restricted to a subset of memory cells. Among murine CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> memory-phenotype Th cells that were isolated from spleen or lymph nodes of naive DO11.10 mice, expression of <italic>twist1</italic> is low. In CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from nephritic <italic>MRL/lpr</italic> mice, which represent chronically activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), <italic>twist1</italic> expression is up-regulated five- to eightfold compared with DO11.10 memory-phenotype Th cells. This is moderate when compared with the &#x0223c;20-fold up-regulation upon repeated restimulation of Th1 cells observed in vitro, and may reflect the heterogeneous composition of the cell populations analyzed. As expected from the phylogenetic conservation of the <italic>twist1</italic> promoter, <italic>twist1</italic> is also expressed by activated human Th cells. It is low in peripheral human naive Th cells and in CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CM Th cells. <italic>Twist1</italic> expression is enhanced in CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> EM Th cells, in particular in the &#x0201c;terminally differentiated&#x0201d; CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> EM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Among CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> EM cells, <italic>twist1</italic> is expressed less by CRTh2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells, which have been shown to be mostly Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> EM cells, which contain Th1 EM and Th17 EM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) have up-regulated activation-induced expression of <italic>twist1</italic>, as we show here. Because at least Th17 cells generated in vitro do not express <italic>twist1</italic>, the expression in CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th EM cells is probably caused by Th1 EM cells. Thus, the phenotype of human peripheral <italic>twist1</italic>-expressing Th cells is that of repeatedly restimulated Th1 EM cells. Remarkably, expression of <italic>twist1</italic> is highly up-regulated in CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from inflamed tissues of patients with chronic inflammation of joints or gut. Repeated biopsies from individual patients show persistent <italic>twist1</italic> mRNA levels over time, i.e., the persistence of chronically reactivated Th1 cells, despite state-of-the-art therapeutic treatment. Their imprinting for increased <italic>twist1</italic> expression, maintained over time in individual patients, indicates a history of repeated restimulation and an endogenous regulation of proinflammatory effector functions under the control of NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p><italic>Twist1</italic> itself is a transcriptional repressor binding to E-boxes in the regulatory regions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). For COS cells, it has been shown that ectopically expressed <italic>twist1</italic> can interact directly with the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B and inhibit its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In contrast, for primary murine macrophages, <italic>twist1</italic> has been shown to block transcription of target genes by binding to E-boxes within the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In this study, we show that in Th1 cells, <italic>twist1</italic> cannot block NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;driven transcription of a reporter gene construct that lacks E-boxes in the promoter, suggesting that <italic>twist1</italic> acts through binding to E-boxes, as in macrophages. In accordance, ectopically expressed <italic>twist1</italic> only regulates the expression of a restricted set of 58 genes in 1-wk-old Th1 cells by a factor of at least 1.5. Expression of 29 genes is up-regulated, and that of another 29 genes down-regulated. Apart from several genes of unknown and metabolic function, these genes are involved in survival, effector function, and motility of the cells. With respect to cytokine expression, <italic>twist1</italic> reduces activation-induced expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-2, and IFN-&#x003b3; by Th1 memory cells by &#x0003e;50% at the protein level. Apart from cytokine expression, <italic>twist1</italic> also decreases expression of proinflammatory chemokines and chemokine receptors, and attenuates cytokine receptor signaling by up-regulating SOCS-1 and -2, the IL-1 decoy receptor, and by down-regulating Jak2, the kinase involved in IL-12 signaling. <italic>Twist1</italic> in Th1 cells thus acts as an endogenous regulator limiting the proinflammatory potential of Th1 cells in the continuous presence of antigen, i.e., repeated activation of NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>The key role of <italic>twist1</italic> expression by Th1 cells for the self-limitation of Th1-induced inflammation is evident from the present analysis of murine models of inflammation. Ectopic overexpression of <italic>twist1</italic> in 6-d-old Th1 cells, which still had a low endogenous expression level, drastically reduced their pathogenic contribution to DTH. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>twist1</italic> in Th1 cells significantly enhanced their potential to induce chronic inflammation in a murine model of antigen-induced arthritis. In this model, OVA-specific Th1 cells, when adoptively transferred into SCID mice and challenged by intraarticular OVA, induce a chronic inflammation of the joint. Adoptive transfer of Th1 cells versus Th1 cells with a shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>twist1</italic> expression demonstrates the relevance of <italic>twist1</italic> expression by Th1 cells for the control of immunopathology. When analyzed on day 21 after transfer, mice with a knockdown of <italic>twist1</italic> expression in Th1 cells showed increased hyperplasia of the lining cells and synovial fibroblasts in the sublining layer, pannus formation, and vascularization. Numbers of Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> granulocytes and F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages, as well as TNF-&#x003b1; expression of lining and sublining cells, were increased in the Th1 <italic>twist1</italic> knockdown situation.</p><p>Why is expression of <italic>twist1</italic> up-regulated gradually? One explanation might be that a regulatory gene is not expressed in initial Th1 activations, to allow full initial reactivity of the Th1 cells. Accordingly, ectopic <italic>twist1</italic> expression in Th1 cells right from the beginning impairs their function in acute inflammation of DTH. In repeated restimulations, reflecting a lack of clearance of the antigen and increased risk of immunopathology, regulation of Th1 may help to limit immunopathology, as we show in the chronic inflammation of the antigen-induced arthritis model by knockdown of <italic>twist1</italic>, but <italic>twist1</italic>-expressing Th1 cells are still capable of driving inflammation.</p><p>Apart from its role in limiting immunopathology in chronic inflammation, <italic>twist1</italic> and the genes controlled by it could be regarded as biomarkers for pathogenic EM cells. <italic>Twist1</italic> is not imprinted for enhanced expression in naive and CM CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th cells. Even CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1 EM cells will only express a low level of <italic>twist1</italic> upon restimulation compared with Th cells from chronically inflamed tissue. Initial clinical studies aiming at a complete depletion of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases suggested a clinical benefit, but the studies had to be terminated because of the severe side effects of systemic depletion of Th lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Targeting of CD4- and CD3-expressing cells with nondepleting antibodies and neutralization of Th-related effector cytokines have demonstrated clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), but all of them impair protective as well as pathogenic T cell memory. Targeting of <italic>twist1</italic>-expressing Th cells, by means of either addressing <italic>twist1</italic> or a gene regulated by it, seems more promising, because it is more specific for repeatedly restimulated Th1 memory cells involved in chronic inflammation. It remains to be shown whether these cells in chronic inflammatory diseases are the critical Th cells capable of driving inflammation, as we show in this study for the experimental model of antigen-induced arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice and reagents.</title><p>MRL<italic><sup>lpr/lpr</sup></italic>, BALB/c, C57BL/6, SCID, STAT4-deficient mice (Stat4<sup>tm1Gr</sup>), and OVA-TCR<sup>tg/tg</sup> DO11.10 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory or were bred under specific pathogen&#x02013;free conditions in our animal facility.

Biotinylated cRNA was transcribed with the MEGAscript high-yield transcription kit (Ambion), fragmented, and the hybridization cocktail was prepared according to Affymetrix protocols (15 &#x003bc;g fragmented biotin-labeled cRNA spiked with Eukaryotic Hybridization control). The Murine Genome U74A version 2, and 430A version 2 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) were hybridized at 45&#x000b0;C for 16 h, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Workstation 400, and scanned on a Hewlett-Packard Gene Array Scanner (MGU74Av2 arrays) or on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 (MG430Av2 arrays). Data were analyzed using the Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Microarrays were globally normalized and scaled to a trimmed mean expression value of 200. All arrays were compared with each other, and a relational database was generated using Microsoft Access software, including the following parameters: expression heights, call for presence of transcripts, P value for presence or absence of transcripts, log<sub>2</sub> value of fold change and 95% confidence intervals, call for the significance of differentially expression, and the P value for that call. For each transcript the significance of differential expression between the groups of arrays was calculated using strict Bonferroni-corrected Welch <italic>t</italic> tests. Significantly differentially expressed genes were filtered according to the following criteria: mean fold change &#x02265;2 or &#x02265;1.5; difference of means &#x02265;200; P value &#x02264;0.05; and immunoglobulin genes were excluded.
