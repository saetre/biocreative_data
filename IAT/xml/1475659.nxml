The most severe complication of influenza is acute pneumonia, which develops rapidly and may result in respiratory failure and death. The etiological agents of the disease, the single-stranded RNA influenza viruses, are classified into three types (A, B, and C), of which influenza A is clinically the most important &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IAV pathogenesis and host immune responses is required for the development of more efficient means of prevention and treatment of influenza.</p><p>The invasion of viruses is initially sensed by the host innate immune system, triggering rapid antiviral responses that involve the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and leading to the subsequent activation of adaptive immune responses. Diverse components of infecting viruses can induce the signalling pathways that regulate the cellular antiviral gene program. Among them, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been viewed as the most important component. It is a common signature linked to the viral replication cycle and lysis of virus-infected cells is hypothesized to release dsRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. A major transducer of cell signalling generated by dsRNA is the Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, a member of a conserved family of innate immune recognition receptors that have key roles in detecting microbes, initiating innate immune responses, and linking innate and adaptive immunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A role for TLR3 in viral detection has been suggested by in vitro and ex vivo studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; but except for a recent study that has clearly shown that TLR3 mediates West Nile virus entry into the brain, causing lethal encephalitis, the functional role of TLR3 in vivo remains unclear &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our findings clearly indicate that TLR3 contributes to a detrimental inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Kinetics of Pathological Features Associated with IAV Infection</title><p>The pathogenesis and immune response associated with influenza pneumonia are assumed to be very complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. To further dissect the role of TLR3 in IAV sensing and pathogenesis, we first characterized in infected wild-type animals the time-course of major dynamic parameters, including animal mortality and weight, leukocyte recruitment into the airspaces, increase in alveolocapillar permeability, and secretion of critical mediators. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows that all C57Bl/6 mice inoculated intranasally with IAV at a dose of 300 plaque-forming units (pfu) per mouse died within 12 d. Signs of piloerection and anorexia were associated with a loss of weight (approximately 32&#x00025;) and appeared after 4 d of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Animals were killed at different intervals postinfection, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected to assess cellular infiltration and mediators content in the airspaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>C (square symbol) shows a biphasic leukocyte recruitment constituted mainly of polymorphonuclear cells (circle symbol) by days 3 to 8 postinfection and of mononuclear cells (triangle symbol) afterward. The kinetics of IAV-induced secretion of a major cytokine (IL-6) and a CC chemokine (RANTES) was investigated. While RANTES peaked at day 3 and decreased significantly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), IL-6 secretion increased steadily until day 4 and was sustained at that level until day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). As an index of transudation from the vascular compartment into the lungs, the amount of total protein was determined in the BAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). Interestingly, the protein concentration curve parallels that of total leukocyte content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, square symbol) confirming a connection between increased microvascular permeability and cellular infiltration during acute lung injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. BAL fluids were further analyzed by an inflammatory protein array to examine at days 3 and 10 postinfection whether other major components, not measured in the initial assays, were affected during influenza pneumonia. A total of 32 mediators were measured, which included 16 cytokines, 11 chemokines, three growth factors, one metalloproteinase inhibitor, and one soluble cytokine receptor (an example of such protein array blot is shown later in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) This array analysis indicated selective major increases of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-5, macrophage inflammatory protein-2&#x003b1;, RANTES, soluble tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) receptor, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (not illustrated). Next, we checked that the lethal pneumonia induced by IAV was not associated with a bacteria superinfection, as it has been reported by others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. We showed that bacteria counts in blood or BAL of IAV-treated mice at day 3, 6, 8, or 10 postinfection were negligible (constantly below 250 cfu/ml). In addition, intramuscular administration of the mice with a large-spectrum antibiotic (Clamoxyl; amoxicillin trihydrate-potassium clavulanate, 25 mg/kg) before and during the viral infection did not reduce or delay the survival pattern (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>IAV Upregulates the Lung Expression of TLR3</title><p>We previously demonstrated that of all the mediators we tested, i.e., bacterial LPS, the cytokines TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, the protein kinase C activator PMA, IAV, and the synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C), only the two latter stimuli upregulated TLR3 expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells, suggesting that the signaling pathways controlling the induction of this gene are restricted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the distinct complexity between in vitro and in vivo systems, there was a need to determine the regulation and the function of TLR3 in relation to the pathogenesis of influenza in an experimental animal model. We first showed that the expression of this receptor in the lungs of infected mice is constitutive and markedly upregulated following IAV administration, peaking at day 3 and slightly decreasing at day 9 postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Reduced Inflammation and Lethality in IAV-Infected <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Mice</title><p>Remarkably, we showed that <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice had a more prolonged survival after a challenge of 300 pfu IAV than did wild-type animals as determined by a Kaplan-Meier test; i.e., approximately 26&#x00025; and 0&#x00025; survival, respectively, at day 12 postinfection (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 35 and 65, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, left upper panel). Ultimately, all <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice died 3 to 5 d later. We have also performed survival experiments that were conducted with lower doses of virus (100 and 30 pfu; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lower panels). The results clearly show that the absence of TLR3 can undeniably protect the mice from the lethal viral effects. Thus, after a challenge of 100 pfu IAV, <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have an even more enhanced survival (approximately 60&#x00025;; even after a month postinfection; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) compared to wild-type animals (0&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 13). Infection with 30 pfu IAV affected neither the wild-type nor the <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5). Interestingly, mice deficient for the adapter protein myeloid differentiation (MyD)88, which is involved in the signaling of all TLR molecules but TLR3, were as sensitive as wild-type mice to influenza infection (0&#x00025; survival for both groups, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, right upper panel; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8). Then, to monitor the role of TLR3 in lung dysfunction induced by the viral infection, the respiratory distress index Penh and total protein amount as well as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were evaluated in BAL fluids of <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and wild-type animals at day 3 postinfection by 300 pfu IAV (this time point was chosen as it corresponds to the peak of the viral load in the lungs of both animal groups, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g005">Figure 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that the Penh index was significantly diminished in <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared to control mice, i.e., 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.12 versus 1.74 &#x000b1; 0.2, respectively (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005). Likewise, total protein, RANTES, and IL-6 amounts were significantly lower in <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> than in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g003">3</xref>D). BAL fluids were further analyzed by an inflammatory protein array to examine at day 9 whether the expression of additional mediators was directly regulated by TLR3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g004">Figure 4</xref>A not only confirms a clearly reduced IL-6 production in the lungs of <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice but also reveals a similar inhibition concerning inflammatory mediators such as IL-12p40/p70, sTNFR1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. On the contrary, the expression of distinct components is increased in <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> versus wild-type lungs, including not only INF-&#x003b3; but also G-CSF and, to a lesser extent, IL-9 and IL-10. As additional evidence, we showed by ELISA that, although similar at day 4 to day 7 post&#x02013;viral infection, the amount of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; in <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was greater (approximately 14.5 times that of wild-type animals) at day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

Infection of wild-type mice with IAV resulted in a significant increase in the number of leukocytes (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), and the accumulated cells in the BAL were composed mostly of T-lymphocytes (55 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 12.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/BAL), neutrophils (23 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 4.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/BAL), and macrophages (11 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/BAL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left and central panels); these numbers have to be compared to a leukocyte population in na&#x000ef;ve mice constituted by approximately 90&#x00025; macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020053-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left panels and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;).

TLRs play a central role in the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and in the initiation of an effective innate and adaptive immune response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. In agreement with this paradigm, there is accumulating in vivo evidence using <italic>TLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice that support a role for these receptors in antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral defense. Moreover, several clinical reports confirm the contribution of TLRs to the pathophysiology of infectious diseases, and polymorphisms in TLR genes are associated with predisposition to severe infections &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In view of this major information, we anticipated at the start of our investigation that TLR3 would act as a protective component and, conversely, its absence in <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice would render the animals more susceptible to IAV infection. On the contrary, our study reveals that mice deficient in TLR3 have an unexpected advantage. Thus, in comparison with wild-type mice, we found in <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (i) a clearly reduced level of inflammatory mediators in the bronchoalveolar spaces, including RANTES, IL-6, and IL-12p40/p70; (ii) a lower number of the predominant leukocyte population in the airspaces, i.e., the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells; and, most important, (iii) a paradoxical longer survival. Based on these findings and in view of previous work describing the major role of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes and cytokines in the pathogenesis of influenza infection, we discuss below the fact that the enhanced resistance of IAV-infected <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> might be due to a lower TLR3-mediated release of inflammatory mediators and T cell infiltration in the lung airspaces.</p><p>It is established that IAV replicates in epithelial cells and leukocytes, resulting in the production of chemokines and cytokines that favors the recruitment of mononuclear cell population to the site of infection. There is growing evidence that the mediators that have a central role in the resolution of influenza are the same that can be the cause of many clinical signs related to this pathology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We confirm in the present study that influenza infection leads to the synthesis of major inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, G-CSF, IL-12p40/p70, MCPs, macrophage inflammatory proteins, and RANTES. Remarkably, IL-6 exhibits multifunctional activities that are largely proinflammatory and its release has been correlated with the symptom pathogenesis during acute influenza &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. IL-12 administration was also found to have an adverse effect on the course of influenza infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Other studies reported the involvement of cytokines in influenza pathogenesis, but the blockade of one individual cytokine appears somewhat partial as there is a substantial redundancy between cytokines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, our study clearly establishes that TLR3 plays a major role in the inflammatory cytokine response to IAV, the lack of TLR3 resulting in a significant decrease of cytokine synthesis, including that of IL-6, IL-12p40/p70, and RANTES. Ongoing loss-of-function in vitro studies with human pulmonary epithelial cells also demonstrate an essential function for TLR3 in the production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, after IAV challenge (unpublished data). On the contrary, the expression of some other mediators is increased in <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus wild-type lungs. The consequences and the mechanisms of this TLR3-regulated differential expression of cytokines and chemokines are rather complex to hypothesize at this stage due to the pleiotropic and multiple effects of these mediators on diverse cell types. Moreover, these molecules induce or inhibit the production of other cytokines or mediators from their targets in a complex array of positive and negative feedback loops &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Regardless, consistent with the role of TLR3 in virus-induced inflammation, two of us recently established that infection of <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with the West Nile virus induces a lower secretion of cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, compared to wild-type mice, that leads to reduced neuronal injury and increased survival in <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, in a study examining the role of another TLR in the host response to herpes simplex virus, Kurt-Jones et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated an attenuated cytokine response parallel to a reduction in symptoms of encephalitis in <italic>TLR2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to control animals. It is of note, however, that our results still demonstrate high mortality when the <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> strain was infected by a high viral amount of IAV, although the difference between this group and wild-type animals is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). This finding suggests that TLR3 contributes to the shaping of a harmful innate and adaptive immune response at an extent that varies under the IAV load, i.e., that supplementary signaling pathways may be involved at high viral load. In that regard, it is of note that while TLR3 has emerged as a key sensor of viral dsRNA, very recent studies show that cells also express RNA helicases that function as alternative pattern-recognition receptors that detect actively replicating viruses in cytoplasm (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;). Hence, depending on the IAV dose, it is tempting to speculate that the activity of one dsRNA receptor or the other may be transiently switched on or off. The in vivo evidence that RNA helicases&#x02013;IAV interaction contributes to the debilitating effects of a detrimental inflammation awaits further studies.</p><p>Interestingly, cytokines play critical roles in shaping subsequent adaptive T cell responses. This is the case for IFN-&#x003b3;, which is generally considered as essential for the control of many microbial infections, and its important role in the antiviral immune defense is highlighted by the fact that several viruses encode proteins designed to interfere with IFN-&#x003b3; signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However, most current evidence studies suggest that it may also exert a strong negative effect on the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell, a critical cellular component of the adaptive immune response. Thus, T cells treated with IFN-&#x003b3; show reduced proliferation and/or increased apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, IFN-&#x003b3; can act as a negative feedback regulator to control Th1-mediated immune responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In view of those data, it may be conceivable that the excessive IFN-&#x003b3; recovered from the airspaces of <italic>TLR3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might contribute to a decrease in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell number and to a limitation of T cell&#x02013;mediated inflammation in this group of animals, in comparison with wild-type mice. Indeed, although the recruitment of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is essential for protective responses, it is becoming increasingly evident that they can also be associated with the development of influenza-related immunopathological sequelae &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. We confirmed that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are prominent in the airways of IAV-challenged wild-type mice. The drastic decrease in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocyte infiltration concomitant with the prolonged survival of the <italic>TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice suggests that a dysregulated TLR3-dependent CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response may lead to sustained lung injury. Accordingly, this idea sheds new light on previous studies that have reported that mice given antilymphocyte serum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; or the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide had a lesser pulmonary pathology when infected with IAV than untreated mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Of note is that the detrimental role of the cell-mediated immune response during influenza is analogous to infection with the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Indeed, immunodepressed mice infected with this virus do not die as do immunocompetent mice, despite persistent viral production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, a clear conclusion from our work is that a reduction in TLR3-mediated inflammatory infiltrate reduces the clinical manifestations of IAV-induced pneumonia. Nonetheless, although potentially valuable, there would be no overall benefit from treating influenza solely with TLR3 downregulators as we found that the lack of TLR3 resulted in increased pulmonary IAV load. Hence, while vaccination should remain the basis for influenza prophylaxis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020053-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, we suggest that along with inhibitors of viral replication, a concomitant treatment with modulators of TLR3 might be useful in the management of IAV infections, particularly in at-risk groups during periods when there is a mismatch between the epidemic strain and the vaccine strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Virus preparation and quantification.</title><p>Influenza A/Scotland/20/74 (H3N2) virus was generously provided by N.
