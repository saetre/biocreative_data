We identified &#x0223c;20 TRIM proteins that, when transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, affect the entry or release of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), or avian leukosis virus (ALV). While TRIM11 and 31 inhibited HIV entry, TRIM11 enhanced N-MLV entry by interfering with Ref1 restriction. Strikingly, many TRIM proteins affected late stages of the viral life cycle. Gene silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM 25, 31, and 62 inhibited viral release indicating that they play an important role at late stages of the viral life cycle.

TRIM5 belongs to a family of E3 ligases with over 70 members, a number of which have exhibited antiviral activity. These findings have led to the hypothesis that several TRIM proteins may contribute to the innate immunity to retroviruses. In this manuscript, we systematically test the antiviral activities of 55 human and mouse TRIM proteins. The results are astonishingly complex with activities affecting both early and late stages of the retroviral life cycle. Importantly, a number of TRIM proteins that affect HIV or MLV replication upon overexpression, enhance virus entry or release when downregulated by gene silencing. These experiments suggest that additional TRIM proteins contribute to the endogenous restriction of retroviruses. Future work should focus on the identification of TRIM proteins that are upregulated specifically in response to interferons as well as the mechanisms by which the identified proteins interfere with retroviral replication.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Uchil PD, Quinlan BD, Chan WT, Luna JM, Mothes W (2008) TRIM E3 ligases interfere with early and late stages of the retroviral life cycle.

To evaluate the significance of the observed inhibitory and enhancing effects standard statistical analysis was employed to arrive at a cut-off of 2.5 (by adding the maximum variability between control samples and two times the standard deviations). HIV entry was potently blocked by rhesus TRIM5 (38-fold) and to a lesser extent by human TRIM5 (5-fold) confirming previous results &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040016-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040016-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040016-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Interestingly, no other TRIM protein affected HIV entry as potently as rhesus TRIM5. Mouse TRIM8 inhibited HIV entry about 6-fold. Moderate inhibitory effects were observed for human TRIM11, 26, 31 and mouse 10, 11 and 56. Expression of human TRIM38 and mouse TRIM21 enhanced HIV entry.</p><p>To perform a similar experiment for N-tropic MLV (N-MLV), reporter viruses were generated in HEK293 cells by transfecting plasmids encoding for N-tropic MLV GagPol, MLV LTR-GFP and ALV-A Env. Viruses were harvested as above and the susceptibility of HEK293 cells expressing Tva receptor and individual TRIM proteins to N-MLV was tested. N-MLV was strongly inhibited by TRIM1 (15-fold) and TRIM5 (18-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). A number of additional TRIM proteins moderately affected N-MLV entry (human TRIM25, 26 and 62; mouse TRIM8, 25, 31 and 56). Interestingly, human and mouse TRIM11 as well as mouse TRIM30 enhanced N-MLV entry (4.5-, 3- and 4.5-fold, respectively).</p><p>The inhibitory pattern observed for N-MLV was largely distinct from HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">1</xref>C). Notable exceptions included human TRIM26, mouse TRIM8 and 56 that affected both HIV and MLV. Opposite effects were observed for the TRIM11 proteins. While they inhibited HIV entry, enhancing effects were observed for MLV. TRIM proteins specifically affecting N-MLV were human and mouse TRIM25, human TRIM62, mouse TRIM31 and mouse TRIM30. In contrast, human TRIM proteins 31, 38 and the mouse proteins 10 and 21 specifically affected HIV entry.

To test which TRIM proteins are specific for N-MLV, we performed an identical entry experiment for B-MLV. As previously reported, human TRIM1 and TRIM5 exhibited no effect on B-MLV entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, the remaining TRIM proteins exhibited an inhibitory profile that resembled that observed for N-MLV (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>D to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">1</xref>C). Interestingly, the enhancing properties of TRIM11 (human and mouse) and mouse TRIM30 proteins were specific for N-MLV and not observed for B-MLV. The ratio of fold inhibition for N versus B-MLV as well as the scatter plot analysis illustrate this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">1</xref>G).

Consistent with the inhibitory effects of TRIM 11 and 31 on HIV entry, downregulation of both proteins using siRNA facilitated HIV entry (2&#x02013;3-fold). While modest, these enhancements in viral entry suggest that TRIM11 and 31 contribute to the restriction of HIV in HeLa cells. Likewise, the enhancing effect of TRIM11 expression on N-MLV entry led to a corresponding inhibition following gene downregulation of the endogenous protein (3-fold). In contrast, TRIM25 and 62 exhibited inhibitory effects against MLV viruses when overexpressed or silenced using RNAi. Thus, the transient expression screen for TRIM proteins identified human TRIM11 and TRIM31 as factors modulating retroviral entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A Role for TRIM 11 in the Reduction of TRIM 5 Protein Levels</title><p>The specific enhancement of N-MLV, but not B-MLV entry upon expression of TRIM11 proteins as well as mouse TRIM30 was unanticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g001">1</xref>E).

Strikingly, expression of low amounts of TRIM11 led to the disappearance of TRIM5, an effect that could be delayed by treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">2</xref>D). The reduction of TRIM5 levels as determined by western blotting corresponded with a loss of cytoplasmic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, lower panel). The protein levels of another TRIM protein, human TRIM15, were largely unaffected by the expression of human TRIM11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Because both proteins are expressed from the same promoter, the observed reduction in TRIM5 levels is likely not explained by effects of TRIM11 on transcription. Deleting the RING domain of TRIM11 did not affect TRIM5 protein levels, indicating a functional dependence on E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Correspondingly, entry of N-MLV in HeLa cells was enhanced 16-fold by the expression of wild-type TRIM11, whereas TRIM11 lacking the RING domain exhibited reduced activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040016-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Together these results suggest that TRIM11 regulates the turnover of TRIM5 thereby regulating the level of Ref1 restriction in mammalian cells.

TRIM11 may contribute to the turnover of endogenous TRIM5, because silencing of endogenous TRIM11 enhanced the Ref1 restriction.

The interaction of TRIM15 with retroviral Gag suggests that TRIM proteins, apart from entry, can recognize retroviral Gag proteins during assembly and budding and thereby inhibit viral release.
