Neural stem cells present in the adult spinal cord can be expanded in vitro and improve recovery when transplanted to the injured spinal cord, demonstrating the presence of cells that can promote regeneration but that normally fail to do so efficiently. Using genetic fate mapping, we show that close to all in vitro neural stem cell potential in the adult spinal cord resides within the population of ependymal cells lining the central canal. These cells are recruited by spinal cord injury and produce not only scar-forming glial cells, but also, to a lesser degree, oligodendrocytes. Modulating the fate of ependymal progeny after spinal cord injury may offer an alternative to cell transplantation for cell replacement therapies in spinal cord injury.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Spinal cord injuries occur in more than 30.000 individuals each year worldwide and result in significant morbidity, with patients requiring long physical and medical care. The recent identification of resident stem cells in the adult spinal cord has opened up for the possibility of pharmacological manipulation of these cells to produce cell types promoting recovery after injury. We have employed genetic tools to specifically address the identity and reaction to injury of a spinal cord subpopulation of cells known as ependymal cell. Genetic labeling of this putative stem cell population allows for the evaluation of stem cell activity in vitro and in vivo. We found that ependymal cells lining the central canal act as neural stem cells in vitro and contribute extensively to the glial scar in vivo. Interestingly, injury induces proliferation of ependymal cells and migration of ependyma-derived progeny towards the site of injury. Moreover, ependymal cell progeny differentiate and give rise to astrocytes as well as myelinating oligodendrocytes. In summary, our results point to ependymal cells as an attractive candidate population for non-invasive manipulation after injury.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Spinal cord injury induces the proliferation of putative stem cells derived from the ependyma that migrate towards the site of injury.

We report that ependymal cells constitute the vast majority of cells displaying in vitro neural stem cell properties in the adult spinal cord. Ependymal cells self-renew in vivo, but do not generate appreciable numbers of other cell types under homeostatic conditions. Their normally limited proliferation increases dramatically after spinal cord injury and they then produce oligodendrocytes, and more abundantly, astrocytes that migrate to the site of injury and make a substantial part of the glial scar.</p><p>The immediate descendants of tissue stem cells, progenitor cells with limited self-renewal capacity and/or lineage potential, can in some situations acquire stem cell properties &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, spermatogonial progenitor cells can regain stem cell function after injury and during aging and forebrain neurospheres may be derived from committed progenitors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. It appears unlikely that this would explain the neural stem cell properties displayed by ependymal cells in vitro, as they are not replenished by any other cell type in the adult, but are self-renewing. However, although ependymal cells at the population level display cardinal stem cell features in vivo, such as self-renewal and generation of diverse progeny, it is difficult to study these properties at the single cell level in the tissue, and we cannot conclude that they act as stem cells in vivo.</p><p>In addition to ependymal cells, neural progenitors (expressing NG2, Olig2, and/or Nkx2.2) reside in the white and gray matter of the adult rodent spinal cord &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.

Under the standard neurosphere assay conditions employed here, the vast majority of the neural stem cell potential resides within the ependymal population. However, we cannot exclude that other cells contribute, to a comparatively smaller degree, to neurosphere formation under our conditions or that they may display neural stem cell properties under other conditions. The parenchymal progenitors are likely to serve to replace glial cells in the uninjured spinal cord, which we do not find evidence that ependymal cells do. Parenchymal progenitors are rapidly depleted after spinal cord injury, but are later replaced and may participate in the generation of glial cells after injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that some of the ependyma-derived Olig2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells observed shortly after injury represent regenerated parenchymal progenitors.</p><p>The limited functional recovery typically associated with central nervous system injuries is in part due to the failure of severed axons to regrow and reinnervate their targets.

The majority of ependyma-derived cells differentiate to astrocyte-like cells after injury and are found in the core of the scar tissue. However, these cells are found in complementary nonoverlapping domains to areas immunoreactive to CSPG, the most important axonal growth inhibitor associated with glial scars &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, axons in the scar tissue, most likely sprouts from severed axons growing into the scar tissue, were frequently found in direct proximity to ependyma-derived cells. This argues that ependyma-derived cells in the scar tissue do not constitute a major impediment to axonal growth, and may even suggest that they support some local sprouting.</p><p>Spinal cord injury results in the loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination of axons even at some distance to the lesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Spinal cord injuries are most commonly incomplete in man, leaving spared tissue connecting the spinal cord above and below the lesion, but the function of remaining axons is often compromised due to demyelination. Without insulating sheaths of myelin, spared axons close to, but not directly affected by the injury, become less efficient in their ability to conduct electrical impulses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, chronically demyelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration. Axons are remyelinated with time, and this is thought to occur through the generation of new oligodendrocytes by stem or progenitor cells rather than by self-duplication of mature remaining oligodendrocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b057">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. We report here that ependymal cells contribute to the regeneration of oligodendrocytes and remyelination after spinal cord injury. The differentiation pattern of ependymal cells after injury is reminiscent to that seen for in vitro expanded adult spinal cord neural stem cells transplanted to the injured spinal cord &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Since ependymal cells are the main source of neurospheres from the adult spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060182-g003">Figure 3</xref>), promoting oligodendrocyte generation from these cells in vivo could potentially improve recovery after spinal cord injury. The development of pharmacological strategies to modulate endogenous stem cells and their progeny may be an attractive alternative to cell transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of transgenic mice.</title><p>For <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic>, we used the enhancer found in the second intron of the rat <italic>nestin</italic> gene fused to a minimal hsp68 promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d; that controls the expression of CreER<sup>T2</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060182-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.
