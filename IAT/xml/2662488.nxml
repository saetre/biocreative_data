Control of the NO concentration, therefore, is critical for proper brain function, but, although its synthesis pathway is well-characterized, the major route of breakdown of NO in brain is unclear. Previous observations indicate that brain cells actively consume NO at a high rate. The mechanism of this consumption was pursued in the present study. NO consumption by a preparation of central glial cells was abolished by cell lysis and recovered by addition of NADPH. NADPH-dependent consumption of NO localized to cell membranes and was inhibited by proteinase K, indicating the involvement of a membrane-bound protein. Purification of this activity yielded CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase). Antibodies against CYPOR inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes and the amount of CYPOR in several cell types correlated with their rate of NO consumption. NO was also consumed by purified CYPOR but this activity was found to depend on the presence of the vitamin E analogue Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid), included in the buffer as a precaution against inadvertent NO consumption by lipid peroxidation. In contrast, NO consumption by brain membranes was independent of Trolox. Hence, it appears that, during the purification process, CYPOR becomes separated from a partner needed for NO consumption. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes, making these proteins likely candidates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR)</kwd><kwd>NADPH</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>CYPOR, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase</kwd><kwd>DETA/NO, diethylenetriamine NONOate</kwd><kwd>DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone</kwd><kwd>DPI, diphenyleneiodonium chloride</kwd><kwd>DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid</kwd><kwd>L-NNA, <sc>L</sc>-nitroarginine</kwd><kwd>NO, nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>NO<sub>GC</sub>, NO-activated guanylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>NOS, NO synthase</kwd><kwd>SOD, superoxide dismutase</kwd><kwd>Trolox, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>NO (nitric oxide) is an intercellular signalling molecule with a role in several neurophysiological functions, including the acute modulation of neuronal excitability, the longer-term synaptic changes associated with learning, and the development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Its major physiological receptor is the NO<sub>GC</sub> (NO-activated guanylyl cyclase, also known by its homogenate-based name, soluble guanylyl cyclase), through which it stimulates the production of the second messenger cGMP. cGMP has numerous targets, including cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases, mediating the short- and long-term modulations of neuronal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>These physiological pathways are engaged by low nanomolar concentrations of NO. The dynamic range of the NO<sub>GC</sub> receptor, as measured in intact cells, is between 0.1 and 10&#x000a0;nM NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that this is the range of NO concentrations normally experienced by cells. Indeed, electrical stimulation of cerebellar brain slices yielded 4&#x000a0;nM NO, as measured by electrodes positioned at the slice surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Even lower NO concentrations may also be physiologically relevant, as NO-dependent phosphorylation events have been reported after exposure to sub-nanomolar NO concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>At higher concentrations, NO may be linked with pathophysiology. NO inhibits the respiratory chain enzyme, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;nM at physiological oxygen concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and micromolar NO levels can produce cell damage via reaction with superoxide and production of the highly oxidising species peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Control of the amplitude and duration of changes in NO concentration is therefore likely to critically affect both the manner in which NO can act physiologically and also whether it has any pathological effects. The NO concentration experienced by a cell will be determined by the relative rates of NO synthesis and breakdown but, although the mechanism of NO synthesis from <sc>L</sc>-arginine is relatively well characterized, there is no known dedicated consumption pathway for NO in the brain, although a number of enzymes have been proposed to fulfil this function in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One such protein is CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase), which is involved in an extremely avid NO consumption by a colorectal cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A process with similar properties [membrane localization and NAD(P)H dependence] has also been reported in cultured endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Previous work has revealed that brain tissue actively consumes NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In dissociated brain cells, part of the NO consumption was found to be caused by lipid peroxidation, which is likely to be of particular relevance to pathology, but inhibition of lipid peroxidation unmasked another consumption process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The present study aimed to identify this mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All compounds were purchased from Sigma (Poole, U.K.) unless otherwise stated.

Cytochrome P450 inhibitors decreased NO consumption by brain membranes, suggesting that reduction of these proteins by CYPOR underlies NO consumption.</p><p>Cytochrome P450s perform hydroxylation reactions which, in the brain, are involved in diverse functions including steroid hormone synthesis, cholesterol homoeostasis and vitamin, eicosanoid and xenobiotic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Both CYPOR and several members of the cytochrome P450 family are expressed in brain, though at much lower levels than in the liver (1&#x02013;10%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). Interestingly, NO has been shown to bind and inhibit several cytochrome P450s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], making them intriguing candidates for NO consumption by brain membranes. Indeed, the reductase domain of NOS is very similar to that of CYPOR and performs an analogous function, donating electrons to the haem-containing oxygenase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NO binding to the NOS haem domain inhibits its catalytic activity and NO can then be consumed here by reaction with O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The CYPOR/cytochrome P450 system has been previously linked with NO consumption in a colorectal cancer cell line (CaCo-2 cells; Hallstrom et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) in which the authors suggest one of the following reaction schemes: 1) NO binding to cytochrome P450 haem-Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form Fe<sup>2+</sup>-NO, which reacts with O<sub>2</sub> to form nitrate and haem-Fe<sup>3+</sup>, or 2) O<sub>2</sub> binding to the same haem-Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which reacts with NO to form nitrate and haem-Fe<sup>3+</sup>. In both schemes, NADPH/CYPOR then reduces the haem back to Fe<sup>2+</sup> to continue the reaction cycle. Our finding that brain contains a similar NADPH/CYPOR-dependent NO consumption process suggests that this general mechanism plays a role in normal (non-cancer) cells.</p><p>The sensitivity of brain membranes to imidazole-derived cytochrome P450 inhibitors suggests that the operative cytochrome P450 is not likely to be CYPs 3A4, 2A6 or 2C19, which are much more sensitive to ketaconazole and clotrimazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The inhibition profiles found here are instead similar to those for CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 which are less sensitive to imidazole inhibition and are both expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. On a cautionary note, however, both clotrimazole and ketoconazole may affect proteins other than cytochrome P450s (e.g. K<sup>+</sup> channels; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]).</p><p>As CYPOR was able to consume NO in the presence of the soluble vitamin E analogue Trolox (but not other antioxidants), it is also possible that vitamin E is an additional endogenous partner for CYPOR in brain membranes. Vitamin E is highly lipid-soluble and its membrane location would be appropriate for interacting with CYPOR, a membrane protein. Unfortunately, the high lipid solubility of vitamin E makes it very difficult to explicitly test for this relationship. Attempts to incorporate vitamin E and CYPOR into brain membranes and reconstituted phospholipid vesicles were not effective in enhancing NO consumption activity (results not shown), but we were unable to positively control for their successful incorporation, so cannot exclude a role for vitamin E. Endogenous vitamin E levels can be manipulated by dietary means, but this procedure also affects levels of cytochrome P450s and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], so would not clarify the issue.</p><p>The mechanism by which Trolox, CYPOR and NADPH together support NO consumption is unclear. Flavins in the nitric oxide synthase reductase domain (which is analogous to CYPOR) can pass electrons to molecular O<sub>2</sub> to produce superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the bulk solution this will be dismutated by SOD to hydrogen peroxide but it is possible that at the active site, NO could react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a very reactive molecule that could oxidize the protein structure. Possibly Trolox could then recover enzymatic activity by reducing the relevant residues. Alternatively, Trolox can be oxidized to a quinone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], produced by SOD, and Trolox&#x02013;quinone can then be reduced by NADPH to a semiquinone which readily reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. As above, superoxide could react directly with NO or alternatively, NO itself may be directly reduced by quinones or flavins. Which, if any, of these mechanisms underlies the Trolox-dependent NO consumption remains unclear. Before pursuing it further, the physiological relevance of this process to that observed in brain membranes and intact cells needs to be clarified, bearing in mind that the lack of Trolox-dependence in brain membranes indicates that the Trolox effect may be an artifact.</p><p>NADPH-dependent NO consumption in brain is somewhat less active than in CaCo-2 cells. In the latter, the rate of NO consumption at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M NO was 4 nmol/min per mg of protein, or 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M/min at 1&#x000a0;mg of protein/ml. In brain membranes, the rate constant for NO consumption is 0.59 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per mg of protein (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and calculations in the legend), so at 1&#x000a0;mg of protein/ml and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M NO, the rate of NO consumption is 0.59&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M/min, almost 7-fold lower than in CaCo-2 cells. That CaCo-2 cells are more active than brain is consistent with the relative expression levels of the CYPOR/cytochrome P450 systems: low in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] but relatively high in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and in cancer cells and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].
