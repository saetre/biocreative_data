Upon brain injury, the extracellular concentrations of nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysLTs), two families of endogenous signaling molecules, are markedly increased at the site of damage, suggesting that they may act as &#x0201c;danger signals&#x0201d; to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair. Here we show that, in brain telencephalon, GPR17, a recently deorphanized receptor for both uracil nucleotides and cysLTs (e.g., UDP-glucose and LTD<sub>4</sub>), is normally present on neurons and on a subset of parenchymal quiescent oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We also show that induction of brain injury using an established focal ischemia model in the rodent induces profound spatiotemporal-dependent changes of GPR17. In the lesioned area, we observed an early and transient up-regulation of GPR17 in neurons expressing the cellular stress marker heat shock protein 70. Magnetic Resonance Imaging in living mice showed that the <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological or biotechnological knock down of GPR17 markedly prevents brain infarct evolution, suggesting GPR17 as a mediator of neuronal death at this early ischemic stage. At later times after ischemia, GPR17 immuno-labeling appeared on microglia/macrophages infiltrating the lesioned area to indicate that GPR17 may also acts as a player in the remodeling of brain circuitries by microglia. At this later stage, parenchymal GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitors started proliferating in the peri-injured area, suggesting initiation of remyelination. To confirm a specific role for GPR17 in oligodendrocyte differentiation, the <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of cortical pre-oligodendrocytes to the GPR17 endogenous ligands UDP-glucose and LTD<sub>4</sub> promoted the expression of myelin basic protein, confirming progression toward mature oligodendrocytes. Thus, GPR17 may act as a &#x0201c;sensor&#x0201d; that is activated upon brain injury on several embryonically distinct cell types, and may play a key role in both inducing neuronal death inside the ischemic core and in orchestrating the local remodeling/repair response. Specifically, we suggest GPR17 as a novel target for therapeutic manipulation to foster repair of demyelinating wounds, the types of lesions that also occur in patients with multiple sclerosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular adenine (ATP, ADP), uracil (UTP, UDP) and sugar nucleotides (e.g., UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose) are universal and phylogenetically ancient signaling molecules involved in many biological processes, from embryogenesis to adult homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Burnstock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both types of mediators accumulate at the sites of inflammation, and inflammatory cells often co-express both P2Y and CysLT receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Capra1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In rat microglia, the brain immune cells involved in the response to cerebral hypoxia and trauma, the activation of P2Y<sub>1</sub> and CysLT receptors mediate co-release of nucleotides and cysLTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ballerini1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, which might, in turn, contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in the rat, levels of cysLTs in the lesioned cortex were sharply increased 4 h after MCAo and rapidly declined afterwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciceri1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same experimental model, extracellular concentrations of ATP were instead constantly elevated starting from 20 min after MCAo throughout a 220 min of microdialysis sampling, with a time course similar to that of excitatory amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Melani1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, at the site of brain injury, neurons and glia are exposed to high concentrations of both extracellular nucleotides and cysLTs, suggesting that these signaling molecules may act as &#x0201c;danger signals&#x0201d; to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair.</p><p>We have recently reported that GPR17, a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Blasius1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> (GPCR) at an intermediate phylogenetic position between P2Y and CysLT receptor families, is a new P2Y receptor specifically activated by both uracil nucleotides (UDP, UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose) and cysLTs (LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTC<sub>4</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciana1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this hybrid pharmacology, activation of GPR17 by uracil nucleotides was counteracted by the P2Y receptor antagonists cangrelor and MRS2179, whereas its activation by cysLTs was antagonized by montelukast and pranlukast, two already marketed CysLT receptor blockers (ibidem). Both the human and the previously unknown rat receptor were found to be highly expressed in organs typically undergoing ischemic damage, i.e., brain, heart and kidney. Moreover, in the MCAo rat model, 48 hours after ischemia induction, GPR17-immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the ipsilateral cortex both within and at the borders of the ischemic infarct, suggesting a potential role in the evolution of ischemic damage. On the other hand, in a recent transcriptome study comparing the gene expression pattern of human <italic>fetal</italic> and <italic>adult</italic> neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs), GPR17 was identified as one of the three genes that were exclusively expressed in adult hippocampal NPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Maisel1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, thus highlighting a potential role in brain repair. Thus, GPR17 may have a differential role in brain response to injury, depending upon whether the receptor is already constitutively expressed by the cell or is induced as a result of brain insult. Moreover, a differential role of GPR17 may also depend on specific phases of brain response after the insult (sequentially, death of irreversibly damaged cells, clearance of dead cells, remodeling and repair).</p><p>On this basis, the present study has been specifically aimed at assessing the localization of GPR17 in cells of different lineages (neurons, glia and neural progenitor cells) of the intact mouse brain and its changes at different times after induction of focal cerebral ischemia in the MCAo model.</p><p>We show that in the intact brain GPR17 is expressed by neurons and by a subset of adult quiescent parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitors. Following ischemia, GPR17 is sequentially induced in neurons, microglia/macrophages and adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells, suggesting that it may act as a common regulatory gene mediating response to injury in embryonically-distinct cell types. This indicates GPR17 as a possible target for pharmacological intervention in neurodegeneration processes including cerebral ischemia and demyelinating diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning and characterization of mouse GPR17</title><p>To study in detail the role of GPR17 in brain injury, the well established model of focal cerebral ischemia in the mouse (MCAo) was chosen. Thus, as a first step, we cloned and characterized the previously uncharacterized murine GPR17 ortholog (GenBank NM_001025381). Mouse GPR17, which is localized on chromosome 18, contains a 1020 base pairs open reading frame (ORF) that encodes for a putative 339 amino acid protein 90 and 98&#x00025; identical to human and rat GPR17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciana1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Specific external primers were used to amplify cDNA from several mouse tissues. Specific PCR products of the expected mw (1022 bp) were obtained from mouse brain, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle, but not from liver and lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The 1022 bp PCR product from mouse brain cDNA was then cloned into a pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector. The plasmid containing the positive murine GPR17 clone (pcDNA3.1-Gpr17m) was used to transiently transfect 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells, a cell line lacking endogenous P2Y receptors and already utilized for the characterization of human and rat GPR17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciana1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of the transfected receptor was assessed by the appearance of a PCR product of the expected 1022 bp length in cells receiving pcDNA3.1-Gpr17m, whereas no expression of mGPR17 was found in cells transfected with the corresponding empty vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). To confirm that the receptor transcript is indeed translated into the receptor protein, we utilized a rabbit anti-GPR17 polyclonal antibody that also recognizes human and rat GPR17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciana1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, upon incubation with this antibody, 1321N1 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Gpr17m showed a specific immunoreactive signal which, instead, was not detected in cells receiving the corresponding empty vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). To further confirm the specificity of these results, in the mGPR17-expressing cells, pre-adsorption of the anti-receptor antibody with the neutralizing peptide utilized for immunization completely abolished the GPR17 signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p>The pharmacological profile of mGPR17 was then assessed. Since stimulation of GPCRs results in increased binding of GTP to G proteins (which can, in turn, be quantified by measuring &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;GTP&#x003b3;S binding to purified membranes; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Marteau1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>), GPR17 activation in the heterologous system was determined by testing the increase of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;GTP&#x003b3;S binding by exogenously-added agonists in membranes from transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Marteau1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Kotani1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Fumagalli1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Coronal sections taken at different brain levels were immuno-labeled with the anti-receptor antibody in parallel with markers of neuronal or glial cells. In the intact cerebral cortex, immunohistochemical studies with a high sensitivity amplification kit revealed GPR17 expression in two distinct types of cells. One cell type had neuronal morphology (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003579-g002">Figure 2A</xref>): the neuronal nature of these GPR17-positive (GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells was confirmed by co-staining with the neuronal specific markers SMI-311 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003579-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003579-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Higher magnification analysis of these cells suggested that, as expected for a GPCR, GPR17 was selectively expressed in the plasma-membrane of NeuN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003579-g002">Figure 2D, 2D&#x02032;, 2D&#x02033;</xref>).

Co-expression with markers of pre-oligodendrocytes was further confirmed using an antibody against the transcription factor Olig2, a key regulator of oligodendrocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Dawson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, in the case of NG2, only a partial co-localization was found, since some cells only stained for NG2 (arrowheads in G) and some others only stained for GPR17 (white arrows in G, H). Co-localization was much higher in the case of GPR17 and Olig2 (see text for quantification).

Up-regulation of GPR17 in the ischemic area is also confirmed by western blot analysis in membrane (M) and cytosolic (C) fractions from intact contralateral (Con) and ipsilateral ischemic (MCAo) cortex of mice (right panel). GPR17 is identified with an anti-GPR17 antibody as an immunoreactive protein band with an approximate 50 kDa molecular weight; as expected for a membrane receptor, this band is present in membranes but not in cytosolic fractions. To confirm blot specificity, the 50 kDa protein band is abolished in the presence of the neutralizing peptide (indicated as&#x0002b;pept).

A causal link between up-regulation of GPR17 and extent of brain damage was suggested by data showing that inhibition of GPR17 by either pharmacological agents or by an antisense-oligonucleotide strategy markedly attenuated cell death (ibidem).

Mouse GPR17 is 90&#x00025; identical to the human receptor and, importantly, its response profile to ligands is closer to that of the human receptor with respect to the rat receptor. Despite some differences in the affinities of UDP and UDP-glucose, which were more potent at the mouse compared to the human receptor, potencies of cysLTs were in the same range. Moreover, while the endogenous ligand UDP-galactose is totally ineffective at rat GPR17, this nucleotide significantly activates both the human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Ciana1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and the mouse receptor (the present study).

In particular, the number of ramified precursors expressing both Olig2 and GPR17 is very high, to suggest that Olig2, which is a transcriptional factor, may drive the expression of GPR17 in these cells. By bioinformatic analysis, we indeed found 14 potential Olig2-responsive elements in the upstream region of the GPR17 gene. These responsive elements can bind to either Olig2 itself or to other members of the Olig2 transcription factor family, such as Atoh1, Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, Neurod6, Neurog1, Neurog2, Neurog3, TGF12 and TGF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In both the human, rat and mouse GPR17 upstream regions, 6 phylogenetically conserved domains were found: two of them (indicated as E-Box 1 and E-Box 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003579.s003">Figure S3</xref>) are particularly interesting, since they are identical in the 3 species and contain 2 responsive elements for members of the Olig2 transcription factor family.</p><p>In the intact brain parenchyma, none of the GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursor cells expressed either GFAP, or DCX or mature oligodendrocyte/myelination markers, suggesting that GPR17 specifically decorates mature neurons and quiescent pre-oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, in c. striatum, immature GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/MBP-negative precursor cells were often found physically associated to or inside myelin tracts, which have been previously shown to also contain immature Olig2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Arnett1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. These GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells may represent a source of pre-oligodendrocytes able to turn into myelinating cells when necessary; alternatively, these cells could play a role in the local trophic control of myelination. To confirm the link between GPR17 and the oligodendroglial lineage, highly ramified GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursors specifically expressing markers identifying different stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation are also present in primary cultures obtained from cortical parenchyma. In a similar way to what observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, under control conditions, these cells are not positive for either stem cell, neuronal or glial markers, and very few of them express MBP, a marker of mature oligodendroglia. This suggests that GPR17 expression is specifically segregated to the early stages of the oligodendrocyte differentiating pathway, and that the receptor is turned down when these cells reach functional maturation (in this respect, see also below).</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, GPR17 is also present in both cells of the ependymal layer and in a subset of subependymal precursor cells of the lateral ventricles, one of the classical neurogenic areas that are still active in the adult brain. Again, none of these cells express either GFAP, nestin or DCX, suggesting that they are not &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; multipotent neurogenic cells or neuronal precursors; moreover, in a similar way to the parenchymal GPR17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursor cells, they did not incorporate BrdU (at least under the experimental conditions utilized here).

No synergistic nor additive effects were noticed when both agonists were combined together.

Our unpublished data demonstrate that GPR17 plays a similar role in other models of central nervous system neurodegenerative disease such as spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis (manuscripts in preparation); thus, GPR17 may represents a sensor of local injury that is activated upon different kinds of lesions independently of the cause at the basis of damage.

In addition, pharmacological strategies aiming to activate this receptor on pre-oligodendrocytes via small brain-permeable molecules may also directly contribute to implement intrinsic repair in post-ischemic regeneration as well as in demyelinating neurodegenerative conditions such as multiple sclerosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human astrocytoma cells 1321N1 cells were cultured as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003579-Fumagalli1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.
