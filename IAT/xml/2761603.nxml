Viruses are thought to cause epithelial cell injury and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and considered a source of fibroblasts in the setting of lung injury. We have demonstrated an association between the epithelial injury caused by chronic herpes virus infection with the murine &#x003b3;-herpes virus, MHV68, and lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that EMT in this model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis is driven by the expression of the transcription factor Twist.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Findings</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> MHV68 infection of murine lung epithelial cells induced expression of Twist, and mesenchymal markers. Stable overexpression of Twist promoted EMT in MLE15 lung epithelial cells. Transient knockdown expression of Twist resulted in preservation of epithelial phenotype after <italic>in vitro</italic> MHV68 infection. In concordance, high expression of Twist was found in lung epithelial cells of MHV68 infected mice, but not in mock infected mice. Alveolar epithelial cells from lung tissue of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were strongly positive for Twist. These cells demonstrated features of EMT with low expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin. Finally, IPF tissue with high Twist protein levels was also positive for the herpesvirus, EBV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We conclude that Twist contributes to EMT in the model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

Both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein and DNA expression have been identified in lung tissue of patients with IPF. Evidence that viral infection may be causally related to the development of IPF is the observation that expression of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in alveolar cells is associated with a poor prognosis in IPF patients, and a major host cell for the virus is the alveolar epithelial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Tsukamoto1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have demonstrated that Interferon-&#x003b3;-Receptor knockout (IFN&#x003b3;R&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice inoculated with the murine &#x003b3;-herpes virus 68 (MHV68) develop progressive interstitial fibrosis, and many histological features reminiscent of IPF associated with virus reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Mora1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Fibroblasts from fibrotic lungs can originate locally by proliferation of resident interstitial fibroblasts. They can also originate from circulating fibrocytes derived from bone marrow progenitor cells or from the transdifferentiation of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Meneghin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Strieter1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In the latter, the epithelial cells undergo morphological changes to acquire fibroblast or myofibroblast markers such as fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1), &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, while losing epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, occludin, and desmoplakin. This process is termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Histopathology analyses of IPF lung biopsies and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis have revealed epithelial cells which acquire a mesenchymal phenotype giving evidence to the idea that EMT may be an important source of fibroblasts in the setting of IPF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Willis1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Kim1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We set out to investigate the role of EMT in virus-induced lung fibrosis and the factors that influence this process.

In this report, using an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> model of MHV68 infection of lung epithelial cells, we show that &#x003b3;-herpes virus infection induces Twist and expression of mesenchymal markers. Inhibition of Twist expression by shRNA in MLE15 cells infected with MHV68 resulted in persistent E-cadherin expression and lower expression of collagen compared to cells without Twist knockdown. Importantly, ectopic overexpression of Twist in MLE-15 was sufficient to reduce the expression of E-cadherin, a protein required in the cell-cell contact and usually downmodulated during EMT, and to increase the expression of FSP-1, fibronectin and collagen, mesenchymal cell markers. Furthermore, this report is the first to demonstrate upregulation of Twist protein expression in a murine model of virus-induced lung fibrosis and in IPF lung tissue. Twist was expressed in the nuclei of alveolar type II epithelial cells of MHV68 infected lungs and was not expressed in mock-infected lung tissue. The levels of Twist changed with time after lung infection starting with low levels in early infection and high levels at the time of chronic MHV68 infection. Expression of Twist in IPF lungs was upregulated significantly. Furthermore, expression of Twist in alveolar epithelial cells in IPF was associated with expression of pro-SP-C protein and the mesenchymal cell marker N-cadherin. In addition, Twist-positive lung epithelial cells in IPF tissues had cytoplasmic instead of membranous localization of E-cadherin.</p><p>Microarray analysis of IPF tissue identified an IPF-specific gene expression signature characterized by the up-regulation of genes involved in tissue remodeling and enriched with genes associated with lung development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Studer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the developmental genes discovered were members of the Sry-related high mobility group-box and forkhead box families, and genes related to the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway.

Once expressed, Twist directly or indirectly represses E-cadherin expression via E-boxes that are also targeted by Snail and SIP1. However, the repression of E-cadherin is not sufficient to induce EMT and ectopic expression of E-cadherin does not restore the epithelial phenotype in Twist-overexpressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Yang3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, Twist expression in tumor cells is associated with EMT and increased cell motility, suggesting that Twist may contribute to metastasis. Suppression of Twist expression in highly aggressive 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007559-Yang3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Samples containing 40 &#x000b5;g of protein were separated by electrophoresis on SDS 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; gradient polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membrane was blocked in 5&#x00025; skim dry milk and probed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in TBS-Tween buffer (0.02 M Tris &#x0005b;pH 7.6&#x0005d;, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.05&#x00025; Tween 20) with primary antibodies. Membranes were washed in TBS-Tween buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. After washing membranes in TBS-Tween buffer again, they were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank to Dr. Seth Force, Emory University Thoracic Surgery, for his support with human tissue collection, and to Jianguo Xu and Melinda Dorson for excellent
