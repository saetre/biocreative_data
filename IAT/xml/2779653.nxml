At damaged forks, BLM interacts with RAD51 recombinase, the essential enzyme in HR that catalyzes homology-dependent strand invasion. We have previously shown that defects in BLM modification by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) cause increased &#x003b3;-H2AX foci. Because the increased &#x003b3;-H2AX could result from defective repair of spontaneous DNA damage, we hypothesized that SUMO modification regulates BLM's function in HR repair at damaged forks. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells that stably expressed a normal BLM (BLM&#x0002b;) or a SUMO-mutant BLM (SM-BLM) with hydroxyurea (HU) and examined the effects of stalled replication forks on RAD51 and its DNA repair functions. HU treatment generated excess &#x003b3;-H2AX in SM-BLM compared to BLM&#x0002b; cells, consistent with a defect in replication-fork repair. SM-BLM cells accumulated increased numbers of DNA breaks and were hypersensitive to DNA damage. Importantly, HU treatment failed to induce sister-chromatid exchanges in SM-BLM cells compared to BLM&#x0002b; cells, indicating a specific defect in HR repair and suggesting that RAD51 function could be compromised. Consistent with this hypothesis, RAD51 localization to HU-induced repair foci was impaired in SM-BLM cells. These data suggested that RAD51 might interact noncovalently with SUMO. We found that in vitro RAD51 interacts noncovalently with SUMO and that it interacts more efficiently with SUMO-modified BLM compared to unmodified BLM. These data suggest that SUMOylation controls the switch between BLM's pro- and anti-recombinogenic roles in HR. In the absence of BLM SUMOylation, BLM perturbs RAD51 localization at damaged replication forks and inhibits fork repair by HR. Conversely, BLM SUMOylation relieves its inhibitory effects on HR, and it promotes RAD51 function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Replication is the process in which cellular DNA is duplicated. DNA damage incurred during replication is detrimental to the cell. Homologous recombination, in which DNA sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical strands of DNA, plays a pivotal role in correcting replication processes that have failed due to DNA breakage and is tightly regulated, because deficient or excess recombination results in genomic instability. Previous studies have implicated the DNA-processing enzyme BLM in the regulation of homologous recombination; BLM is defective in Bloom's syndrome, which is characterized by excess recombination and cancer susceptibility. Here, we show that modification of BLM by the small protein SUMO controls BLM's function in regulating homologous recombination at sites where DNA replication failed. We showed that cells expressing a SUMO-deficient mutant of BLM accumulated more DNA damage and displayed defects in repair by homologous recombination. An enzyme involved in homologous recombination, RAD51, displayed a defect in localization to sites where DNA replication failed. Our data support a model in which SUMO modification regulates BLM's function in homologous recombination by controlling the localization of RAD51 to failed replication sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity DNA repair mechanism that functions to rejoin double-strand breaks (DSBs) and restart broken replication forks.

Failure to SUMOylate BLM resulted in excess damage-induced repair foci, DSBs, and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Importantly, in SM-BLM cells, replication stalling by HU did not stimulate HR as measured by SCEs, suggesting a defect in RAD51 function. Consistent with these data, RAD51 failed to accumulate at stalled forks. SUMO-mutant BLM exerts a dominant effect, because excess &#x003b3;-H2AX foci were induced by expression of SUMO-mutant BLM in HeLa cells, which express endogenous normal BLM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Eladad1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we showed here that several SM-BLM phenotypes differed from BS phenotypes, such as the presence of excess H2AX phosphorylation in untreated cells, the RAD51 localization defect, and the lack of HU-induced SCEs. We found that RAD51 is a SUMO-binding protein, implicating BLM SUMOylation in recruitment of RAD51 to repair sites through a mechanism involving noncovalent SUMO interactions. Our findings demonstrate that BLM SUMOylation regulates the recruitment and/or retention of RAD51 to damaged replication forks, and it is important in HR-mediated repair.</p><p>The steady-state levels of DSBs in cells are a function of the rate at which DNA damage accumulates and the rate at which it is repaired. We observed that SM-BLM cells exhibited greater numbers of DSBs than BLM&#x0002b; cells under a variety of conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000252-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For example, SM-BLM cells exhibited more HU-induced DSBs, which arise due to breakage of stalled forks, and more CPT-induced DSBs, which arise due to replication runoff at sites where topoisomerase-cleavage complexes are bound to the DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Strumberg1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Formally, the presence of increased levels of DSBs in SM-BLM cells could result from an increase in the rate at which DNA damage accumulates (due to excess numbers of replication forks, increased numbers of topoisomerase cleavage complexes, or a failure to process aberrant replication intermediates) or from a decrease in the rate of DNA repair (due to a failure to recruit RAD51). We noted that the rate of DSB accumulation after release from the HU block was the same in both SM-BLM and BLM&#x0002b; cells, indicating that the rate of breakage exceeds the rate of repair under these conditions in both types of cells. Consistent with these observations, the numbers of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in both BLM&#x0002b; and SM-BLM cells increase 6 h after release from the HU block (unpublished data).</p><p>Recent work has shown that BLM is present on a class of ultrafine anaphase bridges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Chan1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and it acts to separate interlinked DNA strands especially at loci with intrinsic replication difficulties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Chan2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. BS cells consequently have a defect in separation of sister chromatids, resulting in more anaphase bridges; some fraction of the increased DSBs that arise in BS cells no doubt traces to breakage at sites of underreplicated DNA.

One possible explanation for the excessive numbers of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci and DSBs in treated and untreated SM-BLM cells is that these cells have increased replication difficulties, as BS cells do, and they compensate by activating additional replication forks, which are concomitantly more likely to break after replication damage. According to this view, BLM SUMOylation helps prevent the collapse of replication forks in regions with hard-to-replicate DNA, perhaps by stimulation of BLM's activity in subverting aberrant recombination intermediates at stalled replication forks.</p><p>Alternatively, BLM SUMOylation could promote HR-mediated repair of broken forks through the recruitment and/or retention of RAD51 at damaged forks. RAD51 is the DNA recombinase essential for HR-mediated DNA repair, and previous studies have demonstrated that RAD51 and BLM interact specifically in DNA-damaged cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Bischof1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Wu3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of immunolocalization studies, we found that the recruitment and/or retention of RAD51 at sites of stalled DNA replication forks is impaired in SM-BLM cells. Whereas BLM&#x0002b; cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in the number of colocalized &#x003b3;-H2AX-RAD51 foci upon HU treatment, SM-BLM cells exhibited a &#x0003c;1.5-fold increase in these foci. On the basis of this finding, and the finding that HR-mediated DNA repair is defective in SM-BLM cells, we propose that BLM SUMOylation mediates the recruitment and/or retention of RAD51 to sites of DNA damage and thereby facilitates HR-mediated repair processes.</p><p>Previous cell and biochemical studies have led to the view that BLM has both pro- and anti-recombinogenic functions.

In the event that a stalled replication fork progresses to a DSB, stimulation of HR-mediated repair would be triggered by BLM SUMOylation and, consequently, more efficient recruitment and/or retention of RAD51 at the repair site.</p><fig id="pbio-1000252-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000252.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>BLM SUMOylation regulates BLM and RAD51 function in HR-mediated repair of damaged forks.</title><p>The model depicts a replication fork that has either stalled or broken.

SUMOylation could dissociate BLM from broken DNA ends, where it might otherwise inhibit RAD51 binding and function by displacing RAD51 from ssDNA or by unwinding D-loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Bugreev1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-vanBrabant1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. SUMOylation could limit the binding of BLM to sites of DNA damage by altering its affinity to ssDNA or possibly by triggering its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. SUMO-mediated degradation has been described for PML and other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-LallemandBreitenbach1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Tatham1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In the model that we currently favor, BLM SUMOylation could function to promote RAD51 localization at repair sites by stabilizing its interactions with BLM through a mechanism involving noncovalent SUMO binding. Consistent with this model, we found that RAD51 is a SUMO-binding protein and that it interacts more efficiently with SUMOylated BLM compared to unmodified BLM. RAD51 is recruited to damaged replication forks in BS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Bischof1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Wu3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and to a limited number of sites of DNA damage in SM-BLM&#x02013;expressing cells. Thus, multiple factors appear to control RAD51 recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Nonetheless, our findings support the hypothesis that in BLM-expressing cells, BLM SUMOylation promotes RAD51 recruitment and/or retention at sites of DNA damage and thereby facilitates HR-mediated DNA repair.</p><p>SUMOylation of BLM is likely to have multiple roles. In addition to regulating its activity at sites of DNA damage as revealed in the current study, BLM SUMOylation may also be important in mediating the localization of BLM to PML-NBs in undamaged cells. SUMO modification can function to retain proteins in the PML-NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Matunis1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies have shown that BLM rapidly associates and dissociates from the PML-NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-WeidtkampPeters1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This on&#x02013;off process may be mediated primarily through BLM's SUMO interaction motif, which is required for BLM localization to the PML-NBs and for BLM SUMOylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Hu1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Zhu2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of a SUMO binding site(s) in RAD51 suggests that its association with the PML-NBs may also be regulated through the SUMO pathway.</p><p>Our results have broad implications for understanding not only how the integrity of replication forks are maintained under stress but also how SUMO modification regulates its substrates, because many proteins in the DNA repair and signaling pathways are SUMO substrates. Although the role of SUMO in HR function is not yet understood, it is clear that SUMOylation plays multiple roles in regulating the HR pathway through modifications of various HR factors, including Sgs1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Branzei1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, Rad52 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Burgess1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Sacher1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, PCNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Moldovan1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, and other recombination-associated factors. <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants and mutants of the SUMO-specific E3 ligase gene <italic>mms21</italic> accumulate aberrant cruciform structures at damaged replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Branzei1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Liberi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. This genetic evidence suggests that SUMOylation is important in the regulation of HR, but there has been no direct evidence that SUMOylation occurs at the repair site. Because SUMO-mutant BLM accumulates at HU-induced replication fork damage, the present results indicate that BLM SUMOylation occurs at the sites of damaged replication forks, where it affects stabilization of stalled forks, trafficking of RAD51 to repair sites, and HR repair of damaged forks. Further experiments are now needed to characterize the spatial and temporal regulation of SUMOylation of the different repair factors in HR. In particular, we need to determine what signals activate BLM SUMOylation and how BLM SUMOylation is regulated at damaged forks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>For BLM Western analysis, rabbit polyclonal anti-BLM antibodies raised against the first 431 amino acids of human BLM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Beresten1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> or commercially available antibodies (A300-110A, Bethyl Laboratories) were used.

These effects on RAD51 localization are observed despite the fact that mimosine treatment induces many &#x003b3;-H2AX foci, which has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000252-Saintigny1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000252.s006.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000252.s007"><label>Figure S7</label><caption><p><bold>BLM and SM-BLM localize to stalled replication forks with similar efficiency.</bold> (A) Immunofluorescence images of representative S-phase BLM&#x0002b; and SM-BLM cells treated with 0.5 mM HU for 24 h. Cells were stained with antibodies to PCNA. Images show GFP-BLM fluorescence, PCNA staining, and merged BLM-PCNA immunofluorescence. (B) Graphical representation of the average numbers of BLM foci, PCNA foci, and colocalized BLM-PCNA foci in HU-treated BLM&#x0002b; and SM-BLM cells. The numbers of BLM and PCNA foci were counted in cells that stained positively for PCNA, as these represented cells in S phase. Data presented are the average of two experiments in each of two BLM&#x0002b; and two SM-BLM clones. Bars represent the mean numbers of foci or colocalized foci per nucleus, and the error bars represent the standard deviations of the combined data. The levels of BLM foci and PCNA foci were higher in SM-BLM than in BLM&#x0002b; cells; however, the percentages of colocalized BLM-PCNA foci were similar in BLM&#x0002b; and SM-BLM cells, indicating that SUMO-mutant BLM localizes normally to sites of replication damage.</p><p>(0.99 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000252.s007.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mary Yagle for technical assistance, Elizabeth Davis in Dr. Michelle Le Beau's laboratory for assistance with the cytogenetic assays, Dr. Vytas Bindokas for assistance with immunofluorescence analysis, Dr. Phillip Connell for antibodies to human RAD51 and human RAD51 expression constructs, and Dr. Kenan Onel for helpful discussions.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pbio.1000252-Kowalczykowski1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kowalczykowski</surname><given-names>S.
