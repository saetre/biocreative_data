Using confocal microscopy, we showed that cell sizes and shapes differ between the two cell layers of the outer integument. Expression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>in the integuments leads to extra cell divisions specifically in the outer layer of the outer integument. This is being compensated for by a decrease of cell volume in this layer, thus showing that mechanisms exist to control proper ovule integument morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>outer ovule integument can be used as a good model system to study the basic principles of plant organ morphogenesis. This work provides new insights into its development and opens new possibilities for the identification of factors involved in the regulation of cell division and elongation during plant organ growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fertilised ovules develop into seeds that contain the plant embryo. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, three distinct regions can be identified along the proximal-distal axis of the ovule primordium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The most proximal structure of the primordium is the funiculus, which connects the primordium to the placenta. At the distal end of the primordium lies the nucellus in which the megaspore mother cell develops. The chalaza in the central zone of the primordium initiates two integuments, each composed of two cell layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During ovule development, the two integuments grow around the nucellus and, after fertilization, develop into the seed coat that encloses the embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Whereas the inner integument initially develops as a radially symmetrical structure that surrounds the nucellus, the outer integument grows only from the side of the ovule primordium that faces the basal end of the carpel (gynobasal side) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The outer integument remains two-cell layered throughout seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At later stages of seed development, cells of the abaxial (outer) layer of the outer integument differentiate terminally into highly specialized seed coat cells that contain polysaccharide mucilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The development of ovule integuments in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Two inner and one outer integument grow out from the chalaza (c) during early ovule development. <bold>(B) </bold>Ovule at stage of fertilization: Integuments have grown around nucellus (n), i.i.1: inner (adaxial) layer of inner integument, i.i.2: outer (abaxial) layer of inner integument, o.i.1: inner (adaxial) layer of outer integument, o.i.2: outer (abaxial) layer of outer integument.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-8-35-1"/></fig><p>The integuments are the only lateral organs produced by the ovule. The evolutionary origin of the integuments is still a matter of debate. The telome theory suggests that integuments originated from the fusion of sterile or fertile branches (telomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is generally believed that the inner and outer integument derived independently. While the inner integument most likely originated directly from the fusion of telomes or sporangiophores, the outer integument is believed to have developed later from a cupule, a leaf-like structure surrounding one or more ovules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The development of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>outer ovule integument involves the same basic processes required for the formation of other determinate lateral plant organs, such as leaves. The outer ovule integument is an example for an organ of determinate growth and characteristic form in which the rate and direction of cell division and elongation needs to be precisely regulated. Asymmetric growth and differentiation are also essential features of its development. In case of the integuments, proper morphogenesis is especially critical, as an improper curvature or closure would lead to seeds with embryos that are not sufficiently protected. However, it seems that integument extension is relatively sensitive to alterations in cell division or cell expansion. Mutations in <italic>SHORT INTEGUMENTS2 </italic>(<italic>SIN2</italic>), for example, lead to shorter integuments due to a reduction of cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The result of mutations in <italic>SIN1/DCL1</italic>, on the other hand, show reduced integument size due to a lack of cell expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Because of its simple two-layered structure, the outer integument is an ideal organ for the study of the basic principles of plant morphogenesis. For this a better characterisation of outer integument growth and cell fates within the integument is required. To address this, we have identified <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>enhancer-trap lines with specific expression of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) in distinct domains of the outer integument. These lines provided good markers for the characterisation of cell proliferation and differentiation during development of the outer integument. KNAT1 is a homeodomain protein that is normally expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), and which alters leaf morphology when ectopically expressed in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Misexpression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>caused increased cell division specifically in the abaxial layer of the outer integument and showed that compensatory mechanisms exist in the outer integument to ensure its proper morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A screen for marker lines for the study of outer integument development</title><p>To obtain markers for the study of outer ovule integument development, a population of 400 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>C24 enhancer-trap lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was screened for <italic>GFP </italic>expression in the outer ovule integument. Six lines showed stable patterns of <italic>GFP </italic>expression in this tissue. In seed coats of seeds that contained walking stick stage embryos, <italic>GFP </italic>expression in three of the lines (KS059, KS110, KS151) was seen throughout the outer layer of the outer integument, one line (KS149) showed expression in both outer integument cell layers, and two lines (M214, M237) showed <italic>GFP </italic>expression that was restricted to the micropylar end of the outer layer of the outer integument. Four of the lines (KS110, KS151, KS149, M237) were chosen for a more detailed analysis of <italic>GFP </italic>expression patterns throughout ovule and seed development using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (ovules and seeds of three independent plants, n &#x02265; 5/stage).</p><p>To describe <italic>GFP </italic>expression patterns in those four lines we will follow a recent suggestion by Skinner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We will use the term "gynobasal" to refer to the side of the ovule primordium that faces the base (receptacle) of the carpel, and the term "gynoapical" for the side that faces the apical (stigma) side of the carpel. The terms "abaxial" and "adaxial" will be used to refer to the polarity of the lateral organs of the ovule, i.e. the integuments (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Markers for the adaxial-abaxial polarity in the outer integument</title><p><italic>GFP </italic>expression in ovules of line KS110 was restricted to the abaxial (outer) layer of the outer integument (o.i.2).

This is reflected by the shape of the endothelium. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B</xref> shows seeds of wild type and <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressers during early embryo development. The endothelium accumulates proanthocyanidins and can therefore be selectively stained with vanillin.

Unlike the rest of the integument, cells at the micropylar end did not seem to be able to compensate fully for the extra cell division by reducing their size. Therefore more cells of almost normal size were expressing the <italic>GFP </italic>marker.</p><p>In summary, although reduced cell elongation largely compensated for the extra cell division in the o.i.2 of plants with ectopic expression of <italic>KNAT1</italic>, a more pronounced hyponastic growth of the integument was still noticeable. The shape of the seed of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing plants was slightly distorted, with the closure of the integuments shifted towards the gynobasal side (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>).

Therefore the root tip lies closest to the unprotected area of the <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing plant seed. We noticed that seedlings of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing lines were often impaired in root growth and developed secondary roots at a much earlier stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9G</xref>). These seedlings seemed to have localized tissue damage in the embryonic root tip and occasionally also at the tip of the cotyledons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). To quantify our observations, seeds (n = 30) of C24 and <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing lines were germinated and the number of seedlings with impaired root growth was counted. While wild type roots grew normally, 3.5% (line 41) and 7.1% (line 13) of seedlings of the <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressers showed impaired growth. Sodium hypochlorite treatment, as commonly used for the surface sterilization of seeds, dramatically increased the number of seedlings with severely impaired root growth. Treatment with Na-hypochlorite for 5 minutes led to 20% and 36% seedlings with damaged root tips, respectively (wild type control: 3.5%). An exposure for 30 minutes resulted in more than 90% of seedlings with non-viable root tips in both transgenic lines (wild type control: 6.6%). Therefore, the seed coats of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing plants provided less effective protection against the bleach solution, and cells at the site of closure of the integuments were most vulnerable to damage.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Domains of gene expression in the outer integument</title><p>We have selected four <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>enhancer-trap lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] for the study of gene expression domains in the outer ovule integument. These lines expressed <italic>GFP </italic>under the control of endogenous enhancers, depending on the insertion of the enhancer-trap construct into the plant genome. The lines obtained in this study can be used for the analysis of ovule development, as has been shown here for the analysis of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>misexpressing ovules.</p><p>Two main points can be made from the study of <italic>GFP </italic>expression in the enhancer-trap lines: 1) The different cell identities of cells in the o.i.1 and in the o.i.2 are laid down during early integument development and are maintained. Lines KS110 and KS149 showed <italic>GFP </italic>expression in the o.i.2 but not in the o.i.1 of the developing outer integument in ovules before fertilization. <italic>INO </italic>also shows a similar expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The establishment of polarity in the integuments might be important for the outgrowth of the integuments, as has been shown for leaves (for a recent review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). In contrast to <italic>INO</italic>, <italic>GFP </italic>expression in lines KS149 and KS110 did not show axial preferences with respect to the gynoecium's axis. Lines KS110 and KS151 showed <italic>GFP </italic>expression in the outer layer of the outer integument also throughout seed development. The differences between o.i.1 and o.i.2 become obvious during late seed coat development when only cells of the o.i.2 differentiate into mucilage containing seed coat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>2) Cells at the micropylar end of both seed integuments are distinct from the rest of the integument cells. These cells also show obvious morphological differences, as they are noticeably longer than the average integument cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, they responded differently to <italic>KNAT1 </italic>misexpression. The morphological differences were reflected by the expression of markers that were not present in the rest of the integument. Line M0237 specifically marked cells at the micropylar end of the o.i.2 after fertilization and during seed development. Line KS151 marked this area in the outer cell layer of both integuments. It is likely that cells at the micropylar end have specific functions such as the protection of the embryo, which is growing from the micropylar end. Moreover, the region includes cells that are among the earliest to undergo elongation during integument growth. The differential expansion of these cells may help bend this tissue to form the characteristic shape of the ovule.</p></sec><sec><title>Similarities of leaf and outer integument polarity</title><p>The expression patterns of our marker lines support the theory that the outer integument developed from a leaf-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While lines KS110, KS149, and KS151 with <italic>GFP </italic>expression in the outer integument did not show expression in the inner integuments, they all showed <italic>GFP </italic>expression in leaves and some also in other leaf-like structures, such as petals. Moreover, the markers that were expressed on the abaxial side of the outer integument (KS110 and KS151) also showed the same polar expression in leaves. So far, no gene has been found that is exclusively expressed in the o.i.1. To date, we also have not identified an enhancer-trap line that shows <italic>GFP </italic>expression solely in the o.i.1 (unpublished results). Surprisingly, it has been shown recently that <italic>PHABULOSA </italic>(<italic>PHB</italic>), a homeodomain gene that is expressed on the adaxial side of leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], is expressed in the inner integument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This led to the speculation that the two integuments of the bitegmic <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ovule might have been derived through the splitting of one integument of a unitegmic precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. According to this, however, we would expect <italic>GFP </italic>expression in line KS149 to be found in both integuments, as <italic>GFP </italic>was expressed in all leaf cell layers in this line. In order to clarify these contradicting findings we need to investigate the expression patterns of more ovule-expressed genes on a whole plant level.</p></sec><sec><title>KNAT1 overexpression phenotype</title><p>Many genes that play a role in SAM development are also important for ovule development and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Although <italic>KNAT1 </italic>is not normally expressed in ovules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], it is likely that <italic>KNAT1</italic>, when expressed in the ovule, can interact with other proteins that are normal KNAT1 interaction partners in the SAM. Moreover, other <italic>KNOX </italic>genes could be expressed in the ovule and be involved in the regulation of meristematic activity during integument development. In many cases members of a gene family have become functionally diversified by changes in their expression patterns but their activities are still interchangeable. Several members of the YABBY family, for example, can restore integument outgrowth in <italic>ino-1 </italic>mutants. However, only the ovule expressed <italic>INO </italic>is sensitive to SUPERMAN (SUP) regulation that limits <italic>INO </italic>expression to the gynobasal side of the ovule primordium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Accordingly, KNAT1 could partially adopt the role of another KNOX homeodomain protein but would be insensitive to proper regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>In the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>SAM, KNAT1, together with STM1, plays a role in the transition zone where it allows for the amplification of stem cell daughter cells by maintaining their meristematic identity before they are consumed by organ formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In agreement with its role in the SAM, <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expression phenotypes in leaves have been interpreted as being the result of a shift from determinate to indeterminate growth characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, the <italic>KNAT1 </italic>loss-of-function mutant <italic>brevipedicellus </italic>(<italic>bp</italic>) displays defects in cell division in internodes and pedicels, demonstrating that KNAT1 is also required for the maintenance of an indeterminate state in these organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Cell differentiation, elongation and growth in the pedicels of <italic>bp </italic>mutants were more severely affected on the abaxial side than on the adaxial side, causing a change in pedicel growth angle.</p><p>Expression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>in the ovule integuments triggered ectopic cell divisions, consistent with a role of KNAT1 in maintaining indeterminancy. At present we cannot explain why the presence of KNAT1 only has a visible effect in the o.i.2. However, the phenotype of <italic>bp </italic>pedicels also seems to suggest that the abaxial side of pedicels is more affected by the presence of KNAT1 than the adaxial side. It is also possible that expression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>in the integuments caused a certain degree of adaxialization of the outer integument and therefore the o.i.2 would adopt o.i.1 features. Two observations support this interpretation. First, expression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>in the integuments caused cells of the o.i.2 to divide approximately as often as cells of the o.i.1. Second, a marker that is normally expressed in the o.i.2 but not in the o.i.1 was virtually absent in <italic>KNAT1 </italic>expressing ovules. As no markers are available that are only expressed in the o.i.1 we were unable to test the reverse situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of cell proliferation during morphogenesis of the outer integument</title><p>We found clear differences in cell sizes in the two cell layers of the outer integument. Cell area sizes in the o.i.2 were 2.4 times bigger than in the o.i.1, which indicates that during integument development cells in the adaxial layer undergo approximately one division more than cells in the abaxial layer.</p><p>Misexpression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>almost abolished the differences of cell area sizes in the two layers. Formally, the higher number of smaller cells found in the o.i.2 of integuments of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>over-expressing plants could be the result of impaired cell elongation or increased cell division. It is more likely that KNAT1 promoted cell division, since cells of the o.i.2 were still able to elongate after the extra cell division had already occurred. A compensatory mechanism was in place in the o.i.2 that resulted in the restriction of cell expansion and therefore in the development of an outer integument of relatively normal size and shape.</p><p>During leaf morphogenesis, mechanisms exist to compensate for defects in cell division or expansion (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). As a general rule it can be stated that a decrease in cell number or an increase in cell elongation can be compensated for by increased cell expansion or decreased cell division, respectively. So far, there are only a few examples that an increased number of cell divisions or decreased cell expansion, as seen here for <italic>KNAT1 </italic>expression in the o.i.2, could lead to similar compensatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. To our knowledge a cell layer specific increase of cell divisions, which would more accurately correspond to the <italic>KNAT1 </italic>overexpression phenotype, has not been achieved so far. Therefore, the <italic>KNAT1 </italic>overexpression phenotype of ovules represents the first description of a compensatory mechanism that involves a decrease in cell elongation to compensate for increased cell divisions in one specific cell layer. Strict control of integument size on the whole organ level and cell-cell communication between the o.i.1 and the o.i.2 has to be postulated.</p><p>For <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>it has been shown that endosperm growth has a reciprocal effect on integument cell elongation to control final <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>seed size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here we show that, in addition to that, growth in the two outer integument cell layers is precisely and independently regulated to achieve coordinated integument morphogenesis. The outer integument would therefore be a good system to study the mechanisms of coordinated cell proliferation that result in the final shape of a plant organ.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work shows that previously not recognized compensatory mechanisms exist to ensure proper ovule integument morphogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the outer ovule integument can be used as a good model system to study the basic principles of plant organ morphogenesis. The outer integument is a simple two-cell layered structure, consists of only a few different cell types, and is easily accessible by confocal microscopy. A marker line expressing <italic>GFP </italic>in both layers of the outer integument enabled us to measure cell areas in the two outer integument cell layers of developing <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>wild type seeds and can be used for a high-throughput screen for mutants with altered cell division patterns in the integument. Misexpression of <italic>KNAT1 </italic>in the ovule produces a clear and easily visible phenotype that can be used to identify factors involved in the regulation of cell division and elongation on the organ level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Transgenic lines</title><p>The GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] KS110, KS149, KS151, and M0237 are available from the Nottingham <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Stock Centre (NASC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] as stock numbers N9260, N9266, N9267, and N9339, respectively.
