RNase T1 and nuclease S1 were used to probe unpaired nucleotides and RNase V1 to monitor base-paired or stacked nucleotides. Bases were probed with dimethylsulfate (at A(N-1), C(N-3) and G(N-7)), with 1-cyclohexyl-3 (2-(1-methylmorpholino)-ethyl)-carboiimide-p- toluenesulfonate (at U(N-3) and G(N-1)) and with diethylpyrocarbonate (at A(N-7)). The RNA region corresponding to nucleotides 652 to 753 was tested within: (1) the complete 16S rRNA molecule; (2) a 16S rRNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 578 to 756 obtained by transcription in vitro; (3) the S15-16S rRNA complex; (4) the S15-fragment complex. Cleavage and modification sites were detected by primer extension with reverse transcriptase. Our results show that: (1) The synthetized fragment folds into the same overall secondary structure as in the complete 16S rRNA, with the exception of the large asymmetrical internal loop (nucleotides 673-676/714-733) which is fully accessible in the fragment while it appears conformationally heterogeneous in the 16S rRNA; (2) the reactivity patterns of the S15-16S rRNA and S15-fragment complexes are identical; (3) the protein protects defined RNA regions, located in the large interior loop and in the 3'-end strand of helix [655-672]-[734-751]; (4) the protein also causes enhanced chemical reactivity and enzyme accessibility interpreted as resulting from a local conformational rearrangement, induced by S15 binding.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0089-a" xlink:role="2828"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0090-a" xlink:role="2829"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0091-a" xlink:role="2830"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2825"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2826"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2827"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2828"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2833"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2834"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2836"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2837"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2838"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00150-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2839"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
