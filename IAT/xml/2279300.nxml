TARP crosses the plasma membrane where it is immediately phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by unknown host kinases. The Rac GTPase is also activated, resulting in WAVE2 and Arp2/3-dependent recruitment of actin to the sites of chlamydia attachment. We show that TARP participates directly in chlamydial invasion activating the Rac-dependent signaling cascade to recruit actin. TARP functions by binding two distinct Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Sos1 and Vav2, in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. The tyrosine phosphorylation profile of the sequence YEPISTENIYESI within TARP, as well as the transient activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI<sub>3</sub>-K), appears to determine which GEF is utilized to activate Rac. The first and second tyrosine residues, when phosphorylated, are utilized by the Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 and Vav2, respectively, with the latter requiring the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Depletion of these critical signaling molecules by siRNA resulted in inhibition of chlamydial invasion to varying degrees, owing to a possible functional redundancy of the two pathways. Collectively, these data implicate TARP in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling machinery, demonstrating a mechanism by which <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> invades non-phagocytic cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The human pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is the causative agent of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted disease in industrialized nations, and of the preventable blinding condition trachoma in developing countries. Survival and replication of chlamydial species occur exclusively inside a host cell, and thus, gaining access to the protective intracellular niche is an absolute requirement. This report describes how the chlamydia protein TARP, which is secreted at the base of the bacteria and across the host membrane, acts as a scaffold to which host signaling proteins bind. This assembly of the complex of signaling proteins, which include Sos1, Abi1, Eps8, and Vav2 results in the remodeling of the host cytoskeleton to facilitate engulfment of the infecting chlamydia. We conclude that these proteins have a role in chlamydia based on a number of observations including their interaction with the TARP protein, their ability to switch on known signaling participants in chlamydia invasion, their localization at the site of chlamydia entry, and the inhibition of chlamydia invasion in their absence. Altogether, the data functionally link TARP with signaling pathways that function in chlamydial invasion, demonstrating the direct involvement of TARP in the invasion of host cells by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that are responsible for a number of human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Schachter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Different serological variants of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> are primarily pathogens of humans. Serological variants (serovar) A, B, Ba, and C are the etiologic agents of trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Serovars D to K are associated with sexually transmitted diseases, and serovars L1, L2, and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum, a more invasive sexually transmitted disease. <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci</italic> is a zoonotic agent that causes a pneumonia-like respiratory disease in humans. <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> is a causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia, and has recently been associated with cardiovascular diseases. The genii Chlamydia and Chlamydophila share several biological properties, including a biphasic developmental cycle that includes cell types adapted for extracellular survival (elementary bodies or EBs) or intracellular multiplication (reticulate bodies or RBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Moulder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Intracellular development occurs within a protective vacuole called an inclusion, which is nonfusogenic with endocytic vesicles, but is instead interactive with an exocytic pathway that delivers sphingomyelin and cholesterol from the Golgi apparatus to the inclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Hackstadt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because of the obligate intracellular nature of chlamydiae, access to the inside of the cell is paramount to survival. To this end, Chlamydiae have evolved to efficiently invade non-phagocytic cells through a process that has been described as &#x0201c;parasite-specified phagocytosis&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Byrne1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Because entry into host cells is a critical step in the chlamydial developmental cycle, this stage of infection is an especially attractive chemotherapeutic target for inhibition. Thus, considerable efforts have been put forth to understand the molecular mechanism of chlamydial invasion. Several chlamydial ligands and host receptors have been proposed, although there has been little consensus as to which of the number of chlamydial ligands and host receptors are of primary importance. It is likely that many of these ligand-receptor interactions function in infection of different cell and tissue types conferring an advantage during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-ScidmoreCarlson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Chlamydial invasion is initiated by the electrostatic and reversible interaction of EBs mediated through host heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans, followed by an irreversible host-dependent step that leads to internalization of EBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Zhang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Wuppermann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. While the identity of the host factors in this secondary irreversible step has yet to be identified, the characterization of the molecular mechanism of the post-attachment stages of chlamydial infection is beginning to be defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Subtil1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon attachment of EBs, there is a demonstrable rapid recruitment of actin at the sites of attachment, leading to the the formation of pedestal-like structures underneath attached EBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Coombes1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This recruitment of actin is transient and eventually leads to the uptake of EBs into membrane-bound vesicles that are devoid of known early endosomal markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Hackstadt2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, a chlamydial protein associated with the uptake of EBs was found to be translocated by a type III secretion system into the host cell at the site of entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Clifton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Once in the cytosol, the protein quickly becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by host kinases. This protein, termed TARP for translocated actin-recruiting protein, is likely to be involved in chlamydial invasion in that it is able to interact with both filamentous and monomeric actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Jewett1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, live cell imaging studies demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation preceding actin recruitment, leading to the hypothesis that TARP plays a key role in initiating a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of the cellular actin remodeling machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Clifton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A striking feature of the TARP protein is the presence of several tyrosine-rich tandem repeats of approximately 50 amino acids in length. The number of repeats differs, with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> urogenital isolate, serovar D, containing three repeat units and an LGV strain with almost six full repeat units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carlson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is consistent with recent functional studies of TARP that concluded a C-terminal domain located downstream of the tandem repeat region contributes to actin recruitment and nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Jewett1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we report of an alternate mechanism of actin remodeling by TARP that involves the repeat domain. Our data show that phosphorylation of critical residues in this region initiates a signal transduction cascade by interacting with guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Sos1 and Vav2. Mutations in the relevant tyrosine residues resulted in the loss of the ability of TARP to interact with these proteins, preventing recruitment of Rac and actin, and reduced invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A single phosphodomain unit of TARP functions to recruit actin and Rac</title><p>Upon interaction of the EBs with epithelial cells, the TARP tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated are within the context of the phosphorylation sites for members of the Src-family of kinases and recognition sites of various src-homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).

Indeed, the re-initiation of the formation of these actin-rich structures after disruption by the actin-destabilizing agent cytochalasin D was preferentially localized to the sites of chlamydia attachment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000014.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The induced aggregation provided defined spaces in which to monitor the recruitment of GFP-actin and/or GFP-Rac1. Doubly transfected cells were decorated with the beads and appeared green under fluorescence microscopy. For those transfected with CD4-1xR (WT), a ring-like localization of GFP-actin could easily be seen surrounding the beads. CD4-1xR (Y1F2) and (F1Y2), in which the tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanines, also demonstrated recruitment of GFP-actin and GFP-Rac1, while the double mutant CD4-1xR (F1F2) failed to show the same recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The differences in the ability to recruit actin and Rac1 was not due to differences in expression level as all constructs were expressed equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g001">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>The tyrosine residues in the CD4-1xR fusion protein that were actually phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> were determined to be Tyr179 or Tyr189, using a numbering system that starts with the Asp174 residue of the second repeat of the serovar L2 TARP homolog. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g001">Figure 1b</xref> shows that the mutation of the two tyrosines to phenylalanines (F1F2) eliminated any reactivity with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Thus Tyr179 and Tyr189, but not Tyr218 and Tyr221 were phosphorylated. The doublet observed in the lane marked WT was likely due to the singly and doubly phosphorylated forms. Thus, one unit of the phosphodomain of TARP is functional, and that recruitment of actin and Rac1 appeared to require at least one tyrosine to be phosphorylated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The oligopeptide spanning a single copy of the repeated units of TARP binds Rac-specific GEFs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner</title><p>Because one copy of the repeated unit is apparently sufficient to recruit actin and Rac1 in our cell culture assay, and the dependence of these activities on the phosphorylation of Tyr179 and Tyr189, it is hypothesized that the domain may act as a signaling platform to which host signaling molecules are recruited. To directly test this possibility, biotinylated oligopeptides with the sequence DAAAD<underline>Y</underline>EPISTTENI<underline>Y</underline>ESIDDSSTSDPENTSGGAAALNSLRGSSYSNYD were custom synthesized either as non-phosphorylated tyrosines (WT), individually phosphorylated tyrosines (pY1 and pY2), or in which phenylalanines have been substituted for the tyrosines (F1F2). The biotinylated oligopeptides were incubated with lysates from HeLa cells and the presence of molecules known to participate with Rac1 in signal transduction pathways, specifically the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors Vav2 and Sos1 were monitored by Western blotting.

The intramolecular interaction of Vav2 blocks the binding domain of Rac1, which the lipid analog unmasked, and thus allowed for binding of Rac with Vav2. c) The interaction of the Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 complex with TARP requires the Abi1 protein. Lysates depleted of the various components of this complex were subjected to co-precipitation with the pY1 oligopeptide to determine the nature of its interaction with TARP. Abi1 was required for the coprecipitation of Sos1 and Eps8 with the pY1 oligopeptide, while Sos1 or Eps8 depletion did not affect the interaction of Abi1 with pY1, but rather partially inhibited their respective interactions with pY1.

While Vav2 was also present in the pY1, it is unlikely that Rac is binding to this protein, because Rac was not pulled down by pY2 despite the presence of Vav2. However, it has been reported previously that Rac association with Vav2 could be enhanced by the addition of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Marcoux1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Booden1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a water-soluble analog of this phospholipid was added to the lysates, and the pulldown fraction was assayed for the presence of Rac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). When lysates were pre-treated with the PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> analog, the Rac GTPase protein could be detected from the pulldown fractions from both pY1 and pY2. Thus, it appears that interaction of Rac with the phosphodomain of TARP via Vav2 required PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>A series of lysates was prepared from HeLa cells depleted of Sos1, Abi1, and Eps8, and the co-precipitation of these signaling molecules was performed to determine which proteins are required for the interaction of the complex with the pY1 oligopeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). The depletion of the Abi1 protein markedly affected the levels of Eps8 and Sos1 coprecipitated by the pY1 oligopeptide, while neither the depletion of Eps8 nor Sos1 significantly affected the level of coprecipitated Abi1 protein. However, depletion of Eps8 negatively affected the ability of Sos1 to be coprecipitated. Sos1 depletion also had a negative effect on Eps8 pulldown. Taken together, the depletion and pulldown data indicate that Abi1 binding to TARP, which is likely to be indirect due to the lack of any SH2 domain, mediated the coprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos1 in a complex.

We sought to determine if the Sos1, Eps8, and Abi1 complex and Vav2 proteins precipitated by the pY1 oligopeptide could act as a Rac GEF. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared from HeLa cells that were depleted of Sos1 or Vav2 proteins by small interfering RNA (siRNA). As a control, lysates were prepared from HeLa cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. The levels of Sos1 and Vav2 from the respective lysates were markedly reduced. A representative Western blot of an siRNA depletion experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000014.s004">Figure S4</xref>.</p><p>The different precipitates were evaluated for GEF activity towards purified His-tagged Rac1 or His-tagged Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000014-t001">Table 1</xref>). His-Rac1 and His-Cdc42 molecules were mixed with the different precipitates along with <sup>32</sup>P-&#x003b1;-GTP. An additional control in which the His-tagged Rac1 was omitted from the reaction was included. Total HeLa cell lysate showed the highest GEF activity towards the His-tagged Rac1 and Cdc42. When no biotinylated oligopeptide was present, the amount of <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity was relatively low and comparable to samples in which the His-Rac has been omitted. Pulldown samples from the WT oligopeptide showed an approximately 4-fold increase relative to the samples with no oligopeptide, possibly representing the non-specific binding of proteins to the oligopeptides. However, using His-Rac1 as the target, the supernatant incubated with the pulldown samples from the pY1 oligopeptide displayed significantly elevated levels of retained <sup>32</sup>P label relative to the pulldown from the WT oligopeptide for all lysates examined. An exception was the Sos1-depleted lysate, indicating the requirement for the Sos1 GEF. The pY1 precipitate from the PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> -supplemented lysate showed an increase in GEF activity for both His-Rac1 and His-Cdc42 (31038 cpm vs. 51169 (Rac1) and 2821 cpm vs. 28660 cpm (Cdc42)). The corresponding increases could be attributed to the presence of Vav2, which is a GEF for Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA. Indeed, for the exchange reaction using His-Rac1 as the target, Vav2 depletion by siRNA returned the <sup>32</sup>P level to that of the untreated cell lysate, even in the presence of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>. While a similar reaction was not performed using Cdc42 as the target, the significantly lower level of GEF activity in the absence of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> indicate that Vav2 may be involved as well. From the data, it appears that withdrawal of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> was functionally similar to the depletion of Vav2, as this GEF appears to be inefficient in catalyzing the exchange reaction in Rac1 and Cdc42 in the absence of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>. Note that the remaining GEF activity found in the Vav2-depleted lysates was likely due to the presence of Sos1, because its depletion resulted in the further 10-fold decrease in retained <sup>32</sup>P label. The pY1 oligopeptide contained Sos1 and Vav2 exchange activities.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1000014-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000014.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Guanine nucleotide exchange activity associated with the different TARP oligopeptide coprecipitates</title></caption><graphic id="ppat-1000014-t001-1" xlink:href="ppat.1000014.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="ppat-1000014-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pY1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pY2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F1F2</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reg. lysate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">722 (110)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3085 (455)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31038 (1840)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7634 (1155)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">845 (316)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">782 (135)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3165 (520)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51169 (3660)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31700 (2860)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">857 (228)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sos1 siRNA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">846 (118)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3427 (512)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3325 (480)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3385 (720)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/D</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vav2 siRNA&#x0002b;PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">837 (104)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3252 (633)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34520 (2110)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">870 (180)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/D</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cdc42-His</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1013 (94)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2985 (714)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2821 (813)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3842 (996)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">910 (177)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cdc42-His&#x0002b;PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/D</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3790 (996)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28660 (2130)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22985 (3143)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/D</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No Rac-His</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">962 (113)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">835 (210)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">844 (196)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">909 (410)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">924 (211)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total lysate</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">161725 (12860) His-Rac1</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">218830 (9455) His-Cdc42</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Data are expressed as CPM Mean (S.D.).</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><p>Used His-Rac1 as the acceptor unless indicated.</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><p>N/D &#x02013; not determined.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The pulldowns with pY2 yielded relatively high numbers with the PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> -treated (31700 cpm) or untreated (7634 cpm) lysates. The former indicated the presence of a PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> -dependent Vav2 activity, which was confirmed by the loss of retained label (870 cpm) when Vav2 was depleted even in the presence of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>. Similar to pY1, the exchange reaction using Cdc42 as the target was stimulated by the addition of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>, indicating the involvement of Vav2. That Vav2 depletion resulted in values that are similar to the background levels suggests that Vav2 is the only GEF towards Rac1 and Cdc42 in the pY2 pulldown. Interestingly, there was still a relatively high level of GEF activity in the pY2 pulldown from untreated lysates (7634 cpm) compared to background (722 cpm). This result was reproducible, and the significance of this observation is unclear. As expected, the oligopeptides in which the tyrosine residues have been replaced by phenylalanine failed to yield values that are statistically different from the negative controls. Taken together, the lysates pulled down by the phosphorylated peptides contained GEF activity towards His-Rac (pY1) and Cdc42 (pY1 and pY2), and that this GEF activity was due to the presence of Sos1 and Vav2, with the latter requiring the addition of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>.

Manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton by pathogens typically involves the modulation of the activities of host cellular proteins that participate in the complex dynamics of actin recruitment and remodeling. Some pathogens, like Salmonella and Shigella achieve this through secretion of soluble Type III effectors, while others, like Listeria directly bind host cell receptors whose signaling constitutes a cascade that regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Finlay1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we report the identification of the relevant GEFs that activate Rac during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> invasion. Both the Sos1/Eps8/Abi1 multiprotein complex and Vav2 were found to associate with the phosphodomain of TARP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Optimal Rac activation by Vav2 <italic>in vitro</italic> also required the presence of the phospholipids PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>, which is generated at the site of chlamydial attachment by virtue of the interaction of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase with the TARP phosphodomain. Localization to the sites of chlamydial entry and their functional involvement in chlamydial invasion demonstrate their importance in chlamydial invasion of non-phagocytic cells.</p><p>The multiple phosphotyrosine residues in the repeat region of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> TARP are likely recognized by a number of signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and thus act as a scaffolding to which the signaling proteins relevant to actin remodeling are recruited. The binding of the Vav2 GEF and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase is likely due to their respective SH2 domains, which recognize phosphorylated tyrosines. There is, however, a level of specificity to this interaction as not all of the SH2 domain-containing proteins examined bound to the phosphorylated oligopeptides. For example, the adaptor protein Grb-2 failed to bind to either pY1 or pY2 oligopeptides at levels above background. Furthermore, depletion of Grb-2 by siRNA did not affect chlamydial invasion (data not shown).</p><p>It has been previously shown that invasion of HeLa cells by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 is Rac-dependent, and that WAVE2 and Abi1 are downstream effectors that activate the Arp2/3 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo4">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Their report demonstrated that, while Sos1 by itself could activate both Rac and Ras, the addition of Eps8 and Abi1 shifted the specificity of Sos1 towards Rac. We confirmed that the fraction that contained Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 complex has at least a GEF activity towards Rac1. These proteins, indeed function as a complex as depletion of one of the components affected the efficiency of co-precipitation of the others. Based on this set of pulldown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g002">Figure 2c</xref>), we propose that Abi1 mediates the indirect interaction of Sos1 and Eps8 with the pY1 oligopeptide, while Sos1 and Eps8 require each other for their respective interaction with Abi1. The presence of a low level of Eps8 in pY2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000014-g002">Figure 2a</xref> may be due to its interaction with Abi1, and its low level relative to that observed for pY1 was likely due to the absence of Sos1 in the pY2 fraction.</p><p>We have previously shown that expression of the dominant negative mutant of the Rac GTPase inhibited chlamydial invasion, and this inhibition correlated with the loss of actin localization at the sites of entry. The depletion of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate Rac, in essence is functionally equivalent to the dominant negative Rac mutant. Thus, it is likely that inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity towards Rac would result in the similar loss of actin localization at the sites of chlamydial invasion.</p><p>Vav2 demonstrated GEF activity towards both Rac1 and Cdc42. Our results are consistent with previous data that characterized Vav2 specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Abe1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the previously reported exclusive dependence of the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 invasion on Rac1 seems to contradict our data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo4">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation could be the lack of a sustained signal to or by Cdc42 during chlamydial invasion. Three observations appear to support this hypothesis. First, our previous data that demonstrated the lack of any detectable activation of Cdc42 could be interpreted as short-lived activation that was undetected during the time intervals chosen for the experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Carabeo3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the synthesis of the Vav2 co-factor PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> at the site of entry is extremely short-lived, resulting in the transient interaction of Vav2 with its downstream GTPase effectors. Thirdly, there is a precedent for a difference in the duration of signals transduced by GTPase protein. An excellent example is the difference in Rac and Ras signaling, in which Ras signaling, mediated by the Sos1/Grb-2 complex during growth factor stimulation, was short-lived relative to signaling by Rac, which was mediated by Sos1/Abi1/Eps8, under similar conditions of growth factor stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Innocenti2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is quite possible that the transient production of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> may explain the apparent lack of Cdc42 involvement in chlamydial invasion. On the other hand, Rac1 could be activated by two distinct pathways; one of which is independent of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>. This Rac activation pathway would be expected to predominate during conditions of high PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> turnover. The presence of a PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> -independent pathway of Rac1 activation would be expected to confer a wortmannin-insensitive invasion mechanism. Indeed, entry of serovar L2 is insensitive to treatment with 100 nM wortmannin. During inhibition of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> synthesis, the Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 pathway of Rac activation remains functional, with the host cell still supporting chlamydial uptake.</p><p>We observed highly localized and transient bursts of synthesis of PI 3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub> at the sites of chlamydial entry. This implies the recruitment of the regulatory subunit (p85) of PI<sub>3</sub>-kinase and its binding partner, the catalytic (p110) subunit. Indeed, the p85 subunit was found to bind preferentially the pY1 oligopeptide. In conjunction with the observed interaction of Vav2 with the pY2 oligopeptide, these two components may bind independently to two distinct binding sites, but cooperate to activate the Vav2-dependent pathway. That the PI3-kinase p85 subunit displayed the same preferential binding to pY1, as the Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 complex is suggestive of a competition or a hierarchical control that possibly determines which pathway is utilized for chlamydia uptake. The reproducible decrease in invasion efficiency during depletion of the Sos1 protein indicate the preferential utilization of this pathway compared to the Vav2 pathway. In addition, because TARP homologs within the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> species have at least two phosphodomains, it is intriguing to speculate that the domains cooperate with each other to recruit signaling molecules, and bring into proximity components to stabilize the signaling complex and/or transduce the desired signal. However, the presence of multiple potential binding sites adds another level of complexity to this signaling process in the regulation of this signaling pathway.</p><p>Chlamydophila species that possess TARP homologs, but do not contain the repeated phosphodomain clearly demonstrate that alternative mechanisms of actin remodeling and recruitment exist. An attractive scenario is the requirement for an additional bacterial factor that interacts with a conserved region of TARP and substitute for the tyrosine phosphorylation during recruitment of signaling molecules. The enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) EspFu/TccP protein directly binds to the GTPase binding domain of N-WASP to induce pedestal formation independent of Tir tyrosine phosphorylation and Nck recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Campellone1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether a similar mechanism is at work in other species of chlamydia is certainly a topic that warrants further investigations.</p><p>Equally important is how the actin nucleating function of the conserved C-terminal domain of TARP fit with the model that requires signaling to the Arp2/3 complex to activate its actin-nucleating activity. It is unlikely that the Arp2/3-independent actin nucleating activity of the C-terminal domain of TARP is sufficient for chlamydia-induced actin recruitment and invasion. It has been reported that the invasion of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 depends on Arp2/3. A model that we favor is a cooperative one, in which the activation of the Arp2/3 complex by the Rac-dependent signaling pathway initiates actin nucleation forming short actin filaments. These nascent filaments are then bound by the WH2 motifs within the C-terminal domain of TARP, nucleating spontaneous actin polymerization. This model fits a number of critical observations &#x02013; a) <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> invasion is Arp2/3-dependent; b) actin polymerization can be mediated by a minimal TARP domain that contains the WH2 motifs in an Arp2/3-independent manner; and c) the C-terminal domain has a higher affinity for F-actin. How these two mechanisms cooperate is under investigation.</p><p>In summary, this report is the first to directly implicate the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> Type III effector TARP in invasion by identifying the host signaling molecules that link TARP to the actin remodeling machinery. The potential for TARP to be differentially phosphorylated at the two tyrosine residues described in this report and the presence of multiple phosphodomains together imply the presence of a control mechanism that fine tunes the function of TARP in chlamydia invasion. This modulation may be at the level of phosphorylation, binding of the signaling complexes, their respective stability, or the ability of the signaling pathway to cooperate with the nucleating function of the C-terminal domain of TARP. Clearly, many questions still need to be answered to gain a full understanding of the invasion process of this medically important obligate intracellular pathogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Organisms and cell culture</title><p><italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars L2 (LGV-434) were grown in and harvested from HeLa 229 cells as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000014-Caldwell1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.
