These SSIs, induced by AP-endonuclease through DNA strand cleavage of 5&#x02032; apyrimidinic/apurinic sites, have 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl and 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c3">3</xref>). If these SSIs remain unrepaired, they cause cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c4">4</xref>). In mammalian cells, these SSIs are repaired by two subpathways.</p><p>The first pathway is mediated by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) and DNA ligase III (Lig III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c8">8</xref>). This DNA polymerase possesses a deoxyribose lyase activity that removes deoxyribose moieties attached at the 5&#x02032; termini of SSIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c10">10</xref>). The resulting one-nucleotide gap is filled in by Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>) and the DNA strands are then sealed by Lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>). This ligase forms a complex with XRCC-1, a factor that also forms a complex with AP-endonuclease and Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c13">13</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that these enzymes are recruited to DNA damage sites through complex formation with XRCC-1, and that incision of AP sites by AP-endonuclease, DNA polymerization and DNA ligation occur in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c13">13</xref>).</p><p>The second pathway is mediated by DNA polymerase &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; (Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c14">14</xref>). During the repair process, DNA strands must be removed from the 5&#x02032; termini of SSIs, and flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) has been demonstrated to have this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c14">14</xref>). The DNA gaps are then filled in by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;&#x0002c; and the repair is completed by DNA ligase I (Lig I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>). A DNA sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), interacts with FEN-1, Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c17">17</xref>). Thus, the processes of DNA strand cleavage by FEN-1, DNA strand synthesis and DNA ligation probably occur in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>). This second pathway is required for the repair of SSIs that have reduced deoxyriboses attached to the 5&#x02032; terminus, as Pol &#x003b2; cannot efficiently remove the reduced deoxyribose with its lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c14">14</xref>). However, this pathway is also involved in the repair of SSIs that have a normal 5&#x02032; deoxyribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c14">14</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the presence of a third pathway, mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I, has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c18">18</xref>). In fact, in a reconstituted BER assay system, SSIs can be repaired by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Although each pathway probably has a role in response to DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic>, the functional implications of SSI repair by those three distinct pathways are not clearly understood. One functional difference among these repair pathways could be the efficiency of SSI repair. As AP-endonuclease, Pol &#x003b2; and Lig III can be recruited to the damaged sites through complex formation with XRCC-1, the pathway mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig III is proposed to be more efficient than the pathway mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c13">13</xref>). However, cells from a patient with an abnormality in Lig I show an increased sensitivity to alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c21">21</xref>), suggesting that, even though the pathway mediated by Lig III may be more efficient, the repair of SSIs by this pathway only is not sufficient for cell survival.</p><p>As SSIs are common substrates for those three repair pathways, they may be repaired in a competitive or cooperative manner by these pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, most biochemical investigations have focused on each individual pathway, and thus the relative involvement of each pathway in SSI repair is not clearly determined. To obtain a better understanding of SSI repair, we investigated whether these pathways are indeed involved in the repair of SSIs by monitoring the utilization of DNA ligases in cell-free extracts. Here we report that all three pathways are in fact involved in the repair of SSIs to a different degree. Our results suggest that the majority of SSIs produced during the repair of alkylated DNA bases are repaired by Pol &#x003b2; with either Lig I or Lig III, although some SSIs are repaired by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I. At a cellular level, we found that expression of Lig III increased the resistance of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, repair pathways mediated by Lig III may regulate cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant protein preparation</title><p>Human Lig I and Lig III cDNAs, cloned into pET11a (pET11a/L1) and pET16b (pET16b/L3), respectively, were kindly provided by Dr T.

The plasmids containing single-strand DNA breaks were then purified by two cycles of ethidium bromide&#x02013;CsCl density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c27">27</xref>). Under these conditions, the amounts of other oxidized base damage present in these purified plasmids were estimated (using Nth and Fpg proteins) to be 10&#x00025; of SSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c29">29</xref>).

To determine the pathways involved in the repair of SSIs, we first focused on DNA ligases. In the extracts, most of the DNA ligases are present as DNA ligase-AMP intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c26">26</xref>). Thus, the extracts were treated with PPi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>A) to remove the AMP from the DNA ligases and the PPi was then dialyzed out from the extracts. The dialyzed extracts were incubated with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (2 &#x000b5;M) to allow DNA ligases to form intermediates with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP. Because AMP was removed from DNA ligase by PPi, the specific activity of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP is expected to be similar to that of Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP. In crude extracts, 125 and 100 kDa proteins, identified as Lig I and Lig III/DNA ligase IV, are reported to be &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c31">31</xref>). Consistent with the reports and as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>B, lane 1, proteins showing mobilities similar to recombinant Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (125 kDa, lane 5) and recombinant Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (100 kDa, lane 7), respectively, were visualized in HeLa S3 cell extracts. DNA ligase IV, another DNA ligase involved in non-homologous end joining and V(D)J recombination, shows similar mobility to Lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c32">32</xref>). However, in lymphoblastoid cell extracts that contain a lower amount of Lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c7">7</xref>), negligible amounts of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP-labeled 100 kDa protein were found &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>B, lane 2 (GM0631A) and lane 3 (GMO1953C)&#x0005d;, suggesting that DNA ligase IV may not be efficiently adenylated, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c32">32</xref>). In addition, this type of cell-free extract does not support non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c28">28</xref>). Thus, even if DNA ligase IV is &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP labeled, DNA ligase IV is unlikely to have any effect on our analysis. These radiolabeled extracts were then used for cell-free DNA repair assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>A) containing a 1000-fold excess of non-labeled ATP (2 mM) relative to &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (2 &#x000b5;M). Upon DNA break rejoining, AMP is released from DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c26">26</xref>). Thus, if DNA ligases- &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP are used for rejoining DNA breaks during the cell-free DNA repair assay, &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP is expected to be released.

However, the amount of Lig I was not altered (determined by western blotting with anti-Lig I antibody) by incubation (data not shown), suggesting that the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP occurs in a DNA repair-dependent manner.

A similar reduction was observed when recombinant Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP was incubated in the presence of 2 mM ATP, suggesting that this reduction occurs due to the replacement of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP bound to Lig III by AMP during cell-free DNA repair assay. Despite this reduction, the rate of Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP reduction was further increased in the assay with a plasmid containing &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs or MNNG-treated plasmid DNA. This reduction was not due to the degradation of Lig III, as no obvious degradation of Lig III was found by western blotting with anti-Lig III antibody (data not shown), suggesting that Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP is also used in the repair of SSIs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref>A&#x02013;D). To determine the relative involvement of Lig I and Lig III in SSI repair, we calculated the percentage of Lig I and Lig III used for the repair (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref> legend). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref>E, of the total amount of DNA ligases that was used for repair of &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs, Lig I accounts for 71&#x00025;, suggesting that Lig I plays a major role in the repair of &#x003b3;-ray induced SSIs, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c1">1</xref>). In the case of Lig III, a significant involvement was observed when MNNG-treated plasmid DNA was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref>E, &#x0223c;50&#x00025;). Typically, the content of Lig III relative to Lig I is only 30&#x00025;. Despite this fact, Lig III was probably involved in the repair of &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of SSIs produced during BER. Thus, repair mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig III indeed has a higher efficiency of SSI repair, as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c33">33</xref>), than repair mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I. However, these results also suggest that SSIs are still repaired by the repair pathway mediated by Lig I.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of addition of purified DNA ligases on the reduction of DNA ligase-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP</title><p>We determined the DNA ligases involved in the repair of SSIs by addition of purified DNA ligases to the cell-free DNA repair assay with extracts containing DNA ligases- &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP. Cell-free reactions were carried out for 60 min and the amount of Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP was reduced to background levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f3">3</xref>A). Under these conditions, the amount of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP was reduced in a DNA repair-dependent manner as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref>A and B. If the added DNA ligases can compete with Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP, the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP is expected to be inhibited. In fact, 4 U of purified Lig I was sufficient to inhibit the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f3">3</xref>A and B). On the other hand, even 32 U of T4 DNA ligase did not inhibit the reduction. Interestingly, added Lig III did not show any effect on the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP, consistent with our finding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f2">2</xref>A and B) that Lig I plays a major role in the repair of &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs.</p><p>In the case of alkylating base damage induced by MNNG, 4 U of either Lig I or Lig III inhibited the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f3">3</xref>A and C), suggesting that SSIs produced by BER during the repair of alkylated base damage are repaired throught the action of Lig III in addition to Lig I. Furthermore, these results suggest that, for the repair of SSIs, Lig I can be replaced by Lig III.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-free DNA repair assay in the presence of aphidicolin</title><p>Repair mediated by both Pol &#x003b2; and Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; can be terminated by Lig I. Thus, we carried out cell-free repair assays under conditions in which Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;-mediated repair is inhibited by aphidicolin. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>A, aphidicolin inhibited the conversion of open circular plasmid containing &#x003b3;-ray-induced single-strand DNA breaks to the closed circular form, forms that are due to the repair of SSIs. Over 95&#x00025; of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dAMP incorporation into plasmid DNA containing &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs due to DNA repair synthesis was also inhibited by aphidicolin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>B, lane 5 versus 6). In addition, aphidicolin inhibited the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>C). These results suggest that &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs are repaired mainly by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;.</p><p>In contrast to the repair of &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs, aphidicolin had little effect on the incorporation of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dAMP (20&#x00025; reduction) into MNNG-treated plasmid DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>B, lane 2 versus 3), suggesting that 80&#x00025; of the repair is mediated by Pol &#x003b2; and 20&#x00025; by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;. Under assay conditions in which aphidicolin is present, the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP was only slightly affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>D, lane 2 versus 3). Thus, the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP is likely to be due to the repair of SSIs by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I. We then carried out cell-free DNA repair assays with aphidicolin and tested the effect of purified Lig I or Lig III addition. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>D (lanes 4&#x02013;6), the reduction of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP was inhibited by the addition of Lig I. Similarly, addition of Lig III also inhibited the reduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f4">4</xref>D, lanes 7&#x02013;9). Therefore, SSIs produced during the repair of alkylated base damage by BER are repaired mainly by Pol &#x003b2;, and the repair can be terminated by either Lig I or Lig III.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Lig III and cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents</title><p>Our results thus far suggest that both Lig I and Lig III can terminate repair of SSIs mediated by Pol &#x003b2;. In cells, the amount of Lig III relative to Lig I is typically &#x0223c;30&#x00025;, and in lymphoblastoid cells it is &#x0003c;5&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c7">7</xref>). Thus, an altered Lig III content in cells may affect the relative involvement of repair mediated by Lig III in the repair of SSIs. At a biochemical level, however, an increased content in Lig III is unlikely to affect the repair rate, as addition of Lig I or Lig III to a cell-free repair assay did not show any major effect on the rate of DNA break repair &#x0005b;data not shown and Satoh <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d;. However, the cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents is altered by the impairment of one particular pathway for the repair of SSIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c21">21</xref>). Thus, we then investigated the effect of an altered content of Lig III on cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. For this purpose, HeLa S3 cells over-expressing Lig III were exposed to MNNG. After transfection of a Lig III mammalian expression construct, cells expressing Lig III were purified with the pMACSelect K<sup>K</sup>.II system (see Materials and Methods) that allowed a 5-fold concentration of Lig III-expressing cells (20&#x00025; positive cells to 95&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>A). Purified cells were then treated with MNNG to determine the effect of Lig III over-expression on cell survival. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>B (Control), &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of control cells were killed by 7.5 &#x000b5;M MNNG. On the other hand, Lig III-over-expressing cells showed an increased resistance to MNNG, and 20 &#x000b5;M MNNG was required to kill 90&#x00025; of these cells. As a control, Lig I was also over-expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>A) and exposed to MNNG or &#x003b3;-rays. However, Lig I over-expression did not cause any major change in cellular sensitivity to MNNG or &#x003b3;-rays (data not shown). Thus, cells possibly already contain a sufficient amount of endogenous Lig I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>B). These results suggest that expression of Lig III confers cellular resistance to MNNG.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Through biochemical investigations, two SSI repair pathways have been identified and an additional one has been suggested, but the relative involvement of each pathway in SSI repair has not been clearly determined. In this report, we demonstrated that, although some SSIs are repaired by Pol &#x003b2; and Lig I, &#x003b3;-ray-induced SSIs were predominantly repaired by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I. The 3&#x02032;-phosphate or phosphoglycolate groups, produced by &#x003b3;-ray irradiation, must be removed by AP-endonuclease or polynucleotide kinase to repair SSIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c36">36</xref>). Thus, FEN-1 may initiate DNA strand cleavage prior to the initiation of DNA polymerization, favoring a repair mediated by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I. On the other hand, alkylated DNA bases are repaired by Pol &#x003b2; and either Lig I or Lig III. In terms of biochemical activity of DNA repair, however, the lack of one or two pathways does not seem to have a major effect on the rate of SSI repair. Extracts prepared from 46BR cells, impaired in Lig I, can repair uracils at a rate almost identical to extracts from normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c26">26</xref>). Thus, even though repair pathways mediated by Lig I are impaired in 46BR cells, SSI repair can be carried out by a pathway mediated by Lig III. Similarly, the lack of the Pol &#x003b2;-mediated pathway does not have a major effect on the repair of DNA damage, as extracts prepared from Pol &#x003b2; knockout cells show a normal repair rate of oxidized base damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c37">37</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of Lig III is unlikely to have an effect on the rate of SSI repair since extracts from lymphoblastoid cells, containing significantly less Lig III, do not show any impairment of either Pol &#x003b2; or Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; pathways. Addition of Lig I or Lig III to repair assays with lymphoblastoid cell extracts indeed does not alter the rate of DNA repair &#x0005b;data not shown and Satoh <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d;. These observations suggest that one particular pathway can act as a backup pathway for others. Various protein&#x02013;protein interactions, including XRCC-1 with Lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c8">8</xref>), XRCC-1 with Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c8">8</xref>) and PCNA with Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c38">38</xref>), along with repair of SSI by Pol &#x003b2; and FEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c39">39</xref>), may thus facilitate the repair by this backup mechanism. Due to the presence of this mechanism, however, unique experimental settings seem to be required to observe the specific role of DNA polymerases or DNA ligases in SSI repair. For example, Lig I abnormality can only be observed when AP sites, designed not to be repaired by the pathways mediated by Pol &#x003b2;, are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c40">40</xref>). The use of reduced AP sites is required to detect the DNA polymerase switching from Pol &#x003b2; to Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c41">41</xref>). The role of Pol &#x003b2; in oxidative DNA damage repair can be detected when Pol &#x003b2; &#x02013;/&#x02013; cell extracts, in which Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; activity is inhibited, are used, although a lack of Pol &#x003b2; does not have a major effect on cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c42">42</xref>). Nevertheless, if one particular pathway is active enough to repair SSIs even when other pathways are impaired, the repair rate of SSIs may not be affected significantly by these impairments. Therefore, the functional roles of SSI repair by those three pathways must be related to other events, such as cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.</p><p>Regarding cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, we recently reported that long repair-patch synthesis increases risks of double-strand DNA break (DSB) formation. DSBs are the most lethal type of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c44">44</xref>), occurring when two closely spaced damaged sites in DNA are produced on opposite DNA strands. The repair of this damage by BER results in SSI formation. If the distance between two sites of DNA damage is long enough to maintain the DNA duplex (a denaturation temperature &#x0003e;37&#x000b0;C), SSI formation itself cannot cause DSB formation. We demonstrated that initiation of DNA strand cleavage in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction by FEN-1, an enzyme involved in the repair pathway mediated by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5;&#x0002c; results in reduction of the DNA duplex length between these SSIs, and leads to the denaturation of DNA and ultimately to DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c44">44</xref>). Thus, SSI repair by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I (often referred to as long-patch BER) is probably associated with a higher risk of causing DSB formation. In this context, SSI repaired by Pol &#x003b2; has less risk of forming DSBs as this repair is completed by synthesis of short repair patches. Thus, cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents may be controlled or affected by the relative involvement of the pathways mediated by Pol &#x003b4;/&#x003b5; and Lig I or by Pol &#x003b2;.</p><p>Alternatively, Lig III itself may play a role in the regulation of cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, as a recent report demonstrated that stabilization of Lig III results in an increased resistance of cells to apoptotic induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c45">45</xref>) and we found that cells over-expressing Lig III were less sensitive to MNNG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>). Because Lig III forms a complex with XRCC-1, a factor that also interacts with Pol &#x003b2;, AP-endonuclease, polynucleotide kinase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c47">47</xref>), an increased resistance of Lig III-over-expressing or Lig III-stabilized cells to DNA-damaging agents is probably related to complex formation and the interaction of this complex with other enzymes. In particular, the mechanistic link between Lig III&#x02013;XRCC-1 complex formation and an increased resistance of cells by over-expression of Lig III can be explained by the interaction of XRCC-1 with an abundant nuclear enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c48">48</xref>). In response to DNA break formation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 catalyzes a post-translational modification of proteins with ADP-ribose polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c48">48</xref>). However, it has been reported that the interaction of XRCC-1 with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 leads to the inhibition of ADP-ribose polymer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c46">46</xref>). Recently, Yu <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that ADP-ribose polymers play a critical role in the induction of cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c49">49</xref>). One of the factors inducing apoptosis, AIF, is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to activate apoptosis, and this translocation process depends on ADP-ribose polymer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c49">49</xref>). Because the suppression of ADP-ribose polymer formation inhibits AIF-mediated apoptotic induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c49">49</xref>), inhibition of ADP-ribose polymer formation by the Lig III&#x02013;XRCC-1 complex may have a similar effect. Thus, by this mechanism, over-expression or stabilization of Lig III may confer cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents.</p><p>Finally, the cellular content of Lig III relative to Lig I and of Lig III mRNA relative to Lig I mRNA varies significantly among cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c50">50</xref>); for example, in lymphoblastoid cells, only small amounts of Lig III are found compared with HeLa S3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f1">1</xref>). It has been shown that lymphoblastoid cells are relatively sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c52">52</xref>). Lig III mutant cells are also sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c53">53</xref>). On the other hand, over-expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>A) or stabilization of Lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg892c45">45</xref>) increased cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents, while Lig I over-expression did not alter cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg892f5">5</xref>B). Thus, it is plausible that, while repair mediated by Lig I acts as a constitutive repair pathway for SSIs, repair completed by Lig III may play a role in the regulation of cell type-specific sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg892f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Assay design and preparation of cell-free extracts containing DNA ligase-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP.

After the repair reactions, extracts were fractionated on an SDS&#x02013;7.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel, and <sup>32</sup>P activity was visualized by autoradiography. The results shown are from five independent experiments. The standard errors are typically within 5&#x00025;. (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) Quantified data from (A) and (C) are shown in (B) and (D), respectively. The amount of Lig I-&#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP at 0 min was expressed as 100 arbitrary units. (<bold>E</bold>) The percentage of each DNA ligase used was determined using results shown in (B) and (D). Linear regression lines were drawn (gray dotted lines in B and D). Then time points within the linear range were chosen (10 min for SSI-&#x003b3; and 60 min for MNNG). The reduced amounts of Lig I-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP &#x0005b;a&#x0005d; and Lig III-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP &#x0005b;b&#x0005d; were determined based on linear regression lines. Upon determination, non-specific reduction (non-damaged) was subtracted. The sum of &#x0005b;a&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;b&#x0005d; was calculated as 100&#x00025;, and the percentage of Lig I and Lig III used was calculated as follows: &#x00025; of Lig I used &#x0003d; a/(a &#x0002b; b) &#x000d7; 100, and &#x00025; of Lig III used &#x0003d; b/(a &#x0002b; b) &#x000d7; 100.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkg892f2"/></fig><fig id="gkg892f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p> Effect of DNA ligase addition on the DNA ligase-&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP reduction.
