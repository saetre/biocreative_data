The bulk of the lens consists of highly elongated secondary lens fiber cells, which differentiate at the lens equatorial region from an epithelial cell monolayer that covers the lens anterior surface. Throughout this process, fiber cells develop several specializations that help maintain global lens homeostasis and, therefore, transparency. Among the most important specializations are the degradation of cell nuclei and other cell organelles to maintain a path free from light-scattering elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], the acquisition of junctional specializations, which maintain the extracellular space smaller than the wavelength of light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], and the abundant expression of soluble lens crystallin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], which contributes to an increasing gradient of protein concentration and refractive index toward the center of the lens that aids visual acuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>As a consequence of programmed lens cell differentiation, mature fiber cells lack the ability to synthesize new protein. Instead, posttranslational modification of existing proteins has been proposed as a mechanism for functional adaptation to a changing cell environment in differentiated lens fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. A variety of proteins, including connexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], aquaporin-0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], and crystallin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] have now been observed to alter function in differentiated fiber cells in response to common posttranslational modifications such as truncation and phosphorylation. The most abundant lens crystallin protein, &#x003b1;-crystallin, is primarily found as large molecular weight aggregates of two subunits, &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallin. A member of the small heat shock protein family, &#x003b1;-crystallin is a molecular chaperone in the lens, acting to prevent nonspecific aggregation of denatured proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The chaperone activity of &#x003b1;-crystallin is altered by truncation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] and phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Therefore, information on the spatial distribution of &#x003b1;-crystallin and its modified forms is useful in understanding how the normal lens maintains transparency.</p><p>While immunolabeling can be used to investigate such distribution patterns, its ability to simultaneously detect more than three to four specific antibody probes is limited principally due to the small number of discrete recording channels available. Furthermore, the simultaneous detection of multiple truncation products of a single protein using immunolabeling is not possible for the simple reason that any antibody epitope will be present in more than one truncation product of any individual protein. In addition, detection of phosphoproteins using immunolabeling requires prior knowledge of phosphorylated residues in the protein of interest and rigorous validation of their antibody specificity.</p><p>Alternatively, the spatial distribution of unmodified and modified proteins can be investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of microdissected tissue regions. Posttranslational modification of human &#x003b1;A-crystallin was investigated using this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Increased truncation and modification of &#x003b1;A-crystallin correlated with lens fiber cell age and depth within the lens. Spatial resolution in this study was limited to two microdissected regions, although a protocol for human lens microdissection into six distinct regions has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the precise truncation sites and modifications could not be determined, and low molecular weight truncation products of &#x003b1;A-crystallin were not detectable using the electrophoresis method.</p><p>A recent report employed a new technology, MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization) tissue imaging, to simultaneously map the unmodified and numerous modified forms of &#x003b1;-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. In this study, extensive degradation of bovine &#x003b1;A-crystallin and phosphorylation of both &#x003b1;-crystallin subunits was detected. While &#x003b1;-crystallin phosphorylation appeared to be most abundant in the lens middle cortex, the MALDI images were not resolved enough to confirm this. Here, we present an improved tissue preparation method for obtaining high quality MALDI images of the ocular lens. The general applicability of the method is demonstrated in bovine and rabbit lenses where &#x003b1;-crystallin distributions are compared and contrasted. In addition, we use higher spatial resolution MALDI imaging techniques to confirm the presence of abundant phosphorylation of &#x003b1;-crystallin in the lens middle cortex of both bovine and rabbit lenses. This information adds to our growing understanding of protein modification that occurs as a function of lens fiber cell differentiation and age in the normal lens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Acetonitrile, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water, formic acid, and sinapinic acid (SA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Anhydrous ethanol was purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA). ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) -coated conductive glass microscope slides were purchased from Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA). Frozen mature bovine lenses (approximately two years old) were obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). Rabbit eyes (approximately two years old) were obtained fresh from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR).

Lenses were sectioned equatorially at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C into 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m-thick tissue sections using a disposable blade stage-equipped cryostat (Microm HM 550, Walldorf, Germany). To collect frozen sections, a thin, uniform layer of anhydrous ethanol (room temperature, r.t.) was applied to the conductive glass slides (r.t.), and cryosections were thaw mounted by touching the glass slide to the tissue section. After drying, tissue sections were sprayed with several cycles of acetonitrile-water solution (50:50, vol/vol) with a TLC sprayer, resulting in a tightly bound section. After drying, tissue sections were washed successively for 60 s each in 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and xylene to facilitate uniform matrix crystal formation across the entire tissue section.</p></sec><sec><title>Matrix deposition</title><p>A solution of 15&#x000a0;mg/ml SA freshly prepared in acetonitrile-water-formic acid (50:40:10, vol/vol/vol) was sprayed evenly onto the tissue sections using a TLC sprayer. Repeated cycles of matrix solution spraying were applied when tissue sections appeared mostly dry, approximately 45&#x02013;60 s after previous spray application. Typically, a total volume of 15&#x000a0;ml was used to obtain an even coating with good quality test MALDI mass spectra.</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI imaging</title><p>Mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the linear, positive mode at +20 kV accelerating potential on a time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Autoflex III TOF/TOF; Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), which was equipped with a Smartbeam laser capable of operating at a repetition rate of 200 Hz with optimized delayed extraction time. The laser beam size was set to small, estimated to be approximately 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter. Using Bruker Protein Standard 1 (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), a linear, external calibration was applied to the instrument before data collection. Mass spectral data sets were acquired over approximately half of a bovine lens and a whole rabbit lens using flexImaging<sup>TM</sup> software (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in the mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 3,000-30,000 with a raster step size of 100 &#x003bc;m and 250 laser shots per spectrum. After data acquisition, molecular images were reconstituted using flexImaging<sup>TM</sup> software. Each data set consists of approximately 12,000 individual sampling locations, each representing one pixel in the resultant image. Data was normalized to total ion current in each spectrum, and each <italic>m/z</italic> signal plotted &#x000b1;8 mass units. For display purposes, data was interpolated and pixel intensities were re-scaled in flexImaging<sup>TM</sup> to utilize the entire dynamic range.

MALDI imaging mass spectrometry is an ideal tool to study the spatial distribution of posttranslational modifications of the lens protein, &#x003b1;-crystallin. Standard immunohistochemical approaches that are often used to study protein distributions would be challenged by the lack of specific antibodies to phosphorylated forms, the inability to detect specific truncation products, and the large number of individual experiments required to obtain this information. While MALDI imaging mass spectrometry eliminates more complex protein extraction and separation techniques often used in other proteomic studies, tissue preparation is nevertheless crucial to the acquisition of high quality data.</p><p>A new tissue preparation procedure for MALDI imaging of lens &#x003b1;-crystallin has been developed, and its utility has been demonstrated by applying the procedure to study the spatial distribution of bovine and rabbit lens &#x003b1;-crystallin. The detection of similar distributions of truncated &#x003b1;A-crystallin in the bovine lens to previous results validates the current tissue preparation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, due to improved spatial resolution, the predominance of phosphorylated &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallin in the lens middle cortex is confirmed. In comparing the bovine and rabbit lens &#x003b1;-crystallin images, similar spatial distributions of unmodified and modified &#x003b1;-crystallin were observed in both species in general, however, some significant differences were noted. A greater abundance of higher mass/longer &#x003b1;-crystallin truncation products was observed in the rabbit lens. In contrast to &#x003b1;B-crystallin distribution in the bovine lens, intact rabbit lens &#x003b1;B-crystallin was most abundant in the lens middle cortex. These observations highlight differential expression and processing of a highly conserved protein in two different species.</p><p>The current tissue preparation method worked well in both bovine and rabbit lenses; however, higher quality mass spectral data were obtained in the bovine lens especially toward the core region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). While the precise reason for this is not known, the composition of lipids may be a contributing factor. Lipids are generally good target analytes for MALDI analysis since they ionize easily. However, their presence in tissue sections may interfere with matrix/protein co-crystallization, hence compromising protein ionization efficiency in the mass spectrometer. Previously, the composition of lens phospholipids has been shown to differ between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] and in different regions of the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. In addition, while the tissue preparation procedure for MALDI imaging included several washes aimed at tissue dehydration, fixation, and removal of physiological salts and phospholipids, it is possible that not all phospholipids were removed by this procedure, hence contributing to the variability in mass spectral data quality between species. Nevertheless, the current tissue preparation procedure and matrix/solvent system serves as a robust starting point for the application and optimization of MALDI imaging techniques to lenses from different species. The results presented in the current study indicate that tissue preparation methods must be optimized not only for each tissue but also for equivalent tissue in different species.</p><p>Age-dependent truncation of lens &#x003b1;A-crystallin is a well known and well characterized phenomenon. Nonenzymatic cleavage of bovine &#x003b1;A-crystallin has been shown to occur at Asn-101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] while calpain-mediated cleavage at Asp-151, Glu-156, Arg-163, and Ser-168 occurs in the rat lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. The abundance of bovine &#x003b1;A-crystallin 1&#x02013;101, which was highest in the lens outer nucleus, decreased in the central lens nucleus and has not previously been reported. This spatial distribution may represent the further breakdown of &#x003b1;A-crystallin 1&#x02013;101 to lower molecular weight forms of the protein, which were observed in highest abundance in the central lens nucleus. This phenomenon may also be reflected in the spatial distribution patterns of rabbit &#x003b1;A/&#x003b1;B-crystallin 1&#x02013;168 and &#x003b1;A-crystallin 1&#x02013;101, which is also most abundant in the lens outer nucleus. Differences in the truncation products between bovine and rabbit lens &#x003b1;A-crystallin were observed with more abundant higher mass truncation products (&#x003b1;A/&#x003b1;B 1&#x02013;168 and &#x003b1;A 1&#x02013;163) observed in the rabbit lens (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Since &#x003b1;A-crystallin is highly conserved between bovine and rabbit at all detected truncated residues, the observed differences in truncation products are not due to sequence differences. Additionally, these differences are unlikely to be due to differences in lens age since both lenses were approximately two years old. Instead, it is possible that each species exhibits either differential expression or activity of lens enzymes such as calpains, which may contribute to increased formation of higher mass &#x003b1;A-crystallin truncation products observed in the rabbit lens. Despite the observed species differences in &#x003b1;A-crystallin truncation products, COOH-terminal truncation of &#x003b1;A-crystallin is known to decrease its chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], which is thought to promote increased protein aggregation in the center of the lens and the formation of lens opacities. Furthermore, the abundance and diversity of truncated &#x003b1;-crystallin forms must be considered in the context of lens physiology and lens aging. For example, some products may function as mini-chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] while others may be unstable and proaggregatory.</p><p>It is noteworthy that well known lens protein modifications in the nucleus region such as aggregation/insolubilization and protein&#x02013;protein cross-linking would likely reduce the mass spectral signals for &#x003b1;-crystallin subunits. It is possible that based on the analysis of intact &#x003b1;A-crystallin distributions alone, this effect could lead to an overrepresentation of &#x003b1;A-crystallin truncation in the lens nucleus. However, since the decreased signal for intact &#x003b1;A-crystallin in the lens nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) is accompanied by an increase in its truncation products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C-H</xref>) and the intensity of bovine &#x003b1;B-crystallin is similar in the outer cortical and nuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>), this suggests that the disappearance of the &#x003b1;A-crystallin signal in the bovine and rabbit lens nucleus is not substantially affected by aggregation/insolubilization and cross-linking.</p><p>A striking feature of &#x003b1;-crystallin distribution in both species is the zone of &#x003b1;-crystallin phosphorylation in the lens middle cortex. Phosphorylation is a common form of posttranslational modification known to alter the function of proteins. Such a posttranslational modification is particularly significant in the setting of lens fiber cells, which lose the ability to synthesize new protein as they age and must find other ways to modify protein function to adapt to the changing lens fiber cell environment. Both subunits of &#x003b1;-crystallin are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase in bovine lens extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], &#x003b1;A-crystallin at Ser-122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] and &#x003b1;B-crystallin at Ser-19, Ser-45, and Ser-59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Additionally, a lens phosphatase has been shown to dephosphorylate both subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], suggesting that in the lens, &#x003b1;-crystallin phosphorylation may be reversible. This suggestion is consistent with our MALDI imaging results, particularly for bovine &#x003b1;B-crystallin, where rings of unphosphorylated &#x003b1;B-crystallin were observed both in the lens outer cortex and outer nucleus while singly- and doubly-phosphorylated &#x003b1;B-crystallin was most abundant in the lens middle cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E-H</xref>). Interestingly, doubly-phosphorylated &#x003b1;B-crystallin was not detected in the rabbit lens. This contrast between bovine and rabbit lenses is not due to sequence differences as the known phosphorylated residues in bovine &#x003b1;B-crystallin are conserved in the rabbit. Furthermore, since the age of each lens is approximately two years, it is less likely that the observed differences in &#x003b1;B-crystallin phosphorylation are due to age differences. Instead, this difference may be due to differential protein processing between species, which has already been shown through the observation of different degradation products for &#x003b1;-crystallin between the bovine and rabbit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In the lens, phosphorylation of &#x003b1;-crystallin has been associated with numerous biological processes including protein translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] and interaction with cytoskeletal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>], which may be involved in morphological remodeling of differentiating lens fiber cells. In addition, the studies of &#x003b1;B-crystallin phosphorylation mimics indicate that phosphorylation of this subunit alters substrate binding and subsequent molecular chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Therefore, phosphorylation is an important functional regulator of this &#x003b1;-crystallin protein subunit. However, information pertaining to the spatial localization of phosphorylated &#x003b1;-crystallin in the lens has been largely limited to electrophoretic analysis of microdissected lens regions. These studies have indicated that both &#x003b1;-crystallin truncation and other forms of &#x003b1;-crystallin modification increase with increasing cell age and depth in the lens, although the nature of these modifications have been unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In addition, the spatial resolution of these studies is limited by the microdissection technique.</p><p>In summary, a new method has been developed to map the distribution of &#x003b1;-crystallin and its most abundant modified forms in the ocular lens by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry. While this general method worked well in both bovine and rabbit lenses, the present results suggest that species-dependent tissue preparation is required to maximize the information obtained in each MALDI imaging mass spectrometry experiment. Moreover, the current study indicates that consistent with previous reports, &#x003b1;-crystallin modification increases with cell age and depth in the lens. Lastly, based on the MALDI imaging results of lens &#x003b1;-crystallin, the middle cortex is an important region in the lens where a variety of functional changes related to protein phosphorylation and truncation may take place simultaneously. However, the precise nature of those changes, the signals for &#x003b1;-crystallin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (spatial/biochemical), and their effect on global lens function remain unknown and require further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge funding sources, EY13462 and S10 RR22591, and support from the Medical University of South Carolina Mass Spectrometry Facility.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bassnett</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The fate of the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum during lens fiber cell differentiation.</article-title><source>Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci</source><year>1995</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>1793</fpage><lpage>803</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7635654</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bassnett</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Beebe</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Coincident loss of mitochondria and nuclei during lens fiber cell differentiation.</article-title><source>Dev Dyn</source><year>1992</year><volume>194</volume><fpage>85</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1421526</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zampighi</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The specialized junctions of the lens.</article-title><source>Int Rev Cytol</source><year>1992</year><volume>136</volume><fpage>185</fpage><lpage>225</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1506144</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wistow</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Piatigorsky</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lens crystallins: The evolution and expression of proteins for a highly specialized tissue.</article-title><source>Annu Rev Biochem</source><year>1988</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>479</fpage><lpage>504</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3052280</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r5"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fagerholm</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Philipson</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Normal human lens -
