It exhibits a bimodal subcellular distribution, accumulating at actin-based filaments in the cytosol and in the nucleus. In order to analyze the function of CRP2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we disrupted the <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene in mice and analysed the resulting phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A ~17.3 kbp fragment of the murine <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene containing exon 3 through 6 was isolated.

A gene disruption cassette was cloned into exon 4 and a mouse strain lacking functional <italic>Csrp2 </italic>was generated. Mice lacking CRP2 are viable and fertile and have no obvious deficits in reproduction and survival. However, detailed histological and electron microscopic studies reveal that CRP2-deficient mice have subtle alterations in their cardiac ultrastructure. In these mice, the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level. Although the expression of several intercalated disc-associated proteins such as &#x003b2;-catenin, N-RAP and connexin-43 were not affected in these mice, the distribution of respective proteins was changed within heart tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the lack of CRP2 is associated with alterations in cardiomyocyte thickness and hypertrophy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In vertebrates, the cysteine- and glycine-rich proteins (CRPs) encoded by the <italic>Csrp </italic>genes are evolutionarily conserved proteins that define a subset of zinc-binding LIM domain proteins. As structural hallmarks, these proteins exhibit two LIM domains with a characteristic spacing, adjacent glycine-rich repeats, and a potential nuclear localization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Originally, this family of LIM domain proteins included three members (CRP1, CRP2, CRP3/MLP) that were independently isolated in the course of different experimental strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequently, based on structural and sequence similarities, the thymus LIM protein (TLP) was grouped into this subclass of LIM domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The four CRPs possess significant differences in their temporal and spatial patterns of expression raising interesting questions regarding the physiological and biological significance of the CRP multigene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, it is uncertain if these proteins perform unique functions or substitute for each other within a living organism. The cell types and organs that express the different CRPs suggest several hypothetical functions for this group of LIM domain proteins, including possible roles in organization and stabilization of the contractile myofibrillar/cytoskeletal apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], maintenance of cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and in the establishment of fibrogenic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition to this potential functional versatility, there is growing evidence supporting the notion that the two LIM domains of CRPs serve as protein interfaces mediating specific protein-protein interactions thereby arranging two or more protein constituents into nuclear transcription or cytoskeletal complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this regard, the CRP3 protein (also termed MLP for muscle LIM protein) is best characterized. It is a positive regulator of myogenic differentiation that was first identified in a screen for genes that become transcriptionally upregulated as a result of skeletal muscle denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In accordance, the overexpression of MLP in C2 myoblasts potentiates myogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the absence of the <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>gene product causes a phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy underscoring the hypothesis that CRP3/MLP is an essential regulator of cardiac muscle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In line with this hypothesis, the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy in humans is associated with altered <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>mutations were found in families suffering from dilated as well as from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Together, CRP1 and CRP2 were shown to be potent smooth muscle differentiation cofactors triggering the conversion of pluripotent 10T1/2 fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells when overexpressed together with serum response factor (SRF) and GATA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Compatible with this presumed function is the finding that CRP2 is present at highest levels in arterial samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, a recent report demonstrated that CRP2 can effectively switch on smooth muscle gene activity in adult cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] suggesting that CRP2 has essential functions in controlling smooth muscle gene activity.</p><p>Furthermore, during embryogenesis and in adult tissue, <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene expression is also prominently associated with mesenchyme and epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, compared to other CRP family members, CRP2 expression begins early in gestation and has a distinct pattern of tissue distribution during cardiovascular development. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. CRP2 is expressed transiently in early embryonic cardiomyocytes similar to smooth muscle cell markers like &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin, calponin, and SM22&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] but its expression is downregulated in adult cardiomyocytes. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the expression of CRP2 is downregulated with cellular dedifferentiation induced by oncogenic transformation, injury, or wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that the loss of CRP2 did not result in any apparent gross vascular defects or altered expression of smooth muscle cell markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, vascular development, morphology, cell proliferation, endothelial regeneration and the expression of several characteristic smooth muscle specific genes were similar between WT and <italic>Csrp2 </italic>nulls. However, the loss of CRP2 is correlated with increased neointima formation in response to vascular injury. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from mice lacking CRP2 migrated more rapidly in response to PDGF-BB with an increased activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1 suggesting that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>and its protein product CRP2 are functionally linked to cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We here report about the generation and characterization of a similar <italic>Csrp2 </italic>null mouse model. We demonstrate that these deficient mice are viable and fertile, exhibiting a mild cardiac phenotype in which the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level. In line with these findings, the peculiarity of heart architecture reflected by the typical arrangement of intercalated disc-associated proteins (i.e. &#x003b2;-catenin, N-RAP, connexin-43) was altered suggesting that CRP2 is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton in cardiac muscle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chromosomal localization of the murine <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene</title><p>By use of the T31 mouse/hamster radiation hybrid (RH) panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] containing a set of 100 different DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, we localized the murine <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene to Chromosome 10. In this analysis with the highest anchor LOD of 23.2 was assigned to D10Mit150 with a best-fit location between markers D10Mit203 proximal and D10Mit150 central, confirming the gene position that was recently launched by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (NT_09500). Noteworthy, this region is syntenic to human chromosomal region 12q21.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), essentially the region to which the human orthologue was previously assigned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Assignment and map location of murine <italic>Csrp2 </italic>on Chromosome 10</bold>. We typed the 100 cell hybrid DNAs (1&#x02013;100) of the mouse T31 whole-genome-radiation hybrid panel and two sets of independent A23 hamster (H) and 129 mouse (M) controls by PCR to determine the chromosomal map location of <italic>Csrp2</italic>. The mapping results of this analysis were deposited under accession no. MGI: 1202907 at the Jackson Laboratory and the murine <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene localized to chromosome 10.

The enlarged segment of distal Chromosome 10 is shown with respective framework markers listed to the left of the chromosome bar and a selection of mapped genes to the right. The distances between loci are calculated based on only the listed data sets, and unscored radiation hybrid cell line data are inferred where the data on either side of the missing score are in agreement.

The targeting construct was generated by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into the <italic>Stu</italic>I restriction site of exon 4 and contained 1386 bp upstream and 14413 bp downstream sequences (for more details see Method section). After transfection of ES cells with the targeting construct, we tested 142 transformants by Southern blot using an external hybridization probe. Sixteen of these ES clones were found to have incorporated the targeted vector by homologous recombination. Subsequently, ES clones carrying the disrupted <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant recipients. The mouse chimeras were identified by the inspection of the proportion of coat agouti skin color ranging from complete white to near 80% black. Crosses between chimeras and C57BL/6J mice revealed that the ES cell genome was transmitted through the germline, as indicated by the agouti skin color of the offspring. F1 hybrids tested to be heterozygous for the disrupted gene were backcrossed (up to N10) into the C57BL/6J strain background. To generate <italic>Csrp2 </italic>null mice, we interbred heterozygous animals and genotyped litters after weaning at 4 weeks of age using a genotyping PCR strategy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Furthermore, we performed Southern blot hybridization using an external probe to demonstrate that the targeting construct was correctly inserted into the <italic>Csrp2 </italic>locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To demonstrate the absence of specific <italic>Csrp2 </italic>transcripts, we performed Northern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and quantitative PCR (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) revealing that the level of <italic>Csrp2 </italic>mRNA was half that of the wild type in heterozygous <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>null mouse. However, an aberrant RNA species that appeared at very low level was expressed in gene-disrupted mice (cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Sequence analysis of a cDNA generated by reverse transcription of the respective mRNA species revealed that this aberrant message was generated by artificial splicing of exon 3 to the downstream neomycin/exon4 boundary (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1C</xref>). This RNA does not produce any protein product at any size as tested by Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Targeted disruption of the mouse <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>A neomycin resistance cassette (neo) was incorporated into <italic>Csrp2 </italic>(exon 4) as outlined in the Method section.

As a positive control and to demonstrate the specificity of the CRP2 specific antibody, cell extracts taken from COS-7 cells that were transfected with myc-epitope tagged version of murine CRP1, CRP2 and CRP3 were taken. The expression of these proteins was demonstrated by subsequent probing with a myc-epitope specific antibody.

Mating of homozygous males with homozygous females produced viable offspring of normal litter size at normal frequency indicating that CRP2-deficient mice were fertile and pregnancies were carried out to full term. To detect possible structural defects induced by the absence of <italic>Csrp2</italic>, we comparatively examined formalin-fixed tissue sections of adult wt and <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. We found that sections taken from kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, lung, brain, thymus, stomach, or intestine were indistinguishable from those of control mice (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, and not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Detailed analysis of heart architecture</title><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that the absence of another CRP family member (i.e. CRP3/MLP) reproduces the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

To do so, we first tested if CRP2 is expressed in adult cultured cardiomyocytes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). This analysis revealed that, compared to the regular arrangement of &#x003b1;-actinin and F-actin, CRP2 showed a more irregular staining pattern in cultured cardiomyocytes. In the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation, CRP2 was most prominently localized at the intercalated disc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>Mlp</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cardiomyocytes in which the myofibrils are somewhat disorganized, the localization pattern of &#x003b1;-actinin, an integral component of the Z-disc is indistinguishable in wild-type and <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cardiomyocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Furthermore, the intercalated discs were more convoluted in <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse hearts than in hearts of wild type littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) but less pronounced than in the <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>null mice (not shown).

Although less pronounced than in the <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>knock out mice, we found that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>knock outs show also increased signal for the adherens junction protein &#x003b2;-catenin at the intercalated disc, while there is less signal for connexin-43, the component of the gap junctions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Likewise, the slight increase of cardiomyocyte thickness in <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice were detectable confirming the diameter measurements described above. To test if the increased signals determined for N-RAP and &#x003b2;-catenin are due to a higher expression of these proteins or an altered distribution, we performed Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

The sequence of mouse CRP2 displays 99.5%, 97.9%, and 97.4% amino acid identity to human, quail, and chicken CRP2, respectively. Therefore, it is supposed that this LIM domain protein has a critically, evolutionarily conserved role for the development or maintenance of vital processes within organisms. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>expression is detectable in a number of cell types during embryogenesis, including mesenchyme, vascular smooth muscle cells, and epithelial derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It was also demonstrated that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>is expressed in the cardiovascular system at early time points during mouse development indicating an important role in vascular smooth muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Based on the knowledge that CRP2 and other CRPs can bind to zyxin, &#x003b1;-actinin, and &#x003b1;-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that these proteins are bridging molecules that are important for the organization or stabilization of cytoskeletal structures. This is also supported by structural data showing that the two tandemly arranged LIM domains are completely independent folded units that are linked by a highly flexible spacer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, <italic>Csrp2 </italic>was originally identified from normal quail embryo fibroblasts that were screened for genes suppressed in the course of oncogenic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the transcriptional suppression of <italic>Csrp2 </italic>is generally linked to the transformed state of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggesting that CRP2 might have tumor-suppressor activity. In this context it is remarkable that the reintroduction of CRP2 into human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines was sufficient to significantly decrease colony formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, all these findings demonstrate that indeed CRP2 must have specific functions both in development and control of cancer cell growth. Considering the postulated roles and the observed expression pattern of CRP2, the finding that mice lacking a functional <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene exhibit a quite mild phenotype was unexpected but is in agreement with a recent report characterizing a similar <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene disruption in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. No gross morphological or physiological abnormalities were detected, suggesting that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>is dispensable for normal development. This finding is somewhat surprising, since the ablation of the CRP3/MLP or TLP genes is associated with striking morphological and functional alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Possibly, there exists a functional redundancy that is known from other myogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This would give rise to "cryptic robustness" to cells and organs expressing different CRPs. Conversely, a loss of function mutation or an experimental inactivation of a <italic>Csrp </italic>gene would predominantly affect cells or organs exclusively expressing this family member. There are some good arguments supporting this "quantitative model of CRP function". First, different independent studies have shown that CRP3/MLP is exclusively expressed in heart at high level and to a lower extent in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The abundance of <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>transcripts in these organs is several times higher than those of <italic>Csrp1 </italic>and <italic>Csrp2 </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable that the CRP quantities expressed by these genes cannot compensate for CRP3/MLP. Consistent with our hypothesis, it is not surprising that <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>nulls have a strong cardiac phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>mutations are associated with heart failure in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Secondly, TLP is highly expressed in the thymus and accordingly mice deficient for TLP have alterations of normal thymus function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Third, our data presented in this study indicate that the loss of CRP2 has only a mild cardiac phenotype. Compared to the <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>knock out model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the cardiac alterations are much less pronounced. The localisation of CRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and the alterations in tissue distribution of N-RAP and &#x003b2;-catenin found in animals lacking CRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) point to a functionality of CRP2 in the organisation of the intercalated disc. In this regard, CRP2 might cooperate with other CRPs. It is tempting to speculate that during heart development <italic>Csrp3/Mlp </italic>or <italic>Csrp1 </italic>may be in the position to compensate for the loss of CRP2. This principle may also be true for the development of other organs. <italic>Csrp2 </italic>is broadly expressed in mouse embryos and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>Csrp1 </italic>is widely expressed in mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and expression coincides with that of <italic>Csrp2 </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Noteworthy, the <italic>Csrp1 </italic>and <italic>Csrp2 </italic>genes are expressed in early vertebrate embryos and are spatially regulated in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this regard, the recent finding that both, CRP1 and CRP2, are able to convert pluripotent 10T1/2 fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] demonstrates that these CRPs share some functions. Together, these observations are in agreement with the notion that individual CRPs share redundant functions and may explain the mild phenotype of the <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse and the surprising observation that <italic>Csrp2 </italic>thought to be involved in key biological processes could be removed without affecting the organism.</p><p>A recent report has shown that CRP2 physically associates with other cardiovascular lineage regulators, such as serum response factor (SRF) and GATA proteins, thereby synergistically activating the transcription of smooth muscle cell target genes (i.e. smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain, calponin, smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actin, caldesmon, SM22&#x003b1;) with contractile abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the lack of CRP2 cause alterations in expression of respective genes resulting in cardiomyocytes displaying a slight increase in thickness. CRP2 and its close homologue CRP1 are co-expressed during early cardiovascular development and both CRPs share similar functionality in facilitating transcriptional activity of the SRF-GATA-complex, especially of promoters encoding the SMC target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable that CRP1 in the <italic>Csrp2 </italic>nulls can substitute for CRP2 resulting in the observed mild phenotype. Noteworthy, this functional substitution is not overall complete. In preliminary echocardiography using five animals each we found indications that the disruption of the <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene is associated with a lower left ventricular wall thickness and fractional shortening (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) indicating reduced heart function in respective nulls.</p><p>However, the lack of an "obvious <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>phenotype" in an animal kept under laboratory conditions constitutes no compelling argument against a unique and indispensable role of a gene in the normal physiology and the specialized <italic>in vivo </italic>function of CRP2 may become apparent only after appropriate challenges to the mice. In this context, it might be significant that apart from the shared binding affinity of CRP1, CRP2 and CRP3/MLP to zyxin and &#x003b1;-actinin, we and others have isolated proteins specifically interacting with individual CRPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The ability of CRPs to discriminate between different target proteins may the basis for subtle differences in functionality. Such an overlap of functional redundancy with protein specific activities was also demonstrated in the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Comparable to the <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>nulls, the inactivation of <italic>MyoD </italic>leads to up-regulation of the myogenic HLH gene <italic>Myf-5 </italic>and results in normal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is possible that during early development and differentiation of different myogenic lineages, myogenic factors and also CRPs act cooperatively, but exert distinct function at later stages, when the fine-tuning of cellular programs happens.</p><p>The demonstration that the <italic>Csrp2 </italic>gene is silenced during cellular transformation and CRP2 protein induces growth-inhibitory effects when overexpressed in cancer cells points to a critical role in the control of normal cell growth. Future studies will clarify whether mice or cells lacking CRP2 will be more susceptible to tumor promoters or other physiological stress factors. Moreover, the phenotype of mice lacking several members of the CRP family will be highly informative as it directly addresses the question of mutual functional substitution and redundancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the LIM domain protein CRP2 is involved in normal cardiomyocyte development.

Longitudinal cut areas of the left vetricular wall below the aortic valve were analysed for cardiomyocyte diameters using an internal microscopic size standard (mouse erythrocyte, 7 &#x003bc;m) and counting 20 high-power fields (HPF) of three (<italic>Csrp</italic>2<sup>-/-</sup>) or four (WT) animals. In all experiments, homozygous mutant mice were compared to wild-type siblings. Cryosections (10 &#x003bc;m thickness) were prepared from equivalent ventricular regions of age-matched wild-type, <italic>Csrp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>MLP</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice and were immunostained for N-RAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], connexin-43 (Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA), &#x003b2;-catenin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), and sarcomeric &#x003b1;-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and generation of CRP expression plasmids</title><p>Whole-cell extracts from transfected COS-7 cells or kidney lysates were prepared following standard procedures.

Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and unspecific binding sites were blocked in TBST [10 mM Tris/HCl; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20; pH 7.6] containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milkpowder. Primary antibodies employed were directed against the myc-epitope (M5546, Sigma), &#x003b2;-actin (A5441, Sigma) and CRP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. They were diluted in 2.5% (w/v) nonfat milkpowder in TBST and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse- or anti-rabbit-IgG (Santa Cruz) and the Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Bonn, Germany).
