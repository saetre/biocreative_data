Although a number of pattern recognition receptors have been shown to be involved in recognition and phagocytosis of this fungus, the relative role of these receptors has not been formally examined. In this paper, we have investigated the contribution of the mannose receptor, Dectin-1, and complement receptor 3; and we have demonstrated that Dectin-1 is the main non-opsonic receptor involved in fungal uptake. However, both Dectin-1 and complement receptor 3 were found to accumulate at the site of uptake, while mannose receptor accumulated on <italic>C. albicans</italic> phagosomes at later stages. These results suggest a potential role for MR in phagosome sampling; and, accordingly, MR deficiency led to a reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 production in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> uptake. Our data suggest that pattern recognition receptors sample the fungal phagosome in a sequential fashion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Infection by <italic>Candida albicans</italic> has increased as a result of immunosuppression associated with AIDS and organ transplantation. We assessed the role of three pattern recognition receptors, namely Dectin-1 (a beta glucan receptor), the type 3 complement receptor (CR3), and the mannose receptor, in mediating uptake of this fungus. These receptors are known to recognize structures on the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall, but their exact contribution to binding and uptake is still unclear. We show that only Dectin-1 plays a major role in binding and uptake of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Furthermore, we are the first to find that these receptors sample the internalized particle in a sequential manner; intracellular mannose receptor is recruited later and is involved in secretion of immune modulators. These findings provide a better understanding of the innate immune mechanisms involved in protection against this medically important fungal pathogen.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen, mostly confined to the gastrointestinal, genitourinary tracts and the skin.

Immune cells recognize <italic>C. albicans</italic> mainly through motifs on its cell wall which consists of approximately 90&#x00025; carbohydrate, 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; protein and a small proportion of glycolipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000218-Chaffin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of the cell wall carbohydrates are &#x003b2;1,3- and &#x003b2;1,6-linked glucose polymers (&#x003b2;-glucans); it also contains a large amount of mannose polymers (mannans) covalently associated with protein, and a small amount of chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000218-Chaffin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The timing of this association was receptor specific and appeared to reflect the natural compartmentalisation of the receptor itself. These studies provide new insights into the processes by which surface and predominantly intracellular receptors sample the phagosome. Taken altogether this suggests that pattern recognition receptors sample ligands both during phagocytosis and phagosome maturation to tailor a response specific for the internalised particle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse macrophage cultures</title><p>Mice used in this study (6 BALB/c, 35 C57BL/6, 10 C57BL/6.MR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000218-Lee2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, 6 C57BL/6.CD11b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000218-Melo1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref> and 7 129/Sv&#x000d7;C57BL/6 Dectin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and 6 129/Sv&#x000d7;C57BL/6 controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000218-Taylor4">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>) were from the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology (University of Oxford) breeding colonies, sex-matched and between 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of study.

Cells were washed three times prior to incubation with the secondary antibody in the same buffer. After two washes with buffer and two washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass microscopy slides with DakoCytomation Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation). Double staining for CR3 and MR was done in the buffers described above, as follows: 5D3 was added first after which an anti-rat secondary reagent was used. This was followed with biotinylated 5C6 and incubation with Cy3 conjugated streptavidin. FITC-phalloidin (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml in permeabilisation buffer for 1 hour at room temperature.

Vybrant DiI (Invitrogen) and FM4-64FX membrane dye (Invitrogen) were also used according to the manufacturer's protocol, however the quality of staining was not adequate for our experiments. Following staining, preparations were treated as described above for confocal immunofluorescence studies. In brief, cells were cooled and washed, particles added and preparations kept at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 hour to allow binding of the particles. Unbound particles were removed by washing and cells incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for two minutes. Experiments were fixed on ice and stained as described above. The staining buffer for these experiments did not contain saponin, reducing membrane permeabilisation as much as possible to prevent loss of membrane staining.</p><p>For each experiment, 25 representative images were collected on a Radiance 2000 (Biorad) confocal microscope, using a 60&#x000d7; PlanApo oil immersion objective (NA 1.4). The software used for collecting images was Bio-Rad Lasersharp 2000 (v. 5.0). Kalman-filtered images were collected with an optimal iris aperture and the minimum laser power that fitted the whole grey scale. To prevent bleedthrough between channels, sequential series were obtained by alternating the different channels.</p><p>Fluorochrome intensity measurements were obtained for each image using MetaMorph. The mean intensity of each fluorochome was measured at three regions (regions 1&#x02013;3) around the particle and three regions elsewhere on the plasma membrane (regions 4&#x02013;6). The regions were standard 15&#x0002a;15 pixel squares.
