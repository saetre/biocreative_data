The pseudokinase STRAD activates the LKB1 tumour suppressor by forming a heterotrimeric complex with LKB1 and the scaffolding protein MO25. Here, we describe the structure of STRAD&#x003b1; in complex with MO25&#x003b1;. The structure reveals an intricate web of interactions between STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; involving the &#x003b1;C-helix of STRAD&#x003b1;, reminiscent of the mechanism by which CDK2 interacts with cyclin A. Surprisingly, STRAD&#x003b1; binds ATP and displays a closed conformation and an ordered activation loop, typical of active protein kinases. Inactivity is accounted for by nonconservative substitution of almost all essential catalytic residues. We demonstrate that binding of ATP enhances the affinity of STRAD&#x003b1; for MO25&#x003b1;, and conversely, binding of MO25&#x003b1; promotes interaction of STRAD&#x003b1; with ATP. Mutagenesis studies reveal that association of STRAD&#x003b1; with either ATP or MO25&#x003b1; is essential for LKB1 activation. We conclude that ATP and MO25&#x003b1; cooperate to maintain STRAD&#x003b1; in an &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; closed conformation required for LKB1 activation. It has recently been demonstrated that a mutation in human STRAD&#x003b1; that truncates a C-terminal region of the pseudokinase domain leads to the polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy (PMSE) syndrome. We demonstrate this mutation destabilizes STRAD&#x003b1; and prevents association with LKB1. In summary, our findings describe one of the first structures of a genuinely inactive pseudokinase. The ability of STRAD&#x003b1; to activate LKB1 is dependent on a closed &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; conformation, aided by ATP and MO25&#x003b1; binding. Thus, the function of STRAD&#x003b1; is mediated through an active kinase conformation rather than kinase activity. It is possible that other pseudokinases exert their function through nucleotide binding and active conformations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>There are 518 human protein kinases that are responsible for orchestrating the phosphorylation-dependant signal transduction events that regulate almost all cellular processes. Curiously, approximately 10&#x00025; of protein kinases lack one or more catalytic residues, and these kinases have been termed pseudokinases. It has been proposed that some pseudokinases act as scaffolds, bringing together proteins involved in signalling networks. Here, we report the structure of the pseudokinase STRAD&#x003b1; in complex with the adaptor protein MO25&#x003b1;; together these two proteins regulate the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase. Despite lacking several key catalytic residues, STRAD&#x003b1; binds ATP and adopts an active conformation typical of catalytically competent kinases. The affinity of STRAD&#x003b1; for ATP is enhanced by MO25&#x003b1; and vice versa. We go on to demonstrate through mutagenesis studies that binding to both ATP and MO25&#x003b1; is essential for the activation of LKB1. Our data suggest that STRAD&#x003b1; exerts its functions through an active conformation, not through actual catalytic activity, thus raising the possibility that pseudokinases regulate signalling networks by adopting different structural conformations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pseudokinases are classified as protein kinases that lack key catalytic residues within their kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Manning1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

found in active protein kinases, namely a conserved Gly residue in the glycine-rich loop (subdomain-I), the Lys residue of the VAIK motif (subdomain-II), the catalytic Asp residue of the HRD motif (subdomain-VIb), a conserved Asn residue (subdomain-VIb), as well as the entire DFG motif in subdomain-VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Despite missing these key residues, STRAD&#x003b1; adopts a similar overall conformation to that of TAO2 (sharing 25&#x00025; sequence identity and 37&#x00025; sequence similarity), an active protein kinase of known structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Zhou1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> (RMSD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.4 &#x000c5; on 197 C&#x003b1; atoms). Comparison of the STRAD&#x003b1; and TAO2 structures reveals that a number of substitutions of key catalytic residues are found in STRAD&#x003b1;. Met83 replaces one of the conserved Gly residues in the glycine-rich loop, Arg100 substitutes the catalytic Lys residue in the VAIK motif, Ser195 replaces the Asp residue in the HRD motif, His200 substitutes for the conserved Asn in subdomain-VIb, and the entire DFG motif is replaced by GLR (residues 213&#x02013;215).</p><p>In active protein kinases, the DFG motif plays a pivotal role in coordinating two Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions: one that orients the &#x003b3;-phosphate into the position required for phosphoryl transfer and the other that controls ATP conformation by interacting with the &#x003b2;/&#x003b3; phosphates. Consistent with the lack of the DFG motif in STRAD&#x003b1;, no Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions were observed in the STRAD&#x003b1;-ATP complex, despite 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> being present in the crystallization mother liquor. However, despite the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions, the positioning of the &#x003b2;/&#x003b3; phosphates in STRAD&#x003b1; was similar to that of active TAO2 kinase complexed to MgATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The &#x003b2;-phosphate is tethered through interactions with Arg215 from the GLR (DFG) motif, and His200 (subdomain-VIb), basic residues that may substitute for one of the positively charged Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The second Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion and its coordinating residues are also missing; instead, the &#x003b3;-phosphate only interacts with a conserved lysine (Lys197) in the catalytic loop. Thus, STRAD&#x003b1; appears to have evolved a novel, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent mechanism to bind the phosphate groups of ATP. The presence of the two hydrogen bonds between N1 and N6 atoms of the ATP adenine ring and the protein backbone, observed in all active protein kinase structures, further illustrates the conservation of the ATP binding pocket. Thus, the STRAD&#x003b1; structure explains previous observations that STRAD&#x003b1; can bind ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and its similar affinity for ADP and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>STRAD&#x003b1; Adopts an Active Conformation</title><p>Although the activation loop of STRAD&#x003b1; (residues 212&#x02013;245) is not phosphorylated, it is well ordered, a feature normally observed only in structures of activated protein kinases that are phosphorylated on their activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, Asp232 in the activation loop occupies a position similar to the activating phosphorylated residue found in active kinases, e.g., (phospho)Ser181 in TAO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Asp232 appears to play the same structural role as the activating phosphate group, coordinating the conserved arginine from the catalytic HRD motif (Arg194 in the STRAD&#x003b1; HRS motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Further evidence that STRAD&#x003b1; adopts the canonical active conformation stems from the presence of a short antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet between the &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;9 strands, which is a characteristic feature of the active state of kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Nolen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have attempted to detect activity in the presence and absence of MO25&#x003b1; and/or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. We have also generated mutations converting all the missing catalytic residues on the STRAD&#x003b1; pseudokinase discussed above to the equivalent residues found in the active kinase TAO2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, none of these mutants showed autophosphorylation or phosphorylated myelin basic protein in the presence or absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions and/or MO25&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also tested whether STRAD&#x003b1; possessed ATPase activity, employing a highly sensitive ATPase assay kit (Innova Biosciences), but no activity was observed (E. Zeqiraj, unpublished data). Nevertheless, it is impossible to categorically rule out that STRAD&#x003b1; will not, highly specifically, phosphorylate an as-yet unidentified substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of the Biological STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1; Complex</title><p>The asymmetric unit of the STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1; complex crystals contains one molecule of MO25&#x003b1;, with a conformation similar to the previously published MO25&#x003b1;/WEF peptide complex structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (RMSD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.6 &#x000c5; on 292 C&#x003b1; atoms), and one molecule of STRAD&#x003b1;. The position and conformation of the WEF motif is similar to that in the previously described MO25&#x003b1;/WEF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (RMSD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3 &#x000c5; on 35 atoms, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Due to tight crystal contacts (total buried surface on MO25&#x003b1; by STRAD&#x003b1; and its symmetry mates&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2,833 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), it was not immediately apparent which contacts represented biologically relevant interactions and which were crystallographic packing artefacts. Whereas clear electron density is present for the last six amino acids of STRAD&#x003b1; (residues 426&#x02013;431, including the WEF motif that interacts with MO25&#x003b1;, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), residues 402&#x02013;425 of STRAD&#x003b1; were not visible in the electron density maps, and it was thus not possible to directly identify the appropriate symmetry mates of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; that make up the biologically relevant binary complex. Analysis of the crystal contacts between symmetry-related molecules suggested that there were four possible ways in which STRAD&#x003b1; could interact with MO25&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We studied all four possible STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1; complexes and ranked these in terms of total buried surface area, a possible method for distinguishing crystallographic from biological contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Nooren1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Discounting the WEF motif interaction (800 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> buried surface area), identical in all four possible complexes, the buried surface area in each of the possible complexes is 1,550 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 225 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 58 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, and 200 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for complexes A, B, C, and D, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, the distances between the last well-defined residue of the STRAD&#x003b1; C-terminal lobe and the first well-defined residue of the WEF motif at the extreme C-terminus of STRAD&#x003b1; were measured for the four possible complexes. This yielded direct distances of 52, 83, 65, and 55 &#x000c5; for complexes A, B, C, and D, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, it appears that complex A is the most likely biological interaction, since STRAD&#x003b1; binds to the (highly conserved) concave surface of MO25&#x003b1; and has the largest buried surface area, while also possessing the shortest distance from the C-terminal lobe to the WEF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, analysis of the possible complexes with PISA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Krissinel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> yields the highest (1.0) complexation significance score (CSS) for complex A, while predicting that complexes B, C, and D will not be stable in solution.</p><p>The 6-His purification tag that extends from the N-terminus of STRAD&#x003b1; (450 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> buried surface area in complex A) forms additional contacts between MO25&#x003b1; and STRAD&#x003b1;. SPR studies demonstrate that His-tagged STRAD&#x003b1; binds MO25&#x003b1; in vitro with the same affinity as STRAD&#x003b1; lacking the His tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, MO25&#x003b1; residues 2&#x02013;5 (Pro-Phe-Pro-Phe, termed the PFPF motif here) make hydrophobic contacts in a pocket adjacent to the STRAD&#x003b1; ATP binding pocket on a symmetry-related copy of STRAD&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). This is unlikely to constitute a physiological STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1; interaction, as deleting this motif did not impair the in vivo interaction of MO25&#x003b1; with either STRAD&#x003b1; alone or a complex of STRAD&#x003b1; and LKB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). Moreover, we were unable to affinity purify overexpressed STRAD&#x003b1; or LKB1 from a cell extract employing a PFPF motif containing biotinylated peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). A complex of LKB1/STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1;(&#x00394;PFPF) still activated the heterotrimeric AMPK complex expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with similar efficiency as wild-type LKB1/STRAD&#x003b1;/MO25&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that the PFPF docking site on STRAD&#x003b1; does play a role in enabling STRAD&#x003b1; to interact with other regulators or substrates of the LKB1 complex. Intriguingly, a similar crystallographic interaction can be observed in the structure of the mammalian AMPK heterotrimeric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Xiao1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case, a similar hydrophobic N-terminal motif &#x0201c;MYAF&#x0201d; from the &#x003b2;2 domain interacts with the kinase domain from the neighbouring molecule in the crystal lattice, albeit not near the phospho-nucleotide binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>STRAD&#x003b1; Interacts with the MO25&#x003b1; Concave Surface</title><p>MO25&#x003b1; is composed of seven structurally similar &#x003b1;-helical repeats (named R0&#x02013;R6) that form a horseshoe-shaped molecule with a concave and a convex surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

This closed conformation is stabilized through binding of ATP and/or MO25&#x003b1;. Moreover, binding of MO25&#x003b1; to STRAD&#x003b1; markedly enhances affinity for ATP, and binding of ATP to STRAD&#x003b1; stimulates interaction with MO25&#x003b1;. Our findings support a model in which binding of either MO25&#x003b1; or ATP is sufficient to enable STRAD&#x003b1; to activate LKB1. Consistent with this, mutant forms of STRAD&#x003b1; that are incapable of binding both ATP and MO25&#x003b1; can no longer activate LKB1, whereas mutant forms of STRAD&#x003b1; that retain the ability to bind either ATP or MO25&#x003b1; still activate LKB1.
