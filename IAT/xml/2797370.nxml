AM404 is a derivative of arachidonic acid and has been reported to inhibit arachidonate oxygenation by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 and -2 (PGHS-1 and -2, respectively). While examining the structural requirements for inhibition of PGHS, we discovered that the <italic>meta</italic> isomer of AM404, <italic>N</italic>-(3-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonoylamide (3-HPAA), is a substrate for purified PGHS. PGHS-2 efficiently oxygenated 3-HPAA to prostaglandin and hydroxyeicosatetraenoate products. No oxidation of the phenolamide moiety was observed. 3-HPAA appeared to be converted by PGHS-1 in a similar manner; however, conversion was less efficient than that by PGHS-2. PGHS-2 was selectively, dose-dependently, and irreversibly inactivated in the presence of 3-HPAA. Complete inactivation of PGHS-2 was achieved with 10 &#x003bc;M 3-HPAA. Preliminary characterization revealed that 3-HPAA inactivation did not result from covalent modification of PGHS-2 or damage to the heme moiety. These studies provide additional insight into the structural requirements for substrate metabolism and inactivation of PGHS and report the first metabolism-dependent, selective inactivator of PGHS-2.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi901181z</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-01181z</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Research Grant CA89450 (L.J.M.) and a training grant to M.V.T.

Prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> (PGH<sub>2</sub>) is an end product of the PGHS reaction and serves as the precursor for prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane, which mediate processes such as inflammation, platelet aggregation, and cell proliferation, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). PGHS catalyzes the removal of a bis-allylic hydrogen from arachidonate, which allows sequential incorporation of two molecules of oxygen into the fatty acid substrate to yield the hydroperoxyendoperoxide, prostaglandin G<sub>2</sub> (PGG<sub>2</sub>) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The hydroperoxide of PGG<sub>2</sub> is subsequently reduced at a separate peroxidase active site of the protein to yield the hydroxyendoperoxide, PGH<sub>2</sub>.

This conformation is required to yield the appropriate product stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Fatty acids utilize ionic and/or hydrogen bonding to active site residues Arg-120 and Tyr-355 to stabilize binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Arg-120 is required for high-affinity binding to PGHS-1 but not PGHS-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In PGHS-2, the presence of valine at positions 434 and 523, which are both occupied by isoleucine in PGHS-1, increases the active site volume and allows ligands access to an additional hydrophilic interaction at Arg-513 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). These key structural differences allow PGHS-2 to metabolize a wider range of substrates than PGHS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). PGHS-2-selective substrates include the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol and arachidonoylethanolamide, as well as arachidonoylamides of amino acids (glycine, alanine, and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid).

It was first described as an inhibitor of cellular endocannabinoid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) and has been used as an alternative to cannabinoid receptor agonists in animal studies of the physiology of endocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). However, AM404 acts at multiple targets. It inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), the key enzyme regulating arachidonoylethanolamide levels, activates transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>), and inhibits both isoforms of PGHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). In an effort to understand determinants of binding and metabolism of arachidonoylamides, we synthesized a small series of substituted phenylarachidonoylamides. This led to the discovery that the <italic>meta</italic> isomer of AM404, <italic>N</italic>-(3-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonoylamide (3-HPAA), is oxygenated by PGHS and leads to enzyme inactivation.

The higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for 3-HPAA accounts for differences in the catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) for 3-HPAA and arachidonate. The efficiency of 3-HPAA oxygenation by PGHS-2 is somewhat surprising, as <italic>N</italic>-arachidonoyldopamine and its <italic>O</italic>-desmethyl analogue are poor substrates for this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). PGHS-2 produces phenolamide derivatives of prostaglandins and HETEs from 3-HPAA. The same classes of products are observed for arachidonic acid and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, suggesting 3-HPAA adopts a conformation similar to that of other arachidonoyl derivatives. Although PGHS-1 oxidizes 3-HPAA much less efficiently than PGHS-2, PGHS-1 seems to produce a similar product profile.</p><p>Following metabolism of 3-HPAA, oxygenase activity is reduced in both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. PGHS-1 activity is reduced by only 30% at 25 &#x003bc;M 3-HPAA, whereas PGHS-2 is completely and irreversibly inactivated. Metabolism of 3-HPAA does not seem to result in covalent modification, oxidation, or cross-linking of the heme moiety. In addition, covalent modification of PGHS-2 protein was not detectable. This behavior is quite similar to substrate-dependent autoinactivation of PGHS, which is observed with arachidonate and other substrates. The mechanism of PGHS autoinactivation remains elusive. As with 3-HPAA, inactivation during arachidonate turnover is not associated with heme inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Covalent modification of PGHS has been observed following metabolism of arachidonate, but this occurs on a time scale slower than that of autoinactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). A favored model of autoinactivation suggests that a critical residue such as the catalytic tyrosine, Tyr-385, is damaged during the course of catalysis. Oxidative damage to PGHS may provide a mechanism for inactivation of PGHS by 3-HPAA as well. Oxidation of side chains has not previously been reported for PGHS, although this may be due to inadequate technology for assessing such modifications, which would produce a mass shift of only 1, 2, or 16 mass units.</p><p><italic>N</italic>-(Hydroxyphenyl)arachidonoylamides provide a unique series for elucidating determinants of binding of ligands to PGHS. A definitive switch from inhibitor to substrate is noted by moving the hydroxyl group from the <italic>para</italic> to the <italic>meta</italic> position on the phenyl ring. This suggests that 3-HPAA adopts a distinct conformation that permits it to be oxygenated by PGHS. Future structural studies of the <italic>para</italic> and <italic>meta</italic> isomers bound to PGHS could provide unique insights into the structural determinants of ligand binding and metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Molecular graphics were produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by National Institutes of Health Grant P41 RR-01081) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).
