Some of these, called effectors, are injected into the host cell by two specialized protein translocation machineries &#x02013; type three secretion systems (T3SS). The T3SS encoded within <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) is produced by extracellular bacteria and delivers effectors across the host cell plasma membrane; these are necessary for bacterial internalization and the early stages of <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zhou and Galan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2006</xref>). The SPI-2-encoded T3SS is activated by internalized <italic>Salmonella</italic> and translocates effectors across the vacuolar membrane. These support bacterial replication in epithelial cells and macrophages, interfere with MHC class II presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and also induce macrophage motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Worley <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rytkonen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Together, SPI-2 T3SS effectors are required for systemic virulence in the murine model of salmonellosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Shea <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Waterman and Holden, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Some <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars carry plasmids which share a highly conserved locus called the <italic>spv</italic> (<italic>salmonella plasmid virulence</italic>) operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boyd and Hartl, 1998</xref>). This operon is primarily responsible for the virulence phenotype associated with these plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gulig <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gulig and Doyle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chu and Chiu, 2006</xref>). It has been suggested that <italic>spv</italic> genes are important for pathogenesis in humans as <italic>spv</italic>-carrying strains dominate among clinical isolates from patients with non-typhoidal bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Montenegro <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fierer <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). <italic>spv</italic> genes are also necessary for full virulence of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in mouse models of systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gulig and Doyle, 1993</xref>), but their functions are poorly understood. The operon consists of five genes, named <italic>spvR</italic>, <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Krause <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). The expression of <italic>spv</italic> genes is strongly induced in intracellular bacteria in tissue culture, in animal infection models and in media mimicking the ion composition and low pH within the SCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Wilson and Gulig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Ygberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The expression of the operon depends on <italic>spvR,</italic> which encodes a positive transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Krause <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Grob and Guiney, 1996</xref>). <italic>spvA</italic> seems to be dispensable for virulence and its function is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Roudier <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Wilson and Gulig, 1998</xref>). <italic>spvB</italic> encodes an actin-ribosyltransferase, which upon delivery to host cells modifies actin and blocks its polymerization into F-actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Otto <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lesnick <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Tezcan-Merdol <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). During infections of macrophages <italic>in vitro,</italic> the loss of actin cytoskeleton results in a form of delayed cytotoxicity, manifested by cell detachment and apoptosis of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Libby <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The function of <italic>spvD</italic> is unknown but it contributes to virulence of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Matsui <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p>SpvC shares 63% identity at the amino acid level with OspF of <italic>Shigella flexneri.</italic> Two recent reports demonstrated that OspF can remove phosphate groups from host cell mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) thereby inactivating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). OspF interference with MAPK-pathways blocks the activation of a subset of NF-kB-regulated genes resulting in impaired chemokine signalling and compromised recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). OspF removes phosphate groups of Erk and p38 MAPKs by either phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) or phosphothreonine lyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) activity. Experiments with recombinant SpvC and cells producing SpvC following transfection suggested that it is also capable of inactivating MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have investigated the function of SpvC in more detail. We show that SpvC is important for <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence in mice and that it can be secreted by either the SPI-1 or SPI-2 T3SS. Translocation of SpvC into the cytosol of macrophages is shown to be dependent on the SPI-2 T3SS.

To investigate the possibility that SpvC is a secreted effector we used homologous recombination to introduce a double haemagglutinin (2HA) tag at the C-terminus of SpvC on the <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Uzzau <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Then we checked production of SpvC-2HA by <italic>Salmonella</italic> grown in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) or MgM-MES media. SpvC-2HA could only be detected at a very low level in the stationary growth phase in LB medium, but a strong induction was observed during exponential growth phase in MgM-MES (data not shown). Production of SpvC-2HA in MgM-MES medium (which mimics the luminal environment of the SCV and which induces expression of SPI-2 T3SS genes) raised the possibility that SpvC might be translocated by the SPI-2 T3SS. <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains carrying mutations in SPI-1 or SPI-2 genes and expressing SpvC-2HA from the virulence plasmid were grown in MgM-MES medium. Immunoblotting was used to detect HA-tagged protein in bacterial lysates and on the plastic surface of the culture vessels, which adsorbs secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Daefler, 1999</xref>). Similar amounts of SpvC-2HA were present in lysates from wild-type bacteria and strains carrying mutations in <italic>prgH</italic> and <italic>ssaV</italic> (which inactivate the SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). SpvC-2HA was also present on the plastic surface of the tubes in which wild-type and <italic>prgH</italic> mutant bacteria were cultured, but it was absent from the surface of the tube containing the <italic>ssaV</italic> mutant strain, indicating that SpvC is secreted in a SPI-2 T3SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). To test the activity of the SPI-2 T3SS in the strains used, we examined the secretion of SseB, a component of the SPI-2 T3SS translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beuzon <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). As expected, SseB was detected in secreted fractions from wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>prgH</italic> mutant bacteria but not from the <italic>ssaV</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). When SpvC-2HA was overproduced from the constitutive <italic>tet</italic> promoter of pACYC184 (p<italic>spvC</italic>), a SPI-1 T3SS-dependent secretion was detected in SPI-1-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> secretion of SpvC-2HA.

However, after infection of macrophages with the strain harbouring p<italic>spvC</italic> it was possible to detect translocated SpvC-2HA 16 h post challenge. The amounts of detectable SpvC-2HA increased when infected cells were incubated for 2 h prior to fixation with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the majority of examined cells, translocated SpvC-2HA appeared to be distributed evenly in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that relatively small amounts of SpvC are translocated into the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it is prone to degradation. No colocalization with the SCV membrane or accumulation in the nucleus was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>).

After 96 h of infection mice were sacrificed and bacteria were recovered from spleens and plated on LB and LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin to discriminate the strains. The competitive index (CI) of &#x00394;<italic>spvC</italic> strain was 0.51 (SD &#x000b1; 0.069) indicating an attenuation in virulence.

Next, we quantified the attenuation caused by the &#x00394;<italic>spvC</italic> mutation in strains carrying mutations in essential genes for either the SPI-1 (<italic>prgH</italic>) or SPI-2 (<italic>ssaV</italic>) T3SS. Mixed infections with <italic>prgH</italic>&#x00394;<italic>spvC</italic> and <italic>prgH</italic> mutants showed that the lack of <italic>spvC</italic> has an additive effect on the attenuation of <italic>prgH</italic> mutant, indicating that functions of <italic>prgH</italic> and <italic>spvC</italic> are unrelated.

This antibody does not recognize unphosphorylated Erk or Erk phosphorylated on either threonine or tyrosine. Therefore, to establish if SpvC is a dual specificity enzyme or if it acts only on phospho-threonine or phospho-tyrosine residues, we probed MKP1- or SpvC-treated pErk with antibodies recognizing only phospho-threonine or only phospho-tyrosine residues.

By contrast, SpvC-treated pErk was negative for phospho-threonine labelling but remained positive for phospho-tyrosine labelling. Furthermore, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody gave a stronger signal from the SpvC-treated pErk sample than from untreated pErk, suggesting that the presence of phosphate group on the threonine residue adjacent to the phospho-tyrosine might reduce binding of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to double phosphorylated Erk.

The tryptic peptide VADPDHDHTGFLTEYVATR with a single phosphorylation site and a dehydrothreonine residue, which would be produced from the p-Erk2 by SpvC acting as lyase, has an expected [M + H]<sup>+</sup> monoisotopic mass of 2206. An ion with this mass was observed in the MALDI-TOF spectrum of the tryptic digest of SpvC-treated p-Erk2 (data not shown), but its intensity was not sufficient for selection as a precursor ion for MS/MS.

The CID-MS/MS spectrum of the triply charged ion at <italic>m/z</italic> 736 contains product ions that are consistent with the sequence VADPDHDHTGFLT<sup>&#x00394;</sup>EpYVATR, where T<sup>&#x00394;</sup> indicates dehydrothreonine and pY indicates phosphotyrosine in the sequence.

The best characterized Spv protein is SpvB (which is encoded immediately upstream of <italic>spvC</italic> in the operon). SpvB ADP-ribosylates actin and is associated with cytotoxic activity in infected host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Otto <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Tezcan-Merdol <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Browne <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). SpvB must therefore be translocated into host cells from extracellular or intracellular bacteria. Its cytopathic effects seem to be dependent on a functional SPI-2 T3SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Browne <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), but paradoxically its secretion into the culture medium <italic>in vitro</italic> was reported to be independent of either the SPI-1 or SPI-2 T3SSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gotoh <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Until recently little has been known about the function of SpvC, apart from its requirement for virulence in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Matsui <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Using an epitope-tagged version produced from its own promoter in the virulence plasmid, we have shown here that SpvC can be secreted into the culture medium in either a SPI-1- or SPI-2-dependent manner, according to which secretion system is activated by bacterial growth conditions. However, we were unable to detect translocation of the protein by immunofluorescence microscopy following its normal production in infected cells. Only when SpvC was produced from a multicopy plasmid in infected cells that had been treated with a proteasome inhibitor could its SPI-2 T3SS-dependent translocation be detected clearly.</p><p>Although SpvC was not observed in infected macrophages following expression from its own promoter, phospho-Erk was detected in the cytoplasm of cells infected with either the <italic>spvC</italic> and SPI-2 T3SS null mutant, but not in cells infected with the wild-type or <italic>spvC</italic>-complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). As SpvC removes phosphate groups from Erk, this provides strong indirect evidence for SPI-2-dependent translocation of SpvC by wild-type bacteria. Furthermore, virulence tests with single and double mutants demonstrated that the attenuation caused by mutation of <italic>spvC</italic> is SPI-2-dependent, indicating that SpvC uses this secretion system <italic>in vivo</italic>. This contrasts with the results of an earlier study in which a polar <italic>spvA</italic> mutation had an additive effect on virulence attenuation of a SPI-2 null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Shea <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). It is possible that other protein(s) encoded by the operon might be functionally independent of the SPI-2 T3SS, but further work on secretion and translocation of the Spv proteins is necessary to clarify this issue. Taken together, the results of this study provide strong evidence that during intracellular growth of bacteria, SpvC is translocated into the cytosol of macrophages in relatively small amounts through the SPI-2 T3SS. Whether or not it is also translocated along with SPI-1 T3SS effectors during invasion of epithelial cells remains to be determined.</p><p>There are approximately 31 genes in SPI-2 that encode the secretion apparatus, translocon, chaperones and at least two effectors. These, together with genes for several other effectors located outside SPI-2, are strongly induced following uptake of bacteria by host cells and require the SPI-2-encoded SsrA-B two-component system for their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cirillo <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). The <italic>spv</italic> operon is known to be induced during intracellular growth in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Rhen <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Eriksson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), but to our knowledge there is no evidence indicating that its expression is dependent on the SsrA-B two-component system. Indeed, we found that RNA levels for <italic>spvA, B, C and D</italic> were similar in wild-type and <italic>ssrA</italic> mutant bacteria that had been grown in conditions that result in strong expression of the SsrA-SsrB regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rytkonen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; P. Mazurkiewicz and D.W. Holden, unpubl. results). SlrP and SspH 1 are two other effectors that can be translocated by either the SPI-1 or SPI-2 T3SSs, and neither seems to be regulated by SsrA-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miao and Miller, 2000</xref>). Therefore, the repertoire of SPI-2 T3SS effectors is not restricted to the SsrA-B regulon, and the total number of SPI-2 effectors could be significantly larger than previously anticipated.</p><p>A purified GST&#x02013;SpvC fusion protein removed phosphate groups from phospho-Erk and phospho-JNK <italic>in vitro</italic>, and its insensitivity to vanadate suggested that it is not a typical tyrosine phosphatase. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of both full-length Erk and a synthetic phosphopeptide established that it acts as a phosphothreonine lysase, as has been shown for OspF of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). A potential catalytic mechanism has been proposed recently, based on an analysis of the crystal structure of SpvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This form of phosphate removal appears to be irreversible, which might help to explain why we could detect the effects of SpvC activity on levels of phospho-Erk in infected cells, but not the bacterial effector itself.</p><p>The action of OspF on MAP kinases inhibits immune responses by impairing the formation of histone H3-phosphorylated and NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This is associated with a pronounced decrease in IL-8 production by infected cells and reduced recruitment of polymorphonuclear leucocytes to infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It would appear that SpvC performs a similar function in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. However, while SpvC is clearly a phosphothreonine lyase, it is possible that its substrate specificity and/or overall physiological effects are different to OspF. The proteins share 63% amino acid identity, and this could allow differential specificity towards MAP kinases. In support of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbibe <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> reported that OspF is active towards Erk and p38, but not JNK, while SpvC acts on Erk, p38 and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; and this work). A second possible means by which the proteins could exert different activities results from the spatio-temporal context in which they are produced: OspF is injected by extracellular bacteria shortly after bacterial contact with host cells and localizes to the nucleus, while SpvC is translocated into the host cytoplasm relatively late in the infective process from intracellular bacteria. Furthermore, whereas OspF accounted for strong suppression of IL-8 transcription and secretion between 2 and 5 h following bacterial invasion of Caco-2 cells, we did not observe a significant difference between the wild-type or <italic>spvC</italic> mutant strains in the levels of IL-8 produced from HeLa cells, TNF-&#x003b1; released from mouse macrophages (despite the clear difference in levels of phospho-Erk in infected cells) or six cytokines that were tested in sera from infected mice. Nevertheless, it seems likely that SpvC does inhibit proinflammatory responses, because the complemented mutant overexpressing SpvC caused a strong reduction of IL-8 and TNF-&#x003b1; production in tissue cultured cells. It is possible that the effects of SpvC produced by wild-type bacteria are masked by other immune-modulating bacterial molecules present in the infection assays. <italic>In vivo</italic>, SpvC could help suppress localized proinflammatory responses at infection foci in the spleen and liver, and thereby facilitate bacterial growth. This would be consistent with our finding that the <italic>spvC</italic> mutant does not have a replication defect in tissue cultured macrophages, but is attenuated in the mouse model of systemic infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

Supernatants were transferred into clean tubes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the assay was performed. Purified LPS (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 1 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was used as a positive control stimulus for TNF-&#x003b1; production by J774 macrophages. TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 levels were measured using sandwich ELISA according to manufacturer's recommendations (Diaclone, Stamford, CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cytokines in mouse sera</title><p>Blood samples were collected at various time points after bacterial challenge from intraperitoneally infected mice. Animals were sacrificed and spleens were isolated for enumeration of bacteria. Blood was allowed to clot for 4 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The clot was separated by centrifugation and sera were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until used for measurements. BD&#x02122; Cytometric Bead Array (BD&#x02122; CBA, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) specific for IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, MCP-1, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; was used to test the sera.

Overnight cultures were subcultured 1:33 into a tube containing 5 ml of fresh growth medium, and bacteria were allowed to grow for a further 6 h. To ensure that protein from equal numbers of cells was analysed, in all experiments protein samples were adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> values such that a volume corresponding to 1 ml of a culture of OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5 was taken up in 100 &#x003bc;l of protein-denaturing buffer for gel electrophoresis. The secreted and total bacterial fractions were prepared as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Plasmids for production of GST and GST fusion SpvC (GST&#x02013;SpvC) were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> TOP10 cells. Proteins were induced by using IPTG (0.5 mM), and cells were lysed using a French press. Samples were centrifuged at 38 000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min, and supernatants were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) and eluted in the same buffer containing 10 mM glutathione. Samples were dialysed against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl. To dialysed samples, 20% glycerol was added and aliquots were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. For purification of six histidine-tagged SpvC, pET22b<italic>spvC</italic>-His was introduced to <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21. Proteins were induced by using IPTG (0.5 mM), and cells were lysed using a French press. Samples were centrifuged at 38 000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min, and supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen). The beads were washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) and SpvC-His was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0). Samples were dialysed in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad RC-DC assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was confirmed through analysis of samples by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dephosphorylation assay</title><p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> dephosphorylation reactions 100 ng of GST-pErk2 (pErk) (14&#x02013;173, Upstate) was incubated with 30 U (1 &#x003bc;g) of MAP-kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) 14&#x02013;391, Upstate, 400 ng of GST&#x02013;SpvC, 400 ng of GST or left untreated as a positive control for Erk phosphorylation in 100 mM TRIS-Cl pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl (DB buffer) for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C. The reactions were stopped by boiling samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For orthovanadate inhibition, an appropriate amount of activated Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> was added to the DB buffer. The phosphorylation state of Erk was assessed by Western blot analysis. For mass spectrometry pErk or pErk-derived phosphopeptide (1 &#x003bc;g) were incubated with 400 ng of SpvC-His for 1 h at 30&#x000b0;C in DB buffer. The mixture of pErk and SpvC was separated on a precast Bio-Rad Tris-Glycine acrylamide gel and the band corresponding to pErk was then excised and used for in-gel tryptic digestion. The pErk-derived peptide was used directly for mass spectrometry analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>In-gel tryptic digestion</title><p>In-gel tryptic digestion of SDS-PAGE bands was performed after reduction with DTT and S-carbamidomethylation with iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were washed three times with 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and dried in a vacuum concentrator for 30 min. Sequencing-grade, modified porcine trypsin (Promega) was dissolved in the 50 mM acetic acid supplied by the manufacturer, and then diluted fivefold by adding 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to give a final trypsin concentration of 0.02 &#x003bc;g &#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Gel pieces were rehydrated by adding 10 &#x003bc;l of trypsin solution, and after 30 min enough trypsin solution was added to cover the gel pieces. Digests were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry</title><p>A 0.5 &#x003bc;l aliquot of peptide or tryptic digest was applied directly to a MALDI target plate, followed immediately by an equal volume of a freshly prepared 5 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> solution of &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma, Poole, UK) in 50% aqueous (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA (v/v). Positive ion mass spectra were obtained using an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in reflectron mode. MS spectra were acquired with a total of 1000 laser pulses over a mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 800&#x02013;4000 with a focus mass of <italic>m/z</italic> 1500. CID-MS/MS spectra were acquired using a collision energy of 1 kV with air as the gas at a Source 2 pressure of about 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> torr. The precursor mass window was set to a relative resolution of 50, and the metastable suppressor was enabled. MS/MS spectra were baseline-subtracted (peak width 50) and smoothed (Savitsky-Golay with three points across a peak and polynomial order 4) Peak detection used a minimum S/N of 5, local noise window of 50 <italic>m/z</italic>, and minimum peak width of 2.9 bins.</p></sec><sec><title>LC-electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry</title><p>Peptide separations were achieved using a 5 cm polystyrene-divinlybenzene (PS-DVB) monolithic column (100 &#x003bc;m inside diameter) and UltiMate capillary HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with the column at 60&#x000b0;C. Samples (3 &#x003bc;l) were injected directly onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid from 2 to 50% in 10 min at a flow rate of 1.1 &#x003bc;l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Peptides eluting from the column were analysed using a QSTAR Pulsar i hybrid mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with Analyst QS software and fitted with a modified MicroIonSpray source. The mass spectrometer was operated in information-dependent acquisition mode with an MS survey scan of 1 s and two 0.5 s MS/MS spectra acquired per experiment. Precursor masses were excluded for 120 s after selection, and the collision offset was selected automatically.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the MRC and Wellcome Trust (UK) to D.H.
