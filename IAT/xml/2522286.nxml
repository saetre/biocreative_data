However, the cause of sporadic AD is less well defined. The major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the presence of the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Corder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Polymorphisms in the LRP and SorLA/LR11 genes have also been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Kang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Rogaeva1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mature LRP is composed of two subunits, 515 kDa (&#x003b1;-chain) and 85 kDa (&#x003b2;-chain), which are produced by proteolytic cleavage from a single polypeptide precursor of 600 kDa in the trans-Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Herz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Maturation of LRP to the trans-Golgi network is partially dependent upon the presence of LRP-receptor-associated protein (RAP), which binds to LRP at multiple sites to block the receptor's ability to interact with its ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Bu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Premature binding of LRP ligands to the receptor interferes with maturation of LRP, and similar receptors, and with translocation to the plasma membrane (reviewed by Willnow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Willnow2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>LRP is a potentially important etiological agent for AD because three proteins clearly involved in AD - APP, APOE, and &#x003b1;2-macroglobulin (&#x003b1;2M), are ligands of LRP &#x0005b;for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, each of these proteins plays significant roles in the production and metabolism of A&#x003b2; peptide, the principal component of amyloid plaques that characterize AD. LRP has been found to bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in a manner that alters its trafficking and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Yoon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Cam2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. LRP-deficient cells secrete less A&#x003b2; and restoring LRP function substantially increases A&#x003b2; production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Ulery1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. One study has reported reduced levels of LRP in the brains of AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Kang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, but this finding has not been confirmed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Causevic1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. LRP also appears to mediate the clearance of A&#x003b2; that is bound to &#x003b1;2M or ApoE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Kang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Qiu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Narita1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. It is, therefore, important to examine the role of LRP in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer-type amyloidosis in transgenic mouse models of this pathology. Unfortunately, the large size of the LRP gene (&#x0003e;10 kb) makes production of transgenic animals that express the whole protein difficult by standard cDNA approaches. Zerbinatti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Zerbinatti1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> reported that overexpression of an LRP minireceptor in the PDAPP mouse model of AD, resulted in increased levels of soluble A&#x003b2; but did not impact amyloid burden. Similarly, it is not possible to examine adult animals that lack LRP because targeted deletion of the LRP gene in mice leads to death of the embryo at day 13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Herz2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the levels of functional LRP in the brain are regulated by RAP. Unlike LRP, mice deficient in RAP are viable and have normal lifespans because the maturation of LRP is only partially dependent upon RAP; neurons of RAP KO mice show 75&#x00025; reductions in the levels of endoproteolytically processed, mature, LRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Willnow3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is noteworthy that expression of PS1 variants M146L or L286V, which are linked to familial AD, also cause 40&#x00025; reductions in the levels of mature LRP in brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we have utilized RAP KO mice crossed with mice that co-express mutant APP (APPswe) and PS1 (PS1dE9) to examine how loss of RAP influences amyloid deposition. This work, in part, is a repetition of a previous effort by van Uden and colleagues in which RAP knockout mice were crossed to the PDAPP model of AD amyloidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the present study differs from this previous work in a few important ways, providing new insights into the mechanisms involved. First, we determine the effects of partial loss of RAP on amyloid deposition by examining mice with heterozygous deletion of RAP. Second, we use mice that co-express mutant presenilin, which has been shown in other studies to reduce the maturation of LRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, we study mice that express the 695 isoform of APP, which lacks a domain critical for interaction with LRP. Also, we noted that methods described in the van Uden study indicated that mice heterozygous for the APP transgene and heterozygous for RAP &#x0005b;APP (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)&#x0005d; were intercrossed to produce the animals ultimately analyzed: APP transgene positive and homozygous wild-type for RAP or homozygous null for RAP. A possible flaw in this strategy is that some offspring could be homozygous for the APP transgene (i.e. have two transgene alleles instead of one). If transgene homozygous animals were, by chance, over-represented in one of the RAP genotypes examined, then there could be error in determining the contribution of RAP to amyloid load. Thus, we repeated the study, using our APPswe/PS1dE9 model of AD and RAP KO mice. For reasons that are not clear, mice hemizygous for the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenes and homozygous null for RAP died at high frequency just after birth. We therefore studied mice that were heterozygous null for RAP and heterozygous for the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenes. The partial reduction in RAP led to very modest reductions in the levels of mature LRP and SorLA/LR11 (&#x0223c;15&#x02013;20&#x00025; reductions of both) with predictable 50&#x00025; reductions in the levels of RAP. The changes in the levels of these proteins correlated with 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; increases in amyloid burden (assessed at 9 months of age). Our findings indicate that RAP plays a focal role in the biology of amyloid deposition either by regulating the maturation of proteins that modulate APP processing and A&#x003b2; metabolism, or by directly modulating other yet to be defined aspects of amyloidogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>The AD mouse model used in this study (APPswe/PS1dE9-Line 85) co-expresses a chimeric mouse/human APP695 harboring the Swedish K670M/N671L mutations (Mo/HuAPPswe) and human PS1with the exon-9 deletion mutation (PS1dE9).

Animals were mated to APPswe/PS1dE9- Line 85 mice (B6C3/F2) background to produce an F1 generation of mice that were &#x0005b;APP/PS1&#x0005d;(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), which we then backcrossed to RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice in an attempt to produce mice that were &#x0005b;APP/PS1&#x0005d;(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;).

Similarly 50&#x00025; of the offspring should be RAP (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), with half of these offspring also harboring the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgene.

By contrast, the levels of LRP and SorLA/LR11 did not show the same level of reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003159-g003">Figs. 3A and B</xref>). On average, the levels of LRP were reduced 20&#x00025;, but variability between animals reduced statistical significance to only a trend (p&#x0003c;0.20). The levels of SorLA/LR11, however, were less variable and were measured as reduced on average by 15&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.05). Thus, the levels of both of these RAP-dependent receptors were modestly reduced in mice partially deficient in RAP.

Two-tailed student t-Test with equal variance was used to estimate the probability that differences in the levels of each protein, between genotypes, resulted from random chance (p values for each comparison are noted on the figure).

As a result of unexpected lethality in mice that expressed APPswe/PS1dE9 in a RAP null background, we focused our analysis on mice with only partial reductions of RAP, finding that partial reduction increased the rate of A&#x003b2; deposition by 1.5 to 2-fold. By our estimates, 50&#x00025; reductions in the level of RAP cause 15&#x02013;20&#x00025; reductions in the levels of mature LRP and SorLA/LR11. We expected that mice co-expressing mutant PS1dE9 with partial reductions of RAP would exhibit larger affects on LRP maturation because mice that are wild-type for RAP and transgenic for PS1-M146L or L286V show 40&#x00025; reductions in the levels of mature LRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we did not observe an obvious effect of PS1dE9 expression on LRP processing. Thus, the strongest correlate to increased A&#x003b2; deposition in this experiment is the 50&#x00025; reduction in RAP levels.</p><p>A caveat of our study is that the &#x0005b;APPswe/PS1dE9&#x0005d;(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice and the &#x0005b;APPswe/PS1dE9&#x0005d;(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP(&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) mice they were compared to were of a slightly different genetic background. The RAP knockout mice were congenic on the C57BL/6J background while the parental APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were hybrids of C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ (maintained by crosses of transgenic males to F1 hybrids of the 2 strains purchased from Jackson Laboratory). In prior studies of mice that harbor the APPswe and mutant PS1 transgene constructs utilized here, we have noted that transfer of the transgene from the hybrid background to C57BL/6J mice modestly delays the onset of amyloid deposition to lower amyloid loads at younger ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Savonenko1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we have confidence that the increased amyloid burden seen in first generation offspring of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice&#x000d7;RAP knockout mice is due to the partial loss of RAP and not to effects of the other genetic factors in the backgrounds of these mouse strains. Indeed, the influence of strain background may have attenuated the magnitude of the change in amyloid burden by the partial reduction in RAP.</p><p>Whether modest reductions in LRP or SorLA/LR11 account for the increased amyloid burden we have observed is unclear. In previous studies, complete deficiency in SorLA/LR11 was shown to cause a 30&#x00025; increase in the secretion of mouse A&#x003b2;40 and 42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Andersen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. More substantial reductions in SorLA/LR11 levels (80&#x00025;) in the frontal cortex of AD patients, without changes in LRP levels, has been found to correlate with higher amyloid burden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Andersen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the study by Van Uden and colleagues of PDGF-APP<sub>Ind</sub> mice mated to RAP KO mice, increases in amyloid burden were correlated with 80&#x00025; reductions in the levels of mature LRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these studies suggest that reductions in LRP and/or SorLA/LR11 that are of a significantly greater magnitude than found here produce significant changes in amyloidogenesis. We conclude that either RAP possesses an activity that influences amyloidogenesis in the absence of profound effects on LRP and SorLA/LR11 maturation, or relatively modest reductions in the levels of these proteins (separately or in combination) are sufficient to cause significant changes in the rate of amyloid deposition in the APPswe/PS1dE9 model.</p><p>The genetic association of LRP and SorLA/LR11, and their ligands, APOE, &#x003b1;2M, and APP, to AD indicates that these membrane receptor proteins could play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Previous studies provide evidence that LRP has opposing effects on APP processing and A&#x003b2; metabolism. LRP can promote A&#x003b2; production by altering the processing of APP through interactions with the Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain (APP751 or APP770) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Rebeck1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the APP695 isoform, which lacks a KPI domain, can weakly bind to LRP through cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, such as FE65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Pietrzik1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, it is not known whether the processing of APP695 can be influenced by LRP. LRP also functions in the catabolism of A&#x003b2; peptides and it is possible that modest reductions in LRP levels are sufficient to diminish the rate of A&#x003b2; clearance, which involves the binding of A&#x003b2; to the LRP ligands ApoE or &#x003b1;2M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Kang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Qiu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Narita1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Herz3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Deane1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. SorLA/LR11 has been shown to promote the trafficking of APP to discrete intracellular compartments that result in decreased A&#x003b2; secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Andersen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, reduced levels of SorLA/LR11 could increase A&#x003b2; production. Collectively, these studies suggest very complicated inter-connected pathways by which these proteins could influence APP processing and A&#x003b2; metabolism. It is possible that the combined effects of modest reductions in both LRP and SorLA/LR11 could, by different mechanisms, alter the balance of A&#x003b2; production and clearance to increase the rate of amyloid deposition. However, because the effects of partial RAP deficiency in the levels of these two proteins is so modest, it is possible that RAP may have the capacity to modulate amyloid deposition by other, yet to be defined, pathways.</p><p>As outlined in the Introduction, our work replicates and extends a previous study by van Uden and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the potential caveats to the van Uden study that are described in the Introduction, we seem to produce a similar result, which is increased amyloid burden when RAP levels are decreased. In our case, only partial reduction in RAP levels was sufficient to increase amyloid deposition. Although we have similar outcomes to the van Uden study, the mechanisms by which these effects occur could be different. The J9 mice used by van Uden were PDGF-hAPP<sub>Swe/Ind</sub> mice, which created by Mucke and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Mucke1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The J9 model utilizes a mini-APP gene that can produce all three isoforms of APP: APP695, APP751 and APP770 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Games1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, based on the discussion above, one prediction might have been for deficiency in RAP to lead to diminished amyloid deposition because the absence of LRP would reduce A&#x003b2; production from APP751 and 770 splice variants. However, since amyloid burden increased in RAP deficiency, it is possible that the loss of LRP slowed the clearance of A&#x003b2;, resulting in increased amyloid deposition. It is also possible that lowering the levels of SorLA/LR11 by deleting RAP may have contributed to the increase in A&#x003b2; deposition.</p><p>In a direct test of the role of LRP in amyloidogenesis, transgenic mice that overexpress an LRP-minireceptor, containing the ligand-binding domain II of human LRP and the region representing the transmembrane subunit including the full cytoplasmic tail (mLRP2), were mated to PDAPP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Zerbinatti1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors reported 3-fold increases in LRP levels and found increased soluble A&#x003b2; and enhanced memory impairment in PDAPP mice, but did not find evidence of a change in amyloid loads in mice harboring both transgenes as compared to mice harboring only the PDAPP transgene. If LRP directly affects amyloidogenesis by mediating clearance of A&#x003b2; peptides, then one would have predicted that the above study would have produced mice with lowered amyloid burden. However, the transgene product was not full-length LRP and the transgene was not expressed by its endogenous promoter. Additional study is clearly required to clarify the role LRP in APP and A&#x003b2; metabolism.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Mutant PS1 and LRP maturation</title><p>It has been reported that the levels of mature, endoproteolytically cleaved, LRP in the murine nervous system are reduced when AD associated mutants of PS1 (M146L or L286V, expressed via the hamster prion protein gene promoter) are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Our expectation was that PS1dE9 (expressed via the mouse prion protein gene promoter), which has a strong effect on APP processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Lesuisse1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Jankowsky3">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Thinakaran1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, would also affect LRP maturation. However, our data do not provide evidence that this is the case. Moreover, partial reduction of RAP with co-expression of PS1dE9 also has little impact on the levels of mature LRP. Thus, either the PS1dE9 variant of PS1 does not have the same activity towards LRP maturation as possessed by the M146L or L286V variants, or some subtle difference in the expression pattern of the PS1 transgenes in the different mouse models modulates the effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Lethality in RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice that co-express APPswe/PS1dE9</title><p>The cause of lethality in RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice that harbor the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgene is not clear. The overall number of RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice, regardless of the presence of the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgene, that were identified in the genotyping of weaning age mice was lower than expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003159-t001">Table 1</xref>). Initially, we suspected that the poor survival of &#x0005b;APPswe/PS1dE9&#x0005d;(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;)/RAP(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice was due to a combined effect of RAP deficiency and mutant PS1expression on LRP levels such that LRP levels were lowered to a level below the threshold for survival. Homozygous deletion of LRP is embryonic lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Herz4">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as noted above, LRP maturation in PS1dE9 mice was not affected as significantly as reported in mice expressing other PS1 variants. At present the basis for poor survival is unknown but it appears that expression of PS1dE9 is implicated because others have not noted that expression of mutant APP in a RAP null background decreases survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-VanUden2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is clear from the literature that interactions between RAP and LRP, between LRP and APP, and between LRP and APOE, &#x003b1;2M, and A&#x003b2; create a complicated network by which amyloidogenesis might be regulated. RAP also regulates other members of the LRP family, such as LRP1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Cam1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, SorLA/LR11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Jacobsen1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, LDL-R and VLDL-R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003159-Veinbergs1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, which adds additional complexity to the system. We find that APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with partial reduction in RAP showed significant amyloid burden increases with modest to slight reductions in the levels of mature SorLA/LR11 and LRP. Although it is possible that modest reductions in SorLA/LR11 and LRP act in concert to alter the processing or clearance of A&#x003b2;, it is also possible that RAP has more direct effects on APP processing or the clearance of A&#x003b2; peptides. Overall, RAP could be viewed as either directly or indirectly influencing multiple processes that modulate Alzheimer-type amyloidogenesis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0003159-Vetrivel1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
