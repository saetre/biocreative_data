Of 62 highly reproducible ARORs, 32 (52&#x00025;) were also marked by AcH3. While the number of ARORs detected in prostate cancer cells exceeded the number of nearby DHT-responsive genes, the AcH3 mark defined a subclass of ARORs much more highly associated with such genes &#x02013; 12&#x00025; of the genes flanking AcH3&#x0002b;ARORs were DHT-responsive, compared to only 1&#x00025; of genes flanking AcH3&#x02212;ARORs. Most ARORs contained enhancer activities as detected in luciferase reporter assays. Analysis of the AROR sequences, followed by site-directed ChIP, identified binding sites for AR transcriptional coregulators FoxA1, CEBP&#x003b2;, NFI and GATA2, which had diverse effects on endogenous AR target gene expression levels in siRNA knockout experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We suggest that only some ARORs function under the given physiological conditions, utilizing diverse mechanisms.

These latter factors modify histones and interact with the basal transcriptional machinery to modulate transcriptional initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Rosenfeld1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This paradigm is based on, and has been the basis for, many studies in which steroid hormone receptor binding motifs, 5&#x02032;-upstream of TSSs of target genes, were identified and characterized. Thus, DNA binding locations for steroid receptors were found where investigators looked for them. More recent data however have revealed that the distribution of steroid receptor occupancy genome-wide has no preference for 5&#x02032;-flanking sequences of annotated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Carroll1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the distribution of such sites, including androgen receptor (AR)-occupied regions (ARORs) on chromosomes 21 &#x00026; 22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, is poorly correlated with gene density. For this reason, two studies that used genomic windows around the TSSs of annotated genes may have been limited in their capacity to assign ARORs in a genome-wide fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Bolton1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Massie1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> by missing functional ARORs far away on linear DNA. Nonetheless, it is not a trivial task to assign <italic>a priori</italic> functionality to ARORs if they are not directly associated with promoters of nearby genes. One potential way to better assign functionality to transcription factor binding sites, including ARORs, is to make use of chromatin analyses. In particular, ARORs containing active histone modifications may function as enhancers, modulating transcription at a distance.</p><p>Histone covalent modifications, also referred to as chromatin epigenetics, are involved in normal somatic cell development as well as in the progression of diseases, such as cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Feinberg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Feinberg2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Such histone modifications or &#x02018;marks&#x02019; lead to the recruitment and subsequent docking of regulatory protein complexes that modulate transcription. These marks provide a nuanced chromatin &#x02018;language&#x02019; that demarcate chromatin into structural domains with dynamic functional consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Berger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Systematic studies of chromatin modifications have revealed a complex landscape including &#x02018;punctate&#x02019; sites of modified histones (histone H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation and lysine 4 di- and trimethylation) at transcription start sites and distal regulatory elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Heintzman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Histone H3 acetylation is an epigenetic mark that allows prediction of functional regulatory elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Roh1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular mechanisms of how chromatin remodeling modulates transcription in the context of many diseases, including prostate cancer (PCa), will undoubtedly have a major impact in disease understanding and management. In the case of PCa, it is known that the progression to the fatal stage of the disease, ablation resistance, depends to a large degree on the activity of the AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Jenster1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Debes1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, a potent transcription factor (TF) that facilitates epigenetic control of gene expression at many target loci across the entire human genome.</p><p>With the development of high throughput methodologies such as ChIP-chip (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Hudson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>) and more recently ChIP-seq (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Robertson1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>), it has become possible to comprehensively map regions in the genome of mammalian cells that are occupied by TFs of interest.

To determine genomic AR binding sites and better understand their biological significance, we mapped both AR-occupied regions (ARORs) as well as histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) states chromosome-wide (large parts of chromosomes 19 and 20) in the C4-2B aggressive PCa cell line.

Of the ARORs identified, only a subset has clear functional consequences in the PCa cell line analyzed, indicating the existence of diverse AR functions under changing physiological circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>AR-occupied regions in prostate cancer cells exceed number of DHT-responsive genes</title><p>We performed three independent AR ChIP-chip analyses using a genomic tiling microarray (NimbleGen Systems Inc., Madison, WI) that covers sequences on chromosomes 19 and 20 that total about 3&#x00025; of the human genome, including the classical AR target gene <italic>PSA/KLK3</italic>. We implemented a novel peak-calling algorithm that allowed us to identify 189 genomic regions (about 500 bp on average) occupied by the AR in at least two of the three experiments, with 62 &#x0005b;level 1 (L1) ARORs&#x0005d; being reproduced in all three, and 127 &#x0005b;level 2 (L2) ARORs&#x0005d; being reproduced in exactly two of the three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Their coordinates are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003645.s008">Table S1</xref>, where they are numbered consecutively from A001 to A189. The AROR peaks were generally robust in multiple sampling experiments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Frequently, ARORs were classified as L2 and not L1 because of missing probes imposed by repetitive sequences and requirements of the NimbleGen design criteria. For instance, AROR A042 encompasses the well-characterized <italic>PSA/KLK3</italic> enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Jia1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Shang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, but was called as an L2 AROR primarily because it partly overlaps a repeat-masked region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A043 identifies a novel AROR at the KLK locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and four other examples, ARORs A033, A067, A128 and A129, are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. The AROR calling in our ChIP-chip analysis has a very low false positive discovery rate, which is reflected by the fact that 21/21 L1 ARORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and 6/7 L2 ARORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) could be validated by site-specific independent ChIP assays. For the four negative control (NC) regions, two of which (NC1 and NC2) contain canonical androgen response elements (ARE), no AR occupancy was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, with the exceptions of A039 and A129 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), we found little evidence of ligand-independent AR occupancy, which is in line with previous observations at the canonical AR responsive enhancer for the <italic>PSA</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Jia2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Jia3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These exceptions, however, may have important implications for ligand-independent signaling of the AR as part of the ablation-resistant phenotype in advanced prostate tumors.</p><fig id="pone-0003645-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003645.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Characterization of ARORs and AcH3 regions on chromosome 19 and 20.</title><p>Three replicate ChIP-chip experiments identified 738 Androgen Receptor Occupied Regions (ARORs), 62 of which were common to all three replicates (L1 ARORs) and 127 common to only two of three (L2 ARORs), while two replicate ChIP-chip experiments identified 1,388 regions with acetylated histone H3 marks, 1,189 of which were present in both replicates (A). Genome plots are shown for the kallikrein locus (B) and three other AROR-containing loci (C), where AR-ChIP peaks are labeled, and raw log2 ratios &#x0005b;from 0 (1-fold) to 2 (4-fold)&#x0005d; for each replicate are shown in green (AR-ChIP) and blue (AcH3-ChIP). Panel (D) shows the genomic positioning of the 189 L1/L2 AROR peaks and 1,189 AcH3 peaks.

All three classes (AROR, EROR, and AcH3) are excluded from exons relative to randomly selected regions (insert). The selected ARORs were validated by independent ChIP-qPCR (E&#x02013;G). C4-2B cell were incubated in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 containing 5&#x00025; CSS for 3 days and then treated with 10 nM DHT or ethanol (EtOH) vehicle for 4 h.

This high reproducibility is attributable to the stability of this lineage-specific histone modification. Mapping of the AcH3 peaks to the human genome show that 48&#x00025; of them overlap with TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1D, insert</xref>). In contrast, very few ARORs coincide with TSSs, indicating that AR rarely occupies proximal promoters.

This distribution was very similar to that obtained for ARORs in chromosomes 21 &#x00026; 22 of LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003645.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In terms of evolutionary conservation, both the ARORs and ERORs were only slightly more conserved across evolution than a set of random control sequences that exclude repetitive sequences not represented on the tiling array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003645.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Extrapolation of our chromosome 19/20 results suggests that under similar experimental and computational stringency we would expect in the human genome just over 2,000 ARORs that would be classified as L1 and around 6,300 as L2.

This finding is suggestive of complex protein-protein interactions in the recruitment of a given TF to a specific AROR, and further indicates that the site-specific arrangement of TFs creates a diversity of site-specific AR-mediated transcriptional responses.

AR occupancy exhibited higher inter-experimental variance than AcH3, but was still sufficiently reproducible to detect 62 regions occupied in every one of three independent experiments. Aside from their exclusion from exonic sequences, ARORs were distributed randomly with respect to gene locations. Of the 62 highly reproducible ARORs, 32 were also marked by AcH3. The significance of AROR acetylation was apparent when examining gene expression patterns of neighboring genes &#x02013; 12&#x00025; of genes adjacent to AcH3&#x0002b;ARORs were DHT-stimulated, compared to only 1&#x00025; of genes adjacent to AcH3- ARORs (conversely, 46&#x00025; of up-regulated transcripts were adjacent to acetylated ARORs whereas only 4&#x00025; were adjacent to an un-acetylated AROR.) While the number of differentially regulated genes on chromosomes 19 and 20 is small, this roughly 10-fold enrichment in functionality of ARORs with the acetylation mark illustrates the utility of combining ChIP studies of individual transcription factors with epigenetic markers in the same cells.</p><p>We detected many more ARORs than DHT-responsive genes, leaving most ARORs without any detectable function in C4-2B cells. We can speculate that these ARORs, particularly the acetylated ones, modulate transcription at levels undetectable in our assay, or target microRNAs or other un-annotated transcripts.

Transcriptional enhancement of other genes could have been offset by compensatory mechanisms of RNA destabilization, or difficult to detect due to high basal steady state levels. Finally, it is plausible that occupancy at some ARORs was without any transcriptional function under the experimental conditions employed. Some of these ARORs, in particular acetylated ARORs, could be poised for transcriptional engagement upon arrival of a missing signal. Others may have functions unrelated to transcription, such as chromosome structural regulation, replication or DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Li1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Still others, especially non-acetylated ARORs, may have no function at all.

Only a small number of ARORs is actually engaged in transcriptional regulation possibly again due to the presence of another set of coregulators (Y &#x00026; Z) that may convert poised ARORs to engaged ones.

Indeed, even ARORs that had no enhancer activity in C4-2B cells turned out to be active in other prostate cancer cell lines (data not shown). As stated above, whether an AROR is engaged, poised, or transcriptionally inactive, even in a non-chromosomal context after transient transfection, likely depends on the differential occupancy of the AROR by trans-acting factors, which modify the transcriptional activity of the AR. This was best exemplified by the siRNA knockdown of specific AR coregulators that had differential effects on different DHT-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Interestingly, all three were in the proximity of genes that were substantially stimulated by DHT treatment (<italic>PSA</italic>, <italic>TGM2</italic> and <italic>PYGB</italic>), indicating that this transcriptional coregulator might potentiate the AR-mediated transcription of these genes. However, depending on the specific enhancer, GATA2 might have enhancing or repressing activities on gene expression, as was shown in the siRNA knockdown experiments.</p><p>Oct-1 was proposed as an AR collaborator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and was shown to physically interact with the AR in a DNA-dependent manner that facilitated cofactor recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Gonzalez1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Gonzalez2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Apart from the different kallikrein loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003645-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we did not find any other gene-wide acetylation profiles on chromosomes 19 &#x00026; 20, indicating that the expression of kallikreins is perhaps examples of only a few genes marked in this way. From the work presented here it is clear that coregulators also contribute significantly to transcriptional efficiency.</p><p>The interplay between the AR and potential coregulators is very likely promoter/enhancer specific and dependent on the phenotypes of the target genes as was shown in the present study. Some of the AR coregulators may be considered pioneer factors, laying the groundwork to allow efficient AR-mediated gene modulation as was proposed for ER activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003645-Carroll1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In such cases they may even provide the initial site for the AR to dock at enhancers or promoters that do not contain strong AREs; in this scenario, the AR is brought into play via its interaction with the coregulator, with weak binding to, or even no contact with DNA. A complex site-specific matrix of transcription factors may therefore exist to allow specific gene regulation under specific physiological conditions. At this stage we do not know the rules governing AR-mediated expression control at different loci. As a matter of fact, there are likely dozens more coregulators that determine AR activity across all ARORs and cell types. Deciphering the rules of AR engagement by these coregulators across various ARORs and under different physiological and pathological conditions may require decades of research. Meanwhile, measuring epigenetic marks, such as histone H3 acetylation, provides a powerful approach as a functional adjunct to characterize ARORs. The combined mapping of TF-binding regions and histone modifications may therefore prove a beneficial principle to be used for the functional, genome-wide characterization of not only AR, but also that of many other TFs.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Over the past several decades a general concept of TF-mediated gene regulation has emerged. It depicts a sequence of events, starting with TFs binding at specific regions of DNA, followed by the covalent modification of chromatin proteins (primarily histones) to &#x02018;open&#x02019; chromatin, and ultimately allowing the nearby docking of the transcription machinery. This is not necessarily always the case and alternative insights were recently revealed by the use of new high throughput techniques, which allow the agnostic mapping of such regions and an unbiased appreciation of their functions. In the current study, many AR binding sites were not associated with nearby gene expression despite the fact that they had intrinsic positive regulatory activity in chromatin-independent assays. On the other hand, those that regulated the expression of nearby genes were 10-times more likely marked by acetylation, indicating that AR occupancy and associated histone acetylation are both necessary requirements for positive regulatory competence. The existence of silent AR occupied regions, however indicates that AR occupancy does not necessarily lead to the recruitment of histone acetylases and subsequent nearby gene expression. Therefore, the rate-limiting step for AR-mediated gene expression is not occupancy <italic>per se</italic>. Silent occupied regions may act as a reservoir of bound AR, possibly poised to mediate gene expression as conditions change. Such conditions may include chromatin modifications and/or the recruitment of coregulators, since most of the AR occupied regions were also co-occupied by other TFs, which in several cases acted as coregulators of gene expression. We conclude that the diversity of site-specific functions of the AR points to differential regulation of gene expression by the same transcription factor related to chromatin structure and the presence of coregulators.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Materials</title><p>Human prostate cancer C4-2B cells, obtained from ViroMed Laboratories (Minneapolis, MN), were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5&#x00025; (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS).

This volcano plot shows the E-value (number of transcripts at the given p-value expected by chance) plotted against the mean fold change. 552 transcripts up-regulated at the E&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;150 level (permutation-adjusted p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004), along with 416 transcripts down-regulated (permutation-adjusted p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003), are shown in the upper two quadrants, and of the well-studied DHT-responsive genes in prostate cancer are labeled.</p><p>(2.42 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003645.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003645.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Predicted ARE and coregulator binding sites in L1 ARORs.

The results show that they largely follow a normal distribution.
