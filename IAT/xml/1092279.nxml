When bound to RNAP II, Mg(B) is coordinated by the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates of the NTP, Rpb1 residues D481 and D483 and Rpb2 residue D837. Rpb2 residue D837 is highly conserved across species. Notably, its neighboring residue, E836 (E791 in human RNAP II), is also highly conserved. To probe the role of E791 in transcription, we have affinity purified and characterized a human RNAP II mutant in which this residue was substituted for alanine. Our results indicate that the transcription activity of the Rpb2 E791A mutant is impaired at low NTP concentrations both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. They also revealed that both its NTP polymerization and transcript cleavage activities are decreased at low Mg concentrations. Because Rpb2 residue E791 appears to be located too far from the NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) complex to make direct contact at either the entry (E) or addition (A) site, we propose alternative mechanisms by which this highly conserved residue participates in loading NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) in the active site during transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA polymerase (RNAP) II, the enzyme that synthesizes mRNA in mammals, is composed of 12 subunits, termed Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Crystal structures of yeast RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) have confirmed that the two largest subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2, form the enzyme's catalytic center. These structures also revealed the presence of a cleft at the surface of the enzyme, which buries this active center. The cleft is formed, on one side, by a mobile &#x02018;clamp&#x02019; which is connected to the protein by a series of five &#x02018;switch&#x02019; regions. In the elongation complex, the DNA enters the cleft through a pair of &#x02018;jaws&#x02019; and the DNA helix is opened before the active center. The template strand binds to switches 1 and 2 and the &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; helix. Beyond the bridge, the template strand and the nascent RNA form a 9 bp duplex. Beneath the active site and in line with the bridge is found a &#x02018;pore&#x02019; or secondary channel; the space formed by the cleft at the surface of the protein being the main channel. The secondary channel widens towards the bottom of RNAP II, forming an inverted &#x02018;funnel&#x02019;. In the past, both channels have been proposed as privileged routes for NTP entry, and pyrophosphate exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>DNA and RNAPs catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the 3&#x02032; hydroxyl of a first nucleotide on the &#x003b1;-phosphate of a second incoming NTP, leading to phosphodiester bond formation and the release of a pyrophosphate molecule. Based on crystal structures of T7 DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), a two metal ion mechanism has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Through this mechanism, a first Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion [metal A or Mg(A)] lowers the affinity of the 3&#x02032; oxygen for the hydrogen thereby facilitating the O<sup>&#x02212;</sup> attack on the 5&#x02032; &#x003b1;-phosphate. The second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion [metal B or Mg(B)] facilitates the release of the pyrophosphate. High-resolution crystal structures of yeast RNAP II revealed the position of the two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in the catalytic site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In the yeast RNAP II structure, Mg(A) is coordinated by three aspartate residues of Rpb1, D481, D483 and D485, contained within the strictly conserved motif NADFDGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Mg(B) was recently localized near residue D481 and D483 of Rpb1 as well as the highly conserved residue D837 of Rpb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). However, previous studies have suggested that the highly conserved residue E836 is also implicated in the coordination of Mg(B) in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). A number of studies have also proposed that Mg(B) would necessitate the presence of the incoming NTP for its complete coordination required for the polymerization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). However, biochemical data in support of the role of E836, D837 and NTP as Mg(B) coordinating residues is currently lacking.</p><p>In addition to their polymerization activity, DNA-dependent RNAPs can also catalyze the 3&#x02032; endonucleolytic cleavage of transcripts to stimulate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). First discovered in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), this cleavage activity takes place when RNAP has backtracked at pause and arrest sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Weakly associated DNA&#x02013;RNA hybrids can induce backtracking of the enzyme to a more stable register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). To resume elongation from this more stable position, RNAP needs to cleave the 3&#x02032; end of the transcript that now extrudes from the catalytic site through the pore. This intrinsic nuclease activity is stimulated at basic pH, strongly suggesting a hydrolytic mechanism rather than pyrophosphorolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The 3&#x02032; cleavage activity is also enhanced by specific factors, GreA and GreB in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and TFIIS in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). TFIIS was first identified as an elongation factor that helps RNAP II to elongate through arrest sites <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). TFIIS greatly stimulates the intrinsic nuclease activity of RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The crystal structure of TFIIS in a complex with RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) provided insight into the mechanism by which this factor enhances transcript cleavage. Specifically, it revealed that two conserved acidic residues in TFIIS essential for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), are located in the vicinity of the polymerase Mg(B) and could participate in its coordination. Therefore, it was suggested that a two metal ion mechanism is involved in the 3&#x02032; endonucleolytic activity of RNAP II. A two metal ion mechanism is consistent with the requirement for divalent cations for the cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In addition, recent studies on GreB, the prokaryotic homolog of TFIIS, have also provided evidence for a two metal ion mechanism for the 3&#x02032; transcript cleavage activity of bacterial RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the role of the highly conserved residues E791 and D792 of Rpb2 (equivalent to E836 and D837 in yeast RNAP II), we have studied mutant RNAP II having alanine substitutions in these residues. We found that the D792A substitution in Rpb2 impairs the assembly of RNAP II, thereby preventing the study of its effect during transcription. In contrast, the E791A substitution does not affect assembly of the enzyme but rather makes its polymerization activity more sensitive to low NTP concentrations and both its polymerization and cleavage activities more sensitive to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Accordingly, we found that the equivalent substitution in yeast Rpb2, E836A, confers sensitivity to low nucleotide concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic>, while D837A is lethal either alone or in combination with E836A. Our results demonstrate for the first time that amino acid E791 (E836 in yeast) participates in the binding of Mg(B) in the active site and is required both for the polymerization and cleavage reactions. They also support the hypothesis that this second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion enters the catalytic center with the incoming NTP. We propose, for the polymerization reaction, that Rpb2 E791 interacts with the NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) complex and participates in its loading to the active site prior to catalysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein factors</title><p>Recombinant yeast TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), human TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), RAP74 and RAP30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), TFIIE56/&#x003b1; and TFIIE34/&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), calf thymus RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and GST-TFIIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) were purified as previously described.</p></sec><sec><title>Tandem affinity purification of wild-type and mutant RNAP II</title><p>TAP-tagged wild-type and mutant RNAP II subunits were expressed in human EcR-293 cells and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gel mobility shift assay</title><p>Gel mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) with the following modifications.

In a separate experiment, the different mutant rpb2 alleles were also introduced into the wild-type yeast strain W303-1A in order to test if they confer a dominant-lethal phenotype.

A mock-transfected cell line was used as a negative control. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Primer pairs were designed for both the promoter and transcribed regions of <italic>GNB2L1</italic> (&#x02212;200 to +55 and +998 to +1165, respectively), <italic>FTL</italic> (&#x02212;157 to +33 and +955 to +1176, respectively) and <italic>ENO1</italic> (&#x02212;90 to +91 and +1143 to +1292, respectively) genes.

Only MB E791A assembled correctly in the cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and was able to form a preinitiation complex with the general initiation factors on promoter DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both MB D792A and MB E791A/D792A lacked some of the small RNAP II subunits. As expected from their assembly defect, both MB D792A and MB E791A/D792A were also defective in run-off transcription reactions (data not shown). In contrast, the correctly assembled mutant MB E791A was able to synthesize an accurately initiated 391 nt run-off transcript, albeit less efficiently than the wild- type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports have shown that the substitution equivalent to E791A in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) and in the archae <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) impaired the ability of these enzymes to transcribe at low NTP concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the human mutant MB E791A is also sensitive to low NTP concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Increasing the concentration of non-radioactive UTP in the assay partially alleviated the failure of MB E791A to produce run-off transcripts, but had no effect on the wild-type enzyme. Because the same amount of radioactive UTP (0.08 &#x003bc;M, 0.25 &#x003bc;Ci) was used in all of the assays, increasing the concentration of unlabeled UTP from 2.5 &#x003bc;M UTP to 10 &#x003bc;M resulted in less incorporation of the labeled NTP in the 391 nt transcript synthesized by the wild-type enzyme, as indicated by the lower intensity of that band. Further increasing the concentration of non-radioactive UTP &#x0003e;40 &#x003bc;M led to a decrease in signal for both the wild-type and the mutant enzyme.</p><p>To confirm the sensitivity of MB E791A to NTP concentration, we immobilized the biotinylated template on streptavidin coated beads. The template used contained the AdML promoter that directed the synthesis of a 24 nt transcript in the absence of GTP as it contains a G residue at position +24 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for a schematic representation). Wild-type RNAP II or MB E791A were pre-assembled with the GTF on the immobilized template. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 30 min in the presence of a mix of NTP (Mix 1). Mix 1 contained 100 &#x003bc;M of ATP and CTP and 5 &#x003bc;Ci of 0.08 &#x003bc;M [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP and allowed the synthesis of transcripts of various lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 6). Under these conditions, the wild-type enzyme was able to predominantly produce the 24 nt transcript. In contrast, the majority of the MB E791A enzyme was stalled at around +10, indicating that the mutant enzyme is impaired in its ability to transcribe at limiting NTP concentrations. Increasing the concentration of non-radioactive NTP in Mix 2 stimulated production of the 24 nt transcript by the mutant polymerase (compare lanes 7&#x02013;10 with lanes 2&#x02013;5). At 0.64 &#x003bc;M of NTP, the mutant was as active as the wild type enzyme.</p><p>We then wished to determine the phenotypes associated with the Rpb2 substitutions E836A (E791A), D837A (D792A) and the double substitutions E836A D837A (E791A D792A), in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. To do so, the mutant <italic>rpb2</italic> alleles as well as the wild-type allele, all expressed from the endogenous <italic>RPB2</italic> promoter and cloned into a centromeric plasmid (<italic>TRP</italic>, <italic>CEN</italic>, <italic>ARS</italic>), were introduced into yeast strain yBC-1. In this strain, the chromosomal <italic>RPB2</italic> allele has been disrupted (<italic>Rpb2::LEU2</italic>) and is complemented by a plasmid expressing a galactose-inducible <italic>RPB2</italic> gene (<italic>pGal-Rpb2</italic>). On galactose-containing medium, both the wild-type Rpb2 encoded by the <italic>pGAL-Rpb2</italic> allele and the mutant or wild-type Rpb2 under the control of the endogenous <italic>RPB2</italic> promoter, are expressed. However, on glucose-containing medium transcription from the <italic>pGal</italic> promoter is repressed and only the wild-type or mutant Rpb2 allele transcribed from the endogenous promoter is expressed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that transformation of yBC-1 with the <italic>RPB2</italic> D837A expressing vector has a dominant-negative effect on cellular growth and/or viability. This dominant effect, which was also observed in the wild-type strain W303-1A (data not shown), suggests that the Rpb2 D837A subunit interferes with the function of wild-type RNAP II. In contrast, expression of the mutant Rpb2 E836A and E836A D837A had no dominant effect on the growth of yBC-1 on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Viable yBC-1 transformants expressing these mutant proteins were then streaked on glucose-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to repress expression of the <italic>pGal-Rpb2</italic> allele and reveal the recessive phenotypes associated with these mutant subunits. While the Rpb2 E836A subunit could support yeast growth on glucose medium, the double mutant Rpb2 E836A D837A was found to be lethal. Similar results were obtained in a strain lacking TFIIS (data not shown).</p><p>We then tested if Rpb2 E836A could support cell growth in the presence of 6-azauracil (6-AU), an inhibitor of IMP-dehydrogenase, which leads to a depletion of the intracellular pool of GTP and UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Most yeast mutants with a defect in transcriptional elongation show a growth defect on 6-AU containing medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). This was also found to be the case for cells expressing Rpb2 E836A, which showed severely reduced growth on glucose-medium supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml 6-AU, as compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the 6-AU sensitivity imposed by the E836A substitution in Rpb2 was more pronounced than that associated with the previously reported <italic>rpo21-18</italic> or <italic>rpo21&#x02013;24</italic> mutations in Rpb1 (data not shown), which affect the binding of TFIIS to RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). These results suggest that the yeast E836A RNAP II is sensitive to low nucleotide concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription results obtained for the human RNAP II counterpart (E791A).</p></sec><sec><title>MB E791A is more sensitive than wild-type RNAP II to MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations both during NTP polymerization and transcript cleavage</title><p>To test the hypothesis that E836/E791 is involved in the binding of the second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, we looked at the ability of MB E791A to transcribe at different MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> show that MB E791A is more sensitive to low MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations than wild type when assayed for the production of the 24 nt transcript from immobilized templates. These results strongly suggest that Rpb2 amino acid E791 is involved in the binding of Mg(B) during NTP polymerization.</p><p>Since a two metal ion mechanism was also proposed for the cleavage activity of RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), we tested the ability of the mutant MB E791A to cleave the 3&#x02032; end of a transcript. In the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, wild-type and mutant RNAP II were stalled at G + 24 using our transcription assay on immobilized templates, with a Mix 2 containing 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, CTP and UTP. Complexes were washed and incubated at pH 9.5 in the absence of NTP for 1 h. It has been shown that in a stalled complex, RNAP II is able to cleave the 3&#x02032; end of a transcript at a basic pH in the absence of TFIIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). At pH 8, intrinsic cleavage is almost completely abolished, but increasing the pH to 9.5 stimulates this RNAP II activity. The cleavage activity of RNAP II can also be greatly stimulated by the addition of TFIIS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that MB E791A is able to cleave the 3&#x02032; end of a transcript as efficiently as the wild type. At pH 9.5, the wild-type and the mutant cleave the RNA at two major sites, one at +22 and the other at +18. The addition of TFIIS stimulates both the wild type and the mutant to cleave, favoring the first (+22) site.</p><p>Previous studies using an <italic>E.coli</italic> mutant RNAP (E813A/D814A) analogous to our double mutant MB E791A/D792A have suggested that these two residues are not involved in the coordination of Mg(B) in the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Specifically, using a cleavage assay similar to the one used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Goldbarb and colleagues have shown that the ability of the mutant enzyme to cleave the 3&#x02032; end of a transcript was equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme at all MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations tested. We therefore determined the effect of decreasing the MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration on the cleavage activity of MB E791A at pH 9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We measured the disappearance of the 24 nt band for the wild type and the mutant at different MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<italic>x</italic>-axis). The <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the ratio of the intensity of the cleaved band to the uncleaved band. In contrast to Sosunov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) the graph shows that at low MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations, MB E791A is less active than wild type. At higher MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (5 mM), the mutant is as efficient as the wild type. Together, these results show that Rpb2 amino acid E791 is involved in the binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the active site of RNAP II for both the polymerization and cleavage reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>TFIIS stimulates transcription by both wild-type and MB E791A RNAP II at limiting NTP concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>In yeast, the TFIIS gene (<italic>DST1</italic>) is not essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). However, knocking out the gene confers sensitivity to 6-AU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that reducing the concentration of NTPs causes RNAP II to pause and overall elongate less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Since MB E791A is sensitive to low nucleotide concentrations, we decided to test the effect of TFIIS on transcription by this mutant <italic>in vitro</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that at 10 &#x003bc;M UTP, TFIIS stimulates synthesis of the 391 nt transcript by MB E791A but has no effect on transcription by the wild-type enzyme. Reducing UTP concentrations from 2.5 to 0.625 &#x003bc;M causes a decrease in the synthesis of the run-off transcript by the wild-type enzyme and causes the enzyme to arrest at different sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). At these limiting concentrations of NTP, TFIIS now stimulates transcription by the wild-type RNAP II. These <italic>in vitro</italic> results confirm that TFIIS helps RNAP II to transcribe at low NTP concentrations, as suggested by previous <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). We hypothesize that TFIIS helps RNAP II to resume arrest at low NTP concentrations by stimulating its 3&#x02032; transcript cleavage activity, possibly by stabilizing the binding of Mg(B) in the active site.</p></sec><sec><title>Metal B mutant E791A is defective for transcription <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In order to determine the transcriptional defects of the human MB E791A mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>, ChIP experiments were performed using IgG beads to precipitate the different TAP-tagged RNAP II bound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Q-PCR was used to determine the enrichment of wild-type and mutant RNAP II on the promoter and coding region of 3 actively transcribed genes relative to an untranscribed region. The three transcribed genes used in these studies were: the ferritin light polypeptide gene (<italic>FTL</italic>), the guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 2-like 1 gene (<italic>GNB2L1</italic>) and the enolase 1 (alpha) gene (<italic>ENO1</italic>).</p><p>As we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), wild-type TAP-tagged RNAP II was found at the promoter and in the transcribed region of the three genes tested, in substantially greater amounts than in the negative control (mock-transfected cell line). Consistent with the observation that MB E791A is able to form a pre-initiation complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, this mutant was present at the promoter of <italic>FTL</italic>, <italic>GNB2L1</italic> and <italic>ENO1</italic> genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results indicate that MB E791A is also located in the coding region of all three genes, albeit at a lower level than wild type. For the <italic>FTL</italic> and <italic>GNB2L1</italic> genes, the MB E791A mutation had a greater effect on the density of RNAP II in the coding region than at the promoter. For the <italic>ENO1</italic> gene, the mutant is similarly affected in both regions. Taken together, our ChIP results indicate that the E791A mutation has a more profound impact on transcript elongation than promoter recruitment <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We propose that a similar situation takes place in yeast cells. In the yeast strain carrying the E836A mutation, the RNAP II mutant is probably altered in its elongation efficiency on some genes but to an extent that does not affect growth under normal conditions. The addition of the drug 6-AU has a dramatic effect on growth of the mutant since it further reduces the altered enzyme's capacity to elongate by lowering the concentration of nucleotides in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The finding that mutant MB E791A is less efficiently recruited to promoters and less present in the transcribed regions <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot be explained solely by the <italic>in vitro</italic> defects presented in this article. We speculate that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, other factors that regulate transcription interact with the mutated polymerase and affect its ability to associate with promoters and to transcribe.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have purified and characterized a human RNAP II mutant in which the highly conserved residue E791 of Rpb2 has been substituted for an alanine. Our results indicate that the Rpb2 E791A substitution in the human enzyme alters both its polymerization activity at low NTP concentrations (<italic>in vitro</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <italic>in vivo</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or at low Mg concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and its transcript cleavage activity at low Mg concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Although previous reports have shown that the substitution equivalent to E791A in the RNAP of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) and the archae <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) impaired the ability of these enzymes to transcribe at low NTP concentrations, our results provide, what is to our knowledge, the first biochemical evidence that the E791A substitution reduces transcription at low Mg concentrations. Indeed, previous studies using an <italic>E.coli</italic> mutant RNAP (E813A/D814A) analogous to our double mutant MB E791A/D792A have suggested that these two residues are not involved in the coordination of Mg(B) in the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Specifically, using a cleavage assay similar to the one used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Goldbarb and colleagues have shown that this mutant enzyme cleaves the 3&#x02032; end of a transcript as efficiently as the wild-type enzyme at all MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations tested. The discrepancy between our results and those of Goldfarb and colleagues might accounted for by the fact that MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations &#x0003c;5 mM were not tested by Sosunov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>).</p><p>At high NTP concentrations, TFIIS was found to stimulate elongation of the Rpb2 E791A mutant, but not that of wild-type RNAP II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Stimulation of the wild-type enzyme by TFIIS was only observed when the NTP concentration was made limiting. These data support previous <italic>in vivo</italic> results showing that TFIIS helps RNAP II to transcribe at low NTP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), presumably by increasing NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) binding in the enzyme's active site. Our finding that TFIIS is able to stimulate transcript elongation at high NTP concentrations by a RNAP II having the Rpb2 E791A substitution supports a role for this residue in NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) binding. A lower density of the mutated RNAP II along transcribed genes, as determined by ChIP experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), is also consistent with the role of E791 in transcript elongation.</p><p>Recently, Kornberg and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) have published the crystal structure of yeast RNAP II bound to a DNA&#x02013;RNA duplex and a nucleotide positioned at the <italic>i</italic> + 1 site, poised for bond formation. In this structure, Mg(B) was found to be located in proximity to Rpb1 residues D481 and D483 and Rpb2 D837. On this basis, the authors proposed that these amino acids are implicated in Mg(B) coordination at the active site. At this step of the polymerization process, Rpb2 E836 is located too far from Mg(B) to interact with it. The structure of a RNAP II with a mismatched nucleotide revealed the existence of a second binding site for the incoming NTP, called the &#x02018;entry&#x02019; or E site. It was suggested that the NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) complex enters the active site through the pore and first binds to the E site in an inverted orientation, followed by a rotation and subsequent binding to the so-called &#x02018;addition&#x02019; or A site.</p><p>To account for our results showing that the mutant E791A is sensitive to NTP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations during the polymerization reaction, we propose that Rpb2 E836/791 is implicated in loading the NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) into the E site. We can envisage two distinct mechanisms by which this could occur. First, it is possible that the Rpb2 E791 side chain is essential for specifying the proper topology of the E site. In this case, substituting E791 for alanine could conceivably modify the configuration of the E site, for example, by affecting the precise positioning of residue D792, such as to reduce its binding affinity for the incoming NTP&#x02013;Mg(B). Alternatively, it is possible that Rpb2 E791 defines a third and distinct NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) binding site within the active center, which we will refer to as the &#x02018;pre-loading&#x02019; (P) site. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> depicts how an incoming NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) entering the active site through the pore would first interact transiently with the P site (panel 1), before being loaded in the E site at a position where metal B can interact with Rpb2 D837, Rpb1 D481 and D483 and the NTP &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) (panel 2). The nucleotide is next flipped and positioned at the A site for catalysis (panel 3). Consistent with the existence of a P site, we note that E836/E791 is the acidic residue within the vicinity of the active site that is the most accessible to an incoming NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) entering from the pore.</p><p>In a recent series of papers, Burton and colleagues have proposed that the incoming NTPs access the active center through the main channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Furthermore, these authors have proposed an NTP-driven translocation model in which the incoming NTP pairs with the DNA base at the <italic>i</italic> + 2 site. According to this model, this pairing is necessary to induce translocation of the NTP at the <italic>i</italic> + 1 site (A site) for catalysis and allows substrate selection prior to arrival into the catalytic site. Our data is also consistent with the idea that the NTPs access the catalytic center through the main channel. This would imply, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, that Mg(B) is implicated in an interaction with E836 (panel 2) during translocation of the NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) from the <italic>i</italic> + 2 site (panel 1) to the A site (panel 3). The interaction of E836 with NTP&#x02013;Mg(B) would play a crucial role in loading the NTP or retaining it in the active site for catalysis. If this model is correct, the position of the E site would be more consistent with it being a site for expulsion and subsequent exit of a mismatched nucleotide.</p><p>The mutant MB E791A is also sensitive to MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration in the cleavage reaction, suggesting that E791 is implicated in binding Mg(B) for this activity of the polymerase. High-resolution structures of RNAP II engaged in transcript cleavage will be required to determine the molecular basis of the interaction between E836 and Mg(B) during the rescue of backtracked transcripts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the members of our laboratory for helpful discussions and comments on this paper.
