Many algorithms for computational gene prediction have been described, ultimately derived from two basic concepts: (1) modeling gene structure and (2) recognizing sequence similarity. Successful hybrid methods combining these two concepts have also been developed. We present a third orthogonal approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER, which quantify mutational strand biases caused by transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection against polyadenylation signals. We combined these algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST, which we used to predict the location and orientation of thousands of putative transcription units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly predicted transcriptional units do not appear to code for proteins. The new algorithms are particularly apt at detecting genes with long introns and lacking sequence conservation.

Wong et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; have argued that the vast majority of the human genome is transcribed. Indeed, there is mounting experimental evidence showing that the human transcriptome is more complex and extensive than previously thought (Cheng et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). Computational sequence analysis can help direct the experimental discovery of novel genes; even the highly experimentally annotated <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> ORFeome was significantly enriched by computational gene predictions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several types of software for gene prediction are currently available. There are two basic concepts underlying these methods: (1) the recognition of gene structure and (2) sequence similarity. Methods that predict gene structure identify the structural and functional requirements for a segment of genomic sequence to be able to be transcribed, spliced, and finally to be translated into a protein sequence, e.g., GenScan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Methods based on sequence similarity identify genes by detecting regions of sequence that have been conserved in evolution, e.g., spliced alignment in Procrustes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The two concepts have been combined leading to significant improvements in accuracy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, gene predictions can be validated computationally by comparison to gene structures derived from coalignment and clustering of locus-specific mRNAs and ESTs on the genomic sequence.</p><p>Here, we develop a third basic concept in gene prediction that is based solely on the analysis of genomic sequence data: the recognition of &#x0201c;transcription footprints.&#x0201d; These are the side effects of sustained transcription on the genomic sequence, leading over evolutionary time to an accumulation of differences between the two DNA strands, which can be detected by appropriate statistical analysis. We present here an integrated suite of four prediction methods exemplifying this third basic concept. Importantly, the method presented here can readily predict transcriptional units that do not code for proteins.</p><p>Many of the transcription footprints are buried in interspersed repeats, which comprise almost half of the human genomic sequence, including intronic sequences. Most of these repeats are copies of transposable elements exhibiting various levels of sequence decay and are systematically excluded (&#x0201c;masked&#x0201d;) as a first step in most standard gene prediction methodologies. The present work takes advantage of a detailed analysis of interspersed repeats, as a reference framework for detecting the otherwise overlooked transcription footprints.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Strand Biases as Transcription Footprints</title><p>In this work, we focus on the detection of transcription footprints in the form of significant differences between the &#x0201c;forward&#x0201d; (coding, sense) and &#x0201c;reverse&#x0201d; (antisense) strands of transcribed regions. Two sources for orientation biases within genes are (1) mutations influenced by the act of transcription and (2) selection against harmful signals that disrupt transcription.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Biased mutation.</title><p>A transcription-associated strand asymmetry has been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and attributed to a byproduct of transcription-coupled DNA repair in germline cells. Transcription encourages the early resolution of mutations from polymerase base misinsertions, which are biased toward purines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Two gene prediction algorithms taking into account these biases were suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;: a &#x0201c;nucleotide compositional analysis,&#x0201d; which identifies composition skews in the sequence studied, and a &#x0201c;substitution rate analysis,&#x0201d; identifying all lineage-specific mutations from multispecies alignments.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Biased selection.</title><p>The identification of ORFs has long been considered the method of choice for identifying genes in genomes with little or no splicing. Where mRNA splicing is prevalent, this method loses power since ORFs can be split into several short segments separated by potentially long introns. In conceptual similarity to ORF identification, we hypothesized the existence of selection against the introduction of any signal that could prematurely interrupt the transcription process, in particular, polyadenylation signals (PASs). Since the PAS is asymmetric, with consensus sequence AATAAA or ATTAAA, selection should lead to orientation biases: introduction of the same signal in the opposite orientation would typically be a neutral event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Four Novel Transcript Predictors</title><p>We describe here four algorithms for transcript prediction and then present their combination as an integrated method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>The first algorithm: Greens.</title><p>The combined mutational biases yield an excess of G &#x0002b; T over A &#x0002b; C in the forward strand of genes, leading to an equilibrium value of 52.7&#x00025; G &#x0002b; T &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The nucleotide compositional analysis employs a log-likelihood ratio system derived from this expected nucleotide composition at equilibrium and then identifies segments of sequence with significant orientation biases. In this method, though, the strongest scores are obtained by the most biased sequences, not those nearest the equilibrium value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). By training on transcribed genomic sequence, we obtained an empirical distribution describing the strength of strand bias as a function of the local G &#x0002b; T composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). We found extremely biased nucleotide compositions to be less orientationally biased within genes than the more prevalent moderate compositions. The log-likelihood ratio scores obtained empirically from this analysis represent a better model for saturation of the mutation process and serve as the basis for this first algorithm (Greens), which is a refined version of the published nucleotide composition analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>The second algorithm: CHOWDER.</title><p>The Greens algorithm is not applicable to interspersed repeats, most of which have inserted into the genome too recently to have reached equilibrium with respect to G &#x0002b; T composition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;; some repeats introduce large compositional distortions, e.g., LINE1 retrotransposons have a 2:1 ratio of A to T in the forward strand &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Excluding repeats from the analysis is, though, equivalent to discarding almost half of the genomic data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The alignment of an interspersed repeat copy to its repeat family consensus sequence provides an enumeration of the substitutions it accrued since the time it inserted into the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). These substitutions have well-defined evolutionary directionality, from the state observed in the consensus to that observed in the extant sequence. A strand orientation can be established by arbitrarily normalizing mutations to one strand, e.g., the C&#x02192;T mutation is equivalent to a G&#x02192;A mutation on the opposite strand. We analyzed the alignments of all repeats contained within known transcripts and tabulated the observed frequencies of the different mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Using log-likelihood ratios derived from these observed frequencies, we implemented this second algorithm for transcript prediction (CHOWDER &#x0005b;CHanges Oriented Within DispErsed Repeats&#x0005d;). As observed for unique sequences, the overall trend for repeats leads to a rise in the frequency of G &#x0002b; T in the forward strand of transcripts. Interestingly, the strongest skews are for the G&#x02192;T mutation (C&#x02192;A on the opposite strand), which lowers the G &#x0002b; C content of transcribed regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>The third algorithm: ROAST.</title><p>Many retrotransposons have a highly conserved PAS; this suggests that the retroposition of such elements into the genome could be harmful when the orientation of the repeat is the same as the host gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). We found interspersed repeats of most types to be significantly biased in their orientation within transcribed regions, typically with a preference for the antisense strand &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We observed a strong correlation between the repeat orientation biases in the human and mouse genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). There is also a qualitative correlation between the extent of the orientation bias of a repeat family and the strength of the PAS it introduces into the genome: LTR elements are the most biased, LINE1 elements are strongly biased but less so, and DNA transposons are the least biased. While the LINE1 consensus sequences do not show canonical PAS, approximately 85&#x00025; of LINE1 insertions terminate at the 3&#x02032; end of the consensus sequence, suggesting that active LINE1 retroposons have reasonably strong PASs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been suggested that forward-strand LINE1 repeats attenuate gene expression due to its idiosyncratic A-rich nucleotide composition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;; in this case, we would expect longer LINE1 inserts to be more strongly skewed than shorter ones. We observed LINE1 skews to be invariant with element length (skew &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.3), suggesting that the biasing mechanism involves a discrete signal (e.g., the PAS) and not a length-dependent compositional signal. DNA transposons do not replicate via their transcript, and read-through transcription is probably of very little effect on their survival. Being transcribed by RNA polymerase III, Alu repeats have no PAS, yet they are significantly biased in orientation. To elucidate why, we performed a simulation experiment in which the consensus sequence for each repeat was integrated into randomly picked locations in a 4.4-Mb human genomic sequence (GenBank accession number NT&#x0005f;001520) in random orientation and studied the location and quality values for the potential PASs observed in the resulting sequences. In this simulation experiment, we found that the combination of the Alu polyA tail with the integration target site frequently generates a novel PAS (not shown). This third algorithm for transcript prediction (ROAST &#x0005b;Repeat Orientation Analysis Suggesting Transcripts&#x0005d;) is based on the statistical quantification of repeat orientation skews, stratified by repeat family and age and by the regional &#x00025;GC of the sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>The fourth algorithm: PASTA.</title><p>We further hypothesized that selective pressure to maintain functionally transcribed regions &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; to uninterrupted transcription might act against mutations making a weak forward-strand PAS stronger and in turn might favor mutations weakening cryptic PAS-like sites within transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). We identified PAS-like sequences using the polyadq program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and indeed found them to be significantly biased within known transcripts, with a strong preference for the reverse orientation. Most of this bias can be explained by random expectation from a G &#x0002b; T&#x02013;skewed sequence (see above): since the PAS is A rich, it is expected to be more prevalent in the reverse strand of a T-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). We therefore implemented a statistical correction to compensate for these expected biases in PAS orientation, based on training on intergenic sequences. Furthermore, the differential fixation of repeats itself yields a skew in PAS favoring the reverse strand. We therefore generated a &#x0201c;sequence mask&#x0201d; in which each repeat was replaced with the corresponding section of its consensus sequence and corrected PAS counts and strengths within repeats to reflect changes from the consensus. Significant PAS biases remain after these corrections, yielding this fourth independent predictor (PASTA &#x0005b;Polyadenylation Signal Transcript Analysis&#x0005d;).</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><title>The integrated method: FEAST.</title><p>We implemented the four methods using the same conceptual structure, as follows. First, we obtained log-likelihood ratio parameters for each predictor by genomewide training on annotated known genes. Second, we scanned the whole genome and tabulated local frequencies and orientations for each of the predictors. Third, we calculated for each genomic location four scores representing the significance level of the strand bias; these scores indicate each method's support for a claim of transcription at that genomic location. These four scores are then combined, yielding an integrated predictive score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, we integrated these scores into maximal segments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, predicted to correspond to transcribed regions. FEAST (Fast Empirical Algorithms Suggesting Transcripts) scores are calculated as Z scores analytically calculated from the distribution expected from an independent assortment of randomly oriented predictors, under the assumption that the four combined methods are mutually independent under the null hypothesis that a region is not transcribed (with observed correlations due to uniformly higher expected scores within transcribed regions). Positive scores indicate evidence for transcription on the forward strand; negative scores support transcription on the reverse strand, and small values of either sign indicate the absence of significant orientation biases. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Supporting Information</xref> for a detailed description.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Reanalysis of Known Genes and Gene Predictions</title><p>The FEAST analysis can be used as an independent qualification of known genes and gene predictions, by combining FEAST scores included within the genomic span of each gene. It is important to stress that here we are not comparing two independent sets of transcript predictions but rather calculating FEAST scores for transcribed regions as predicted by other methods, and predicting just the transcript orientation based on our log-likelihood model. We performed this calculation for all known genes in the human genome, excluding those for which an overlapping antisense transcript has been annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This analysis shows that the FEAST method typically requires more than 10 kb of sequence to identify the transcript's orientation: a significant positive score (Z &#x0003e; 2) was obtained for only 8&#x00025; of the genes shorter than 10 kb, rising to 86&#x00025; for genes longer than 100 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g003">Figure 3</xref>, top left). Conversely, incorrect orientation identifications (Z &#x0003c; &#x02212;2) were made for 1.4&#x00025; of genes shorter than 10 kb but for only 3&#x00025; of genes longer than 100 kb. Therefore, a useful property of FEAST is that longer transcribed regions typically produce higher scores, making this approach useful for identification of large genes with long introns. Such genes are particularly difficult to identify using current computational gene prediction methodologies.</p><p>We observed some extremely negative scores for some annotated genes, typically indicating errors in the annotation. For example, the AF118089 transcript spanning the range chr1:88,617,147&#x02013;88,738,864 (q&#x02192;p strand) was assigned a FEAST score of &#x02212;37.4. This transcript in fact corresponds to the reverse strand of the first nine exons of the <italic>PRKCL2</italic> gene and likely represents a clerical error. Some of the observed negative scores may indicate actual transcription on the reverse strand of those genes.</p><p>We similarly calculated FEAST scores for all GenScan, Twinscan, and AceView annotations in the human genome and found them to be largely in agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g003">Figure 3</xref>, right) while preserving the trend of higher scores for longer genes. When considering only gene models not overlapping known genes, the rate of agreement was significantly lower, particularly for GenScan. This suggests that a combined method accepting input from ab initio and FEAST-like sensors might have a lower error rate by virtue of combining additional sources of information.</p><p>Finally, we applied the FEAST algorithms to qualify experimentally derived gene structures, as represented in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; by the rnaCluster and mgcGenes tracks. These respectively denote gene boundaries deduced from clustering spliced ESTs and mRNAs against the genome and cDNA clones from the Mammalian Gene Collection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We again found that longer gene structures are typically recognized at higher levels of certainty by FEAST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g003">Figure 3</xref>, center and bottom left). Importantly, the success rate was only moderately lower when excluding gene structures overlapping those in the knownGenes track on which the FEAST method was trained; e.g., for 69&#x00025; of rnaCluster entries not corresponding to known genes, the orientation was properly predicted by FEAST, with only 4.3&#x00025; being mispredicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Whole-Genome Transcript Prediction</title><p>We implemented a variation on the maximal segment analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; to translate genome-wide FEAST scores into specific transcript predictions. When using a Z score cutoff of 2, this analysis yielded a set of 13,623 human genomic regions predicted to be transcribed, with a median size of 81 kb and covering 1,521.3 Mb of genomic sequence. Using a more stringent cutoff (Z &#x0003d; 3) FEAST identifies 6,579 regions with a median size of 138 kb and encompassing 1,132.1 Mb. In contrast, the training set of known transcripts included 19,449 regions totaling just 1,078.4 Mb. This suggests that the current implementation of FEAST yields predictions that (1) miss short genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g002">Figure 2</xref>), (2) correspond to known genes but extend further than annotated, (3) merge separate genes into combined predictions, and/or (4) reveal novel large transcribed regions.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Extensions.</title><p>We aligned the known genes at their start and end positions and studied the average FEAST values surrounding gene boundaries. As expected, the observed scores outside the transcripts are low while those within transcripts are significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The transition at the beginning of genes is much sharper than that observed at their ends, consistent with well-defined transcription start sites and less sharply defined termination signals. We also observed an apparent linear decay in scores from gene start to gene end. The same pattern is obtained when studying expressed mRNAs and ESTs (rnaCluster track). A related but different pattern is observed when analyzing the boundaries of gene predictions, e.g., by Twinscan. According to our analysis, transcripts are expected to extend further than predicted, particularly toward the 5&#x02032; end.

As a general rule, location between two similarly oriented genes appears to be strongly predictive of intergenic transcription on the same strand, e.g., 52&#x00025; for intergenic segments in the 10-to 100-kb range, versus 28&#x00025; for the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).

In this case, &#x0201c;known genes&#x0201d; collates annotated genes and predictions from the knownGene and the ensEmbl tracks in the UCSC database. While the median length of the FEAST predictions is approximately 50 kb, many are less than 20 kb long. A more stringent cutoff (Z &#x02265; 3) yields 1,293 predictions, with median size of approximately 130 kb. Some of the FEAST predictions may encompass more than one gene each, and we expect many of the predictions with Z scores between 2 and 3 to represent novel genes. Our analysis of the whole human genome suggests the potential existence of thousands of heretofore-unidentified genes.</p><p>Several of the new predictions have been confirmed by gene annotations that were introduced at a later stage, i.e., they did not contribute to the training set. For example, a 112-kb-long prediction in 19q13.42 (Z &#x0003d; 8.8) corresponds to a recently published microRNA (miRNA) cluster &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

By collating 2,162,170 transcribed fragments (&#x0201c;transfrags&#x0201d;) from 11 experiments, we created a nonredundant set of 503,650 transfrags, of which 260,628 are already included within known genes.

Taking into account that the novel FEAST predictions span only 25.8&#x00025; of the chromosomal sequence outside known genes, FEAST predictions are very significantly enriched in novel transfrags (Z &#x0003e; 61, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>). A significant enrichment was observed for all the chromosomes except the very highly annotated chr19 and chr22. The strongest enrichment ratios were observed for chrY, chr13, and chr21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We next considered the possibility that the genomic tiling data may include noise in the form of scattered, spurious transfrags. We therefore clustered the transfrags by joining those separated by less than 1 kb of unique sequence (i.e., excluding interspersed repeats) and using maximal linkage. We excluded all resulting clusters less than 5 kb long, which yielded 14,302 clusters including 311,441 transfrags. Ninety percent of the clusters include four to 50 transfrags each, with a typical constituency of ten transfrags per cluster. As for the unfiltered data, the novel FEAST predictions for all chromosomes are significantly enriched in transfrags except for chr19 and chr22. Interestingly, filtering disjoint transfrags from the data set increases the enrichment ratios, particularly for chr7, chr13, chr21, and chrY (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared the enrichment ratios observed when partitioning the transfrags by source: polyA&#x0002b; versus polyA&#x02212; and cytoplasmic versus nuclear.

The resulting visualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g005">Figure 5</xref>) reveals three main clusters: one including the observed RNA structures and all methods involving curation, a second one including the ab initio and hybrid gene prediction methods, and, finally, a more dispersed cluster including the FEAST components. These results suggest that the FEAST predictions identify a different subset of genes than established gene prediction methods and that a future integrated method incorporating ab initio gene structure prediction, database comparisons and transcriptional side effects could provide a much closer unsupervised approximation to the observed mRNA (transcriptome) data. A similar analysis including randomized versions of the same annotations indicates that the results of FEAST analysis are nevertheless similar in nature to those obtained by other methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020018-sg009">Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Experimental Testing</title><p>We performed an initial experimental validation for some of the newly predicted novel transcribed regions.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title><italic>CPHL1:</italic> A novel ceruloplasmin-related gene.</title><p>Ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) is a medically important metalloprotein that evolved by internal tandem triplication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

Some divergent genes may be difficult to discover by experimental observation of transcripts if their range of expression is restricted to one or a few cell types or if they are expressed at very low levels. It is significantly more difficult to identify and produce correct models of genes with extremely long introns or short exons or that have diverged extensively from other genes; this is particularly true for genes that do not code for proteins. Such genes would be composed almost entirely of intronic sequence and could be practically &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; to current computational gene prediction methods.</p><p>We found that transcribed sequences hold significant information about the direction of transcription, in the form of significant orientation biases of (1) nucleotide composition, (2) mutations within interspersed repeats, (3) the interspersed repeats themselves, and (4) PASs. We implemented and integrated four algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Greens and CHOWDER rely on biases introduced by transcription in the germline, but the generality of the skews suggests that this includes a large fraction of the genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. ROAST and PASTA reflect functional transcription in both autosomal and germline tissues. The observed skews are evidence for sustained transcription over evolutionary time, and are not caused by &#x0201c;transcriptional noise,&#x0201d; i.e., indiscriminate transcription of random regions of the genome, that complicate the interpretation of most experimentally based transcript identification methods.</p><p>For the purpose of the current work, interspersed repeats have two interesting characteristics. First, since copies generally do not adopt a function within the genome, they accumulate substitutions in a neutral fashion. The availability of sufficient copies allows for a relatively accurate reconstruction of the element sequence at the time of integration, while comparison of the extant copies against these &#x0201c;consensus sequences&#x0201d; gives an accurate account of the frequency spectrum of neutral substitutions. These data have, for example, been used to derive log-odds matrices for comparison of interspersed repeats to a consensus database in the program RepeatMasker as well as for the alignment of genomic sequences of different mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. We exploit this aspect of interspersed repeats by measuring the strand-specific substitution biases in repeats (CHOWDER) and the changes in PAS strength (PASTA) to predict the presence and orientation of a transcribed region. Second, while decayed interspersed repeats are generally relatively inert, except for promoting homologous recombination, at the time of integration they contain functional transcription regulatory signals that can affect nearby gene transcription, as exemplified by the discovery of oncogenes constitutively expressed from nearby retroviral LTR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Probably mostly because of transcriptional disruption by their PAS, LINE and LTR elements are underrepresented in the forward orientation of genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the nature of the interaction of other interspersed repeats with genes is less clear, their distribution is nonrandom with respect to the location of genes as well. Notably, the location of lineage specific (and therefore independently accumulated) SINEs in different mammals is remarkably similar &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the distribution pattern of repeats harbors significant information concerning the location of genes. We have utilized this aspect to infer transcription unit locations, by quantifying the abundance of each type of repeat in the forward and reverse strand of genes. The data were stratified by GC level, to accommodate the large-scale correlation of repeat densities with isochores.</p><p>The &#x0201c;transcriptional footprints&#x0201d; described here have some conceptual similarity to &#x0201c;content&#x0201d; methods like coding potential and coding sequence compositional biases. While those are limited to coding exons, the signal of transcriptional footprints can be observed throughout the length of the transcript, the vast majority of which is usually intronic in nature. Furthermore, while the &#x0201c;content&#x0201d; methods detect deviations from the sequence composition expected under a random model, the FEAST methods detect significant strand biases of selected signals, regardless of their absolute frequency. A generalized linear model for transcript detection was published &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, integrating nucleotide skews and some repeat densities (not strand biases). S&#x000e9;mon and Duret used a 20-kb sliding window approach to identify putatively transcribed regions but found their method to be insufficiently accurate for automatic gene prediction.</p><p>The basic model underlying the four FEAST methods assumes the accumulation in introns and UTRs of strand-biased signals arising as side effects of transcription. Several deviations from this model can be postulated: (1) a significant proportion of the genomic region included in a gene might not be transcribed, as is the case for somatic rearranging immune loci; (2) antisense overlapping transcripts may lead to partial signal cancellation; and (3) a gene may have long coding exons, or a large number of exons separated by short introns. Furthermore, the statistical model used assumes independence between the observed signals, which may not be true for (4) arrays of tandemly duplicated sequences or (5) interspersed repeats &#x0201c;homing&#x0201d; into similar repeats, e.g., Alu &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, sensitivity may suffer if there is insufficient signal, e.g., for (6) short genes or (7) evolutionarily new transcribed regions, or if the signal was lost by (8) inversions within the introns or other genomic rearrangements. Conversely, (9) decaying pseudogenes derived from genomic duplications may yield spurious signals. Most of these model deviations are expected to lead to false negatives, suggesting that FEAST may be underpredicting the number and/or the extent of genes.</p><p>In the current implementation of FEAST, the four algorithms are combined with equal weights, except for Greens and CHOWDER being weighted according to the repeat fraction. This will be improved in future versions by identifying context-dependent optimal weights for the different algorithms. Since the mutation-based methods refer to germline expression but the selection-based methods reflect functional importance at any developmental stage, additional functional information could be obtained by using different combinations of the four algorithms. Finally, a promising area for future development is the joint gene prediction on orthologous regions, by collating biases accrued independently in different species lineages.</p><p>Sequence-based gene prediction has long been dominated by methods based on modeling gene structure and sequence comparisons, followed by extensive expert curation. It might have appeared impossible to detect genes from genomic sequence without identifying splicing signals or sequence conservation and not even relying on the genomic localization of experimentally observed expressed sequences. We presented here a third basic concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g009">Figure 9</xref>), i.e., the genomic effects of sustained transcription, and four transcript prediction algorithms based on it. It is important to stress that the methods described here differ from conventional gene prediction methods in that they do not lead to detailed prediction of the intron-exon structure of the predicted genes but rather identify the overall extent and orientation of the transcribed regions. To achieve a complete gene model, further analyses are required.</p><p>In addition to yielding hypotheses for correcting 5&#x02032; incomplete gene annotations and novel independent predictions, many of which cannot be detected by gene structure or similarity, the new algorithms are complementary to existing methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020018-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We therefore expect these tools to add valuable information when integrated with the algorithms based on gene structure and sequence similarity, as a further step toward achieving the sensitivity and specificity required for fully automated whole-genome annotation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Overview of computational analyses.</title><p>We analyzed the human genomic sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020018-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

This method is akin to the &#x0201c;substitution rate&#x0201d; method described by Green et al. but is applied to the content of interspersed repeats. Since most repeats cannot be assumed to have approached mutational equilibrium, the method used here is empirical. We excluded from the analysis CpG mutations and tabulated only isolated mutations, defined as those for which the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; neighboring sites were identical between the repeat consensus and the extant sequence. We defined the orientation of a mutation as that in which a purine has mutated. For example, a mutation changing a forward-strand C in the consensus sequence to a T in the extant sequence is considered instead a change from a reverse-strand G into an A. Thus, instead of 12 possible mutations, we considered six possible mutations, each with two possible orientations.
