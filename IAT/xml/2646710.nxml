We examined if this neuroplasticity modulates behavioral hypersensitivity by regulating spinal glutamatergic neurotransmission in injury-free transgenic mice overexpressing the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins in neuronal tissues. The transgenic mice exhibited hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation (allodynia) similar to the spinal nerve ligation injury model. Intrathecally delivered antagonists for <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) and &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptors, but not for the metabotropic glutamate receptors, caused a dose-dependent allodynia reversal in the transgenic mice without changing the behavioral sensitivity in wild-type mice. This suggests that elevated spinal Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>mediates allodynia through a pathway involving activation of selective glutamate receptors. To determine if this is mediated by enhanced spinal neuronal excitability or pre-synaptic glutamate release in deep-dorsal horn, we examined wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neuron excitability with extracellular recording and glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents with whole-cell patch recording in deep-dorsal horn of the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>transgenic mice. Our data indicated that overexpression of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>in neuronal tissues led to increased frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature excitatory post synaptic currents mediated mainly by AMPA/kainate receptors at physiological membrane potentials, and also by NMDA receptors upon depolarization, without changing the excitability of WDR neurons to high intensity stimulation. Together, these findings support a mechanism of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-mediated spinal sensitization in which elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>causes increased pre-synaptic glutamate release that leads to reduced excitation thresholds of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons to innocuous stimuli. This spinal sensitization mechanism may mediate at least partially the neuropathic pain states derived from increased pre-synaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic pain derived from nerve injuries, or neuropathic pain, is a common clinical problem affecting over 50 million people in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Neuropathic pain may manifest as spontaneous pain, pain resulting from stimuli that are normally innocuous (allodynia), and increased pain responses to suprathreshold stimuli (hyperalgesia), all of which affect adversely the quality of patients' daily-life. Unfortunately, neuropathic pain tends to be long-term, and difficult to manage due to the poor efficacies and severe side effects associated with current conventional analgesic treatments. It appears that neuropathic pain with various etiologies can lead to similar behavioral endpoints that response differentially to pharmacological agents, suggesting that different mechanisms may underlie specific neuropathic pain states deriving from different pathological conditions. Thus, the development of target specific, safe and effective agents for neuropathic pain management relies on new insights into mechanisms of different neuropathic pain states.</p><p>Findings from previous studies have indicated that peripheral nerve injury induces a dramatic upregulation of the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) &#x003b1;2&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>subunit (Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>) in sensory neurons and spinal dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which correlates with neuropathic pain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Knocking down of injury-induced Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>upregulation in dorsal spinal cord with intrathecal antisense oligodeoxynucleotides results in allodynia reversal in spinal nerve injured rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>in neuronal tissue display tactile allodynia similar to nerve injury models that can be blocked by intrathecal gabapentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a drug that binds to the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and has anti-neuropathic pain properties in patients and experimental animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, blocking axonal transport of injury-induced Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>from DRG neurons to their pre-synaptic terminals in spinal dorsal horn diminishes tactile allodynia in nerve-injured animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>likely contributes to behavioral hypersensitivity through a pre-synaptic mechanism at the spinal cord level. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested directly.</p><p>Since elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>in the transgenic mice has been shown to cause dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability, behavioral hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; enhanced glutamate neurotransmission is an important mediator in neuropathic pain processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; and elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>may modulate various calcium channels that are known to regulate spinal pre-synaptic neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we examined if elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>mediated deep-dorsal horn neuron excitability and behavioral hypersensitivity through activation of glutamate receptors, and if so, whether it was mediated by a pre-synaptic or post-synaptic mechanism. We tested these hypotheses in the injury-free Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-overexpressing transgenic mouse model showing dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability and behavioral hypersensitivity without the influence from other nerve injury factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A similar tactile allodynia state is developed in spinal nerve injured mice and injury-free Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>transgenic mice</title><p>Our previous studies have indicated that unilateral spinal nerve ligation (SNL) induces upregulation of the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>subunit in DRG and spinal dorsal horn that plays a critical role in tactile allodynia development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, nerve injury may also induce altered expression of other factors and activation of other pathways independent of the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>induction, which may also contribute to tactile allodynia development. To determine if injury-induced Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>alone is sufficient to induce tactile allodynia, we examined the behavioral response of transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins in neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar to the SNL mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> left), the injury-free Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>TG mice also developed a similar allodynic state compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, right). Since other factors in these two models, e.g. other injury-induced factors in the SNL model and compensatory factors in the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>TG mice, are not likely the same, these data support that elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>is highly likely a common factor mediating the abnormal sensations seen in these two models. This is supported by the findings that the tactile allodynia in both models can be blocked by treatment with intrathecal gabapentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which binds to the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in spinal cord and DRG correlates with tactile allodynia in spinal nerve ligated and injury-free Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>TG mice</bold>.

In the presence of CNQX (10 &#x003bc;M), the frequency of NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs, recorded at a holding potential of +50 mV, was also increased in the TG neurons (WT: 0.03 &#x000b1; 0.02 Hz, n = 5; TG: 0.12 &#x000b1; 0.01, n = 3). However, the amplitudes of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor mediated mEPSCs were about the same between the WT and TG neurons. In addition, the kinetics of the AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor mediated mEPSCs showed no obvious difference between the WT and TG neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

Since cellular changes in spinal cord and DRG after a prolonged peripheral nerve injury include altered expression of large numbers of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], multiple factors induced by nerve injury may contribute to neuropathic hypersensitivity. In an attempt to study if upregulated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>is sufficient to mediate behavioral hypersensitivity, and if so, what is the underlying mechanism, we have generated TG mice overexpressing Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>in neuronal tissues and compared their behavioral sensitivity to mechanical stimulation with the SNL model. Our data indicated that the TG mice have tactile allodynia similar to that observed in the SNL model. Since similar behavioral hypersensitivity and increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression occur in both models, and other factors such as compensatory changes in the TG mice and other injury-induced factors in the SNL model are not likely the same, our data, while do not allow the complete exclusion of other factors, strongly support that increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins are sufficient in mediating tactile allodynia observed in these models.</p><p>The pharmacology profiles in allodynia reversal by the spinally delivered, selective glutamate receptor antagonists are consistent with the pharmacology profiles of allodynia reversal by these agents in the SNL model as reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These data suggest that increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>mediates allodynia through a pathway related to a selective activation of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. In contrast, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, AP3, was without effect in allodynia reversal. This is consistent with the notion that metabotropic glutamate receptors are mainly involved in acute and persistent pain states associated with input from afferent C-fibers, but less so on tactile allodynia likely mediated by input from A&#x003b2; fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Since the TG mice have elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>in different neuronal tissues ranging from DRG in the peripheral to spinal cord and supraspinal cord locations in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], it is possible that increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in peripheral as well as central locations in the TG mice contributes to the behavioral hypersensitivity through a glutamate receptor-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the enhanced dorsal horn neuronal excitability could derive from altered pre-synaptic neurotransmission, intrinsic post-synaptic neuron excitability or descending modulation from supra-spinal locations in the TG mice. While our data do not allow the exclusion of potential contributions to tactile allodynia by activated AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors at supra-spinal locations in the TG mice, Chaplan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that only spinal, but not i.c.v., injection of NMDA receptor antagonists reversed injury-induced allodynia in the SNL model. This suggests that activation of a spinal glutamatergic pathway is critical in the development of neuropathic pain states post peripheral nerve injury.</p><p>Data from this study further demonstrate that, in contrast to the enhanced excitability of TG WDR neurons to natural stimuli reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], acutely evoked excitability of WDR neurons to C-fiber-strength electric stimulation is not altered in the TG mice. While mechanisms underlying this discrepancy are not clear, the simplest explanation is that detected WDR neuron excitability to natural stimuli derives from neuronal activation by inputs from multiple sensory fibers including A-fibers, and elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression results in a higher excitability of the WDR neuron to A-fiber-, but not C-fiber-, strength stimulation (see discussion below). Thus, it is likely that increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression mediates tactile allodynia through a Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-dependent pathway by enhancing synaptic strength of A-fibers. Indeed, this hypothesis is consistent with reported findings that: (a) The basal level of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression is relatively high in small DRG neurons, low in large DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and there is a dramatic increase in Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in large DRG neurons after SNL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or in the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>TG mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; (b) increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression correlates with development of allodynia mainly mediated by large A&#x003b2; fibers, but not formalin- and carrageenan-induced acute pain states mainly mediated by nociceptive C-fiber inputs in the TG mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and formalin- or carrageenan-induced pain models do not have increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in DRG and spinal cord (data not shown); (c) increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in the TG mice does not alter the receptive field sizes of WDR neurons, nor the excitability of these neurons to repetitive C-fiber stimulation (wind-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; (d) In the model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury with increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a subpopulation of dorsal horn neurons exhibits abnormal afterdischarges to mechanical and thermal stimuli, but the number of dorsal horn neurons showing wind-up phenomenon to repetitive C-fiber stimulation remains unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The increase in frequency of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor mediated mEPSCs in deep dorsal horn neurons from the TG mice suggests that elevated spinal Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins lead to an increased rate of quanta release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from pre-synaptic terminals at the resting state, which in turn, enhances excitability of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons through mainly AMPA/kainate receptor activation. Since the deep dorsal horn neurons for in vitro and vivo recordings were selected from a similar dorsal horn lamina, and very few non-WDR neurons (which were excluded) were detected in this lamina during neuron sampling in vivo, it is highly likely that a similar population of WDR neurons was examined in our in vivo and in vitro recording. Our data indicate that elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins do not change the amplitudes of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs. This suggests that neither the quantum size of glutamate release nor the intrinsic excitability of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons to glutamate receptor activation is changed by increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression. Direct measurements of glutamate release in deep dorsal horn and membrane excitability of WDR neurons from TG mice would further help to clarify these issues.</p><p>It remains elusive that AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists only normalize behavioral hypersensitivity in the TG mice without affecting the behavioral sensitivity in the WT mice significantly. It is likely that binding of glutamate to AMPA receptors at a resting state causes a conformational change of the receptors that is linked to channel opening followed by desensitization of the receptors, a mechanism controlling glutamate-induced neuron activation under normal physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is possible that DNQX has lower binding affinity to AMPA receptors at the conformation under physiological conditions, thus, is less effective in blocking AMPA receptors. In the transgenic mice or under a pathological condition in which pre-synaptic glutamate release is enhanced, the AMPA receptor channels could be in a different conformational state due to partial membrane depolarization and channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], a primed state as suggested in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>. DNQX could have a higher affinity to this state, thus, be more effective in blocking AMPA receptors in the TG mice or pathological conditions. Alternatively, glutamate activation of kainate receptors at the pre-synaptic sensory neuron terminals can reduce glutamate release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and that at spinal interneurons can induce inhibitory transmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which together help to terminate transient activation of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons under normal physiological conditions. This heterosynaptic regulation is transient due to kainate receptor desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is possible that this heterosynaptic regulation is less sensitive to DNQX. However, in the TG mice or under a pathological condition in which pre-synaptic glutamate release is enhanced, prolonged activation of kainate receptors at inhibitory interneurons can enhance GABA release that may activate pre-synaptic GABA<sub>B </sub>autoreceptors, which in turn, reduces potential-dependent inhibitory transmitter release and causes disinhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is possible that DNQX is more effective in blocking this prolonged activation of kainate receptors. Finally, it is possible that the WT mice are relatively insensitive to (A&#x003b2;-mediated) mechanical stimulation, possibly due to the low level Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in large neurons as discussed previously, so that it is difficult to detect any change in mechanical sensitivity. These possibilities may be not mutually exclusive.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed mechanism of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-mediated spinal hypersensitivity</bold>.

Under normal conditions, the Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression level and quantum release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from pre-synaptic A-fiber terminals is low so that post-synaptic deep dorsal horn neurons maintain a normal excitation threshold. As a consequence, glutamate release in response to stimuli results in a physiological activation of deep dorsal horn neurons mainly by activating AMPA/kainate receptors. The Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression level at C-fiber terminals is relatively high (causing a ceiling effect for C-fiber activation), but there is little C-fiber input onto deep dorsal horn neurons at a resting state. <bold>B</bold>. Under a pathological condition with an elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-level at the A-fiber pre-synaptic terminals, such as post peripheral nerve injuries, the quantum release of glutamate from these terminals at a resting membrane potential is dramatically enhanced. This glutamate "leaking" causes a partial depolarization of post-synaptic deep dorsal horn neurons by activating AMPA/kainate receptors. As a consequence, these primed deep dorsal horn neurons have lowered excitation thresholds to subsequently evoked glutamate release, and also hyperexcitability due to lowered thresholds to NMDA receptor activation. Neither the partial depolarization of deep dorsal horn neurons nor the increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in C-fiber terminals has any detectable effect to high intensity C-fiber stimulations. <bold>C</bold>.

The Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression levels in small DRG neurons and C-fiber terminals are relatively high, but may have little effect on glutamate release from C-fiber terminals at a resting state due to the lack of C-fiber inputs. This high level of basal Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in small DRG neurons may set up a ceiling effect for the influence of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>on WDR neuron excitability to C-fiber or windup stimulations (discussed below).</p><p>Mild pre-synaptic membrane depolarization in response to an action potential leads to the opening of VGCC, triggering calcium influx and a quantum release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Binding of glutamate to post-synaptic AMPA receptors at a resting state causes a conformational change of the receptors that is linked to channel opening, which is terminated by desensitization of the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, glutamate activation of kainate receptors at the pre-synaptic sensory neuron terminals can reduce glutamate release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and that at spinal interneurons can induce inhibitory transmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This heterosynaptic regulation, which is transient due to kainate receptor desensitization, also plays a role in terminating transient activation of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons under normal physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, released glutamate is insufficient in activating post-synaptic NMDA receptors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).</p><p>After peripheral nerve injuries, injury-induced Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>upregulation in DRG neurons, more so in large DRG neurons, leads to increased axonal transport of Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>proteins to central pre-synaptic terminals, which in turn causes an increased rate of basal release of glutamate through a yet identified mechanism. This "glutamate leaking" causes partial sensitization of deep dorsal horn neurons by activating mainly AMPA/kainate receptors at the resting state. These "sensitized" dorsal horn neurons therefore have lowered excitation thresholds to a subsequent release of glutamate in response to innocuous or mild nociceptive stimuli that could evoke further conformational change of the AMPA/kainate receptors and prolonged channel opening, leading to spinal hyperexcitability. In addition, signals of mild noxious stimulation could be further amplified in these sensitized dorsal horn neurons due to their low thresholds to NMDA receptor activation, leading to exaggerated painful sensations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). These hyperexcitability states are sensitive to antagonists of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. However, neither the partial neuron sensitization by glutamate leaking from A-fiber terminals nor the increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression in C-fiber terminals has any detectable effect on WDR neuron excitability to high intensity C-fiber stimulations (the ceiling effect discussed above).</p><p>The detail mechanisms regarding how elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>mediates enhanced pre-synaptic glutamate release remain elusive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Based on in vitro data indicating that Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>expression is required for normal membrane expression of functional VGCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which is critical in mediating pre-synaptic neurotransmission, it is possible that elevated Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>leads to an enhanced VGCC expression at the pre-synaptic terminals. However, there is no direct evidence so far to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, recent findings in drosophila point to the direction that Ca<sub>v&#x003b1;2&#x003b4; </sub>plays a critical role in formation of pre-synaptic structures and active zones related to pre-synaptic neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indeed, it has been proposed that the ability of descending excitatory 5HT3 mediated projections to induce a state-dependency in the actions of gabapentin may also occur with the monoamine receptor interacting with pre-synaptic mechanisms at the spinal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that increased Ca<sub>v</sub>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>1 </sub>causes enhanced synaptic strength and/or synapse numbers by promoting formation of more active zones through a yet identified mechanism.

Depth of the neuron was measured from the surface of the spinal cord and neurons in the deep dorsal horn were visualized with an infrared-differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope (BX50WI; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and a CCD camera. All recordings were performed at 25 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA). During whole-cell recordings, series resistance (8&#x02013;15 M&#x003a9;) was monitored periodically, and cells with &#x0003e; 15% changes were excluded from the analysis. Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 5 kHz using a data-acquisition program (Axograph 4.6; Molecular Devices).</p><p>To record mEPSCs, tetrodotoxin (1 &#x003bc;M) and bicuculline (30 &#x003bc;M) were continuously applied in the bath solution. At a holding potential of -70 mV, the recorded mEPSCs were mainly mediated by AMPA/kainate receptors because application of AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (10 &#x003bc;M) could reduce mEPSCs by 91.3 &#x000b1; 5.3% and 93.9 &#x000b1; 3.3% in WT and TG neurons (n = 5 in each group), respectively. In the presence of CNQX (10 &#x003bc;M), NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of +50 mV.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Indicated significant changes were defined by the two-tailed <italic>p </italic>values as determined with unpaired Student's <italic>t </italic>test, or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DN participated in the design, carried out the behavioral pharmacology studies, and participated in drafting the manuscript.
