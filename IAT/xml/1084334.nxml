Because of the molecular similarity between heme and Mg-Proto, it is reasonable to assume that the cellular machinery used to export heme from the chloroplast may be similar to the machinery used for Mg-Proto export.</p><p>In a search for mutants that affect communication between chloroplasts and the nucleus, a number of mutants, called <italic>gun</italic> mutants, were identified that have defects in plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathways. These plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathways repress the transcription of nuclear genes that encode proteins active in photosynthesis when chloroplast development is blocked &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. A number of <italic>GUN</italic> genes were found to encode factors that participate in Mg-Proto metabolism. Among these were subunits of Mg-chelatase, the enzyme that synthesizes Mg-Proto from protoporphyrin IX (Proto), and indeed, we have shown that buildup of Mg-Proto is a signal that regulates nuclear gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Purification of a GUN4 complex from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> thylakoids revealed that a fraction of GUN4 is tightly associated with GUN5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;, also called ChlH, which is the 140-kDa subunit of Mg-chelatase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Although GUN4 is not essential for Mg-Proto synthesis in vitro or in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> GUN4 is required for chlorophyll accumulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under normal growth conditions, GUN4 binds porphyrins in vitro, and GUN4 stimulates Mg-chelatase in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Thus, GUN4, like GUN5, is a key participant in the generation of a plastid signal. Also, because GUN4 appears to be monomeric or associated with heterogeneous complexes in fractionated chloroplasts, and because GUN4 binds to Mg-Proto more tightly than GUN5 in <italic>Synechocystis,</italic> it is reasonable to expect that GUN4 might perform additional functions in porphyrin metabolism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. For instance, GUN4 might participate in Mg-Proto trafficking or shield Mg-Proto from collisions with molecular oxygen and light, collisions that could result in the production of reactive oxygen species. Alternatively, GUN4 might protect Mg-Proto from catabolic enzymes found in the plastid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;, or it might participate in other tetrapyrrole biosynthetic reactions localized to plastids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To better understand the porphyrin-binding mechanism and Mg-chelatase stimulatory activity of GUN4, we determined the crystal structure of a GUN4 homolog from the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803) and refined the three-dimensional model to 1.78 &#x000c5; resolution. The crystal structure reveals a novel fold that bears no resemblance to known porphyrin-binding proteins. We subsequently used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to map the porphyrin-binding site through analysis of chemical shift data. Quantitative analysis of the putative porphyrin binding site on GUN4 using fluorescence quenching and enzymatic assays has allowed us to determine the energetic contribution of key residues for porphyrin binding, as well as for the enhancement of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation into metal-free porphyrins. Taken together, these data paint a picture of a novel enzymatic cofactor that enhances Mg-Proto biosynthesis and additionally, may play a role in Mg-Proto shuttling and chemical protection within the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement</title><p>The crystallized protein (residues 1&#x02013;233) comprises the entire <italic>Synechocystis</italic> GUN4 (SynGUN4) protein.

The C-terminal domain, which we refer to herein as the GUN4 core domain, is the conserved domain among all GUN4 family members. The N-terminal domain of SynGUN4 is composed of the first five helices of the full-length protein. The &#x003b1;1&#x02032; to &#x003b1;4&#x02032; helices fold into a right-handed, up-and-down helix bundle, and the addition of the &#x003b1;5&#x02032; helix gives the domain an elongated cross-section. Overall, the N-terminal helical bundle is reminiscent in appearance to other entirely helical domains such as the TPR domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d; or the 14&#x02013;3-3 domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The entire helical bundle is held together through a hydrophobic core consisting entirely of centrally located and interdigitated leucines, isoleucines, and valines provided by each helix. In contrast to the N-terminal domain's core, the surface is highly charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Structurally, the &#x003b1;2&#x02032; and &#x003b1;3&#x02032; helices are the linchpins of this tertiary architecture as they bridge one end of the bundle to the other.</p><p>Interestingly, analysis of the known GUN4 sequences from other organisms shows that the N-terminal region is the most highly variable sequence and is unique to only some of the prokaryotic family members. SynGUN4's N-terminal region shares homology with GUN4 family members from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Gracilaria tenuistipitata</named-content> var. <italic>liui, Porphyra purpurea, Nostoc</italic> sp. 7120, <italic>Trichodesmium erythraeum, Anabaena variabilis, Thermosynechococcus elongatus,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Cyanidium caldarium</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The <named-content content-type="genus-species">Cyanidioschyzon merolae</named-content> sequence lacks the N-terminal extension altogether. Additionally, within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice GUN4 sequences, the N-terminal domain is replaced with a chloroplast transit peptide, which is removed upon import into the chloroplast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. What role this N-terminal helical bundle plays within prokaryotes is unknown, but most likely it does not participate in GUN4 functions conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.</p><p>The N-terminal domain links to the C-terminal domain through a long loop (residues 81&#x02013;93) that connects the &#x003b1;5&#x02032; helix of the N-terminal helical bundle to the &#x003b1;1 helix within the GUN4 core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The interaction between the two domains is not extensive and is mediated by van der Waal's interactions between Pro51 and Leu53 from the &#x003b1;4&#x02032; helix and Trp151 and Leu152 from the &#x003b1;4 helix within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen of Gly101 on the &#x003b1;1 helix is within hydrogen bonding distance of Asn60 and Arg63 located on the &#x003b1;4&#x02032; helix. In all, a total of 1,183 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of surface area is buried between the two domains, which suggests that the particular arrangement displayed in the crystal packing may be one of several possible orientations juxtaposing the two domains in solution.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of SynGUN4, the GUN4 core domain, appears to have no currently identified structural homologs, as indicated by a lack of any structural matches from a search of the DALI server &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The GUN4 core domain maintains two distinct architectural regions: a highly structured helical section that forms the majority of the domain, and two loops (&#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 loop and &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop), which constitute one side of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The helices adopt a concave shell shape resembling a &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; on one side of the domain, with the back of the &#x0201c;hand&#x0201d; facing toward the N-terminal helical bundle. Helices &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 extend like a thumb and index finger to form one side of the &#x0201c;cupped hand.&#x0201d; The &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4 helices compose the middle finger of the hand, with the &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 loop forming a knuckle. The &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6 and the &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;8 helices form the remaining fingers, respectively, on the opposite side of the &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; arrangement.</p><p>In total, the helical section constitutes 70&#x00025; of the GUN4 core domain. The buried surface within the concave section of the &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; is highly hydrophobic. Phe105 and Leu116 on the &#x003b1;2 helix; Val135 and Phe138 from the &#x003b1;3 helix; Leu143, Ile146, and Trp150 from the &#x003b1;4 helix; Phe160, Val162, Val166, and Trp167 from the &#x003b1;5 helix; Phe174, Leu177, and Trp178 from the &#x003b1;6 helix; Val218, Ala219, and Tyr223 from the &#x003b1;7 helix; and Trp228 from the &#x003b1;8 helix form an extensive hydrophobic surface or &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the &#x0201c;cupped hand.&#x0201d; Lying loosely across this palm is the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop, which is itself very hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The loop is striking in that it lacks any clear secondary structure, yet it very neatly folds in on itself via van der Waal's interactions between hydrophobic residues. Residues Ile181, Trp183, Trp189, Pro193, Phe196, and Trp198 form a hydrophobic groove within which sits Leu207 and Leu209. The extensive hydrophobicity and intricate arrangement of residues suggest that this loop forms a stable structure that would resist unraveling.</p><p>In contrast to the intraloop packing, only two residues (Pro208 and Leu210) protrude from the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop into the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the GUN4 core domain's &#x0201c;cupped hand.&#x0201d; Mutation of either position to alanine leads to the expression of misfolded protein as determined by inclusion body production in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> during attempted purification of recombinant samples (unpublished data). The necessity of both Pro208 and Leu210 in maintaining protein stability is not surprising, given the lack of interaction between the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop and the &#x0201c;cupped hand.&#x0201d; Analysis of this region of the structure reveals that the juncture of the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop with the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; forms an extended hydrophobic surface that is shielded by the &#x0201c;thumb&#x0201d; (&#x003b1;2 helix) and the &#x0201c;middle finger&#x0201d; (&#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;4 helices). In total, this structural design forms a cavity that is hydrophobic in nature with a volume of about 5,000 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, analysis of 2Fo-Fc electron density maps contoured at 1&#x003c3; reveals several well-ordered water molecules within the confines of the greasy palm, which, given the high degree of hydrophobicity of this space, are unusual.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mapping the Porphyrin Binding Site</title><p>In an effort to determine the binding site for porphyrin within SynGUN4, we used NMR to analyze the full length protein in the absence and presence of Deutero. Comparison of spectra obtained from <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) experiments of SynGUN4 in the absence and presence of 1&#x02013;2 mM Deutero reveals several shifting peaks that were picked with the program CARA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Of the 13 residues that were found to exhibit significant chemical shift perturbations in the presence of Deutero, only two (Tyr59 and Thr72) are located within the nonconserved N-terminal helical bundle domain. Of the remaining residues, three residues (Val135, Val218, and Trp228) form part of the &#x0201c;greasy palm,&#x0201d; six residues (Asn187, Arg191, Trp198, Asp199, Ser201, and Pro208) are localized within the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop, and the remaining two residues (Lys180 and Arg217) form the hinge regions at the ends of the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop. The chemical shifts offer a very precise measure of the chemical environment around the backbone nitrogen atoms at these positions. The observed chemical shift changes upon addition of Deutero suggest that the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop is undergoing a significant conformational change and/or that an electron-rich molecule, such as Deutero, lies within close proximity. As mentioned earlier, the interaction between this &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop and the hydrophobic &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the GUN4 core domain is not extensive, and rearrangements of either or both necessary to accommodate the porphyrin molecule are feasible in both a dynamic and architectural sense. Taken together, the NMR data and the crystal structure strongly suggest that the porphyrin binding region lies within the pocket formed at the intersection of the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop and the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the GUN4 core domain's &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; region.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Deuteroporphyrin IX and Mg-Deuteroporphyrin IX Binding</title><p>First, the affinity of wild-type SynGUN4 for various porphyrins was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

Additionally, SynGUN4's dissociation constants for deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-(4,2) hydroxyethyl-vinyl-(deutero-divinyl) (3.94 &#x000b1; 0.739 &#x003bc;M), hemin (4.73 &#x000b1; 1.16 &#x003bc;M), N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMMP) (11.0 &#x000b1; 0.673 &#x003bc;M) and cobalt (III) protoporphyrin IX (Co-Proto) (2.67 &#x000b1; 0.856 &#x003bc;M) were determined. SynGUN4 displayed the highest affinity for Mg-Deutero and Deutero with a preference for the metal-bound porphyrin. The reported dissociation constants for the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Mg-chelatase enzyme, ChlH, are 1.22 &#x000b1; 0.420 &#x003bc;M for Deutero and 2.43 &#x000b1; 0.460 &#x003bc;M for Mg-Deutero &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Analysis of SynGUN4's affinity for other porphyrins provides a larger context from which to deduce the determinants of binding specificity. Both deuteroporphyrins are smaller than the other porphyrins examined in that they lack two ethylene groups. Hemin and Co-Proto, which closely mimic the size of the naturally occurring substrate Mg-Proto, bind with slightly weaker affinities. This suggests that Mg-Proto and Proto may also bind with slightly weaker affinity then the their Deutero versions. Nonetheless, both hemin and Co-Proto bind as well as deutero-divinyl, which accurately mimics the size of the naturally occurring metal free Proto. This further supports that the less flexible metal bound porphyrins are indeed high affinity ligands for SynGUN4. Interestingly, NMMP, which mimics distorted porphyrins binds with very weak affinity. NMMP is a potent inhibitor of enzymes known to catalyze insertion of metals into porphyrins, including ferrochelatase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. SynGUN4, however, appears to favor the more planar metal-bound porphyrins.</p><p>To quantify the energetic contributions of specific residues in SynGUN4 involved in porphyrin binding, a series of putative porphyrin-binding site mutants were made and dissociation constants were measured. Most of the side chains were mutated to alanine; however, at some positions, other amino acids were investigated to explore the importance of electrostatics, side chain volume, or hydrophobicity in greater detail. Endogenous tryptophan fluorescence quenching of SynGUN4 by Deutero and Mg-Deutero was used to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for all point mutants for which protein could be expressed and purified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030151-t002">Table 2</xref>). Relative values of all the dissociation constants for each mutant were determined by comparing the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of each mutant to that measured for wild-type SynGUN4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><p>Comparison of the relative values for binding to both Deutero and Mg-Deutero shows that the majority of positions affecting binding cluster in neighboring regions of the GUN4 core domain. The positions that appear to be most critical for binding to both porphyrins reside in the &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loops, as well as on the faces of the &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, and &#x003b1;7 helices that form significant parts of the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; within the &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; of SynGUN4. Calculation of the difference between the two sets of the relative <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values shows that certain residues appear to be more important for binding Deutero instead of Mg-Deutero, and vice versa. For example, Val135 and Val218 appear to be essential for Deutero binding but not for Mg-Deutero binding. Alternatively, Ser125, Gln126, Ile146, Phe160, and A219 appear to be essential for specifically involved in binding Mg-Deutero.</p><p>Comparison of Mg-Deutero binding to Deutero binding shows that binding of the metal-bound porphyrin is much more sensitive to changes within the GUN4 core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g005">5</xref>D). This difference most likely reflects the highly specialized architecture involved in binding the more rigid Mg-Deutero.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Modeling of Porphyrin Binding</title><p>Armed with an energy map of relevant positions for porphyrin binding, we generated a model of SynGUN4 bound to Mg-Proto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this model, the porphyrin molecule sits over Leu210 within the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop, deep in the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of SynGUN4. The solvent-exposed section of the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 loops bracket the porphyrin, burying it deep within SynGUN4 core domain. Significantly, the carboxyl moieties of the porphyrin insert between Arg214 and Arg217, which would be complementary to the charge of the carboxylic acid groups extending from the porphyrin scaffold. Analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> ferrochelatase structure bound to NMMP shows that this porphyrin-binding chelatase uses a pair of conserved arginines to bind the carboxyl moieties extending off the porphyrin scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). The Arg214 and Arg217 positions within the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop of SynGUN4 closely resemble the arginine motif found on ferrochelatase, suggesting that this motif in SynGUN4 may function in an analogous fashion upon porphyrin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>Arg214 is absolutely essential for binding to both porphyrins, with both alanine and glutamate substitutions completely abolishing binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030151-t002">Table 2</xref>). Sequence comparisons of plant and bacterial GUN4s show that Arg214 is highly conserved. <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 contains two genes that encode proteins related to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GUN4, previously named SynGUN4b and SynGUN4c, that are less similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GUN4 than is SynGUN4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The SynGUN4b sequence has an asparagine at the Arg214 position, which could functionally substitute for the arginine. The SynGUN4c sequence has a tyrosine at this position, however. This leads us to propose that SynGUN4c does not efficiently bind to Proto or Mg-Proto, but rather may interact with other cellular metabolites.</p><p>An interesting difference between Deutero and Mg-Deutero binding is seen at the Arg217 position. Alanine substitution at this position has no effect on either Deutero or Mg-Deutero binding. However, glutamate substitution at this position drastically reduces affinity for only Mg-Deutero by as much as 15-fold. The Arg217 is not as highly conserved, frequently being replaced by glutamine. The glutamine substitution, however, retains the overall aliphatic nature of the arginine side chain, as well as an amide available for interactions with the carboxyl moiety of Proto or Mg-Proto.</p><p>In an effort to address this difference, NMMP and Mg-Proto were structurally aligned in the putative SynGUN4 porphyrin binding pocket. Analysis of the NMMP molecule shows that one of its corners lies below the plane of the other three. An effort to model NMMP onto Mg-Proto always results in at least one of the four corners of the NMMP molecule lying outside the flattened plane of the porphyrin structural alignment. If the corners that are most buried within the protein are aligned and held fixed, this superpositioning produces a noticeable difference in the position of the carboxyl moieties between the metal-bound and metal-free porphyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Specifically, the position of the carboxyl moiety closest to Arg217 is altered. We propose that the metal-free porphyrins most likely can avoid the electrostatic conflict produced by substituting Arg217 with glutamate through its ability to ruffle or pucker. The metal-bound porphyrin's enforced rigidity does not allow it to avoid electrostatic conflict with the glutamate, which results in a loss of binding affinity. These observations collectively suggest that, although Arg217 is not essential for binding to Mg-Proto, it nonetheless plays some role in selectivity of planar porphyrins.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Enhancing Mg-Chelatase Activity</title><p>The effect of SynGUN4 on the activity of the Mg-chelatase was next investigated. Stoichiometric amounts of SynGUN4 dramatically increased the rate of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation into Deutero, as determined by an increase in fluorescence emission of Mg-Deutero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The apparent Michaelis constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for Deutero was 7.46 &#x000b1; 3.24 &#x003bc;M in a Mg-chelatase reaction containing 200 nM ChlH. The measured <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for Deutero corresponded well with that previously reported for <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 Mg-chelatase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In Mg-chelatase reactions containing SynGUN4, the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for Deutero was 1.48 &#x000b1; 0.371 &#x003bc;M at 200 nM SynGUN4, and 1.65 &#x000b1; 0.357 &#x003bc;M at 400 nM SynGUN4.</p><p>Interestingly, the Mg-chelatase complex from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides,</italic> which carries out anoxygenic photosynthesis and lacks a GUN4 homolog, has a much lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> than that measured for <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Mg-chelatase. This seems to suggest that the development of GUN4 activity coincided with a decrease in the basal catalytic efficiency of the Mg-chelatase complex in the absence of GUN4. Oxygenic phototrophs may require a porphyrin-binding protein such as GUN4 to minimize oxidative stress induced by free Proto and Mg-Proto in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> and bright light. Mg-Proto shielding may be a critical event in the evolution of photosynthesis in oxygen-rich environments.</p><p>Next, each point mutant previously tested for Deutero and Mg-Deutero binding was assayed for its ability to enhance Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation carried out by the Mg-chelatase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Measurements at several time points were analyzed, and the resulting values were compared to the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> determined for SynGUN4 enhancement of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation. Many of the mutants that had no energetic effect on porphyrin binding also did not dramatically affect SynGUN4's stimulatory activity on the holo Mg-chelatase. Several mutants did demonstrate significant effects on enzymatic activity, however. Many of the mutants, not surprisingly, are clustered in the &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loop, including residues that are essential for binding porphyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030151-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Specifically, a region of the &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 loop (Trp129, Leu130, and Tyr131) appears to be essential for Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation. This loop region is moderately important for porphyrin binding as well.</p><p>No mutants deficient in Mg-Proto binding enhanced Mg-chelatase complex activity. These data support a mechanism in which porphyrin binding by SynGUN4 underlies its stimulatory effect on the Mg-chelatase complex. A mechanism in which SynGUN4 stimulates the Mg-chelatase complex by assisting with product release, as opposed to localizing substrates, is further supported by the fact that the Val218 position, which is essential for binding to Deutero but not for Mg-Deutero, had no effect on Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation. The Ala219 position, which is essential for Mg-Deutero binding, did have a significant effect on stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity. Conversely, the Ala219 position is not essential for binding to the metal-free porphyrin.</p><p>Nonetheless, some mutants that had only moderate to no effect on binding appear to dramatically alter enzymatic activity. Among these are two residues (Cys117 and Ile146) within the putative porphyrin binding pocket; one residue (Phe132) on the &#x003b1;3 helix; and Arg217. Serine substitution at the Cys117 position only moderately affects porphyrin binding while completely abolishing Mg-chelatase activity. This cysteine lies directly behind the &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 loop, which has been shown here to be critical for GUN4-assisted Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation activity. The role of the sulfhydryl group in stabilizing loop rearrangements is not fully understood, but clearly, substitution of a hydroxyl group at this position does not suffice to replace wild-type activity.</p><p>Interestingly, mutation of Phe132 to alanine moderately affects binding to both porphyrins. Mutation to tyrosine and tryptophan restores normal binding activity. Nonetheless, the tryptophan mutation at this position has severely compromised enzymatic activity. This suggests that this section of SynGUN4 may modulate interactions with the Mg-chelatase complex. The more bulky hydrophobic groups may help to shield the Arg217-porphyrin interaction from the solvent. However, a too-large side chain at this position, such as a tryptophan, may prevent the GUN4 &#x02022; Mg-chelatase interactions necessary to assist in product release from the chelatase enzyme. Finally, the Arg217 substitution to alanine abolishes GUN4's stimulatory effect on the Mg-chelatase complex while having no apparent effect on binding of either Deutero or Mg-Deutero to GUN4. This suggests that Arg217 plays a role in the selection of chelatase products that is dependent on the presence of the chelatase enzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mg-Proto accumulation is a plastid signal that regulates the expression of a large number of nuclear genes encoding proteins localized to the chloroplast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our results are consistent with GUN4 having a photoprotective role within the chloroplast. Biophysical and biochemical data support a model wherein the hydrophobic &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the GUN4 core domain, formed by helices that comprise the fingers of the &#x0201c;cupped hand,&#x0201d; wrap around the porphyrin molecule, potentially shielding it from the bulk solvent of the plant or bacterial cell. Our model suggests that porphyrins are buried deep within the GUN4 core domain, where they would be protected from collisions with molecular oxygen. The unique &#x0201c;cupped hand&#x0201d; fold of the GUN4 core domain could serve as a novel vehicle for shuttling porphyrin within the chloroplast while inhibiting cellular damage caused by porphyrin-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species formed in the presence of bright light and oxygen.</p><p>In addition to shielding porphyrin from the oxygen-rich environment of the cell, GUN4 also appears to be a necessary component of the Mg-chelatase in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. For example, in <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus,</italic> which carries out anoxygenic photosynthesis, bacteriochlorophyll synthesis is rapidly shut down in the presence of molecular oxygen and bright light by a mechanism that involves both gene repression and Mg-chelatase inhibition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Under these conditions, the largest subunit of <named-content content-type="genus-species">R. capsulatus</named-content> Mg-chelatase, BchH, forms covalent adducts with bound Proto, which inactivates the enzyme &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

The largest subunit of the Mg-chelatase complex from both <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> (BchH) and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (ChlH) bind to both Mg-Proto and Proto, as well as to their analogs, Mg-Deutero and Deutero. However, in contrast to ClhH, BchH binds to the metal-free porphyrin (Deutero) with higher affinity than to Mg-Deutero. It is possible that GUN4 enables ChlH to bind Mg-Proto tightly, like BchH, while simultaneously providing photoprotective functions required for species that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis.</p><p>Distortion of metal-bound porphyrin molecules requires more energy (65&#x02013;130 kJ/mole) than is needed to distort metal-free porphyrins (48 kJ/mole) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In ferrochelatase, once the metal ion is inserted, the porphyrin becomes much more difficult to bend, leading to a decrease in ferrochelatase affinity and ultimately leading to metallized porphyrin release. Conversely, GUN5 maintains some affinity for its metal-containing porphyrin products, creating a potentially deleterious situation in which inhibitory adducts form under conditions of oxygenic photosynthesis. This energetic observation suggests a mechanism in which GUN4 assists in product release from the Mg-chelatase enzyme through its preference for the more planar and rigid Mg-Proto species. In turn, GUN4 may prevent the formation of covalent adducts between the largest subunit of the Mg-chelatase and bound porphyrins in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms by stimulating product release while additionally protecting the Mg-chelatase enzyme active site from molecular oxygen and/or bright light. The mechanism in which SynGUN4 stimulates the Mg-chelatase complex by assisting with product release is supported by the fact that the Val218 position, which is essential for binding to Deutero but not Mg-Deutero had no effect on Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> incorporation, whereas the Ala219 position, which is essential for Mg-Deutero binding, did have a significant effect on stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity.</p><p>The question arises as to how GUN4 discriminates between different metal-bound porphyrins. Quantum mechanical calculations predict that the energy required to distort porphyrin bound to Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are nearly equivalent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The implication of this calculation is that both metals distort the porphyrin scaffold equally and confer comparable rigidity upon the tetrapyrrole once either metal cation is inserted. The biophysical models, and the observation that GUN4 binds porphyrins containing different metal ions with different affinities, intimate the existence of a mechanism mediating preferential selection of specific metal-bound porphyrins based on the bound cation rather than on any structural differences exerted by the metal onto the porphyrin scaffold. Although we were unable to test Mg-Proto directly because of its decreased solubility (unpublished data), we were able to determine that Co-Proto binds with higher affinity than hemin. This in vitro experiment further suggests that, indeed, there may be some intrinsic difference between metal-bound porphyrins that SynGUN4 is able to distinguish. Copurification with GUN5 and the lower <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for Mg-Deutero suggest that GUN4 functions specifically in Mg-porphyrin biosynthesis and trafficking, but currently we cannot rule out a role for GUN4 in the biosynthesis and trafficking of porphyrins that contain other metals (e.g., heme).</p><p>Other porphyrin-binding proteins have been described, among them the mammalian mitochondrial (peripheral-type) benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) from <named-content content-type="genus-species">R. sphaeroides</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

What is notable from the sequence alignment is that the homology is clustered in the helical regions. More specifically, many of the residues that constitute the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the cupped hand of the GUN4 core domains are conserved. Additionally, the Arg214 position is conserved, which is consistent with the purported ability of PBR and TspO to bind to Proto. Both of these proteins are thought to exist as integral membrane transport proteins consisting of five helices. Indeed, only four of the five predicted helical regions show homology to those of GUN4. Notably, the homologous regions are critically involved in porphyrin binding in GUN4. Additionally, PBR and TspO lack the &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;8 helices seen in SynGUN4, which, if absent, would create a significant pore through the GUN4 architecture.

Moreover, the combined use of NMR and x-ray crystallography viewed in the context of subsequent quantitative analysis of porphyrin binding allowed us to propose a mechanism for porphyrin sequestration by GUN4 and GUN4-like proteins. Together, these structural and energetic analyses form a solid foundation for understanding GUN4 activity, and they add to our understanding of the role of GUN4 in the stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity, as well as in Mg-Proto retrograde signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Cloning, mutagenesis, and purification</title><p>The SynGUN4 used in these studies was isolated from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> genomic DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d; and was subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites in the pHIS8&#x02013;3 vector &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030151-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States) and cells were grown at 37 &#x000b0;C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8.

The x-fold change in the magnitude of the affinity of Deutero for each mutant is color-coded, as depicted by the scale shown at the bottom. Most amino acid changes did not alter binding affinity, as shown by the preponderance of light blue. Of the mutations that measurably alter binding affinity, the majority reside on the &#x0201c;greasy palm&#x0201d; of the GUN4 core domain. Several other energetic hotspots reside on the &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;6/&#x003b1;7 loops. Positions of mutations that exhibit a greater than 10-fold decrease in affinity are labeled.
