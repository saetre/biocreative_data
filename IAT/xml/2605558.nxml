We have previously used DNA microarrays to screen for novel genes controlling the developmental fate of the indifferent embryonic mouse gonad. Maestro (<italic>Mro</italic>), which encodes a HEAT-repeat protein, was originally identified as a gene exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression during mouse gonad development. Wholemount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation analysis revealed <italic>Mro</italic> to be expressed in the embryonic male gonad from approximately 11.5 days <italic>post coitum</italic>, prior to overt sexual differentiation. No significant expression was detected in female gonads at the same developmental stage. In order to address its physiological function, we have generated mice lacking Maestro using gene targeting. Male and female mice homozygous for a <italic>Mro</italic> null allele are viable and fertile. We examined gonad development in homozygous male embryos in detail and observed no differences when compared to wild-type controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of homozygous mutant testes of adult mice revealed no overt abnormalities. Expression profiling using DNA microarrays also indicated no significant differences between homozygote embryonic male gonads and controls. We conclude that Maestro is dispensable for normal male sexual development and fertility in laboratory mice; however, the <italic>Mro</italic> locus itself does have utility as a site for insertion of transgenes for future studies in the fields of sexual development and Sertoli cell function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The differentiation of the mammalian gonad from an indifferent embryonic primordium is controlled by distinct molecular mechanisms in males and females. In males, the expression of the Y-linked testis determining gene, <italic>SRY</italic>, initiates a pathway of genetic and cellular activity that culminates in the differentiation of the testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Gubbay1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-LovellBadge1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In females, the absence of <italic>SRY</italic> results in ovary development. Whilst progress in understanding the molecular basis of ovary development has been slower, several genes have now been demonstrated to function in the pathway of testis development, many of these comprising transcription factors or secreted signalling molecules expressed in a male-specific fashion during gonad development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Brennan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Wilhelm1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>).

By 13.5 dpc <italic>Mro</italic> transcripts were restricted to the developing testis cords and appeared to be found in both the somatic (Sertoli) cells and germ cells of the cords.

The <italic>Mro</italic> targeting construct was generated in pBluescript II SK&#x0002b; (Stratagene). The 5&#x02032; homology arm consisted of a 3036 bp fragment derived from mouse chromosome 18 containing the first coding exon of <italic>Mro</italic>. This was ligated to a strong splice-acceptor <italic>lac</italic>Z expression cassette (designed to splice onto exon three of <italic>Mro</italic> and act as a reporter), and a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the PGK promoter for selection purposes. Finally, a 3406 bp fragment, which extends downstream from the 3&#x02032;UTR of <italic>Mro</italic>, was ligated to form the 3&#x02032; homology arm. The construct was linearised with <italic>Asc</italic>I and transfected by electroporation into 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> ES cells of a line (48/1) derived from 129Ola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Brook1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> (a kind gift from Prof. Richard Gardner). After ten days of selection with Geneticin, five hundred resistant colonies were picked and expanded into 96 well plates. Genomic DNA was isolated by digestion with <italic>Proteinase K</italic> (1 mg/ml) in 50 &#x000b5;l of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x00025; sarkosyl) followed by ethanol precipitation. Once dried, samples were digested overnight with five units <italic>Spe</italic>I (NEB). Digested, electrophoresed DNA was Southern blotted onto Hybond N&#x0002b; membrane (Amersham) then hybridised with a 282 bp 5&#x02032; external probe (generated by PCR: F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TGGGAGCCTGACAAGTCCTA-3&#x02032;</named-content>; R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCAAGCAGGGCAAAATGAAGG-3&#x02032;</named-content>) which detects a 9.5 kb fragment derived from the wild-type <italic>Mro</italic> allele and a 7.0 kb fragment from the correctly targeted allele. Probes were labelled using the Megaprime kit (Amersham) and hybridised in ExpressHyb (Clontech) following manufacturers' instructions. Twelve clones containing a correctly targeted allele were identified. These clones were further expanded and following digestion of DNA with <italic>Nde</italic>I, Southern blot analysis was repeated using a 790 bp probe (3&#x02032; external probe), which detects a 10.9 kb fragment derived from the wild-type <italic>Mro</italic> allele and a 7.1 kb fragment from the correctly targeted allele. This ensured that correct targeting had occurred at both ends of the integration. Two ES cell clones (<italic>Mro<sup>tm1H</sup></italic>-C4 and <italic>Mro<sup>tm1H</sup></italic>-C10), giving the predicted fragment sizes with both external probes and exhibiting a normal 38, XY karyotype, were then chosen for injection into C57BL/6J recipient blastocysts. Embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant CD1 foster mothers. Male and female chimaeric offspring, identified by the presence of agouti coat colour, were then bred to C57BL/6J mice to assay for germ-line transmission. Agouti coloured offspring of these crosses were biopsied and their genotype determined by Southern blotting. Mice carrying the targeted allele were bred onto 129SvEv, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeH backgrounds, and were also inter-crossed to produce homozygote and wild-type littermates for phenotypic analysis. A multiplex PCR assay, which screened for both the presence of the wild-type <italic>Mro</italic> allele (F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GAACATCCGGCTCTGTCGTC-3&#x02032;</named-content>; R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CCACGAACCAGGAGGTCAAG-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and also for the presence of the targeted allele (F, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AGGCTATTCGGCTATGACTG-3&#x02032;</named-content>; R, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGTCAAGAAGGCGATAGAAG-3&#x02032;</named-content>), was developed to permit rapid genotyping of mice.

This targeting removes all four HEAT domains of Mro, leaving a single coding exon (exon 4) which splices directly onto the LacZ reporter gene.

These data also confirmed that the first 30 residues of Mro retained in this targeted mouse line were, as expected, expressed as a fusion protein with Beta-galactosidase. Finally, localisation of this fusion protein to the cytoplasm (as opposed to Mro nuclear localisation (9)), strongly suggested that the remaining residues of Mro were extremely unlikely to rescue any potential phenotype. Male and female homozygotes were born in the expected Mendelian ratios and appeared to be morphologically and behaviourally normal by gross inspection. Seven male homozygotes were mated with wild-type females and each sired litters of normal size. Five female homozygotes were also mated with wild-type males and all produced litters with an average size of 8.8.</p><fig id="pone-0004091-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004091.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Targeted disruption of the Maestro gene.</title><p>(A) The mouse Maestro locus (i), targeting vector (ii) and targeted allele (iii).

More recently, cell sorting techniques reliant on fluorescently tagged transgenic marker proteins have been employed to purify specific cell types and thereby refine the screen for potential regulators of gonadogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Beverdam1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Bouma2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Whilst these and other studies vary in the precise approach taken, they share the common aim of identifying sex- and cell-type specific gene expression in the embryonic gonad as a means of identifying candidates for loci causing disorders of human sexual development. Given that it has been estimated that up to 70&#x00025; of such cases of gonadal dysgenesis in the human population remain unaccounted for by mutations in known sex determining genes such as <italic>SRY</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Scherer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, such a gene-driven approach to identifying candidates is well motivated. However, very few genes emerging from such screens have made the transition from promising candidate to established player in sexual development. Two recent success stories involving genes initially identified by expression-based screens, the role of prostaglandin D2 in testis determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Adams1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Malki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and the role of <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> as a meiosis inhibiting factor in developing male gonads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Bowles1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Koubova1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, are relatively rare exceptions to this assessment. Two obstacles to establishing functional roles for the many candidate sexual development genes that exist remain the time and cost of generating mice lacking the relevant gene, and the absence of any reliable <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for gene function during mouse gonadogenesis. However, the generation of mice harbouring null alleles of candidate sexual development genes is perhaps the only reliable way of addressing their function that, at the same time, offers important genetic tools for future experiments.</p><p>The expression pattern of the mouse Maestro gene implicates it in some role during sexual development of the male. We have shown that mice lacking Maestro develop normally, are fertile and appear to have no gross morphological abnormalities when housed in conventional conditions. Maestro is highly conserved amongst mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004091-Smith2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, but no similar gene product has been detected in non-mammalian species by database searches. Moreover, Maestro appears to be a genuine single-copy gene, with no close paralogues existing in mice. Given these observations, the explanation for the absence of any major phenotypic abnormalities in Maestro-deficient mice is unclear. No closely related gene exists that might act redundantly with Maestro, although some unrelated gene product may be able to compensate. We examined gene expression in the developing gonad of Maestro-deficient animals with this explanation in mind, but no significant differences between mutant and wild-type samples were observed. Despite expression of Maestro in extra-gonadal sites, no other morphological abnormalities were observed despite extensive histological examinations. Our observations on mice lacking Maestro have been made with varying degrees of depth on three different genetic backgrounds, namely C3H/HeH, C57BL/6J and 129SvEv. Preliminary studies suggest that there are no significant differences between mutant phenotypes on these backgrounds.</p><p>We are currently screening for proteins that physically interact with Maestro during gonad development in the mouse. Once identified, it will be important to determine the phenotypic consequences of removing both Maestro and genes encoding its protein partners. In this way, it may be possible to discern a physiological role for the Maestro gene and identify the relevant molecular pathways in which it acts.</p><p>The series of experiments we have undertaken to determine the role of Maestro, whilst inconclusive in their initial aim, have a secondary serendipitous outcome. We have carried out a comprehensive investigation of a locus from which exogenous DNA can be expressed in specific cell lineages of the embryonic and adult testis (with extra-gonadal expression observed in heart, brain, liver and kidney (9)). In addition, by utilizing a LacZ expression cassette, we have demonstrated exactly where to insert such DNA in the <italic>Mro</italic> locus to achieve this expression. Thus whilst we have been unable to determine the function of Mro, the <italic>Mro</italic> locus itself has utility as a site of transgene expression that can be exploited during future investigations into sexual development and Sertoli cell function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank past and present members of the laboratory and others in the Developmental Genetics section at Harwell for useful discussions and advice.
