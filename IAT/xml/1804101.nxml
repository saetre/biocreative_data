In &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, Dam is a stand-alone enzyme that methylates GATC sites, which are non-randomly distributed in the genome. Some of these overlap with transcription factor binding sites. This work describes a global computational analysis of a published Dam knockout microarray alongside other publicly available data to throw insights into the extent to which Dam regulates transcription by interfering with protein binding. The results indicate that DNA methylation by DAM may not globally affect gene transcription by physically blocking access of transcription factors to binding sites. Down-regulation of Dam during stationary phase correlates with the activity of TFs whose binding sites are enriched for GATC sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dam is an N6-Adenine methyltransferase, which methylates GATC sites soon after replication.

For all microarray data except the <italic>dam</italic> mutant, differential expression was defined by a q-value of 0.05 following FDR multiple testing.

The most recent of these <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-RobbinsManke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, for which the raw data is available in GEO, describes an overall increase in expression of about 200 genes in <italic>Dam</italic> using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. For the current study, this raw data was reanalyzed. The data was normalised using RMA as in the above study. However, instead of the ANOVA analysis used in the above study, the moderated t-test approach of LIMMA implemented in Bioconductor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Gentleman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Following p-value adjustment with multiple testing, it was found that none of the genes showed a statistically significant change in gene expression at an FDR of 0.05. This is very unlike an FNR&#x02013;one of seven global regulators defined by Martinez-Antonio and Collado-Vides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-MartinezAntonio1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>-knockout under anaerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Covert1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Kang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, which on normalisation with RMA followed by detection of differential expression with LIMMA and multiple testing with FDR results in 340&#x02013;360 differentially expressed genes. While such a multiple correction approach is effective in normalizing for dependencies across genes, it can lead to a loss of sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-vonHeydebreck1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, a more conservative approach of a raw p-value cut-off of 0.01 and a log (base 2) change of 0.7 (2-fold change) was used on the <italic>Dam</italic> dataset. 109 genes were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s001">Table S1</xref>). This included RecA and LexA confirming the activation of DNA repair mechanisms. An over-representation of genes involved in translation was also observed (F-test as used in FatiGO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-AlShahrour1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, FDR q-value: 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>). This is as observed in the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-RobbinsManke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the present analysis shows that no other functional category is enriched. The lack of significance of differential expression after multiple-correction might imply that these changes are subtle. The gene expression changes may be restrained due to the activity of a relatively less characterized methyltransferase SmtA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Kouzminova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It may also arise because of variation in the extent of double strand breaks in the population as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-RobbinsManke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Dam binding sites and gene expression changes are not correlated</title><p>Yet another dataset that was used in this study is experimentally verified transcription factor binding site (TFBS) and promoter sequence (PS) data downloaded from RegulonDB 5.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Salgado1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A list of experimentally verified transcription units was used in conjunction with the above data in order to identify promoters of genes that are differentially expressed, which also contain the GATC motif. The 109 differentially expressed genes fell in 65 different transcription units. Of these 38 had an experimentally verified sigma factor binding sequence (SFBS) and 25 had at least one known TFBS.</p><p>If the change in expression levels were due to altered TF binding to DNA in the <italic>dam</italic> strain, then we would expect to see an over-representation of GATC containing SFBS and TFBS in the list of differentially expressed transcription units. However, this was not the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s003">S3</xref>). Only 3 differentially expressed TFBS and SFBS contained GATC sites. This was just random (Z-scores of-1.5 and 0.005 for SFBS and TFBS respectively; control: 1000 randomly shuffled gene-SFBS/TFBS pairs). In fact a lack of such correlation was reported by Robbins-Manke et al. as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-RobbinsManke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that any change in expression levels, despite being subtle, observed in the microarray data cannot be attributed to the direct influence of methylation on transcription factor or sigma factor binding to the DNA. These transcriptional changes might be in response to damage to the DNA that is caused by reduced methylation or due to hitherto unexplained indirect effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Tetranucleotide profiling for GATC</title><p>In an earlier work, over-representation of specific words in gene-upstream regions was described as a measure of the regulatory potential of such motifs and validated using comparison with known structures of DNA-protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Sivaraman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, as further test for the role of GATC as a regulatory motif at the transcriptional level, tetranucleotide profiling analysis as described in the above publication was carried out. Instead of an arbitrary cut-off, as was used in the former work, the F-test-FDR test was used to test for enrichment. Further, for this test, enrichment of tetranucleotides within the experimentally validated TFBS in comparison to the coding sequences was tested. It was found that out of 256 possible tetranucleotides, 91 were statistically enriched (q-value&#x0003c;0.05) within TFBS. This includes CTAG, which is the core binding sequence for trp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and the met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Somers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> repressors and is known to be highly restrained in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Blattner1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite the fact that over 35&#x00025;of all tetranucleotides are enriched in TFBS, GATC is not, thus adding further to doubts on its role as a transcriptional regulatory motif. This is true even when an alternative approach to identifying enriched tetranucleotides is used. In this approach a score was computed for each tetranucleotide so that it would define whether the word is enriched within TFBS or not. At a two-fold enrichment cut-off, 53 tetranucleotides were obtained. This list was a subset of the list obtained using the F-test and thus GATC is found to be absent here as well. These lists are provided as tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s004">S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s005">S4B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Dam, CRP, Sigma38 and stationary phase</title><p>In the next step of the study, TFs and Sigma factors whose binding sites were significantly enriched for GATC were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000273-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Among TFs for which more than 10 sites contained a GATC sequence, only CRP and FNR showed significant enrichments (tested using 1000 shuffling of TF to site mapping). CRP (Z-score: 8) showed a much greater significance than FNR (Z-score: 2.5). In addition, a survey of Sigma factor binding sequences for GATC using the same permutation tests as used for TFBS shows that only the stationary phase/stress response sigma factor, Sigma 38 or rpoS, is enriched for GATC, though only slightly (Z-score: 2.5).</p><p>CRP, which is activated by cAMP signalling in response to glucose starvation, can be expected to be active during the stationary phase of growth in minimal medium and would therefore not be active under the conditions in which the above microarray data was obtained. Hence it is reasonable that CRP targets with GATC sites do not significantly change in expression levels in a Dam mutant grown in rich media. The same is applicable to SigmaS as well. However, the question is: how does CRP access its binding sites even during stationary phase when the sites are methylated? Two different publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets for stationary phase E coli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Tjaden1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Glasner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> were mined (using comparisons with log phase arrays from the same experiment) for genes that were differentially expressed (moderated t-test from LIMMA and FDR&#x0003c;0.05) during the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000273.s006">Table S5</xref>). It could be seen that Dam is consistently down regulated in the stationary phase (FDR of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> in the two contrasts). This is consistent with results from a ten year old small-scale experiment showing that Dam levels are dependent on growth rate and that a ten-fold decrease in growth rate results in a four-fold fall in Dam levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Rasmussen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This would result in reduced methylation during stationary phase, allowing CRP to bind its targets in newly divided cells. This could also be one reason why double strand breaks are induced during stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Ponder1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that Dam methylation does not really interfere with TF binding under conditions in which the TF might be expected to be active. Further the observation that only Sigma38 binding sites among those for all sigma factors show enrichment for GATC is further evidence to the above. This model is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000273-g002">Fig. 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the description of isolated cases where DNA methylation plays an important role in transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-Wion1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, it may not be a global player. Dam is down regulated in the stationary phase, which correlates with the enrichment of GATC in binding sites for CRP and Sigma 38, though the functional significance of the enrichment seen with FNR is not clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000273-vonHeydebreck2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000273.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Genes differentially expressed in delta-dam mutant in comparison to wt.
