We compared in these cells the types of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>receptors present in the ER, and measured their Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent activity before and after correction of F508del-CFTR abnormal trafficking either by low temperature or by the pharmacological corrector miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We showed reduction of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) dependent-Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response following both correcting treatments compared to uncorrected cells in such a way that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>responses (CF+treatment <italic>vs </italic>wild-type cells) were normalized. This normalization of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>rate does not affect the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride channel in miglustat-treated CF cells. Using two inhibitors of IP<sub>3</sub>R1, we observed a decrease of the implication of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 in the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response in CF corrected cells. We observed a similar Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization between CF-KM4 cells and CFTR-cDNA transfected CF cells (CF-KM4-reverted). When we restored the F508del-CFTR trafficking in CFTR-reverted cells, the specific IP<sub>3</sub>R activity was also reduced to a similar level as in non CF cells. At the structural level, the ER morphology of CF cells was highly condensed around the nucleus while in non CF cells or corrected CF cells the ER was extended at the totality of cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest reversal of the IP<sub>3</sub>R dysfunction in F508del-CFTR epithelial cells by correction of the abnormal trafficking of F508del-CFTR in cystic fibrosis cells.

In addition to requiring IP<sub>3</sub>, IP<sub>3</sub>R are regulated in a biphasic manner by direct interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, <italic>i.e</italic>. activation at low concentrations (up to 0.3 &#x003bc;M) and inhibition at higher concentrations (0.5&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The different modes of interaction of IP<sub>3</sub>R with Ca<sup>2+ </sup>are involved in the complex feedback regulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. IP<sub>3</sub>R activity is also regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent accessory proteins, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, redox potential and ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, a local Ca<sup>2+ </sup>discharge by photolysis of NP-EGTA technique can activate the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release. For example, the type 3 IP<sub>3</sub>R remaining open in the presence of high Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration, initiates a rapid, large and almost total release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These properties place IP<sub>3</sub>Rs at the heart of calcium signalling pathways.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) compared to normal human nasal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or bronchial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] epithelia. Cystic Fibrosis is the most frequent lethal autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasian population. The most common mutation in CF is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator protein (F508del-CFTR). F508del-CFTR protein is misfolded, trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ER quality control (ERQC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and subsequently submitted to proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In this report we monitored the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients using the flash photolysis technique to uncage caged Ca<sup>2+ </sup>into the cytosol of nitrophenyl-EGTA (NP-EGTA) loaded human CF nasal epithelial CF15 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], human CF tracheal gland CF-KM4 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and human non-CF tracheal gland epithelial MM39 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Cells were then washed and allowed to desesterification for 10 min. Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients were monitored using confocal laser scanning microscope FV1000 (Olympus, France) installed on an inverted microscope IX-81 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and equipped with two scanning heads. One is used for imaging Fluo-4 fluorescence with 488 nm line of a multi-line argon laser using line scan mode, the other allows stimulation (SIMS) with 405 nm diode. XT images were acquired with &#x000d7;60/1.2 NA water-immersion objective with 2&#x000d7; optical zoom (spatial resolution of 0.2 &#x003bc;m/pixel) and collected using spectral detector within 500&#x02013;600 nm. To allow comparison between different experimental conditions, uncaging pulses of the same intensity were delivered with 5% of 405 nm diode for 500 ms with tornado scanning mode in a region of interest of 10 pixels diameter (= 2 &#x003bc;m). Simultaneous scanner system of Olympus FV1000 station allows laser stimulation in a restricted region while recording Fluo-4 fluorescence images with no delay and high resolution. As shown on XY images, laser stimulation with 405 nm diode applied on a restricted region of interest (yellow circle in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) induced a localized Ca<sup>2+ </sup>increase that propagated throughout the cell. For high time resolution, intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>images were acquired in a line scan mode during 3 s (XT image, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) with line scan defined in the center of stimulation region (XY reference image, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). 500 ms duration of laser stimulation was chosen for its efficacy to induce large response with no sign of bleach or saturation of cellular response. Typical intensity profile of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>variation was then extracted from XT images with FV10-ASW v1.3 software within a 10 pixels width region to reduce noise (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Intensity profiles were normalized by dividing the fluorescence intensity of each pixel (F) by the average resting value before stimulation (F0) to generate an (F-F0/F0) image.

Using reverse transcription-PCR technique, we found mRNA for the three isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>R (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs indicated for each isoform a punctiform and diffuse immunostaining in the cytoplasm of CF15 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> top images). No immunostaining of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs was detected when the primary antibodies were omitted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> bottom images). Then, to directly investigate IP<sub>3</sub>R activity, we used the flash photolysis technique to uncage caged Ca<sup>2+ </sup>into the cytosol of NP-EGTA loaded CF15 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because the capacity of IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors to release Ca<sup>2+ </sup>into the cytosol is influenced, in part, by the cytosolic local Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration, a confined discharge of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by NP-EGTA photolysis induced an activation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release by IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors. To eliminate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx, we performed all experiments in absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free). As described in the method section, images were acquired in a line scan mode during 3 s (XT image) with CF15 cells cultured at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The corresponding normalized fluorescence and AUC are shown Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> (black line) and C (black bar). To study the contribution of IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors into the local Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release in CF15 cells, we used 2-APB and decavanadate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], two non specific inhibitors of IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms. In these experimental conditions, we observed a decrease by more than 70% of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response when we used either 100 &#x003bc;M 2-APB or 100 &#x003bc;M decavanadate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). To prevent the release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by IP<sub>3</sub>Rs from the ER, we measured the response that had been only induced by the flash. We treated cells 2 h with 10 &#x003bc;M thapsigargin (TG) to release the whole Ca<sup>2+ </sup>store.

However, in absence of agonist stimulation, the level of intracellular IP<sub>3 </sub>remains very low. When we used 10 mM caffeine to activate specifically RYRs, we did not observe Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization, on the contrary of 100 &#x003bc;M histamine stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). These results indicate that RYRs are absent or not functional in these human epithelial cell models (CF15, CF-KM4 and MM39 cells). Then, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response produced by the NP-EGTA photolysis was the consequence of the presence and activity of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. This explains that the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>increase observed is only measured during the UV photolysis (500 ms). To eliminate these limitation of the NP-EGTA technique, and to study, more directly, the IP<sub>3</sub>R activity, we examined the ER Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release by UV light photolysis of a cell-permeable caged iso-Ins(1,4,5)P3/PM in absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In CF-KM4 cells, preloaded with iso-Ins(1,4,5)P3/PM, short exposure (100 ms) to flash photolysis induced a biphasic increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. We observed an initial peak of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release which stabilized during 1 or 2 s, and an increase of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release by a propagation of this Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response at the whole cell level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). In MM39 and miglustat-treated CF-KM4 cells, the UV photolysis stimulated a biphasic increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but the amplitude of the first peak and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization was reduced compared to untreated CF-KM4 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

We observed the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>return to a basal concentration approximately after 15 to 20 s after the UV flash (not shown). To ensure that the response evoked by exposing the cells to UV light was not due to phototoxicity or to a non-specific effect, the experiments were repeated with CF-KM4 cells loaded with fluo-4 without iso-Ins(1,4,5)P3/PM. In this experimental condition, exposure to UV flash did not induce an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

In a first set of experiments, the ER structure was investigated by calreticulin immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Calreticulin is an intraluminal ER protein involved in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> shows that the ER remains highly concentrated around the nucleus in untreated or NB-DGJ-treated CF-KM4 cells. On the contrary, in MM39 and in miglustat-corrected-CF-KM4 cells, the ER is spreaded throughout the cells. No immunostaining of calreticulin was detected when the primary antibodies were omitted (data not shown). To verify whether this difference in ER morphology observed between CF and non CF cells is due to the ER structure or to a change of calreticulin localization, we also stained the ER with a specific fluorescent probes (ER tracker) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Again, the ER was also found highly concentrated around the nucleus in untreated and NB-DGJ-treated CF-KM4 cells, whereas in periphery of the cells the ER network was very thin. On the contrary, in non CF cells or corrected CF cells, the ER was clearly extended throughout the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

The three subtypes of IP<sub>3</sub>R Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release channels share basic properties but differ in term of regulation. Type 1 IP<sub>3</sub>R, with both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation and inhibition, is well suited for establishing Ca<sup>2+ </sup>oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], where the frequency of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients can be modulated when IP<sub>3 </sub>concentrations are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The effects of CsA are lower in CF15 corrected cells than in uncorrected CF15 cells; it suggests that the CsA-sensitive IP<sub>3</sub>R participation in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response was decreased in CF15 corrected cells.</p><p>Human CF primary bronchial epithelial cells and respiratory cell lines were reported to produce an exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine response associated with an activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>is known to play a central role in production and secretion of Il-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation induces a prolonged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in IB3-1 cells which was correlated to NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The deregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release observed in human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells could be implicated in increasing inflammatory response observed in numerous CF cell lines in particular in CF epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The apical ER network is expended in human CF bronchial epithelial cells compared to ER volume in human non CF bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this present study, the ER staining (by calreticulin immunostainning or ER tracker probe) shows that the ER structure is highly different in CF compared to non CF or CF-corrected cells. The ER volume seems to be concentrated around the nucleus in CF cells and expanded throughout the cytoplasm of non CF and CF-corrected cells. This expansion could be responsible for the variation in IP<sub>3</sub>R Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent activity observed in this present study. Indeed, the display of ER web could induce probably an augmentation of distance between IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors which would induce a decrease in the propagation of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response. Furthermore, the F508del-CFTR correction is causing a potential redistribution of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs at the ER membrane. We believed that in corrected CF and non CF cells, IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are more distant from each others, leading to reduce propagation of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave. Then IP<sub>3</sub>Rs clustering of the ER could facilitate the formation of highly sensitive Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release sites, thereby stimulating the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave initiation and propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. For example, in maturation of oocytes, the modifications in ER clusters are accompanied by an increase in the sensitivity of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release by IP<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, in CF cells IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are closer to each other and the photolysis induces a long Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave due to a better propagation. Our interpretation of the data obtained with CF-KM4-reverted cells is that the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs deregulation is not due to the CFTR absence at the plasma membrane but is more likely due to the abnormal ER F508del-CFTR retention. The F508del-CFTR escape of ER by pharmacological corrector treatment induces the normalization of IP<sub>3</sub>R Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release.</p><p>In the airways, pleiotropic consequences accompanied the production of F508del-CFTR protein generating vicious cycle of airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation at the origin of most of the morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. The pro-inflammatory mediator bradykinin triggers Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and induces interleukin-8 secretion in non-CF and CF human airway epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the increase of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals at the apical membrane in human CF airway epithelia; it results from the expansion of the ER Ca<sup>2+ </sup>store compartment rather than from a greater number of purinergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We can confirm these results in our cellular models because we observed that the kinetics of activation of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response obtained in NB-DNJ-treated CF cells do not mimic the effect of the inhibitors of the IP<sub>3</sub>R and we observed a variation of the ER morphology between non CF or corrected and uncorrected epithelial cells.</p><p>We recently provided evidence that the pharmacological correction of abnormal trafficking of F508del-CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] induces a restoration of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in CF cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Here, we showed reduction of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) dependent-Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response following two different correcting treatments compared to uncorrected cells in such a way that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>responses (CF+treatment <italic>vs </italic>wild-type cells) were normalized. Altogether, these results suggest reversal of the IP<sub>3</sub>R dysfunction in F508del-CFTR epithelial cells by a pharmacological correction of the abnormal trafficking of F508del-CFTR in cystic fibrosis cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations list</title><p>AM: Acetoxymethyl; 2-APB: 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borate; CF: cystic fibrosis; CFTR: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; IP<sub>3</sub>: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP<sub>3 </sub>caged: iso-Ins(1,4,5)P3/PM; IP<sub>3</sub>R: IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor; NB-DGJ: N-butyldeoxygalactojirimycin; NB-DNJ: N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; NP-EGTA: Nitrophenyl-Ethylene Glycol-bis(&#x003b2;-Aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-Tetraacetic Acid; TG: Thapsigargin; CsA: Cyclosporine A.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FA conducted the experiments, analysed the data and wrote the draft of the manuscript.
