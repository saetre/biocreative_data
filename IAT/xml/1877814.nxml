The lipid complex lowers the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveolus, and hereby prevents the lung from collapsing at low lung volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The protein complex participates in host defence mechanisms such as regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, chemotaxis, or tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. So far five surfactant proteins (SP) have been identified in humans: SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins and mainly involved in the innate immune system, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic and essential constituents of lung surfactant. All surfactant proteins are mainly synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum of alveolar type II cells. Because of its diverse functions, derangement in composition, structure, or function of surfactant proteins may lead to the development of a wide variety of pulmonary disorders.</p><p>Polymorphisms, especially in <italic>SP-A </italic>and <italic>SP-B</italic>, have been associated with lung diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants (RDS), congenital alveolar proteinosis (CAP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, studies using knockout mice and clinical studies of human congenital proteinosis indicate that SP-B defiency is lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>SP-B </italic>is located on the short arm of human chromosome 2, it consists of 11 exons, whereby the 11<sup>th </sup>exon is not translated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There are two steps involved in the translation of SP-B: First, the <italic>SP-B </italic>transcription product, a 2000 bp long mRNA, is translated into the SP-B preprotein, which consists of 381 amino acids. Second, two proteolytic reactions take place that remove both the amino terminal and carboxy terminal arm of the proprotein and lead to the formation of the mature SP-B protein with a molecular mass of 8 kD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>RSV, a single-stranded RNA virus, is involved in at least 70% of cases of infectious infantile bronchiolitis and has been repetitively linked to asthma. It has been hypothesised that severe RSV infection in infancy might lead to the development of recurrent wheezing and/or bronchial asthma, and consequently a common genetic background of both diseases has been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to verify the previously described polymorphisms in <italic>SP-B </italic>in the German population. Furthermore we were interested in whether any of these polymorphisms or haplotypes showed association with severe RSV associated diseases and/or pediatric asthma. We chose to study five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in <italic>SP-B</italic>: rs2077079 in the promoter region (-32G/T); rs1130866 resulting in the amino acid exchange T131I; rs2040349 in intron 8 (5781A/C); rs3024801 resulting in L176F and rs3024809 resulting in R272H.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><sec><title>Population of infants with severe RSV infection</title><p>The population was recruited at the Centre for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Freiburg, Germany and at the Community Children's Hospital of Freiburg, St. Josefs Hospital.

Infection with RSV was confirmed by antigen test and/or RSV-specific PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. According to the case definition children had symptoms of bronchiolitis, such as wheezing and tachypnea and needed either supplementary oxygen and/or gavage feeding and/or intravenous fluids. Children with congenital heart defects, immune deficiency, or chromosomal aberrations were excluded. DNA samples were collected either by blood taking or buccal smears with sterile cotton sticks. In total 131 children were included.</p></sec><sec><title>Asthmatic population</title><p>322 children with asthma (aged 5 to 18 years) were recruited from the South-Western part of Germany between July 2000 and January 2005. The patients were also characterised at the Centre for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Freiburg, Germany, using a standardized clinical protocol. An extended medical history was recorded including occurrence and duration of wheezing symptoms; previous and acute medications; severity of previous asthma attacks; previous allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis; atopic dermatitis and any family history of allergic diseases.</p><p>The diagnosis was based on a clear-cut history of asthmatic symptoms, the use of anti-asthmatic medication and the presence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Bronchial hyperreactivity was defined as a fall in forced respiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by at least 15% in histamine testing or exercise provocation using standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Acute or chronic inflammation may lead to local alteration of SP concentrations. Our study focussed on the genetic variability of these proteins in an attempt to identify children at increased risk for inflammatory lung disease like severe RSV infection and bronchial asthma. Thus the aim was to determine, whether polymorphisms within <italic>SP-B </italic>show association with one or both diseases. Furthermore, we were interested to detect a common genetic link between both diseases &#x02013; as has previously been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, we did not find any association of three common <italic>SP-B </italic>polymorphisms neither with severe RSV infections nor with bronchial asthma. In addition, haplotype analysis of the asthmatic population supported further that <italic>SP-B </italic>polymorphisms do not play a major role in the development of asthma. This is an important point according to the biophysical and immunological properties of surfactant proteins in lung development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Hohlfeld and colleagues demonstrated alteration of all SPs (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D) in the bronchoalveolar lavage after segmental allergen challenge in patients with asthma. In addition, they assume that activation of the surfactant system is not a universal response to airway inflammation, but rather a specific response to the disturbance of surfactant function by allergen challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Haplotype analysis of the three <italic>SP-B </italic>polymorphisms in the RSV population suggests an influence of these SNPs on the genetic predisposition to severe RSV infection (p = 0.034 and p = 0.035, respectively). Interestingly, we have already described association of Surfactant protein C with RSV bronchitis in the same cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This might further emphasis the importance of the Surfactant system in RSV bronchiolitis. However, looking at the haplotype distribution, it is not possible to decide which haplotype may be the most important one in the development of severe RSV infections. Here functional studies are clearly needed.</p><p>This is the first analysis of <italic>SP-B </italic>polymorphisms in RSV associated diseases. Previous studies have implicated <italic>SP-B </italic>polymorphisms as contributing factors to RDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], COPD and acute respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the majority of published studies the amino acid variant T131I is associated with increased risk to pulmonary diseases. Interestingly, the amino acid change T131I leads to the block of the N-glycosylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This change may have an impact on SP-processing and/or on the function of SP-B. Nevertheless, we did not find association of T131I with severe RSV infection. This could be due to the small sample size of our RSV population. Still our population is larger than the ones used in the above mentioned studies. In addition, we performed power calculations to test the validity of our results. In our asthmatic population with 322 individuals the power to find association with asthma (p-value of p = 0.05, assuming a relative risk of the variant of 2) is between 0.94 for rs2077079 and 0.97 for rs2040349. Regarding the RSV population the power is slightly lower due to the smaller sample size (0.83 to 0.88).</p><p>The polymorphisms rs2077079 did not show association with asthma or severe RSV infection in our populations. One previous study evaluated this polymorphism in a population with RDS and reported association of this polymorphism with RDS in black subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the population size was too small to yield significant results. No significant association was observed between the SNP and RDS in the white population. This is in line with our results. As so little is known about the functional impact of this SNP, we can only speculate about its role in haplotype distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate a possible association of <italic>SP-B </italic>haplotypes with severe RSV infection in the German population. In order to determine which one or ones of the three polymorphisms forming the haplotypes is/are responsible for the association, further case control studies on large populations are necessary. Furthermore, functional analysis needs to be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BP performed genotyping and sequencing of <italic>SBP </italic>polymorphisms as well as the statistical analyses and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>JF participated in the clinical design of the study.</p><p>JH performed DNA extraction of the study populations.</p><p>AH conceived and coordinated the study and helped to draft the manuscript.</p><p>MK participated in the clinical design of the study and the recruitment of the RSV population.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2466/7/6/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG HE 3123/3-1 and DFG HE 3123/4-2).
