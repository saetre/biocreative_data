For the majority of loci, the transition from association signal to mutational mechanism has been difficult to establish. Glucokinase (GCK) regulates glucose storage and disposal in the liver where its activity is regulated by glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP; gene name <italic>GCKR</italic>). Fructose-6 and fructose-1 phosphate (F6P and F1P) enhance or reduce GKRP-mediated inhibition, respectively. A common <italic>GCKR</italic> variant <italic>(</italic>P446L) is reproducibly associated with triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose levels in the general population. The aim of this study was to determine the mutational mechanism responsible for this genetic association. Recombinant human GCK and both human wild-type (WT) and P446L-GKRP proteins were generated. GCK kinetic activity was observed spectrophotometrically using an NADP<sup>+</sup>-coupled assay. WT and P446L-GKRP-mediated inhibition of GCK activity and subsequent regulation by phosphate esters were determined. Assays matched for GKRP activity demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent inhibition of GCK activity or F1P-mediated regulation. However, the response to physiologically relevant F6P levels was significantly attenuated with P446L-GKRP (<italic>n</italic> = 18; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.03). Experiments using equimolar concentrations of both regulatory proteins confirmed these findings (<italic>n</italic> = 9; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In conclusion, P446L-GKRP has reduced regulation by physiological concentrations of F6P, resulting indirectly in increased GCK activity. Altered GCK regulation in liver is predicted to enhance glycolytic flux, promoting hepatic glucose metabolism and elevating concentrations of malonyl-CoA, a substrate for <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, providing a mutational mechanism for the reported association of this variant with raised triglycerides and lower glucose levels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A recent genome-wide association (GWA) scan identified <italic>GCKR</italic> as a potential locus for modulating triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose (fpg) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C1">1</xref>). <italic>GCKR</italic> encodes glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP), and following fine mapping attributed the signal to the common non-synonymous SNP rs1260326 (c.1403 C &#x0003e; T, p.P446L, MAF 34%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C2">2</xref>). Subsequent population-based studies have replicated the association of this variant with triglyceride and fpg levels. Individuals homozygous for the risk allele (L) have on average a 0.15 mmol/l increase in triglyceride and a 0.06 mmol/l reduction in fpg levels compared with individuals with two copies of the wild-type (WT) allele (P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C4">4</xref>). The mutational mechanism behind this genetic association is currently unknown. However, unlike many signals arising from GWA studies, there is a non-synonymous SNP in a strong biological candidate gene driving the genetic association, thus facilitating functional studies. Even with such tractable variants, identifying the mutational mechanism for common risk alleles presents a challenge due to their small physiological effects. It is therefore essential that the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; assays are selected and performed if these small differences in protein function are to be observed.</p><p>Glucokinase (GCK) is a key regulator of glucose storage and disposal in the liver. GKRP regulates GCK activity competitively with respect to the substrate glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C6">6</xref>). GKRP action is in turn controlled by the phosphate esters fructose 6- and fructose 1-phosphate (F6P and F1P), which compete with each other for binding, and enhance or inhibit the action of the regulatory protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>).</p><p>There is some controversy in the literature as to whether GKRP also regulates GCK in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C12">12</xref>). The vast majority of studies state that <italic>GCKR</italic> is not expressed in rodent &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C12">12</xref>). However, there is evidence from one study that an alternatively spliced <italic>GCKR</italic> variant is expressed in the &#x003b2;-cells of rodents and represents the major isoform in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C10">10</xref>). To date, no studies have been reported which investigate <italic>GCKR</italic> expression in human pancreatic islets.</p><p>Biological evidence to support the association of these phenotypes with the <italic>GCKR</italic> SNP comes from both cellular and rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C14">14</xref>). Counter intuitively, Slosberg <italic>et al</italic>. over expressed <italic>GCKR</italic> in the human liver cell line HepG2 and showed an increase in GCK activity and expression at the protein level. From this, they suggested that GKRP as well as inhibiting GCK activity, also has a paradoxical role in extending GCK half-life by binding to and stabilizing the enzyme, thus protecting it from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C14">14</xref>). This finding is supported by data from both homo- and heterozygous <italic>gkrp</italic> knockout mice which display a marked reduction in <italic>gck</italic> expression and reduced GCK enzymatic activity under saturating glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C11">11</xref>). At least one study has also shown that <italic>in vivo</italic> over-expression of <italic>gck</italic> in rat hepatocytes led to a drop in plasma glucose levels with a corresponding increase in circulating triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C13">13</xref>). Therefore, findings from both groups suggested that (i) GKRP expression has a direct affect on GCK activity and (ii) there is a link between GCK activity and plasma glucose/circulating triglyceride levels.</p><p>A number of studies investigating the interaction of GCK and its regulatory protein have been reported but due to technical difficulties in purifying human recombinant GKRP, all of these have used the rat isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C16">16</xref>). One of these studies investigated the effect of rodent P446L-GKRP on GCK activity and reported no differences in the inhibitory ability of the variant protein or its response to phosphate esters compared with WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>). However, despite their high sequence homology (&#x0223c;88%), there are important differences in the regulation of rat and human GKRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C17">17</xref>). First, human regulatory protein inhibits GCK even in the absence of F6P, an affect not observed with the same concentration of rat GKRP. Secondly, human regulatory protein was shown to have a higher affinity for this phosphate ester compared with the rodent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>).</p><p>The aims of this study were therefore, first, to investigate the affect of both human WT and P446L-GKRP on human GCK activity and secondly, to determine whether their regulation by phosphate esters was altered. Finally, we aimed to establish whether <italic>GCKR</italic> is expressed in human pancreatic islets, and if so, to look at this expression relative to that of <italic>GCK</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>WT and P446L-GKRP both inhibit GCK activity</title><p>To assess the inhibitory function of our purified recombinant human WT and P446L-GKRP proteins following heterologous expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, one unit of each regulatory protein was used in assays to study competitive inhibition of GCK activity over a glucose concentration range (0&#x02013;100 m<sc>m</sc>).

Our data demonstrate both human WT and variant regulatory protein to be functional and able to inhibit GCK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Both GKRPs were also equally sensitive to F1P-mediated regulation, which is consistent with that shown previously using rodent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C16">16</xref>). However, our analyses have revealed a previously unappreciated change in F6P-mediated modulation of the P446L regulatory protein at physiologically relevant concentrations of this phosphate ester. These results differ from those reported in earlier rodent studies which showed no differences between the two proteins and confirm the important differences in the properties of human GKRP compared with rodent homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>).</p><p>The differing responses of the P446L-variant regulatory protein to F1P and F6P may be explained by looking at the binding site of these molecules. The crystal structure of GKRP has not been solved; however, it does have homology with other proteins of known crystal structure, such as the isomerase domain of bacterial glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase (GlmS), which catalyses the conversion of F6P into either glucose 6-phosphate or glucosamine 6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C22">22</xref>). This isomerase domain consists of two sugar isomerase sub-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C23">23</xref>), and analysis of the GlmS crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C21">21</xref>) and functional studies on rat GKRP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>) suggests a single substrate binding site lies between the interface of these two sub-domains. It has also been suggested that GKRP adopts different structural conformations in order to accommodate either F1P or F6P at this single binding site, and only one of these (that favoring F6P-binding) can complex with GCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C24">24</xref>). Residue 446 lies between two sequence motifs thought to be involved directly in binding of phosphate esters. As previously reported, mutating certain residues outside of these motifs can still affect binding (and hence regulation of GKRP activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>). Also, residue 446 is a conserved proline across human, rat and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> regulatory protein, and all bar the latter are responsive to both F1P and F6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C9">9</xref>). Therefore, we propose that residue 446 may not play a direct role in the binding of phosphate esters, but may be important structurally within GKRP. This amino acid substitution could then either reduce the ability of the regulatory protein to adopt the F6P-binding conformation or hinder the F6P&#x02013;GKRP complex from binding to and inhibiting GCK.</p><p>Our data show F6P-mediated regulation of P446L-GKRP to be significantly attenuated compared with WT over a physiological range of F6P concentrations, which ultimately leads to a reduction in GCK-inhibition by the variant regulatory protein. This is predicted to increase glycolytic flux and hence glucose uptake by the liver. This enhanced rate of glycolysis (as is seen with GCK over-expression in rats) may raise levels of other liver metabolites such as malonyl-CoA, increasing triglyceride levels via two mechanisms; first by acting as a substrate for <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and secondly by inhibiting carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1 (thus blocking fatty acid oxidation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C13">13</xref>). This perturbation of hepatic metabolism could account for the reduced glucose and raised triglycerides seen in L446-GKRP individuals. However, the very low <italic>GCKR</italic> mRNA levels detected in human islets (compared with human liver) suggest that GKRP has only a very minor (if any) functional role in the regulation of GCK in the pancreas. Consequently, pancreatic GCK is unlikely to be affected in individuals with this variant regulatory protein confirming that the phenotype observed is driven by a hepatic effect.</p><p>Broader implications of these findings regard the alteration of GCK activity to treat diabetes. Aberrant GCK function has been implicated in both monogenic forms of diabetes and in the variation of fpg levels within the general population, and as such it is a well-established therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C26">26</xref>). The initial genetic association data concerning the P446L-<italic>GCKR</italic> variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C4">4</xref>) supported by our functional studies confirm that changing the regulation of GCK activity solely in the liver could alter other hepatic metabolic pathways, thus resulting in an unfavorable lipid profile. This has already been shown in one study in rodents, where over-expressing hepatic <italic>gck</italic> lowers plasma glucose as well as raising triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C13">13</xref>). However, a number of other studies have shown that hepatic over-expression of <italic>gck</italic> does not always result in an increase in triglycerides, suggesting that the degree of increased <italic>gck</italic> activity is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C28">28</xref>). As such, potential new therapies targeting GKRP in the liver should be approached with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, our functional studies demonstrate that altered F6P-mediated GKRP regulation in carriers of the L446 allele explains the association between the common P446L-<italic>GCKR</italic> variant and higher triglyceride and lower fpg levels in several human populations. This work demonstrates that with suitable functional studies it is possible to establish mutational mechanisms for common variants of modest effect size identified by GWA studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>p-FLAG CTC vector (Sigma Aldrich Company Ltd, Gillingham, UK) containing human GKRP coding sequence was kindly supplied by Katy Brocklehurst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP357C7">7</xref>).
