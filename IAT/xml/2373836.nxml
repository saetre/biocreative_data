The Nur77 nuclear steroid receptor and Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, are two molecules implicated in this process. However, how they relate to each other and how Nur77 induces apoptosis remain unclear. In thymocytes, Nur77 has been shown to induce cell death through a transcriptional-dependent pathway, but in cancer cell lines, Nur77 was reported to induce apoptosis through conversion of Bcl-2 into a killer protein at the mitochondria. Whether this Nur77 transcriptional-independent pathway actually occurs in vivo remains controversial. Using an optimized fractionation protocol for thymocytes, here we report that stimulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes results in translocation of Nur77 and its family member Nor-1 to the mitochondria, leading to their association with Bcl-2 and exposure of the Bcl-2 proapoptotic BH3 domain. In two T cell receptor transgenic models of negative selection, F5 and HY, a conformational change of the Bcl-2 molecule in the negatively selected T cell population was similarly observed. Thus, the Nur77 family and Bim pathways converge at mitochondria to mediate negative selection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Apoptosis is an essential process in eliminating superfluous or potentially dangerous cells in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Dysregulation of this evolutionarily conserved mechanism could lead to cancer, autoimmunity, or degenerative disorders. Apoptosis plays an especially important role in regulating and establishing the T cell repertoire during T cell development. Developing immature T cells or thymocytes are subject to selection based on the binding avidity between their TCR and self-peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes. Thymocytes that strongly recognize self-peptide&#x02013;MHC undergo apoptosis through a process termed negative selection, whereas a weak recognition of self-peptide&#x02013;MHC results in survival and further development. Negative selection ensures that thymocytes leaving the thymus are tolerant to the host's own proteins and thus contributes to prevention of autoimmunity. Mice with a mutation in <italic>AIRE</italic>, a gene essential for expression of &#x0201c;tissue-specific&#x0201d; antigens in thymic antigen-presenting cells, exhibit severe autoimmunity due to the defective process of antigen presentation for negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The signal transduction pathways leading to negative selection in thymocytes are not fully understood. Previous work has implicated only a few molecules, including MINK, JNK, and p38 kinases as well as the downstream effector molecules Bim, a Bcl-2 proapoptotic member, and the Nur77 family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Null mutation in <italic>Bim</italic> or expression of a dominant-negative Nur77 protein resulted in a partial rescue of cells destined to die through negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The molecular relationship between these pathways, however, is not clear, and how Nur77 causes thymocyte cell death remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Nur77 is an orphan nuclear steroid receptor that belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The Nur77 family consists of Nur77, Nor-1, and Nurr1. In thymocytes and T cells, expression of only Nur77 and Nor-1 is induced in response to strong engagement of the TCR and correlates with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although <italic>Nur77<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have no phenotype, redundancy with Nor-1 is the likely explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Overexpression of a dominant-negative Nur77 protein, which blocks the activity of all family members, can inhibit apoptosis associated with negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Conversely, constitutive expression of either Nur77 or Nor-1 but not Nurr1 in thymocytes leads to massive apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Establishing Nur77's mode of action during negative selection has proven to be elusive so far. As a transcription factor, Nur77 regulates several downstream genes, including TRAIL, Fas ligand, and two genes with poorly characterized function, NDG1 and NDG2. NDG1 can initiate apoptosis through caspase-8, and thus Nur77 transcription might lead to caspase cleavage through the death receptor pathways or caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In addition, a mutant Nur77 with higher transcriptional activity causes more apoptosis in thymocytes than a mutant Nur77 that exhibits little transcriptional capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Thus, Nur77 transcriptional activity seems to correlate with its apoptotic function. However, a dominant-negative protein of FADD, which can simultaneously inhibit signaling from multiple death receptors, showed no effect on negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Nur77 initiates apoptosis through other mechanisms. Interestingly, Nur77 has been reported to be capable of translocating from the nucleus to mitochondria in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). At the mitochondria of cancer cell lines, Nur77's association with Bcl-2 at a linker region between the BH3 and BH4 domains of Bcl-2 was reported to expose the Bcl-2 BH3 domain that converts Bcl-2 into a proapoptotic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Whether this is physiologically relevant or not is not clear. Most of the original experiments were done through overexpression of a Nur77 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain. In thymocytes, Nur77 was reported to localize mainly in the nucleus in one report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, thymocytes are known to be fragile, and cell fractionation studies of thymocytes are notoriously difficult because they contain very little cytoplasm. Using an optimized fractionation protocol, we report here that Nur77 and its family member Nor-1 are present in thymic mitochondria in an export-dependent fashion. We also present evidence that Nur77 and Nor-1 associate with Bcl-2 in stimulated thymocytes. Exposure of the Bcl-2 BH3 domain was detected in in vitro anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin-stimulated thymocytes and in two TCR transgenic models of negative selection. Based on these data, we present a simplified model of apoptosis during negative selection through the mitochondria via Nur77/Nor-1/Bcl-2 and Bim.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Nur77 family members are localized to the mitochondria and associate with Bcl-2 in stimulated thymocytes</title><p>In cancer cell lines, the conversion of Bcl-2 to a proapoptotic form by Nur77 was reported to be mediated by translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In thymocytes, Nur77 could be detected easily in the nucleus. However, the mitochondria fraction was very difficult to obtain. We first performed cell fractionation with thymocytes using published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). To monitor fractionation, we used Western blot analysis with antibodies for either a nuclear-specific protein lamin B or mitochondria-specific proteins HSP-60 and cytochrome c. However, we found that pestle homogenization, a step described in all published fractionation protocols, led to rupture of mitochondria in these fragile thymocytes, resulting in impure cell fractionation and very little intact mitochondria. Using a modified protocol involving no pestle homogenization, we have successfully isolated fractions from thymocytes in a consistent manner. Thymocytes were either not stimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for either 2 or 6 h to induce apoptosis. Fractions were then probed with antibodies specific for either Nur77 or Nor-1. In addition to the nucleus, both Nur77 and Nor-1 could be found at the mitochondria in a stimulus-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Nur77 was found in the mitochondria fractions from thymocytes stimulated for either 2 or 6 h, whereas a strong Nor-1 signal was found in the 6-h time point. As expected, very little Nur77 or Nor-1 was found in the nucleus or mitochondria fraction of unstimulated thymocytes. Similar results were obtained with PMA/ionomycin-stimulated thymocytes, which also induced cell death, although the kinetics of Nur77/Nor-1 appearance in mitochondria varied depending on the concentrations of PMA and ionomycin used (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Nur77 and Nor-1 localize to the mitochondria and associate with Bcl-2 in anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin-treated thymocytes.</bold> (A) Nuclear and mitochondrial fractions of wild-type thymocytes cultured with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml anti-CD3 and 2 &#x003bc;g/ml anti-CD28 (plate-bound) were isolated and blotted with anti-Nur77 and anti&#x02013;Nor-1 antibodies. For fraction purity, the blot was also probed with antibodies for lamin B, HSP60, Bcl-2, and cytochrome c. (B) Transcriptional activity of Nur77 and Nor-1 was determined using a luciferase assay (as described in Materials and methods) on 293T cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids along with a Nur77/Nor-1&#x02013;dependent luciferase reporter construct and renilla internal control construct. (C) The extent of apoptosis in wild-type thymocytes cultured with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml anti-CD3/2 &#x003bc;g/ml CD28 (plate-bound), 1.25 ng/ml PMA/0.5 &#x003bc;M ionomycin, or 0.5 &#x003bc;M dexamethasone (Dex) was assessed by annexin V staining. Apoptosis was normalized to the untreated controls. (D) Cell lysates from <italic>lck-Bcl-2</italic> thymocytes cultured with 2.5 ng/ml PMA/0.5 &#x003bc;M ionomycin were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG (IP crtl), anti-Nur77, and anti&#x02013;Nor-1 antibodies, followed by blotting with an anti&#x02013;Bcl-2 antibody. Results shown in A and D represent three to six independent experiments. Data in B and C represent the mean &#x000b1; SD of three independent experiments. Thymocytes were pretreated for 2 h with 20 nM leptomycin B (LMB) where indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051029f01"></graphic></fig><p>To see if the mitochondria-specific Nur77/Nor-1 signals are export dependent, we added leptomycin B, a nuclear export inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Leptomycin B completely blocked the translocation of Nur77 and Nor-1 to mitochondria, whereas it had a minimal effect on the Nor-1 levels in the nucleus. Although leptomycin B did decrease the levels of nuclear Nur77 to some extent, its effect on Nur77 translocation to mitochondria is more dramatic and complete. Consistent with this notion, leptomycin B had a minimal effect on Nur77 and Nor-1 transactivation activities in a luciferase reporter assay, affirming intact nuclear function of Nur77/Nor-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Thus, Nur77 and Nor-1 are transported to the thymic mitochondria from the nucleus after TCR-mediated stimulation. Interestingly, leptomycin B also significantly inhibited the apoptotic activities of anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin in thymocytes but not that of dexamethasone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that a significant portion of TCR-mediated apoptotic activities occurs outside the nucleus.</p><p>To determine if Nur77 family proteins were capable of binding to Bcl-2, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using either Nur77 or Nor-1&#x02013;specific antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis with the Bcl-2&#x02013;specific antibodies. Because thymocytes contain very few mitochondria and also express very little Bcl-2, especially for nonstimulated thymocytes, we used <italic>lck-Bcl-2</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Freshly isolated thymocytes were stimulated for 4 h with PMA/ionomycin. PMA/ionomycin treatment was used for this experiment because it stimulates higher levels of Nur77 and Nor-1 compared with anti-CD3/CD28 treatment. The lysate obtained from PMA/ionomycin-treated thymocytes was immunoprecipitated with rabbit IgG control, anti-Nur77, or anti&#x02013;Nor-1 antibodies. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, Bcl-2 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the Nur77 or Nor-1 antibodies, and not with the control rabbit IgG, indicating the interaction of Nur77 and Nor-1 with Bcl-2 under physiological conditions. Leptomycin B treatment efficiently blocked the association of Nur77 and Nor-1 with Bcl-2 in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated thymocytes, confirming that the association occurred outside the nucleus. The observation of Nor-1 localization at the mitochondria, along with the protein's ability to bind to Bcl-2, is not surprising. It has been known that Nor-1 and Nur77 share redundancy in function and both exhibit &#x0003e;90% homology at the reported Bcl-2&#x02013;interacting region, DC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Bcl-2 BH3 domain is exposed in anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin-stimulated thymocytes</title><p>In several cancer cell lines, association of Nur77 with Bcl-2 in mitochondria leads to Bcl-2 conformation change and exposure of its BH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). We investigated whether this domain exposure also occurs in anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin-treated thymocytes. Thymocytes were cultured for various times with either PMA/ionomycin or anti-CD3/CD28, and then stained with antibodies specific for CD4 and CD8 and intracellularly with antibodies specific for the Bcl-2 BH3 domain. The Bcl-2 BH3 domain is usually buried within the folded Bcl-2 protein and undetectable by the Bcl-2/BH3-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Exposure of this domain correlates with the proapoptotic activities of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). We measured Bcl-2 BH3 exposure in various thymocyte populations. As expected, unstimulated thymocytes did not stain with the anti&#x02013;Bcl-2/BH3 antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, solid lines). With 1.25 &#x003bc;g/ml PMA and 0.5 &#x003bc;M ionomycin or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, however, Bcl-2/BH3 staining was clearly observed in 4- and 6-h&#x02013;stimulated double positive (DP) but not single positive (SP) or double negative (DN) thymocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). With a higher concentration of PMA/ionomycin (2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml PMA and 0.5 &#x003bc;M ionomycin), Bcl-2/BH3 staining was seen as early as 2 h after stimulation (not depicted). In contrast, intracellular staining with antibodies specific for total Bcl-2 showed the same levels in all times, consistent with the notion that the Bcl-2/BH3 staining is dependent on the conformation change and not on an increase in the total levels of Bcl-2. The Bcl-2/BH3 staining was specific to the CD69<sup>high</sup> DP population of cells that had just received TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). No staining was seen in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated <italic>Bcl-2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DP thymocytes, confirming the specificity of the antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

This could be due to the redundant function of Nor-1, which we have shown is also capable of associating with Bcl-2 at the mitochondria.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Bcl-2/BH3 exposure was observed in anti-CD3/CD28 and PMA/ionomycin-treated thymocytes.</bold> (A) Bcl-2/BH3 and Bcl-2 expression of DP cells from thymocytes cultured for 2, 4, and 6 h with 1.25 ng/ml PMA/0.5 &#x003bc;M ionomycin.

No Bcl-2 was seen in the immunoprecipitates when we used lysates from either unstimulated or leptomycin B/PMA/ionomycin-treated thymocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, lanes 4 and 6).

It is critical that potentially dangerous thymocytes are eliminated. Thus, in addition to up-regulating and/or activating proapoptotic proteins, antiapoptotic proteins must be effectively inhibited. In various negative selection models, Nur77 and Bim have been consistently found to be key regulators of thymocyte cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In contrast to Bim, the effector mechanism of Nur77-mediated apoptosis has yet to be clearly defined. The transcriptional activity of Nur77 was initially thought to be responsible for its apoptotic activity. This conclusion was based on characterization of transgenic mice expressing C-terminal truncation variants of Nur77 in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and evidence showing an N-terminal truncation of the transcriptional activation domain abolishes Nur77-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, C-terminally truncated Nur77 may also abolish Nur77's ability to export from the nucleus, as this region contains an export signal. Our data here are consistent with the notion that Nur77-induced cell death in thymocytes can be mediated by its translocation to the mitochondria where it binds to Bcl-2, converting the antiapoptotic molecule to a proapoptotic molecule during negative selection. This is consistent with a recent datum showing translocation of Nur77 to mitochondria in ionomycin-treated thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Although others have previously reported that Nur77 resides solely in the nucleus of immature DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), the discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that thymocytes are extremely fragile and their organelles can be lysed easily with even a brief sonication or pestle homogenization. In this study, we used a method with minimal manipulations and simply lysed thymocytes in a hypotonic solution. This protocol allowed us to consistently detect Nur77 and Nor-1 in mitochondria in an activation- and nuclear export&#x02013;dependent fashion.</p><p>Our findings suggest that negative selection may work through two effector molecules that converge at the mitochondria via their interaction with Bcl-2. While Bim antagonizes Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), Nur77 converts Bcl-2 to a killer form. This hypothesis could explain the disparity between the effects of Bim deficiency and Bcl-2 overexpression on negative selection. Although negative selection is defective in <italic>Bim<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, it is only inefficiently blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Overexpression of Bcl-2 was sufficient to block most other Bim-mediated apoptosis (irradiation, glucocorticoid, and death by neglect) but was unable to efficiently inhibit negative selection to any significant degree. Induction of Nur77/Nor-1 in negatively selected thymocytes and their relocalization to mitochondria followed by association with Bcl-2 can lead Bcl-2 to promote instead of block apoptosis in negatively selecting thymocytes. Although expressed at low levels in DP thymocytes, Bcl-2 has been shown to be induced during negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Thus, in the presence of Nur77, Bcl-2 is a proapoptotic protein. Together, Nur77 and Bim converge at the mitochondria to initiate apoptosis during negative selection. Additional experimentation, including that with transgenic mice, will be necessary to test and refine this model further.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Antibodies and reagents.</title><p>Ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate were obtained from EMD.
