To support this contention further studies examining time dependency of expression of IL-6, IL-10 or TNF-&#x003b1; are needed, as is expansion of the range of cytokines to include other key regulators of airway inflammation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bronchial epithelium acts not only as physical barrier but also is a key factor of remodelling and secretion of inflammation mediators in airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to sampling methods such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum, endobronchial biopsies have been used as a key research tool over the last decade to study the importance of bronchial epithelium in inflammatory diseases and define disease progression in asthma and COPD in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and evaluate the effects of different drug treatments and environmental effects on bronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Besides identifying morphological changes, examination of bronchial tissue can provide information on mRNA expression and subsequent levels of translated inflammatory mediators directly within the tissue, both by resident cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells using immunohistochemistry (IHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Horses are commonly affected by the disease "Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO)", which has many similarities with asthma in people. Inflammatory changes in the airways of horses with RAO have been studied predominately on the basis of cell samples collected by BAL, or less commonly, by analysis of other respiratory tract samples, such as bronchial brushing, tracheal lavage, exhaled breath condensate, and even lung tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most of our current understanding about the mechanism of inflammation and involvement of various regulatory or effector cytokines in the airways of horses with RAO has been derived from samples obtained by BAL. Apart from recent work of Ainsworth et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], similar assessment of bronchial tissues or direct identification of tissue cytokine levels by immunohistochemistry, which has been invaluable in human respiratory research, remains poorly investigated in horses.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of bronchial epithelium to airway inflammation in horses with RAO during exacerbation and in remission, with initial focus on relative cytokine mRNA and protein expression of cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;, that are involved in innate non-specific immunity. The differences in mRNA levels measured by quantitative real-time PCR were compared with the corresponding protein levels in epithelial tissue measured by IHC. The epithelial cytokine levels in RAO horses during remission were also compared against samples from healthy controls on pasture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical examination and pulmonary function test</title><p>There was no statistical difference in age and body weight in principal and control animals.

The RAO horses showed a significant worsening of pulmonary function during exacerbation as a response to provocation with mouldy hay, characterised by significant increase in &#x00394;Ppl<sub>max </sub>(41.80 &#x000b1; 17.27 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 versus 9.70 &#x000b1; 1.67 cmH<sub>2</sub>0, p = 0.02) and R<sub>L </sub>(2.96 &#x000b1; 0.76 cmH<sub>2</sub>0/L/s versus 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.02 cmH<sub>2</sub>0/L/s, p = 0.02).

During the pasture remission there was no statistical difference in BAL neutrophil percentage in RAO horses compared to controls (11.00 &#x000b1; 10.66 versus 9.60 &#x000b1; 6.82).

Surprisingly, we were unable to detect significant differences in either mRNA or protein expression in investigated cytokines in endobronchial tissue between provocation and remission. The only statistically significant finding was a small (1.1-fold down-regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA in endobronchial biopsies in RAO horses after provocation). However, given the extreme sensitivity of real time-PCR methodology this difference was unlikely of clinical relevance.</p><p>Earlier studies report conflicting results regarding IL-6 and IL-10 bioactivity or mRNA levels in BAL cells from RAO horses after challenge. However, these results may be due to differences in sampling time or the type of inhalation provocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Regarding IL-10, others have shown that inhalation challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevates IL-10 mRNA expression in both BAL alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and peripheral blood cells in RAO-susceptible horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However inhalation challenge with other agents failed to induce this up-regulation in BAL macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus it is possible that not only the sampling time, but also the mode and individual components of challenge agent may influence the dynamics of cytokine regulation. In our study, the negative correlation of bronchial TNF-&#x003b1; levels to IL-6 mRNA levels in controls examined on pasture may indicate the time-dependent changes in the expression of these two cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or simply be coincidental. The positive correlation of IL-10 mRNA expression with TNF-&#x003b1; measured by IHC (r<sub>s </sub>= 0.967, p = 0.007) may have reflected the immunoregulatory properties of IL-10 as a counterbalance to TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>There are also several other possible reasons that this study did not detect alteration of these cytokines under exacerbation. Firstly, the time point for sample collection in correlation to provocation might have failed to capture a temporally related enhancement in examined cytokine expression. Others workers have shown time-dependent expression of inflammatory mediators in horse airways that occur within hours or days after provocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, our samples were collected only once RAO-horses had developed clinical signs of impaired pulmonary function, (&#x00394;Ppl<sub>max </sub>more than 1.5 kPa), rather than at a predetermined time after provocation. Alternatively, it can be questioned whether the bronchial epithelial tissues obtained were representative for the study. As shown in earlier studies in human COPD and asthma patients, there is variability of distribution of inflammatory cells in bronchial tissue which can require examination of biopsies from more than one airway generation to increase the statistical power to detect differences between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Of the six biopsies we obtained from each horse, the first two were from the first generation bronchus and examined by PCR. The remaining four biopsies were obtained progressively more distally in the lung and from these morphologically representative biopsies were then selected for further analysis by IHC. As well, the small biopsy size, the sampling of the epithelial layer without underlying deeper mucosa, and the fact that biopsies are generally sampled from more proximal airways and from subcarinae, are additional limitations to the sampling procedure. To secure antigen preservation and optimal morphology for IHC studies, we chose plastic resin embedding, GMA, used in several human studies together with acetone fixation containing protease inhibitors. This embedding technique ensures both excellent antigen preservation for IHC and morphologic overview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When planning the study, the choice of equine antibodies was limited. At present there are several equine specific antibodies available for the investigated cytokines.</p><p>The primers used in PCR have been evaluated and validated in other studies. Moreover, companion studies in these RAO subjects have shown increased expression during crisis of other inflammatory mediators in BAL and epithelial cells collected by bronchial brushings and in biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], indicating ongoing inflammatory process. Thus, our findings suggest that, within the complex interrelation of regulatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; may not play a key role in the inflammation in bronchial tissues in horses with RAO.</p><p>Apart from IL-10 for the RAO horses at pasture, the lack of correlation of the cytokine mRNA to protein levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; was not unexpected as regulation of actual protein level is likely more complex than a direct relationship to amount of mRNA and the rate of translation and thus the amount of mRNA does not necessarily directly correlate with the level of protein expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show that combining quantitative real-time PCR and IHC methods on bronchial biopsy tissues can provide a new complementary research tool to study the role of mediators and structural elements in bronchial tissue associated with the inflammatory process in RAO-horses. Future work should focus on examining temporal events in the early stages following challenge exposure, and expanding the range of cytokines examined to study the role of airway epithelial cells in the immunopathogenesis of RAO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Horses</title><p>Seven RAO horses with a history of recurrent episodes of respiratory distress when exposed to dusty stable environment (Mean weight 431 &#x000b1; SD 90 kg, age 19.7 &#x000b1; 6.6 years) and 6 healthy controls (Mean weight 475 &#x000b1; SD 33 kg, age 16.8 &#x000b1; 7.9 years) were included in the study.

After 3 &#x000d7; 5 minute washes in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (TBST), non-specific antibody binding was blocked with undiluted culture medium, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Sigma, Missouri, US) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 minutes. Further blocking of non-specific antibody binding was then done by incubation with swine normal serum for 30 minutes. The primary antibodies IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) diluted in 0.05% TBST with 1% BSA, were applied and incubated overnight. After rinsing with TBST for 3x5 minutes, biotinylated swine anti goat IgG F(ab&#x000b4;)2 (Dako Glostrup Denmark) was applied for 2 hours, followed by the streptavidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase complex (Dako) for another 2 hours. The sections were then visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) to yield a brown colour and counter-stained with Mayer Haematoxylin. TBST treated biopsies were used as negative controls.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Polyclonal antibodies used in IHC staining of bronchial epithelium.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Anti-equine</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Dilution</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Source</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">IL-6</td><td align="left">1: 40</td><td align="left">R &#x00026; D SYSTEM, Abingdon, UK</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IL-10</td><td align="left">1: 25</td><td align="left">R &#x00026; D SYSTEM, Abingdon, UK</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TNF-&#x003b1;</td><td align="left">1: 40</td><td align="left">R &#x00026; D SYSTEM, Abingdon, UK</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Quantification of epithelial expression of cytokines</title><p>Cytokine immunoreactivity was quantified using a colour video camera (Sony DXC-950P &#x02013; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) containing 380,000 effective picture elements (pixels). The camera was connected to a Leica Imaging Workstation, with specific PC software (Leica Q500IW, Leica Cambridge UK). The image setting included a possibility to carefully adjust the individual colour components being displayed by the system in order to ensure a close match between the direct image and that being displayed. Detection of an appropriate colour was quantified using binary definition of colour images as displayed on the screen. The binary image required the user to define which pixel in the image that was to be considered for measurement. In short, the positively stained area was managed as a grid of pixels containing the binary value 1 (the pixel is "set") and remaining area contains the binary value 0 (the pixel is not "set"). All intact epithelium from both sections was used for quantification of epithelial area, from which positive immunoreactivity area was compared to the total measured area.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>The biopsies for PCR were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis.

The difference between mean &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>values for RAO-susceptible horses in remission and controls on pasture for each cytokine was used to count differences in cytokine mRNA expression and statistically tested using the Mann Whitney test. Spearman rank order correlation was used to evaluate the correlation in cytokine expression with PCR and IHC in biopsies and for correlation between cytokine expression and cytological findings. The results from BAL cell counts and pulmonary function from controls and principal animals during pasture were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was set as the level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MR: Contributed to study design, clinical part of the study with sample collection and laboratory work, analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>AR: Performed the real-time PCR test and contributed to the data interpretation.</p><p>J.
