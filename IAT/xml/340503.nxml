Here we report results of a detailed analysis of the r-protein rpA1 gene. A cloned DNA sequence coding for rpA1 has been identified by hybrid-selected translation and amino acid composition analysis. The rpA1 gene was localized to polytene chromosome band 53CD. The nucleotide sequence of the rpA1 gene and its cDNA have been determined. rpA1 is a single copy gene and sequence comparison between the gene and its cDNA indicates that this r-protein gene is intronless. Allelic restriction site polymorphisms outside of the gene were observed, while the coding sequence is well conserved between two Drosophila strains. The protein has unusual domains rich in Ala and charged residues. The rpA1 is homologous to the "A" family of eucaryotic acidic r-proteins which are known to play a key role in the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0130-a" xlink:role="992"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0133-a" xlink:role="995"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0135-a" xlink:role="997"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0136-a" xlink:role="998"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0136-b" xlink:role="998"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="987"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="988"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="989"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="990"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="991"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="992"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="993"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="994"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="995"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="996"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="997"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="998"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="999"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1000"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1001"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1002"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1003"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
