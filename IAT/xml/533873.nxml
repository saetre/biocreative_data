These genes were selected on the basis that they all have high confidence candidate human orthologs and that their function is unknown.

After the sequencing of entire genomes from several metazoans, we are now in an excellent position to take a gene-centric approach to the worm as a model organism. A majority of human genes have homologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In a comparative proteomics study, 83% of the worm proteome was found to have human homologous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Only 11% or less contains nematode specific genes. This makes the worm a suitable model organism for delineating human gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, all transmembrane protein families in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome were classified and the human orthologs identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Predicted proteins with two or more membrane domains were clustered and for each cluster a multiple alignment was created. From the alignments, HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) were built and subsequently used to search for mammalian homologs. The consensus of nine different phylogenetic methods and BLAST were used to assign orthology. This resulted in a total of 174 worm-human orthology assignments with a high confidence.</p><p>Orthologs are sequences that arose from a common ancestor gene and were separated by a speciation event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Identification of orthologs is important, since they might share functionality. In closely related species, such as human and mouse, orthologs are normally trivial to find. However, when comparing distantly related species, e.g. human and worm, this is no longer the case because the similarity levels overall are low. Instead, one needs to rely on sophisticated phylogenetic reconstruction techniques to infer whether two genes stem from a node that corresponds to a speciation split or to a duplication event within a lineage. Close orthologs are likely to have the same biological role in the two organisms. Distant orthologs on the other hand, are less likely to have the same phenotypical role, but may have the same role in the corresponding pathway. Consequently, by studying true <italic>C. elegans </italic>orthologs to human genes experimentally in the worm, one can potentially learn more about the gene function also in humans. Depending on whether duplication(s) have occurred in one or both lineages since the speciation event, orthologs can form one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.</p><p>Paralogs arise from a duplication event. A common scenario when genes are duplicated is that one of the gene copies is under negative selective pressure and therefore retains the function of the ancestor. The other copy might then be more free to evolve a new function different from the ancestral function. This is the reason why paralogs in different species are less likely to share functionality compared to orthologs. Paralogs can be divided into two subtypes &#x02013; outparalogs and inparalogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Outparalogs are paralogs that evolved by gene duplications that happened before the speciation event and therefore they do not form orthologous relationships. Inparalogs, on the other hand, form co-orthologous relationships, since they are paralogs that evolved by gene duplications that happened after the speciation event.</p><p>Here we present an initial functional characterization in <italic>C. elegans </italic>of seventeen genes. The criteria for selecting these genes were that they are high confidence candidate orthologs to human genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and that their function is unknown. They are all predicted to encode transmembrane proteins, which imply that they could constitute as yet unknown receptors, channels or transporters playing important roles in various biological processes in multicellular organisms. We are particularly interested in studying those genes that might have a neuronal function. The phylogeny, membrane topology and domain organization were analyzed. Gene function was explored experimentally in the worm by means of RNA interference induced knock-down phenotypes and gene expression patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Membrane topology predictions</title><p>The consensus of nine different methods was used to predict membrane topologies for the putative <italic>C. elegans </italic>proteins, and two different methods were used to predict signal peptides (see Methods for details). Each predicting method has some margin of error; therefore the consensus from several different predictors is more likely to give a better estimate of the true topology. Results were viewed using the SFINX tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], an example of output can be seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The number of transmembrane (TM) regions ranges between six and ten (except for one of the splice variants of R155.1), with a majority of proteins having six or seven TM regions (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Such proteins are likely to be receptors, channels, or transporters. One case, however, (C36B1.12) is likely to be an intramembrane protease.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Output from SFINX for <bold>(A) </bold><italic>C. elegans </italic>protein C36B1.12 and <bold>(B) </bold>one of its assigned human orthologs Q8TCT8. The overall membrane topology of the two proteins is very similar. The consensus from the different topology predictors is nine transmembrane (TM) regions, a N-terminal signal peptide, and a &#x0003e;150 amino acids non-cytoplasmic N-terminal region. Conserved aspartic acid residues are marked with an asterisk (residues 433 and 516 for C36B1.12; residues 351 and 412 for Q8TCT8). Phobius is the only program used that predicts both TM regions and N-terminal signal peptides. The other programs are designed to only detect TM regions, and therefore, they commonly mistake the signal peptide for a TM region. Numbers on the horizontal axis indicate amino acid positions. Color coding: black = TM region, white = non-cytoplasmic, gray = cytoplasmic, striped = N-terminal signal peptide predicted by Phobius.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-5-85-1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of <italic>C. elegans </italic>&#x02013; human orthologs.

analysis</title><p>The results from the phylogenetic analysis are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The previous orthology assignments are still valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although for some <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes, additional human orthologs have emerged from the sequencing efforts. At present, 29% (5 of 17) of the worm genes have one-to-many ortholog relationship with human genes, which means that there has probably been an expansion in the human lineage. This is the case for C36B1.12 (Q93346) and ZK721.1 (Q9GYF0) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, respectively). 53% (9 of 17) showed a one-to-one relationship with its human ortholog, for example <italic>sft-4 </italic>(Q18864) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Two of the worm genes, F40F9.1 (Q8MQ55, Q8MQ56) and F40F9.2 (Q20241), seem to have a many-to-many relationship (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The phylogenetic tree in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> show somewhat inconclusive support for where the speciation event could have taken place. It is possible that the human gene Q8IVW7 is also an ortholog to the two worm genes. To investigate the ortholog relationship further, Orthostrapper was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Orthostrapper analyzes a set of bootstrap trees instead of the optimal tree for orthologs. The algorithm detects orthologous relations between two (groups of) species. The frequency of orthology assignments in the bootstrap trees can be interpreted as a confidence value for the possible orthology of two proteins. Orthology assignments in the optimal phylogenetic tree that might be incorrect can be identified by their low ortholog bootstrap value. This makes it possible to resolve complicated many-to-many orthologous relationships. When analyzing the multiple alignment for the phylogenetic tree in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> using Orthostrapper, the results showed a stronger support for the human genes Q9BWQ8 and Q969X1 to be the orthologs compared to Q8IVW7 (65% vs. 23%). It seems that the orthologous relationship in this particular case is complicated to elucidate. Still, Q9BWQ8 and Q969X1 are the best candidate human orthologs for the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes F40F9.1 and F40F9.2.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic trees for genes <bold>(A) </bold>C36B1.12 (Q93346), <bold>(B) </bold>F40F9.1a (Q8MQ56), F40F9.1b (Q8MQ55) and F40F9.2 (Q20241), <bold>(C) </bold><italic>sft-4 </italic>(Q18864), and <bold>(D) </bold>ZK721.1 (Q9GYF0).

Orthostrapper results showed a strong support for Q9H6T8 and Q9NXC4 as orthologs to C30H6.2 (84%), whereas the support for Q96NN4 was weaker (57%).

The ZIP proteins have been classified into four groups based on sequence conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; the ZIP subfamily I and II, the gufA subfamily and the LIV-1 subfamily (also called the LZT subfamily).

The other four worm genes appear to belong to the LIV-1 subfamily. This subfamily has a unique metalloprotease motif that raises the possibility that they might have protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within the LIV-1 subfamily there is a subgroup called the KE4 group, to which H13N06.5 and its human ortholog hKE4 (Q92504) belong.</p><p>C36B1.12 was predicted to have a PF04258 domain, a probable signal peptide peptidase (SPP) domain. SPP catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of some signal peptides after they have been cleaved from a preprotein. This processing by SPP is related to protein cleavage by presenilins. Homologs to SPP are divided into five subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis (subfamily SPP and subfamilies SPPL1-4, for SPP like) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. C36B1.12 and its putative human orthologs Q8TCT7, Q8TCT8 and Q8IUH8 belong to the SPPL2 subfamily. The members of subfamilies SPPL1-4 only show homology to SPP in the C-terminal half of the protein and in the N-terminus there is substantial variation. This suggests that the C-terminal part may constitute the proteolytic subdomain, whereas the N-terminus defines the specific function of the respective proteins.</p><p>F40F9.1 and F40F9.2 seem to have a PF01027 domain (UPF0005), which is an uncharacterized protein family. Both F08F1.7 and ZK858.6 may belong to the PF02990 domain family (EMP70). Proteins in this family might be located to endosomal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. F14F3.3 and R155.1 were predicted to have a PF03062 domain, which is annotated as a MBOAT (Membrane bound O-acyl transferases) domain. Biochemically characterized proteins of this group encode enzymes that transfer organic acids onto hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. SFT-4 most likely has a PF02077 (SURF4) domain.

A PF03798 domain (LAG1) was found in Y6B3B.10. This domain is associated with longevity in yeast (Jiang et al. 1998).

Also, germ line expression could not be analyzed, due to germ line silencing. For 18% (3 of 17) of the genes no transgenic lines could be established despite several attempts, and out of the lines established, 14% (2 of 14) showed no expression. This could be due to several reasons (see Discussion). In half of the transgenic lines established, expression was found in more than three different tissues. The most prevalent major tissues of expression were hypodermis (9 of 14 transgenic lines), nervous system and pharyngeal muscle (8 of 14) and intestine (6 of 14).</p><p>Examples of gene expression patterns observed are presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>.

Presenilins are an important group of proteases acting in the nervous system. Abnormal proteolytic cleavage may result in accumulation of pathogenic insoluble proteins, implied in e.g. Alzheimer's disease. We have shown that C36B1.12 is probably expressed in head neurons and intestine; however, the intestinal expression might be ectopic (see Discussion for details), which would imply that the gene is exclusively expressed in neurons. This suggests that the three human orthologs may also encode neuronal functions.</p><p>The membrane topology of human proteins belonging to the presenilin-like family has been analyzed previously. Q8IUH8 was predicted to have seven transmembrane (TM) segments and a cytoplasmic C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the same was predicted for HM13_HUMAN (Swissprot: Q8TCT9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, it should be noted that although the number of TM segments of these predictions is the same, the topologies are in fact different. The fourth segment in the Q8IUH8 prediction is missing from the HM13_HUMAN prediction, and the C-terminal segment in the HM13_HUMAN prediction is missing from the Q8IUH8 prediction. This means that the four C-terminal TM segments are not in register between the predictions, and consequently the loops are on opposite sides. This includes the loop between the putatively catalytic aspartic acid residues also present in presenilins that was predicted cytoplasmic by Ponting et al., and non-cytoplasmic by Weihofen et al. Because of the TM segment disagreement, these aspartic acid residues were predicted to be located in TM5 and TM6 in the Ponting et al. prediction, but in TM4 and TM5 in the Weihofen et al. prediction.</p><p>Merging these two proposed topologies by accepting all TM segments predicted by one or the other study would yield a topology with nine TM segments. Our own analysis of the proteins in question using the SFINX tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] provides strong support for this topology, with the C-terminus in the cytoplasm (data not shown). We therefore propose that both previous TM topologies had incorrectly left out one TM segment, which would correspond to segments 4 and 9 in the 9-TM segment model.</p><p>We further analyzed the other members of this family with SFINX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and consistently found a 9-TM topology model with C-terminus in the cytoplasm. The conserved aspartic acid residues would be located in TM6 and TM7. As an example, the SFINX output for C36B1.12 and one of its human orthologs Q8TCT8 is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The overall topology is very similar between the putative worm protein and all of its orthologs in both human and mouse, as well as the other presenilin-like proteins. One difference, however, is that C36B1.12 and two of its human (Q8TCT8 and Q8IUH8) and mouse orthologs (Q9JJF9 and Q8BHP0) are predicted to have a N-terminal signal peptide, a feature that seems to be missing from the other presenilin-like proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>F40F9.1 and F40F9.2</title><p>F40F9.1 and F40F9.2 are 48% identical to each other on the protein sequence level and they also appear to have similar membrane topologies.

It has been shown that genes closer than 500 bp on opposite strands are likely to have a shared control region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which means that these two genes might be coexpressed. The expression patterns observed are indeed overlapping, although not to a full extent (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

It was predicted to have eleven transmembrane (TM) regions and some of them have been experimentally verified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The high number of TM regions suggests that SID-1 forms a channel. Double stranded RNA is thought to diffuse through this channel, leading to spreading of the RNA and hence, a systemic RNAi effect.

F08F1.7 is probably in an operon with <italic>tth-1 </italic>(F08F1.8, O17389). TTH-1 is likely to belong to the PF01290 domain family (thymosin beta-4), which includes actin-binding proteins, implicating a possible role in cytoskeleton organization. ZK858.6 is predicted to be in an operon with ZK858.5 (Q94421) and ZK858.7 (Q94416). A PF05154 (TM2) domain with unknown function is likely to be present in ZK858.5. ZK858.7 might have a PF04189 domain (eIF3gamma; eukaryotic initiation factor 3, gamma subunit), suggesting that it could be involved in translation. T04A8.12 may be in an operon with T04A8.11 (Q22140) and T04A8.13 (Q22142). T04A8.11 might be a ribosomal protein, since it appears to have a PF00252 (ribosomal L16) domain. T04A8.13 was predicted to have a PF00646 (F-box) domain, which is known for forming structural complexes with other proteins. There are no matching Pfam-A domains for T04A8.12. The best candidate human ortholog to T04A8.12 is FRAG1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor activating gene 1, Q9UHJ9). FRAG1 seems to be ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues and it has also been detected in several human tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

We found that Y41D4A.4 is homologous to F08F1.7 and ZK858.6, and most likely an ortholog to the human gene Q9HD45. Taken together, these findings point to that F08F1.7, ZK858.6 and T04A8.12 might play fundamental biological roles, and that they may be involved in processes such as cellular organization (F08F1.7) and translation (ZK858.6 and T04A8.12).</p></sec><sec><title>F14F3.3 and R155.1</title><p>The human genes Q99908 (BB1) and Q96N66 are probable orthologs to F14F3.3.

LAG1 is a longevity gene that was cloned from yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Members of the LAG1 family are thought to be involved in determining lifespan. However, the phylogenetic tree revealed that Y6B3B.10 and its human and mouse ortholog (P27545) form a tight cluster in the tree, separated from the other LAG1 domain containing proteins, indicating that they may have evolved a slightly different function. Y6B3B.10 showed a wildtype RNAi phenotype and it appears to have an expression restricted to the pharyngeal muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>D2013.10</title><p>D2013.10 is orthologous to Q15055 (human), Q8K1A5 (mouse) and Q9VX39 (<italic>Drosophila</italic>).

D2013.10 is expressed in several tissues in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and it exhibits a wildtype RNAi phenotype.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study illustrates how bioinformatic and experimental analysis can be combined to elucidate putative gene function. We have predicted worm-human orthologs and performed an initial functional characterization of the worm genes. Since orthologs are likely to have the same biological function, a better understanding of the function of the human genes can be accomplished through analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The genes explored in this study were selected from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and they are all predicted to encode transmembrane proteins. Such proteins are attractive to study since many interesting receptors, channels, transporters and signaling proteins are found among them, making them likely to be involved in important regulatory processes in multicellular organisms.</p><p>The number of transmembrane (TM) regions predicted for each protein, is similar to the number predicted for each cluster of putative TM proteins from the former study (&#x000b1; 1 TM region) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For the putative proteins H13N06.5, F14F3.3 and ZK721.1, however, the difference is larger (+2-3 TM regions). This divergence could be due to Remm and Sonnhammer having performed predictions on a cluster and not on individual genes. In addition, they used only the program TMHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] for analyzing membrane topology. TMHMM, when using default settings, may miss weak TM regions, leading to a possible underestimation of the number of TM segments. A better estimate of the true topology can be achieved through the use of several different prediction programs. In this study, we used the consensus of nine different methods provided by the SFINX tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] to assign membrane topology.</p><p>We observed an RNAi phenotype for 11.8% (2 of 17) of the genes when using both strains N2 (wildtype) and <italic>rrf-3 </italic>(RNAi sensitive), respectively. This is in agreement with previous experiments, where 10.3% (N2) and 12.8% (<italic>rrf-3</italic>) phenotypes have been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The RNAi phenotypes for <italic>sft-4 </italic>are consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, the two groups have reported non-overlapping phenotypes, but in this screen we have observed all of them. The Lva (larval arrest) phenotype has also been reported from the genome wide screen using strain <italic>rrf-3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The Dpy (dumpy) phenotype for R155.1 has not been reported before. The gene was downregulated using RNAi by injection in a screen of chromosome III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and the phenotype was found to be wildtype. However, the focus of that analysis was to identify genes involved in cell division and therefore only a few post-embryonic phenotypes were scored. The Dpy phenotype observed is also low penetrant and relatively weak and could therefore be missed. Furthermore, differences in results from RNAi screens have been shown to exist. A 10&#x02013;30% difference between experiments done in both different and in the same laboratories has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>When analyzing expression patterns using transcriptional reporter fusions, one issue of concern is whether the pattern observed is the expression pattern of the native gene or not. Ectopic or lack of expression can occur if the putative promoter used does not include all the regulatory elements. Expression in several different cell types in the pharynx and in the posterior intestinal cells of young animals has been attributed to the use of incomplete promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Another limitation when using extrachromosomal arrays is that analysis of expression in the germ line is not possible, due to germ line silencing.</p><p>The putative promoter used in the transcriptional fusion for C36B1.12 is only 1 kb, due to the presence of an upstream gene. Therefore, it is possible that the intestinal expression seen predominantly in young worms and mostly located to posterior intestinal nuclei, is an artifact of the use of an incomplete promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. If this is the case, C36B1.12 might be expressed exclusively in neurons in the head (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This finding provides support to the idea that C36B1.12 and its three human orthologs encode neuronal functions. A possible consequence of this could be that they act in a fashion analogous to presenilin, or even that they could be involved in &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein processing. It would be interesting to study their role in nervous system development and function, and whether they are linked to neurological disorders</p><p>The transcriptional fusion for T28F3.3 also showed a similar intestinal expression, apart from the specific expression in neurons in the head, ventral nerve cord, vulva and a weak expression in hypodermis. The putative promoter region used is only 0.8 kb, due to the presence of an upstream gene. Thus, the intestinal expression seen for T28F3.3 may once again be related to the use of an incomplete promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Two of the transcriptional fusions (for the genes F14F3.3 and ZK858.6) showed no expression of the reporter gene. This is unlikely due to the use of an incomplete promoter region, since the upstream region included was 2.9 kb and 3.0 kb, respectively. Instead, it might be caused by conditional gene expression, germline silencing or absence of the promoter::<italic>gfp </italic>fusion from the inheritable extrachromosomal array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. For three of the genes in this study we failed to establish transgenic lines. Possible reasons for this could be that the injected DNA concentration was too low or that the sequence was toxic. In either case, the extrachromosomal array formed may not have been sufficiently large to be inheritable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Out of the seventeen genes in this study, three are predicted to be in operons (18%). This is equivalent to the number of genes in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genome that are believed to be in operons (15%). Whether <italic>C. elegans </italic>operons contain genes of related function or not is still unknown. There are, however, some indications that genes encoding proteins of fundamental biological importance might be clustered into operons. For example, genes for mitochondrial proteins have a strong tendency to be together in operons and also genes encoding splicing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shed some light upon the putative function of a few predicted worm-human orthologs. Our aim was to identify genes that could play a role in the nervous system and indeed we have been able to find eight genes that appear to be expressed in neurons. <italic>C. elegans </italic>is an excellent model organism for pursuing the functional characterization of these genes, considering its well mapped and relatively sophisticated nervous system. Investigating the function of orthologous proteins using a simple multicellular organism is a suitable approach for the possibility of learning more about the function of a gene not only in one species but also hopefully in several. This approach becomes even more valid as several genomes are being sequenced at the moment with additional ones already in the pipeline. With the enormous amount of data that these sequencing efforts are generating, it is very useful to be able to start delineating the gene function based on functional characterization of the ortholog in another species, before initiating studies in more complex organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Membrane topology predictions</title><p>The membrane topology was predicted with nine different methods, and the SFINX tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], was used to display the results. Eight membrane topology predictors were used: Phobius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], TMHMM2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], TMHMM1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], PHDhtm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], HMMTOP2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], HMMTOP1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], MEMSAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and TOPPRED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In addition, a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] was constructed for each putative protein sequence. Transmembrane regions were considered positive if they were predicted by a majority of the methods, or by four methods and having a supporting Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity curve. Phobius also predicts N-terminal signal peptides. The signal peptides predicted by Phobius were verified with SignalP1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

It is based on the Swiss-Prot 41.10 and SP-TrEMBL 23.15 databases. The Pfam database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] version 11.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was used for domain assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>The Pfamseq database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] was searched for homologs using the Blastp 2.2.5 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] with default settings and with the putative worm proteins as query. Multiple alignments of full-length sequences were created using POA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] with default settings. Gappy sequences and columns (&#x0003e;50% gaps) and redundant sequences (&#x0003e;99% identical) were removed. The program PHYLOWIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] with tree building method neighbor-joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and PAM distance was used for constructing phylogenetic trees. Trees were also built with observed divergence and Poisson correction as distance methods, however, the results from that analysis are only discussed for genes where there were major differences in bootstrap support. If available, a yeast sequence was used as an outgroup. A total of 500 bootstrap tests were run on trees to assess the significance of the branching order. Only bootstrap values &#x02265; 50% were considered positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Domain assignments</title><p>Pfam-A domains were assigned using the Pfam database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

CGC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] bacterial strain <italic>E. coli </italic>HT115(DE3) was transformed with the L4440 vector (Fire Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]) containing the cloned gene fragment using standard methods. The vector contains an ampicillin (Amp) resistance and strain HT115 is tetracycline (Tet) resistant, so bacteria were selected on Amp (75 &#x003bc;g/ml) and Tet (12.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) plates. Single colonies were picked and grown in cultures of LB with Amp (60 &#x003bc;g/ml) and Tet (12.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 14&#x02013;17 h. The bacterial solution was seeded onto NGM plates containing 1 mM IPTG and 25 &#x003bc;g/ml carbenicillin. Seeded plates were allowed to dry at room temperature. Eggs were prepared with standard bleaching method and transferred to the plates. N2 strain was incubated at 15, 20 and 25&#x000b0;C. <italic>rrf-3 </italic>was incubated only at 15&#x000b0;C and 20&#x000b0;C, since the strain has a temperature-sensitive decrease in broodsize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The hatched worms and their progeny were scored for a number of different phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The phenotypes assayed were: Adl (adult lethal), Bli (blistering of cuticle), Bmd (body morphology defect), Brd (low broodsize), Clr (clear), Dpy (dumpy), Egl (egg laying defect), Emb (embryonic lethal), Gro (slow post-embryonic growth), Him (high incidence of males), Lon (long body), Lva (larval arrest), Lvl (larval lethal), Mlt (molt defect), Muv (multivulva), Prz (paralyzed), Pvl (protruding vulva), Rol (roller), Rup (ruptured), Sck (sick), Sma (small), Ste (sterile), Stp (sterile progeny), Unc (uncoordinated). Emb was defined as greater than 10% dead embryos for N2 and greater than 30% dead embryos for <italic>rrf-3</italic>. Ste and Stp required a brood size of fewer than ten for N2 and fewer than five for <italic>rrf-3</italic>. Each postembryonic phenotype was required to be present among at least 10% of the analyzed worms. The experiment was ongoing for about 4 generations and the phenotypes were scored on a daily basis. A constant supply of transformed HT115 bacteria was ensured. The experiments were performed in duplicates at each temperature for each gene and worm strain. For the postembryonic phenotypes typically at least 20 worms per plate were scored. As a positive control the gene <italic>unc-22 </italic>("twitchin") was used (Fire Laboratory vector pPD34.09 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]).

The reactions were purified and single stranded RNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The two reactions were mixed and annealing was performed to produce double stranded (ds) RNA, which was subsequently purified. The dsRNA was injected undiluted into twelve young adult N2 hermaphrodites for each gene. The injected worms were put on individual plates and split between three different incubation temperatures (15, 20 and 25&#x000b0;C). Phenotypes were scored for both the injected worms and two subsequent generations on a daily basis. Phenotypes scored and criteria for scoring were the same as for the RNAi by feeding of strain N2.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of transgenic lines</title><p>The transgenic lines were constructed at the Baille Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Transcriptional expression constructs for gonadal injection were generated using fusion PCR, also known as "PCR-stitching" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Typically, about 3 kb of genomic DNA sequence immediately upstream of the predicted ATG initiator site, was used as the putative promoter (see supplementary material for primer sequences). When an upstream gene was within the 3 kb, the size of the putative promoter was adjusted downwards. For genes in operons, the sequence upstream of the first gene in the operon was used. The putative promoter was fused with another DNA fragment containing <italic>gfp </italic>(green fluorescent protein) and <italic>unc-54 </italic>3'UTR amplified from vector pPD95.67 (Fire Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional data file 1</xref> for the primer sequences used for generating the fusion PCR products.
