Two forms of Spt7 have been identified, the second of which is truncated at its C-terminus and found in the SAGA-like (SLIK) complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have found that C-terminal processing of Spt7 to its SLIK form (Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>) and to a distinct third form (Spt7<sub>Form3</sub>) occurs in the absence of the SAGA complex components Gcn5, Spt8, Ada1 and Spt20, the latter two of which are required for the integrity of the complex. In addition, N-terminally truncated derivatives of Spt7, including a derivative lacking the histone fold, are processed, indicating that the C-terminus of Spt7 is sufficient for processing and that processing does not require functional Spt7. Using galactose inducible Spt7 expression, we show that the three forms of Spt7 appear and disappear at approximately the same rate with full-length Spt7 not being chased into Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>or Spt7<sub>Form3</sub>. Interestingly, reduced levels of Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>and Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>were observed in a strain lacking the SAGA component Ubp8, suggesting a regulatory role for Ubp8 in the truncation of Spt7.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that truncation of Spt7 occurs early in the biosynthesis of distinct Spt7 containing complexes rather than being a dynamic process linked to the action of the SAGA complex in transcriptional regulation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The multisubunit SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) complex is a prototype for transcriptional coactivators that interface between DNA binding transcriptional regulators, the chromosomal template and the basal transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. SAGA is a dynamic entity, with components existing in subcomplexes having related but distinct functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Ada components of SAGA (<italic>ADA2, NGG1/ADA3, GCN5/ADA4</italic>) were first identified based on their involvement in regulated transcription in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. SAGA possesses histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity mediated by Gcn5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which stimulates or represses transcription in a promoter specific fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The structural core of SAGA is composed of a subset of the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that are also found in TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Spt7, Ada1 and Spt20, members of the TBP-subclass of Spt (Suppressors of Ty insertions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] proteins, are located near the core of the complex and are required for its integrity, forming an interface between TAFs and other SAGA-specific components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The additional Spt proteins, Spt3 and Spt8 are involved in direct interactions with TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Tra1, a 437 kDa, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase related protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] is found at the periphery of the complex and interacts with DNA-binding transcriptional regulators thus conferring promoter specificity to SAGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Through mass spectrometry analysis of purified SAGA complex, other components have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One of these proteins, Sus1, is associated with the nuclear pore mRNA export machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] suggesting that SAGA may have a broader role in nuclear processes than previously envisioned.</p><p>Two forms of Spt7 have been described. The full-length protein of 1332 amino acid residues is found within the SAGA complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The second, a C-terminally truncated form likely arising from processing between residues 1125 and 1150 is found in the SLIK (SAGA-like) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As suggested by the alternate name for this complex, SALSA (SAGA altered, Spt8 absent), SLIK also differs from SAGA in that it lacks Spt8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The absence of Spt8 can be attributed to the fact that it interacts with Spt7 in the region deleted in the truncated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The truncation of Spt7 and the subsequent loss of Spt8 may be a mechanism to create a complex that acts without effects mediated through TBP; for example, the derepression of the <italic>HIS3 </italic>promoter under starvation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A further difference between SAGA and SLIK is that Rtg2, which is required for the retrograde response pathway in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], is found specifically in SLIK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Two other Rtg proteins, Rtg1 and Rtg3 are transcription factors required for the expression of retrograde target genes such as <italic>CIT2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Pray-Grant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] propose that SLIK facilitates transcriptional activation by Rtg1 and Rtg3 and perhaps also at a distinct set of promoters. However, the exact role of SLIK is unclear as the interpretation of transcriptional effects upon disruption of <italic>RTG2 </italic>is complicated since Rtg2 is required for nuclear import of Rtg1 and Rtg3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Two models for the relationship between the Spt7-containing complexes can be envisioned. In the first, processing at the C-terminus would occur as part of the biosynthesis of distinct SAGA and SLIK complexes. Alternatively, processing might occur during the normal functioning of SAGA, perhaps to irreversibly signal that a transcriptional event had occurred and/or enabling subsequent activity of the SLIK complex. In this study we performed experiments to differentiate between these models. We show that the conversion of Spt7 from its full-length SAGA-form (Spt7<sub>SAGA</sub>) to its truncated SLIK-form (Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>) and a third C-terminally processed form (Spt7<sub>Form3</sub>) occurs in the absence of components of the complex including Ada1 and Spt20, which are required for the integrity of the complex. Processing to these forms occurs rapidly after its synthesis and in the absence of full-length Spt7. Taken together our results suggest that processing of Spt7 occurs in the biosynthesis of distinct Spt7-containing complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Truncated forms of Spt7 occur in the absence of fully functional SAGA complex</title><p>Two forms of Spt7 have been described that differ in their length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Full-length Spt7 is 1332 amino acid residues and is found in the SAGA complex. This form, Spt7<sub>SAGA</sub>, migrates with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The SLIK complex contains a C-terminal truncation of Spt7 that results in an apparent molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Based upon the mobility of this form and the differential function of Spt7 derivatives with C-terminal deletions, Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>is predicted to contain a C-terminal truncation of approximately 200 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To detect these forms of Spt7 we engineered a centromeric plasmid expressing a TAP and Flag-tagged version of Spt7 that could be identified after C-terminal truncation (<italic>YCpDed-TAP-Flag-SPT7</italic>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). We first addressed whether this molecule was functional by determining if it would complement a deletion of <italic>spt7 </italic>as assayed by growth on media depleted for inositol. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, a strain lacking <italic>SPT7 </italic>is unable to grow on media lacking inositol. <italic>YCpDed-TAP-Flag-SPT7 </italic>allows for near complete restoration of growth.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Epitope-tagged Spt7 molecules used in this study</italic>. <bold>A </bold>TAP-Flag-Spt7 contains N-terminal TAP and Flag tags fused in frame to the initiator Met of Spt7 (1332 amino acids) via a triple alanine linker encoded by a <italic>NotI </italic>site. Myc-Spt7 has a similar constructed N-terminal myc-epitope while Flag<sub>3</sub>-Spt7 contains 3 tandem copies of the Flag epitope.

Cells were grown in YPD media and protein extracts examined for Spt7 by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 220 and 200 kDa were present in wild-type cells containing <italic>YCpDed-TAP-Flag-SPT7 </italic>but not in control cells (compare lanes 1 and 2). The size of these molecules suggest that they represent the TAP-Flag tagged full-length (Spt7<sub>SAGA</sub>) and SLIK-forms (Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>) of Spt7. The ratio of SAGA:SLIK forms of Spt7 was ~3:1 in the wild-type strain BY4741 (lane 2). This relative amount of Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>was not reduced upon disruption of <italic>GCN5</italic>, <italic>RTG2</italic>, <italic>ADA1, SPT20 </italic>or <italic>SPT8</italic>. Since Spt20 and Ada1 are required for the integrity of the SAGA complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the presence of Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>in these deletion strains indicates that C-terminal processing can occur in the absence of the fully intact and functional complex. (We do note that there was an apparent decrease in the ratio of SAGA:SLIK forms in the <italic>spt20&#x00394;0 </italic>strain and speculate that this may be due to differential stability of the forms in this strain background.) In addition, the wild-type level of Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>seen in the <italic>spt8 </italic>deletion background suggests that the Spt8 interaction with Spt7 does not alter access of the putative processing enzyme(s) to the cleavage site. Furthermore, the lack of a requirement for Rtg2 indicates that the SLIK complex need not fully assemble to allow truncation of Spt7.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>Processed forms of Spt7 in yeast deletion strains</italic>. <bold>A</bold>.

We note that the <italic>ubp8&#x00394;0 </italic>effect was found to vary from approximately two-fold to five-fold between different experiments (not shown). To determine whether the role of Ubp8 was the result of its involvement with SAGA, we examined the Spt7 forms in a strain deleted for Sgf11, a subunit of SAGA required for the association of Ubp8 with components of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, deletion of <italic>sgf11 </italic>partially reduced the level of Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>. This effect was not to the same extent as deletion of Ubp8, perhaps because low levels of Ubp8 remain associated with SAGA in the absence of Sgf11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, while not eliminating other mechanisms, the result is consistent with a model whereby binding of Ubp8 to SAGA may alter the accessibility of the C-terminus of Spt7 to cleavage. Interestingly, another Flag-antibody reactive band, Spt7<sub>Form3</sub>, was evident in the sample lanes but not in the control. Since Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>was somewhat obscured by a Flag antibody cross-reactive band, we analyzed the Spt7 forms in different strain backgrounds after first purifying TAP-Flag-Spt7 on IgG-agarose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). After purification a Flag-reactive molecule with an apparent mass approximately 20 kDa less than Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>(also see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) was revealed. The observed difference in mass of this molecule relative to intact Spt7 estimates an end-point at approximately amino acid residue 950. As was the case for Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>, the level of this third form of Spt7 was comparable in each of the deletion strains (<italic>gcn5&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>spt8&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>spt20&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>ada1&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>rtg2&#x00394;0</italic>) with the exception of <italic>ubp8&#x00394;0 </italic>where it was reduced.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><italic>Formation of truncated forms of Spt7 in N-terminally deleted derivatives</italic>. <bold>A</bold>.

If processing were part of the functional dynamics of SAGA, that is, occurring as a result of its activities in the regulation of transcription, then one would predict that it would require Spt7 in a functional form. We thus examined whether N-terminal deletion derivatives of Spt7, expressed in BY3218 (<italic>spt7&#x00394;0</italic>) would be processed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Each molecule was N-terminally TAP and Flag tagged to allow purification and identification of Spt7 forms. The two longest derivatives (residues 580&#x02013;1332 and 873&#x02013;1332) contain the elements of the protein required for partial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By comparison, the shortest derivative (residues 1038&#x02013;1332) lacks the histone fold, which is required for interaction with other components of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A protein reduced by approximately 20 kDa, an estimated mass consistent with a truncation at the Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>processing site, was seen for each of the derivatives (denoted as SL). A further truncation, approximately 20 kDa smaller than Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>and potentially corresponding to processing at the Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>site (F3), was evident for Spt7<sub>581&#x02013;1332 </sub>and Spt7<sub>873&#x02013;1332 </sub>(though at a reduced level). Note that the third-form equivalent was not seen for Spt7<sub>1037&#x02013;1332</sub>, because its putative cleavage site is removed from this construct. This result suggests that the elements required for processing are intrinsic to the C-terminal end of Spt7 and that the N-terminus of the protein is not required. Furthermore, the appearance of a cleavage product for Spt7<sub>1037&#x02013;1332 </sub>suggests that processing can take place independently from SAGA and is thus not linked to the action of the complex. For Spt7<sub>581&#x02013;1332</sub>, a fourth form was apparent just below Form 3 (marked by *). We have not characterized this form further and can not exclude that it is a degradation product.</p><p>If the forms of Spt7 were created progressively from one another in response to the activity of the complex, one would predict that the longer forms would be chased into shorter forms. We analyzed the appearance and disappearance of the Spt7 forms upon inducing expression of a triple Flag-tagged Spt7 under control of the <italic>GAL10 </italic>promoter (<italic>GAL</italic>-Flag<sub>3</sub>-Spt7; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, cells containing <italic>GAL</italic>-Flag<sub>3</sub>-Spt7 rapidly induce the three Spt7 forms when shifted from raffinose to galactose containing media but not upon shifting to glucose containing media. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> is a time course of the appearance and disappearance of the Spt7 forms after induction in galactose containing media and subsequent shift to media containing glucose. Expression of the forms continued to increase after promoter shut-off until approximately the 60 minute time point. All three forms increased at approximately the same rate. After 60 minutes, the amounts of the Spt7 forms began to decay. This was in contrast to total protein, which continued to increase (comparing the Western blot versus the stained gel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Similar to their appearance, the three forms disappeared at approximately the same rate. The longer forms were not chased into the shorter molecules, suggesting that Spt7<sub>SLIK </sub>and Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>are produced early after the synthesis of Spt7<sub>SAGA </sub>and not sequentially as the result of the action of the complex. Combined with the results above, processing appears inherent to the C-terminus of the molecule and occurs independently from the action of the SAGA complex.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><italic>Time course of the induction and decay of Spt7 forms</italic>. <bold>A</bold>.

The elution profile of the different forms of Spt7 was examined by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody and the relative amounts of the three forms of Spt7 determined by densitometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). All three forms of Spt7 eluted in fractions corresponding to a high molecular mass, the largest being Spt7<sub>SAGA</sub>, followed by Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>. Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>eluted from the column with an average apparent molecular size slightly less than Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>. To determine if Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>was associated with components of the SAGA complex, extracts were prepared from strains containing N-terminally Flag-tagged Spt7 and TAP-tagged versions of Gcn5, Ada2, Ubp8, Taf5, Spt3 and Spt8. Complexes containing the TAP-tagged molecules were partially purified and the presence of the different forms of Spt7 analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;9). Identification of the forms was established by immunoprecipitation of Flag-Spt7 from crude extracts with anti-Flag antibody (compare lanes 1 and 2). As expected from the interaction of Spt8 with the C-terminal end of Spt7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], Spt8 interacted only with full-length Spt7 (lane 8). The other SAGA components interacted with both Spt7<sub>SAGA </sub>and Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>. Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>did not co-purify with the SAGA components to the extent of either Spt7<sub>SAGA </sub>or Spt7<sub>SLIK</sub>.</p><p>The function of Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>is unknown. The fact that Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>appears as stable as the longer forms is consistent with it having a function(s), likely distinct from components of the SAGA complex. It is interesting to note that Spt7 has been found to associate with Ccl1, Rtf1 and Prp43, and that these interactions are not reciprocated by C-terminally TAP-tagged Spt7 or generally by other components of the SAGA complex (<italic>Saccharomyces Genome Database</italic>). In addition, we previously observed a possible SAGA-independent form of Spt7 by fractionation of crude extracts on a Mono Q column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also must consider an alternative model, whereby Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>is an intermediate along a pathway of degradation. In this regard, we did observe an apparent increase in Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>during TAP-purification.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report we show that processing of the C-terminus of Spt7 to the form found in the SLIK complex and to a novel third form does not require a functional SAGA complex. C-terminal truncation occurs in the absence of key components of SAGA and SLIK complexes. Spt20 and Ada1 are necessary for the integrity of a complete SAGA complex with their deletion resulting in severe transcriptional effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], yet processing occurs in their absence. In addition, since the truncated Spt7 molecules were present in a <italic>gcn5&#x00394;0 </italic>strain, histone acetylation is not required for processing. Also suggesting that processing of Spt7 is independent of the function of SAGA, we found that a truncated derivative of Spt7 that lacks the histone fold is capable of being processed in a strain lacking full-length Spt7. Finally a time course revealing the appearance and disappearance of the Spt7 forms showed that Spt7<sub>SAGA </sub>is not chased into the shorter forms. We thus suggest that processing of Spt7 is an independent event in the biosynthesis of distinct Spt7 containing complexes rather than being linked to transcriptional regulation by the SAGA complex.</p><p>Processing of Spt7 showed partial dependence on the ubiquitin protease Ubp8. The role of Ubp8 is unclear but based on a partial effect upon deletion of Sgf11, it may require the association of Ubp8 with SAGA. We were intrigued by the possibility that the effect of Ubp8 may be related to our previous observation of the ubiquitylation of Spt7 dependent on the E3-ubiquitin ligase Tom1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]; however, because the relative amounts of the Spt7 forms appear unchanged in a <italic>tom1&#x00394;0 </italic>strain (not shown) we have concluded that these observations are unrelated.</p><p>Our study has identified a third form of Spt7 with an apparent molecular mass of ~160 kDa. The identification of this form with three different tagged derivatives suggests that it is not an artifact of tagging; however, we can not fully exclude the possibility that N-terminal tagging results in its appearance. Gel-filtration experiments suggest that Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>is found within a complex; albeit, distinct from SAGA or SLIK. As Spt7 was N-terminally tagged, the mobility of Spt7<sub>Form3 </sub>on SDS-PAGE suggests a molecule containing amino acid residues 1 to ~950. Determining the size of the released C-terminal fragment would facilitate mapping of the cleavage site; however, we have been unable to identify this molecule using C-terminally TAP-tagged Spt7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The wild-type yeast strains BY4741 (<italic>MATa his&#x00394;0 leu2&#x00394;0 met1&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0</italic>) and BY4742 (<italic>MAT&#x003b1; his&#x00394;0 leu2&#x00394;0 lys2&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0</italic>) and the consortium constructed isogenic knockout strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] BY3218 (<italic>spt7&#x00394;0</italic>), BY10809 (<italic>ubp8&#x00394;0</italic>), BY17285 (<italic>gcn5&#x00394;0</italic>), BY14619 (<italic>rtg2&#x00394;0</italic>), BY12666 (<italic>spt8&#x00394;0</italic>), BY14433 (<italic>sgf73&#x00394;0</italic>), BY13418 (<italic>sgf29&#x00394;0</italic>), BY2781 (<italic>sgf11&#x00394;0</italic>), BY1038 (<italic>ada1&#x00394;0</italic>) and BY17390 (<italic>spt20&#x00394;0</italic>), and strains containing C-terminally TAP-tagged SAGA components were purchased from Open Biosystems or Research Genetics.
