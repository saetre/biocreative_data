In distinct migratory models, the Exocyst complex has been shown to be involved in secretory events and migration. By RNA interference (RNAi) we show that the polarised delivery of the Exocyst to the leading edge of migrating NRK cells is dependent upon aPKCs. Reciprocally we demonstrate that aPKC localisation at the leading edge is dependent upon the Exocyst. The basis of this inter-dependence derives from two-hybrid, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, which demonstrate the existence of an aPKC&#x02013;Exocyst interaction mediated by Kibra. Using RNAi and small molecule inhibitors, the aPKCs, Kibra, and the Exocyst are shown to be required for NRK cell migration and it is further demonstrated that they are necessary for the localized activation of JNK at the leading edge. The migration associated control of JNK by aPKCs determines JNK phosphorylation of the plasma membrane substrate Paxillin, but not the phosphorylation of the nuclear JNK substrate, c-jun. This plasma membrane localized JNK cascade serves to control the stability of focal adhesion complexes, regulating migration. The study integrates the polarising behaviour of aPKCs with the pro-migratory properties of the Exocyst complex, defining a higher order complex associated with the localised activation of JNK at the leading edge of migrating cells that determines migration rate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cell migration is an essential process in multicellular organisms during such events as embryonic development, the immune response, and wound healing. Cell migration is also instrumental in the development of pathologies such as cancer cell invasion of healthy tissues. To make cells move, key molecules must be engaged in a coordinated manner; understanding which molecules, and how and when they work (for example, under physiological versus pathological conditions) will impact on new therapies designed to suppress abnormal migration. Migrating cells must coordinate two key processes: extension of the front or &#x02018;leading&#x02019; edge of the cell and retraction of the back edge. Both processes require the turnover of protein assemblies known as focal adhesion complexes. In this paper we show that two different groups of regulators of migration &#x02013; aPKC, a protein kinase, and exocyst, a complex of proteins also known to be required for exocytosis &#x02013; interact physically via the scaffold protein kibra. All these components are required for efficient cell migration and all are enriched at the leading edge of moving cells, in a mutually dependent manner. At the leading edge, these components control the local activation of two additional protein kinases, ERK and JNK. The activation of ERK and JNK at the front of migrating cells in turn controls the phosphorylation of paxillin, a component of focal adhesions. Phosphorylation of paxillin is associated with the presence of more dynamic focal adhesions. Our data thus indicate that an aPKC-kibra-exocyst complex plays a crucial role in delivering local stimulatory signals to the leading edge of migrating cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Migration of cells is critical to the development and the normal physiology of organisms; it also plays a more sinister role in the dissemination of cancer towards metastatic disease, a process typically associated with poor prognosis.

This has led to the specific hypothesis that there is a molecular and functional interaction between the Par/CDC42/PKC&#x003b6;/&#x003b9; pathway and the Ral/Exocyst pro-migratory pathways. We demonstrate that indeed there is a mutual dependence of aPKC and Exocyst in their behaviour in migratory cells and this is associated with their mutually dependent regulation of the delivery of signals to the leading edge of migrating cells. We identify key regulatory processes under the control of these local aPKC/Exocyst-dependent signals and go on to demonstrate that the regulation of focal adhesion stability represents a critical migratory output of the aPKC/Exocyst pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Atypical PKCs Are Necessary for NRK Cell Migration</title><p>A cooperative functional relationship between the Exocyst complex and aPKC in cell migration should be reflected in a shared requirement in a model system. The Exocyst has been shown previously to play an essential role in NRK cell migration. So to determine the requirements for PKC&#x003b9; and PKC&#x003b6; in NRK cell migration, two independent siRNAs for each protein were employed to knock-down expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Selected combinations of these inhibitors can be exploited to provide circumstantial evidence on the requirements of PKC isoforms based upon their relative potency such that an aPKC activity involvement would be sensitive to the pan-PKC inhibitor G&#x000f6;6983 (cPKC, nPKC, aPKC) while showing little sensitivity to BIMI (cPKC, nPKC) or G&#x000f6;6976 (cPKC). G&#x000f6;6983 had a profound effect on cell migration, while the cPKC inhibitor G&#x000f6;6976 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). BIMI had a weaker effect than the G&#x000f6;6983 on migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Although these inhibitors are not entirely PKC-specific, in combination with the siRNA data it can be concluded that aPKCs are required for efficient NRK cell migration, providing a model in which to probe an aPKC-Exocyst relationship in migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>aPKCs and the Exocyst Complex Are Recruited to the Leading Edge of Migrating Cells in a Mutually Dependent Manner</title><p>To assess a connection between aPKC isoforms and the Exocyst, we sought to determine their distribution in migrating cells. Examination of the location of aPKCs (combined PKC&#x003b9; and PKC&#x003b6;) demonstrated that aPKC was localised at the leading edge of migrating NRK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, in confluent cells, aPKCs are mainly cytosolic and sometimes partially at cell-cell contacts (unpublished data). A monoclonal antibody specific for PKC&#x003b9; confirmed its presence at the leading edge as well as within a perinuclear compartment; PKC&#x003b6; specific reagents were found to cross-react with recombinant PKC&#x003b9; precluding PKC&#x003b6;-specific immunostaining (Dr. M. Linch and PJP unpublished results). The Exocyst (here visualized by the subunits Sec6 and Exo70) is also in part localized at the leading edge of migrating cells and the pattern of aPKC distribution matches that observed for the Exocyst complex. The localisation of aPKC and the Exocyst at the leading edge of migrating cells is not simply a function of membrane ruffling. In subconfluent monolayers extensive membrane ruffling is observed without enrichment of aPKC or the Exocyst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s001">Figure S1</xref>), while the ruffles at the leading edge of migrating cells are enriched with aPKC and the Exocyst.</p><fig id="pbio-1000235-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000235.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mutual, microtubule dependent control of aPKC and the exocyst at the leading edge.</title><p>(A) Monolayers of NRK cells were wounded 60 h post-transfection with the indicated siRNAs (10 nM).

Knock-down of Sec5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) prevented aPKC localisation at the leading edge without disturbing the total amount of aPKC in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Knock-down of another component of the Exocyst complex, Exo84, also prevented aPKC localisation at the leading edge (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). When one of the components of Exocyst complex (either Sec5 or Exo84) is depleted, more than 50&#x00025; of the cells have a total absence of PKC&#x003b9; at the leading edge. Consistent with this, migration was inhibited on knock-down of Sec5 and Exo84 by 60&#x00025;. Reciprocally it was found that siRNA to aPKCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s002">Figure S2A, S2C</xref>) or treatment with the inhibitor G&#x000f6;6983 (unpublished data) suppressed Exo70 (for more than 60&#x00025; of the cells) and Sec6 accumulation at the leading edge. This disruption of localisation is not due to a modification of the protein levels of Exo70 and Sec6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The recruitment of aPKC and Exo70 at the leading edge were quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s002">Figure S2A, S2B, S2C</xref>). We also evaluated the specificity of the staining as well as the effect on the knock-down of the Exocyst (Sec5 or Exo84) on the presence of aPKC at the leading edge and reciprocally the effect on the knock-down of aPKC on the presence of Exo70 at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s002">Figure S2A, S2B</xref>). Notably, depletion of either PKC&#x003b9; or PKC&#x003b6; partially inhibited the &#x0201c;tubularisation&#x0201d; of the Sec6 compartment seen in motile cells on methanol fixation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s003">Figure S3C</xref>), suggesting that aPKC is required for the localization of Sec6 on microtubules in response to cell migratory cues. Depletion of PKC&#x003b9; or PKC&#x003b6; or Sec5 did not dramatically affect the stability of the microtubules (unpublished data). To control for the possibility of global disruptive effects of aPKC on vesicle-staining patterns in migrating cells, &#x003b2;-COP proteins were monitored.

Antibodies to the Exocyst subunit Sec8 efficiently immunoprecipitated the native complex; probing this immunopurified complex for the presence of aPKC showed that aPKC was also associated. By contrast the related PKC&#x003b5; and PKC&#x003b4;, which are also expressed in NRK cells, were not recovered in association with the immunopurified Exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Immunoprecipitation with anti-mycPKC&#x003b6; or PKC&#x003b9; antibodies did not recover detectable Sec8 in the immunoprecipitate; it would seem that only a subfraction of PKC&#x003b9; or PKC&#x003b6; is complexed to Sec8. Direct demonstration of the interaction in cells employing FRET approaches has not proved possible because the GFP-fusions of Exocyst subunits have been found not to enter into mature Exocyst complexes (unpublished data) in contrast to the findings in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Boyd1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given the predicted requirement for activity in the migratory behaviour described above, it was important to determine whether the Exocyst associated aPKC was catalytically active.

To examine if cell migratory cues impact the stability of the interaction between the Exocyst and aPKC, a monolayer of confluent NRK cells was extensively scratched to maximize the number of &#x0201c;free edges&#x0201d; where cell-cell contacts are released. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, cell migration promoted the interaction between aPKC and the Exocyst at 3 h and 6 h.

To assess whether the endogenous aPKCs are associated with the endogenous Exocyst via Kibra, we submitted protein extracts from scratch wounded NRK cells, depleted or not of endogenous Kibra, to immunoprecipitation with anti-Sec8.

Depletion of ERK2 and JNK1 and not ERK1 elicited an increase of Paxillin patches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is established here that aPKC isoforms via the Exocyst complex can confer efficient migration through their ability to control the leading edge activation of a distinct subpopulation of MAPKinases, conferring increased speed on the serum-dependent migratory response of cells. This localised process is enabled through the traffic of an aPKC-Exocyst complex to the leading edge of migrating cells. Assembly of this complex is dependent upon Kibra, which appears to act as a scaffold linking aPKC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Kremerskothen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Buther1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> with Sec3 through non-overlapping binding domains. Whilst assembly is not dependent upon aPKC activity, it is promoted by migratory conditions and immuno-isolation of the Exocyst-aPKC complex demonstrates that the associated aPKC is catalytically active. The Exocyst complex is required for aPKC accumulation at the leading edge. Reciprocally, the association of the Exocyst with active aPKC correlates with a requirement for aPKC expression and activity for the traffic of the Exocyst to the leading edge of migrating cells. The Exocyst-Kibra-aPKC complex traffics in a microtubule-dependent fashion to the leading edge of migrating NRK cells and this is a necessary event to promote efficient/directed migration. The control of aPKCs on the Exocyst at the leading edge could be explained by control of microtubule dynamics by aPKC as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Harris1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this pattern of behaviour, knock-down of Exocyst subunits or aPKC isoforms, or inhibition of aPKC isoforms (G&#x000f6;6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor) inhibits migration.</p><p>The migratory model itself requires the presence of serum and matrix interactions for migration. For NRK cells, migration occurs on fibronectin, laminin, and collagen with all three displaying a requirement for aPKC for optimum migration. By contrast in RPE1 cells, migration on fibronectin is aPKC-dependent but on laminin or collagen migration is relatively insensitive to knock-down of aPKC. As evident from the NRK cell model here, which is 60&#x00025; dependent on aPKC, there are multiple modes of migration that display differential dependence on control mechanisms and these vary between cells.</p><p>Mechanistically, the aPKC-Exocyst assembly in the NRK cell model confers JNK and ERK activation at the leading edge and furthermore JNK1 (and not JNK2) as well as ERK2 (and not ERK1) inhibition blocks cell migration. JNK's effects appear to be mediated in part through the phosphorylation of Paxillin on serine 178, determining the dynamics of focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Huang2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Huang3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. aPKCs also control the phosphorylation of Paxillin by ERK1/2 on serine 126 (unpublished data). These phosphorylations were described to be important for the turnover of Paxillin at the focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Huang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Huang2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Huang3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Liu1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the knock-down of aPKC&#x003b6;/&#x003b9; or Sec5 (or Exo84) causes Paxillin accumulation in large, static focal adhesions. Thus we have mapped a pathway from the assembly of the aPKC-Exocyst complex, through their mutual delivery to the leading edge of migrating cells, the activation there of ERK and JNK, and the consequent phosphorylation of Paxillin, influencing the dynamics of focal adhesion turnover and migration. Video microscopy experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s011">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s012">S2</xref>) are compatible with the regulation of Paxillin dynamics being under aPKC control. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed also an interaction between Sec8 and Paxillin in NRK cells. Paxillin was shown recently as a partner of Sec5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Spiczka1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction between Sec8 and Paxillin increased during NRK cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These data suggest that there is an acute regulation of Paxillin by aPKC.</p><p>The action of aPKCs in conferring this promigratory behaviour reflects their role in directing the subcellular localisation of signals. Such spatially resolved behaviour of cellular regulators is increasingly recognised as a critical factor in determining the nature of their output. Here the evidence is for the localised action of the JNK pathway (in particular JNK1) in migration. The depletion of JNK1 decreases the P-JNK staining at the leading edge. Only JNK1 and not JNK2 knock-down inhibits cell migration and G&#x000f6;6983 inhibits only the phosphorylation of JNK1 and not JNK2 during cell migration. These three observations provide compelling evidence that JNK1 is a key player in the JNK pathway responsible for aPKC-dependent NRK cell migration. Activation of JNK1 at the leading edge, effected through the aPKC-Kibra-Exocyst complex, is necessary for the phosphorylation of Paxillin in this compartment, while the migration-associated, JNK-dependent phosphorylation of nuclear c-jun is immune to aPKC-Kibra<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-Exocyst function. Conversely it is evident that the activated JNK engaged in c-jun phosphorylation (probably JNK2) is not able to trigger Paxillin phosphorylation at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The aPKC-dependent plasma membrane activation of both JNK and ERK is driven by delivery of upstream controls and not through the localisation of the JNK or ERK proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This lack of effect on ERK and JNK recruitment at the leading edge when the Exocyst-aPKCs is disrupted by various siRNAs shows that a leading edge is preserved; aPKC/Exocyst disruption does not disorganise globally the leading edge, and cells still retain oriented protrusions. Moreover, the distribution of the actin cytoskeleton of migrating cells at the wound edge is retained as described by Guo et al. using siRNA against Exo70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Zuo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These MAPKinases along with characteristic cortical actin structures retain their leading edge location independent of aPKC-Kibra-Exocyst action and their activation by phosphorylation. It is implicit that the polarised delivery and/or retention of these MAPKinases at the leading edge is dependent on distinct non-aPKC signal(s).</p><fig id="pbio-1000235-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000235.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the aPKC-exocyst complex in cell migration.</title><p>The Exocyst-Kibra-aPKC complex controls the activation, but not the localisation of JNK1 and ERK1/2 at the leading edge, via a microtubule dependent process. The active JNK1 and ERK1/2 can then phosphorylate the common substrate, Paxillin, determining the stability of focal adhesion dynamics. By contrast, the activation of JNK2 and c-Jun in the nucleus during cell migration is independent of the Exocyst-aPKC pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000235.g007"/></fig><p>The upstream signals required for the activation of JNK appears to involve MKK4 and not MKK7 since the former shows sensitivity to inhibition of aPKC (pan-PKC) in its migration-induced activation, while the latter is insensitive. Although the depletion of MKK4 inhibits cell migration consistent with the proposed role for MKK4, so does the depletion of MKK7, preventing distinction to be made between these two JNK kinases. However, it is notable that the morphology of cells depleted of MKK4 (but not of MKK7) is a phenocopy of the cells depleted of aPKC (bigger, more spread cells), consistent with the selective effects of aPKC inhibition on MKK4; cells depleted of MKK7 displayed a stressed appearance after wounding that was quite distinct from the morphological phenotype of MKK4 and aPKC knock-down cells. It is concluded that MKK7, though not activated during migration, is probably required for migration in an aPKC independent pathway.</p><p>PKC&#x003b9; can control JNK via Par6 and Rac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Fields1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, however the control exerted during cell migration via MEK4 remains under investigation. HGK, a MAPKKKKinase specific for the JNK pathway, was described to interact with the Exocyst complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Balakireva1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. So one possibility is that aPKCs could control the interaction of HGK with Exocyst complex. Although the Exocyst has been associated with secretory events, the upstream trigger for activation is not thought to be dependent upon any factor(s) secreted following movement of the Exocyst to the leading edge, since conditioned medium from wounded cells does not rescue wounded cells where the Exocyst subunit Sec5 has been knocked down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s003">Figure S3E, S3F</xref>). It would appear that the trigger for activation derives from changes in cell-cell/matrix interactions triggered by removal of cells from the monolayer (wounding).</p><p>In conclusion, aPKCs via the Exocyst complex and Kibra are shown to exert a pro-migratory role in NRK cells and do so through the regulated delivery of a signal to the leading edge of migrating cells through kinases upstream of JNK1 and ERK1/2. This regulation of the ERK and JNK pathways via aPKCs allows the phosphorylation of a common substrate, Paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000235-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and consequently probably the turnover of Paxillin at the focal adhesion sites. The combined actions of this complex thus integrate the polarised, leading edge delivery of signals required for efficient migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Wound Assay</title><p>Normal rat kidney (here denoted NRK, but specifically NRK-49F cells, confirmed by &#x000df;-catenin staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000235-Yeaman1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000235.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum under 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> on Falcon plastic dishes.
