However, estrogen has also been shown to induce the expression of the tumor suppressor gene, <italic>BRCA1</italic>. Upregulation of BRCA1 is thought to be a feedback mechanism for controlling DNA repair in proliferating cells. Estrogens enhance transcription of target genes by stimulating the association of the estrogen receptor (ER) and related coactivators to estrogen response elements or to transcription complexes formed at activator protein (AP)-1 or specificity protein (Sp)-binding sites. Interestingly, the BRCA1 gene lacks a consensus estrogen response element. We previously reported that estrogen stimulated BRCA1 transcription through the recruitment of a p300/ER-&#x003b1; complex to an AP-1 site harbored in the proximal BRCA1 promoter. The purpose of the study was to analyze the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites flanking the AP-1 element to basal and estrogen-dependent regulation of BRCA1 transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Using transfection studies with wild-type and mutated BRCA1 promoter constructs, electromobility binding and shift assays, and DNA-protein interaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we investigated the role of Sp-binding sites and cAMP response element (CRE)-binding sites harbored in the proximal BRCA1 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that in the BRCA1 promoter the AP-1 site is flanked upstream by an element (5'-GGGGCGGAA-3') that recruits Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 factors, and downstream by a half CRE-binding motif (5'-CGTAA-3') that binds CRE-binding protein. In ER-&#x003b1;-positive MCF-7 cells and ER-&#x003b1;-negative Hela cells expressing exogenous ER-&#x003b1;, mutation of the Sp-binding site interfered with basal and estrogen-induced BRCA1 transcription. Conversely, mutation of the CRE-binding element reduced basal BRCA1 promoter activity but did not prevent estrogen activation. In combination with the AP-1/CRE sites, the Sp-binding domain enhanced the recruitment of nuclear proteins to the BRCA1 promoter. Finally, we report that the MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1) inhibitor PD98059 attenuated the recruitment of Sp1 and phosphorylated ER-&#x003b1;, respectively, to the Sp and AP-1 binding element.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These cumulative findings suggest that the proximal BRCA1 promoter segment comprises <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that are targeted by Sp-binding and CRE-binding proteins that contribute to regulation of BRCA1 transcription.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression in mammary tissue is under the control of ovarian steroids, including estrogen, which regulates transcription activity of target promoters by stimulating the recruitment of either the estrogen receptor (ER)-&#x003b1; or ER-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the classical pathway, the liganded ER-&#x003b1; homodimerizes and binds directly to DNA at estrogen response elements (EREs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The physical contact of the ER-&#x003b1; homodimer with DNA facilitates the subsequent recruitment of coregulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The latter factors contribute to chromatin reorganization and transcriptional coactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Alternatively, the ER-&#x003b1; can physically interact with DNA-bound protein complexes containing, among other factors, the activator protein (AP)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], cAMP response element (CRE [TGACGTCA])-binding protein (CREB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], or specificity protein (Sp) family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The Sp factors have been shown to bind directly to the consensus GC-rich region 5'-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)-3' or DNA-bound AP-1 transcription complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Members of the Sp family of transcription factors exert differential effects on gene transcription. For example, Sp1 and Sp4 have been shown to act as transcriptional activators, whereas Sp3 was reported to antagonize Sp1 activation functions by competing for promoter occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Sp family members play a significant role in tissue and organ development, because mice lacking at least one of the Sp proteins exhibit various physiological abnormalities, including embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Increased expression of Sp1 has been detected in gastric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] pancreatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] tumors. In addition to inducing the recruitment of ER to target promoters, estrogen influences gene expression through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which phosphorylate the ER-&#x003b1; and other transcription factors including Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Phosphorylation of these factors increases their binding affinity for cognate DNA elements or DNA-bound coregulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The breast cancer susceptibility gene <italic>BRCA1 </italic>encodes a phosphoprotein that is involved in the DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and regulation of cell cycle checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. About 30% to 40% of sporadic breast cancers, which represent the vast majority (90% to 95%) of breast cancer cases, exhibit lower or absent levels of BRCA1 in the absence of mutations in the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Because altered regulation of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>may increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer, it is important to examine the molecular events that regulate normal BRCA1 expression.</p><p>In proliferating breast epithelial cells, the cellular levels of BRCA1 mRNA and protein have been shown to increase in response to estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter harbors two distinct transcriptional start sites (exon-1A and exon-1B). However, translation of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mRNA always starts from the ATG codon located on exon-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Upregulation of BRCA1 expression in response to estrogen may represent a feedback mechanism that represses ER-signaling during the early stages of breast tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This interpretation is supported by evidence indicating that the BRCA1 protein represses the transcriptional activity of the liganded ER-&#x003b1; and estrogen-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene appears not to be regulated by estrogen through the classical pathway, because the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter lacks canonical EREs. Recently, our laboratory reported that estrogen stimulated <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter activity by inducing the recruitment of an ER-&#x003b1;/p300 transcription complex to an AP-1 element in close proximity to the transcriptional start site of exon-1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The objective of the present work was to elucidate the roles played by Sp-binding and CRE-binding elements flanking the AP-1 site in regulation of BRCA1 transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experimental research reported in the manuscript has been performed with the approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ, USA), on 20 December 2005.</p><sec><title>Cell culture and chemicals</title><p>MCF-7 and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Then, cells were trypsinized and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold 25 mmol/l Hepes buffer containing 1.5 mmol/l EDTA, 1 mmol/l DTT, 0.5 mmol/l PMSF and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, and placed on ice for 10 minutes.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants containing nuclear protein were stored at -70&#x000b0;C. Nuclear protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce Chemical Company). Oligonucleotides used for binding and shift assays are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed then phosphorylated at the 5'-end with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32 </sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using the TE-10 spin columns (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Binding assays were performed by incubating 5 &#x003bc;g nuclear protein in the binding buffer then incubated with the labeled oligonucleotides for 20 minutes. For supershift assays, antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO, USA) were incubated with 1 &#x003bc;g nuclear extracts for 2 hours before addition of labeled oligonucleotides. For cold competition, a 100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction 10 minutes before addition of the labeled oligonucleotides.

Previous studies from our laboratory documented that estrogen stimulated BRCA1 expression by inducing the recruitment of an ER-&#x003b1;/p300 complex at an AP-1 site located close to the transcription start site of exon-1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The objective of this study was to define the role of Sp and CRE binding sites flanking the AP-1 element. The Sp-binding domain (5'-GGGGCGGAA-3') shared homology with the Sp1 consensus sequence (5'-[G/T]GGGCGG [G/A] [G/A]-3'). We found that mutation of the Sp site reduced basal and estrogen-dependent <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter activity in MCF-7 cells expressing endogenous ER-&#x003b1;. In transfected Hela cells expressing exogenous ER-&#x003b1;, the mutation of the Sp site led to a striking reduction in basal activity and reduced the estrogen activation. Cumulative data from DNA:protein binding and ChIP assays with BRCA1 oligonucleotides spanning the GC-rich and AP-1 domain suggested that estrogen stimulated the recruitment of Sp-1, Sp4, and ER-&#x003b1; but did not affect the constitutive occupancy by Sp-3. Therefore, the estrogen-dependent activation of the proximal <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter requires the intact Sp-binding site and appears to be mediated by increased occupancy of Sp1/Sp4 and ER-&#x003b1; as compared with Sp3.</p><p>Previous studies have documented that Sp3 can both enhance and inhibit transactivation. For example, the estrogen-dependent regulation of the <italic>VEGFR2 </italic>(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) promoter was primarily regulated by ER-&#x003b1;/Sp3 and ER-&#x003b1;/Sp4, but not Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Conversely, recent findings by the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] documented a role for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in regulating the <italic>VEGFR1 </italic>gene. Similarly, other reports corroborated a role for ER-&#x003b1;/Sp1 in estrogen-dependent activation of the interleukin-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], insulin-like growth factor-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and cdc25A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] gene promoter. Our results indicate that Sp1 and Sp4 play a specific role in estrogen-dependent regulation of BRCA1 transcription. Interestingly, mutation of the Sp site did not prevent the recruitment of the ER-&#x003b1; to BRCA1 oligonucleotides harboring the AP-1 domain, but it reduced transcriptional activity. These findings suggest that the estrogen-induced association of Sp1 and Sp4 at the GC-box may be functionally required for estrogen-mediated transactivation of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter. The observation that the Sp-binding site enhanced the recruitment of nuclear proteins to BRCA1 oligonucleotides comprising the AP-1 and CRE elements suggests the Sp site may increase the stability of the ER-&#x003b1;/p300 complex recruited at the adjacent AP-1 site. In electromobility shift assays, we observed constitutive recruitment of CREB to a half-CRE (5'-CGTAA-3') located just downstream from the AP-1 motif. However, the constitutive occupancy by CREB was not altered by the estrogen treatment or the presence of the upstream Sp-binding site.</p><p>One possible model that integrates the current results is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Activation of BRCA1 transcription by estrogen may be dependent on the increased interaction between Sp1, Sp4, and ER-&#x003b1; bound respectively to the Sp and AP-1 elements located in the proximal region of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter. The occupancy by CREB at the half-CRE may serve as an ancillary factor that regulates constitutive activity. Interactions between ER-&#x003b1;, Sp1, and Sp4 may trigger the subsequent recruitment of cofactors such as p300, which can function as a histone acetyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], thus leading to estrogen-dependent activation of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene.

In this study, we found that the treatment with estrogen increased the binding of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter by Sp1 and Sp4, but it did not alter the levels of bound Sp3. Similar to other genes involved in the oncogenic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], the relative occupancy ratio between Sp proteins may play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene. For example, elevated Sp3 levels have been shown to promote pancreatic and breast cancer cell growth by inhibiting transcription of growth inhibitory genes including thosse encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and the type II receptor for transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover, pancreatic cells transfected with small inhibitory RNA targeting Sp3 exhibited increased cell cycle distribution in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>and decreased distribution in S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely, Sp1 sites were required for activation of the p21 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Based on the observation that Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation can be repressed by Sp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], a shift in the Sp1/Sp4 versus Sp3 binding ratio may alter normal estrogen regulation of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene. The model depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> of cooperative interactions between DNA-bound Sp proteins and ER-&#x003b1; recruited at an AP-1 site is similar to that reported for the E2F1 promoter, whose transactivation by the ER-&#x003b1; was found to be independent of direct interactions with promoter elements and was regulated by a multiprotein complex comprising ER/Sp1/NF-Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>by estrogen may require activation of the MAPK cascade.

The activated ERK1/2 may add phosphate groups to ER-&#x003b1; and Sp and modulate protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions of these factors at target promoters.

Estrogen stimulates the recruitment of Sp1 and Sp4, but not Sp3, to the GC-rich region. We also provide evidence that the AP-1 site is flanked by a CRE-binding domain that regulates constitutive expression. The close proximity of the Sp, AP-1, and CRE-binding sites may be important for the recruitment of transcriptional complexes and regulation of basal and estrogen-dependent BRCA1 transcription. Finally, we provide evidence that the MAPK pathway regulates the association of Sp1 and ER-&#x003b1; with the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter.
