Rapamycin inhibits cell growth and promotes cell cycle arrest at G1 (G0). However, little is known about whether Tor is involved in other stages of the cell division cycle. Here we report that the rapamycin-sensitive Tor complex 1 (TORC1) is involved in G2/M transition in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Strains carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>KOG1</italic> (<italic>kog1-105</italic>) encoding an essential component of TORC1, as well as yeast cell treated with rapamycin show mitotic delay with prolonged G2. Overexpression of Cdc5, the yeast polo-like kinase, rescues the growth defect of <italic>kog1-105</italic>, and in turn, Cdc5 activity is attenuated in <italic>kog1-105</italic> cells. The TORC1-Type2A phosphatase pathway mediates nucleocytoplasmic transport of Cdc5, which is prerequisite for its proper localization and function. The C-terminal polo-box domain of Cdc5 has an inhibitory role in nuclear translocation. Taken together, our results indicate a novel function of Tor in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell growth (increase in cell mass) and proliferation (increase in cell number) are tightly linked with the cell's perception of its nutritional environment.

Tor signaling participates in two complexes; Tor complex 1 (TORC1) is sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin, whereas Tor complex 2 (TORC2) is not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Loewith1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Yeast TORC1 consists of either of the two yeast Tor homologs, Tor1 or Tor2 together with co-factors Kog1, Lst8, and Tco89. With the exception of Tco89, these proteins are essential and widely conserved in eukaryotes. Rapamycin-sensitive Tor signaling mediated by TORC1 mainly regulates temporal aspects of cell growth: protein synthesis, amino acid uptake, autophagy induction. On the other hand, TORC2, consisting of Tor2, Avo1-3 and Lst8, regulates spatial aspects of cell growth, e.g. organization of actin cytoskeleton. TORC1 function is critical for protein synthesis activities such as translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Barbet1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Honma1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

G0 arrest caused by dysfunction of Tor is mainly explained by impairment of protein synthesis, because mutants of genes involved in early G1 progression (e.g. <italic>cdc25</italic>, <italic>cdc33</italic>, and <italic>cdc35/cyr1</italic>) display a similar phenotype, the stringent response of macromolecular synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Johnston1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Iida1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Type 2A phosphatase (PP2A) and PP2A-like phosphatase (Sit4) are identified as major downstream targets of the TORC1 pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Jacinto1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Jiang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, it is an urgent issue to resolve how rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 activity influences cell proliferation. However, a detailed analysis of how Tor regulates the cell cycle through the control of cell growth has not yet been performed.</p><p>In this study we generated temperature-sensitive <italic>KOG1</italic> mutants to investigate the relationship of rapamycin-sensitive TOR signaling pathway to cell cycle progression. Genetic and biochemical analyses of <italic>kog1</italic> mutants led us the unexpected finding that TORC1 is involved in mitotic entry via regulation of polo-like kinase, Cdc5. Microscopy revealed that TORC1-PP2A pathway regulates the nuclear translocation of Cdc5, which is an indispensable step for its subsequent localization and function. Using these results, we present a model of how TORC1 facilitates nuclear transport of Cdc5 to promote mitotic entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To closely study the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 function, we generated temperature-sensitive mutants of <italic>KOG1</italic>, an essential component of TORC1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Loewith1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Hara1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

It took longer than 6 h to achieve arrest at G1 by rapamycin, whereas it took only 1&#x02013;2 h for reach G1 arrest by &#x003b1;-mating pheromone (data not shown), suggesting that cell cycle progression is delayed in rapamycin-treated cell.

Characteristic to G2 phase these cells had medium to large buds with short spindles and undivided nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). This unexpected result raised two questions: why do <italic>kog1-105</italic> cells not arrest at G1; and does rapamycin treatment or nutrient depletion also cause retardation at G2? To address the first question, yeast cell culture arrested with nocodazole at metaphase was released into fresh medium. Cells released into rapamycin-containing medium re-arrested at G1 as unbudded cells right after they exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

This result also implies that cell cycle stage delayed by <italic>kog1-105</italic> is one that occurs prior to the stage of arrest caused by nocodazole (metaphase). Autophagy, which is induced in nutrient-starved cells, was not induced in <italic>kog1-105</italic> at 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown), suggesting that incubation of <italic>kog1-105</italic> at the non-permissive temperature may not completely mimic nutrient starvation, which promotes G1 arrest.</p><fig id="pone-0002223-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002223.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>kog1-105 cell does not arrested at G1 at non-permissive temperature.</title><p>Cell cultures (WT (YYK409) and <italic>kog1-105</italic> (YYK410)) blocked in metaphase with 15 &#x000b5;g/ml nocodazole were released into YEPD at 30&#x000b0;C (WT cont.), at 37&#x000b0;C (<italic>kog1-105</italic>), or 30&#x000b0;C in the presence of 200 ng/ml rapamycin (WT, rapa.).

When released into rapamycin-containing medium, DNA replication was largely affected suggesting that most of the cells remained at G1 (data not shown). We thus added rapamycin 20 min after release. Control cell culture passed G2 at 40 min and entered mitosis at 60 min, as judged by FACS analysis, spindle formation, and bud indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002223.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

The same experiments were performed using rapamycin-insensitive mutant, <italic>TOR1-1</italic> and <italic>kog1-105</italic>. Although wild-type cell exhibited G2 delay (80&#x02013;100 min) by rapamycin as described, <italic>TOR1-1</italic> showed normal cell cycle progression even in the presence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002223.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

Nutrient depletion also causes mitotic delay. When G1-arrested cells were released into the nitrogen-depleted medium, only small portion of cells entered S phase, confirming that nutrient is indispensable for G1/S transition (data not shown). Thus synchronously growing cells at S phase (30 min after release into SCD medium) were shifted into nitrogen-free medium (SD(-N)), and as a result a significant mitotic delay was observed (100&#x02013;160 min time points) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

However, in light of our findings with <italic>pab1</italic> and <italic>cdc33</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002223.s004">Figure S4</xref>), another novel TORC1 function than regulating protein synthesis is responsible for G2 progression. Morphogenesis checkpoint is either unlikely to participate in TORC1-mediated control of Cdc5.</p><p>PP2A phosphatase has several essential roles in cell growth and proliferation. Loss of PP2A function results in cell cycle arrest at G2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-DiComo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and impaired Swe1 degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Yang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This phenotype concurs with that of <italic>kog1-105</italic> including abnormal localization of Cdc5, suggesting that Tap42-PP2A branch of TORC1 signaling is involved in G2/M transition via regulation of Cdc5.</p><p>We have further demonstrated that nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Cdc5 is a prerequisite step for its proper function, e.g. localization and kinase activation. The TORC1-PP2A pathway promotes Cdc5 translocation across the nuclear membrane. Upon TORC1 inactivation, nuclear transport of Cdc5 is inhibited, perhaps because Cdc5 is retained in the cytosol, but this inhibition is overcome by deletion of the C-terminal PBD domain. These results are best explained by assuming that dissociation of the N-terminal catalytic domain (containing the NLS) from the C-terminal PBD is mediated by TORC1 and promotes NLS recognition by the Kap complex.</p><p>The C-terminal PBD has a critical role in subcellular localization of Plks. The PBD has a well-studied phosphopeptide-binding activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Elia1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, which helps to recruit Plk to the phosphorylated target proteins at specific cellular locations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Park1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphopeptide binding by the PBD disrupts certain intramolecular interactions and lets the kinase domain to be activated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Barr1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In the resting state, phosphopeptide binding is inhibited by interaction with the kinase domain and the kinase activity is repressed by the association of the PBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Elia1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The intra-molecular interaction between the kinase domain and the PBD might thus inhibit nuclear import, recruitment to the target sites, and kinase activity. Our results indicate that nuclear translocation occurs prior to the targeting and the activation, because proper localization and kinase activation of Cdc5 are compromised when its nuclear translocation is prohibited.</p><p>Beyond its critical role in G2/M transition, Plk has subsequent essential roles in mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Barr1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Cid1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In yeast, Cdc5 is essential for mitotic exit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Cid1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It is postulated that SPB movement from mother cell to daughter during anaphase sends a signal to Cdc5 at mitotic exit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Cid1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we did not detect any defect at mitotic exit in <italic>kog1-105</italic> or rapamycin-treated cells when they were released from nocodazole arrest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, regulation of Cdc5 by TORC1 is restricted at G2/M transition, and it is unlikely that TORC1 regulates Cdc5 at mitosis.</p><p>During the course of our study, a report was published suggesting that Tor regulates mitotic entry in the fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Petersen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, their conclusion is completely opposite to ours; rapamycin treatment stimulates mitotic entry in the fission yeast. We assume that this discrepancy comes from the difference of rapamycin-sensitivity of these two species. The budding yeast used in this study is highly sensitive to rapamycin, whereas cell proliferation of the fission yeast is not inhibited by rapamycin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Weisman1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Kawai1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Presumably rapamycin-FKBP12 complex can bind to and inhibit Tor in the fission yeast cells, because components of Tor complex and FKBP12 are widely conserved among eukaryotes including the two yeasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Weisman2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that some downstream pathway(s) of Tor signaling is abrogated in the rapamycin-resistant yeast. Description of rapamycin-resistance in some cancer cell line (e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30) is reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Hosoi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Huang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, thus identification of disconnected circuit in TORC1 signaling which confers rapamycin-insensitivity should be quite informative for application of rapamycin as an anti-cancer drug. Judging from the phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1;, Gcn2 kinase is activated by rapamycin in the budding yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Cherkasova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Kubota1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002223-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), though it is not activated in the fission yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Petersen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> (Nakashima et al. unpublished result). As deletion of <italic>GCN2</italic> or mutation of <italic>SUI2</italic> (encoding eIF2&#x003b1;) confers the budding yeast cell on rapamycin-resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Cherkasova1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, Gcn2 might be a good candidate for a key factor to determine rapamycin-sensitivity.</p><p>Nutrients have two important roles in cell growth. One is to provide material for macromolecule synthesis, and the other is as a signal molecule of Tor pathway. Tor monitors nutrient levels and integrates this information to control cell growth. The fundamental relationship between cell growth and cell cycle was reported by an early landmark study using budding yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002223-Johnston1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This study demonstrated that cell growth occurs throughout whole cell cycle, because cell growth is not perturbed in <italic>cdc</italic> mutants (except <italic>cdc25</italic> and <italic>cdc33</italic>) arrested at various stage in cell cycle. Taking their conclusion into consideration, we assume that TOR signaling remains active during whole cell cycle, acting not only to upregulate macromolecular synthesis, but also to transmit nutrient signals to other downstream factors that promote cell cycle progression. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, the best stage to arrest cell growth is at G1. However, after cells exit G1, it is better to slow down cell cycle progression at G2 and to wait for nutrient levels to recover, because mitosis is the most elaborate and energy-consuming event in cell cycle. Our findings suggest that Tor could play another pivotal role in cell cycle monitoring, determining whether cell growth and nutrient conditions are sufficient to permit mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains, Plasmids, Media and Genetic methods</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002223.s005">Table S1</xref>.
