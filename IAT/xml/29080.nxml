These proteins are associated with mRNPs within translating ribosomes and have the capacity to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Great attention has been given to FMRP due to its implication in human hereditary mental retardation while FXR1P and FXR2P have only recently been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using antibodies directed against several epitopes of FXR1P, we have detected protein isoforms generated by small peptides pocket inserts. Four isoforms of MW 70, 74, 78, 80 kDa are widely distributed in mouse organs, while in striated muscles these isoforms are replaced by proteins of 82 and 84 kDa containing an extra pocket of 27 aa. Expression of these muscle isoforms is an early event during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes and correlates with the activation of muscle-specific genes. However, while FXR1P82,84 are associated with cytoplasmic mRNPs in myotubes, they are sequestered in the nuclei of undifferentiated myoblasts. These observations suggest that, in addition to a cytoplasmic function yet to be defined, FXR1P82,84 may play a nuclear role in pre-mRNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The pattern of subcellular partitioning of FXR1P isoforms during myogenesis is unique among the family of the FXR proteins. The model system described here should be considered as a powerful tool for ongoing attempts to unravel structure-function relationships of the different FMR family members since the potential role(s) of FXR1P as a compensatory factor in Fragile X syndrome is still elusive.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR) protein family is composed of three highly homologous members. The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is coded by the X-linked <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and its absence is directly associated with human hereditary mental retardation [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two other members of this family are the Fragile X Related 1 (FXR1P) and Fragile X Related 2 (FXR2P) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that are coded by the <italic>FXR1</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> genes located at 3q28 and 17p13.1, respectively, in human. These genes are highly conserved in vertebrate evolution and contain two KH domains and a RGG box that are functional characteristic motifs in RNA-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, they also contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) as well as a nuclear export signal (NES) making them putative nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Finally, FMRP as well as the other members of the family have been shown to be associated with messenger RiboNucleoParticles (mRNP) within actively translating ribosomes. This association suggests that their roles might be linked to RNA transport and/or translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Whereas absence of FMRP is the cause of Fragile X Mental Retardation in human, it is not known whether FXR1P and FXR2P are associated to any pathology or phenotype. Also it is not known whether these homologous proteins can compensate for the absence of FMRP in the case of the Fragile X syndrome. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that all three members interact with themselves and with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, their distribution in certain mouse and human tissues showed individual pattern of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] indicating that each protein also may function autonomously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>FXR1P has been shown to have a complex expression pattern in different mammalian cell lines since six distinct isoforms were observed and their respective levels were shown to be cell type specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In particular, it was observed that 4 distinct FXR1P isoforms of MW 70 and 74 kDa (previously referred to as short) and 78 and 80 kDa (long) are widely expressed in diverse cell lines as well as in different organs in mouse. However, in muscle, these isoforms are replaced by novel super long isoforms of MW 82 and 84 kDa. The replacement of the short and long isoforms by the super long isoforms is clearly apparent during myogenesis of myoblastic cell lines that can differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> into myotubes. This model system which mimics, although imperfectly, muscle differentiation has permitted us to show in the present report that transition of the short and long isoforms to the super long is an early event that takes place concomitantly to the expression of muscle-specific genes. In addition, we also show that low levels of the super long isoforms are constitutively expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts and that they are sequestered in the nuclei, while in differentiated myotubes P82,84 are transferred to the cytoplasm where they are incorporated in mRNPs present in actively translating ribosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Complex expression of FXR1P isoforms</title><p>Initial reports of FXR1 cloning described the presence of two mRNA variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] while recent analyses showed that at least 7 mRNA variants can be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These alternatively spliced mRNA differ each from other by the presence or absence of four different exon sequences. A virtual representation of the corresponding deduced protein isoforms is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. For the identification of the different proteins corresponding to the different mRNA variants (iso a to iso g) we used the numbering of Kirkpatrick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For convenience, the different proteins are illustrated in order of decreasing length. All of the seven FXR1P isoforms contain the same unmodified region from amino acids 1 to 379 after which the addition or lack of different small peptide pocket inserts are due to alternative spliced mRNA variants. Addition of 87, 78 and 81 nucleotides inserts in different mRNA directs the synthesis of 29, 26, and 27 extra amino acid pockets, (exon 12, 13 and 15 boxes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) respectively. A fourth spliced variant of 92 nucleotides induces a frameshift that results in the addition of 30 amino acids and a C-terminal with a final product of 677 amino acid long protein. When the 92 nucleotides sequence is absent, a stop codon at bases 1878-1880 of the mRNA allows the synthesis of only 5 additional amino acids and the C-terminal is thus truncated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the FXR1 protein structure. <bold>a</bold>) Localization of the RNA-binding domains (KH and RGG; yellow) and the nuclear localization (NL) and export (NE) signals (green). <bold>b</bold>) Structure of the different FXR1P isoforms at the C-termini generated by the four small peptide inserts (in blue) deduced from the sequence of individual mRNA variants according to Kirkpatrick's et al.

To obtain new antibodies to the muscle specific isoforms, two synthetic polypeptides corresponding to stretches in the 27 aa sequence present in the muscle super long FXR1P isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were used to immunize rabbits. Two polyclonal sera #27-15 and #27-17 were obtained. The different regions that are recognized by the antibodies are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. In theory, mAb3FX should have reacted with the 7 isoforms, however because of the differences of 1 to 3 amino acids between iso c, iso f and iso g (650, 648 and 651 aa) it was not possible to resolve these proteins by SDS-PAGE. The specificity of the antibodies to the different FXR1P isoforms as well as the distribution of the different isoforms in several mouse tissues is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. A complex distribution of the 70, 74, 78, and 80 kDa isoforms is observed using mAb3FX. In agreement with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] none of these isoforms are detected in muscle and heart extracts. Instead, super long isoforms of 82 and 84 kDa are present in these tissues. These observations were clearly confirmed with the use of anti-serum #830 which detects the 78, 80, 82 and 84 kDa isoforms and also with #27-15 and #27-17 sera that are specific to the 82 and 84 kDa isoforms. The additionnal band detected at 94 kDa with mAb3FX corresponds to the closely homologous Fragile X Related 2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] recognized by this monoclonal antibody since part of the peptide used for immunization is present in FXR2P.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of FXR1P isoforms in extracts from different tissues and organs in adult mouse.

P82,84 appear to undergo major post-translational modifications and three variants with pI 6.0, 5.7 and 5.4 were detected for each protein in both tissues, however with slight different distributions. Additional minor forms were also detected around pI 6.6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results strongly suggest that in these two tissues P82,84 have identical distribution. Indeed, <italic>in situ</italic> immunostaining of FXR1P in longitudinal sections from adult mouse limb muscle and heart with #27-15 (or #27-17) showed punctuated immunoreactive sites associated mainly with the myocontractile structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Identical staining patterns were obtained with mAb3FX and #830 as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] since these antibodies also detect P82,84 while the other FXR1P isoforms are absent in these tissues. Similar if not identical pictures for mouse muscle were also reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with the use of a different antibody (Ab2107). The distribution and specific punctuated features of P82,84 staining in striated muscles are reminiscent of that seen for costameres structures containing RNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

This mouse myogenic cell line is derived from the original skeletal muscle cell line C2 and is considered permissive since it can readily differentiate in myotubes in medium containing low serum concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To establish more precisely the timing of the replacement of the short and long isoforms by the super long, proteins were prepared at different times after serum starvation and analyzed by immunoblotting. The kinetics of expression of the different FXR1P isoforms is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In non-differentiated myoblasts prominent bands were observed at 70,74,78 and 80 kDa as well as the 94 kDa FXR2P. As early as 24 h after induction, high levels of P82,84 were detected while levels of the other FXR1P isoforms started to decline. By three days after serum deprivation, P82,84 levels reached a maximum plateau and only faint bands corresponding to the other isoforms were detected. A better picture was obtained using anti-serum #27-15 specific to the super long isoforms and unexpectedly allowed us to detect low levels of P82,84 in non-differentiated myoblasts. The results presented above clearly showed that increased accumulation of P82,84 has taken place during the first 24 h after serum starvation at a time when no morphological changes are detected at the microscopic level. To test for the hypothesis that the induction of P82,84 is an early event that is directly linked to the initial commitment of myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes, protein extracts were prepared at different times over a period of 24 h after serum depletion. Immunoblot analyses showed that trace amounts of P82,84 were present in undifferentiated myoblasts. Increasing levels of P82,84 were detected as early as 12-15 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> upper panels). At this time, accumulation of muscle specific factors of the regulatory program that controls myogenesis, such as myogenin, began to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cardiac Troponin T levels also began to increase around 12 h while a decrease in nestin levels was observed in agreement with earlier observations made on different cell lines induced to differentiate into myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Finally, desmin levels remained constant during the early period studied (not shown), since its accumulation is a late event during myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Time course analyses of FXR1P isoforms levels in C2C4 cells induced to differentiate.

Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated and from stimulated C2C4 myoblasts at different times and subjected to Northern blot analyses. Membranes were sequentially probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled exon 15 and various cDNA inserts. The results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (lower panels) representative of three independent time-course analyses, showed that muscle specific exon 15 (81 nucleotides) hybridized to the two FXR1 transcripts of 3.2 and 2.4 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In agreement with the results obtained at the protein level, these mRNA variants are present at low levels in non-differentiated myoblasts. Densitometric analysis showed a clear and significant increase (3.0 &#x000b1; 0.5) of both transcripts at 15 h after serum deprivation, then after their steady state levels continued to augment to reach a 5 fold increase by 24 h. The beginning of this increase coincided in time with that of myogenin and cardiac actin mRNAs, which began to accumulate at 12-15 h. In contrast, myf 5 mRNA levels decreased gradually as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These results clearly indicate that accumulation of the FXR1 mRNA variants containing the muscle-specific exon 15 tightly correlates with the activation of muscle-specific genes.</p></sec><sec><title>FXR1P82,84 are absent from polyribosomes in undifferentiated myoblasts</title><p>Given the association of FXR1P with mRNPs present in polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we asked whether all the different FXR1P isoforms would be found present in mRNP engaged in the translational machinery. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared from non-induced myoblasts as well as from myotubes at day 3 after serum deprivation and analyzed by sedimentation velocity through sucrose density gradients. Immunoblot analyses of each collected fraction using the different antibodies to FXR1P showed that in extracts from non-induced cells, FXR1P70,74,78,80 co-fractionated with light polyribosomes, while in extracts prepared from myotubes, P70,74,78,80 and P82,84 were detected in heavier sedimenting structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Further evidence that the FXR1P82,84 isoforms were associated with mRNP engaged in polyribosomes was obtained after treatment of these structures with EDTA that causes dissociation of ribosomes into their large and small subunits and the release of the associated mRNPs. After such a treatment, P82,84 were recovered as heterogeneous slower sedimenting structures with the majority peaking around 60-70 S (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These results indicate that similarly to their closely related homologues FMRP and FXR2P, all FXR1P members are also associated with mRNPs within the translational machinery.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>FXR1P isoforms are associated with mRNPs present in polyribosomes.

This was puzzling since these isoforms were constantly detected in total protein extracts (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and we hypothesized that P82,84 would have been retained in the 10 000 x g pellet during the preparation of the cytoplasmic extracts. Indeed, crude preparations of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from myoblasts showed that P82,84 were recovered associated with the nuclear fraction while no signals were detected in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In contrast, we estimated that approximately 95% of P82,84 were present in the cytoplasmic fraction in myotubes, while the remaining 5% were observed associated with the nuclear fractions. Since the intensities observed in both nuclear preparations of myoblasts and myotubes were similar, these results indicate that equivalent amounts of FXR1P82,84 are present in nuclei regardless of the differentiation stage of the cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Low levels of FXR1P82,84 are present in nuclear preparation of undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes, while in differentiated myotubes, accumulation of P82,84 is restricted to the cytoplasmic fraction.

These observations prompted us to determine the <italic>in situ</italic> localization of P82,84 in differentiated and undifferentiated C2C4 cells. Immunofluorescent studies were performed using the different antibodies to FXR1P. In myoblasts, a clear cytoplasmic staining was observed for P70,74,78,80 and for P78,80 using mAb3FX and #830, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Very faint signals were also observed at the level of nuclei, and were confirmed to be intranuclear by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> upper panels).

It should be noted that prolonged exposure times were required to capture the intranuclear images of P82,84.

All members of this family share the same protein structure and contain key domains that are conserved in RNA binding proteins [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] as well as NL and NE signals which allow the proteins to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Indeed, accumulation of the FMR proteins in the nucleus has been observed experimentaly with truncated variants of the proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as well as after overexpression experiments followed by treatment with Leptomycin B, an antibiotic that inhibits the nuclear export of NES-containing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Due to extensive alternative splicing of the FMRP primary transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it is believe that at least 20 different FMRP isoforms might exist. However, using the available antibodies, only 6 FMRP variants have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Similarly to <italic>FMR1</italic>, <italic>FXR1</italic> primary transcript undergoes complex alternative splicing, however yielding in theory a much more modest number of protein isoforms. Recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] showed that 7 mRNA variants are detected, and our analyses in mouse organs revealed that unlike FMRP, the different FXR1P isoforms are tissue-specific. In general, P70,74,78,80 are widely expressed, albeit at different levels, and their respective ratio seem to be cell and tissue specific. In heart and skeletal muscle, these short and long protein isoforms are absent and are replaced by the P82,84 super long isoforms that are generated by a small peptide insert of 27 aa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>While FMRP is abundant in neurons, it is absent in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. On the other hand, FXR1P82,84 specific to muscle has not been detected in neurons or in brain extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> and this study]. This tissue specificity is not maintained in culture of undifferentiated myoblasts since both FMRP and P82,84 are detected in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, P70,74,78,80 isoforms which are absent in muscle are clearly present in myoblasts. These observations suggest that the individual FMR members may be interchangeable in certain physiological conditions such as cell deadaptation in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or under cellular reprogramming during wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Using the model system of myoblast induced to differentiate into myotubes, we provide evidence that expression of the non-muscle to muscle-specific isoforms of FXR1P correlates with cellular differentiation. We observed that the levels of P82,84 and that of muscle mRNA variants begin to increase at an early time after stimulation concomitant with the expression of different markers of myogenesis. Accumulation of these super long isoforms is paralleled by the decrease of the short and long isoforms and finally at day 3 when approximately 80% of the cells underwent myotube differentiation, P82,84 accounted for the great majority of FXR1P. These results strongly suggest that the mechanisms by which FXR1P82,84 expression are controlled, reside at the level of splicing of the primary transcript. Further analyses are required to determine the factors associated with the expression of these muscle mRNA variants.</p><p>In undifferentiated myoblasts, P82,84 make exception in the FMR protein family since they are not associated with polysomal mRNPs and are sequestered in the nucleus. One possible explanation for this localization would have been that these isoforms contain, in addition to the canonical NLS found in all FMR protein members, a second nuclear localization signal. In fact, Tamanini <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] recently reported that the 27 aa pocket insert contains a short arginine rich motif (QRRNRSRRR) identical to amino acids 35 to 44 present in a domain that confers nucleolar localization to the HIV Rev protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Although a similar (PQRRNRSRRRRFRGQ) peptide present in the 27 aa pocket, when coupled to a dye, has been shown to penetrate the cell and target the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], transient expression of all FXR1P isoforms, with or without the 27 aa pocket, localize exclusively to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref> and our unpublished results]. Thus, it is not established that localization of FXRP82,84 is under the control of this peptide sequence. On the other hand, proteins that have been considered to be strictly nucleoplasmic, such as the hnRNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or the Rev proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], have subsequently been found to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In addition, hnRNPs have been shown to participate in the processing of pre-mRNAs and in the transport of mRNAs to the cytoplasm, and have even been suggested to play a role in translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We propose that FXR1P82,84 might be sequestered in nucleoplasmic complexes in undifferentiated myoblasts and once cells are committed to differentiate, P82,84 are transferred to the cytoplasm with mRNPs carrying the newly processed mRNAs specific to the differentiated stage of myotubes. According to our working hypothesis, a nuclear role, yet to be defined, for FXR1P82,84 in undifferentiated myoblasts, is conceivable.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Previous studies on the FMR proteins have shown that although the FXR1 protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, in rare occasions a nuclear localization has been observed in undifferentiated cells in several tissues of human foetuses and mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The model system of C2C4 myoblasts that can be manipulated <italic>in vitro</italic> to differentiate into myotubes provides strong evidence that specific isoforms of FXR1P are indeed sequestred in the nucleus in undifferentiated myoblasts. As a working hypothesis we propose that the pattern of nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of FXR1P isoforms is under the control of factors regulating cell differentiation. By extention, we also speculate that isoforms of FMRP, that for the moment have escaped detection due to the very restricted number of available antibodies, might play a nuclear role in mRNA maturation at specific stages of neuronal differentiation and plasticity. In conclusion, the model system described here should be considered as a powerful tool for ongoing attempts to unravel structure-function relationships of the different FMR family members since the potential role(s) of FXR1P and FXR2P as a compensatory factor(s) in Fragile X Mental Retardation is still elusive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The mouse myogenic cell line C2C4, a subclone of the mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was obtained from Chistian Pinset, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.
