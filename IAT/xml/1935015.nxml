To identify novel Tdp1 inhibitors, we developed a high-throughput assay that uses electrochemiluminescent (ECL) substrates. Subsequent to screening of 1981 compounds from the &#x02018;diversity set&#x02019; of the NCI-Developmental Therapeutics Program, here we report that furamidine inhibits Tdp1&#x02009;at low micromolar concentrations. Inhibition of Tdp1 by furamidine is effective both with single- and double-stranded substrates but is slightly stronger with the duplex DNA. Surface plasmon resonance studies show that furamidine binds both single- and double-stranded DNA, though more weakly with the single-stranded substrate DNA. Thus, the inhibition of Tdp1 activity could in part be due to the binding of furamidine to DNA. However, the inhibition of Tdp1 by furamidine is independent of the substrate DNA sequence. The kinetics of Tdp1 inhibition by furamidine was influenced by the drug to enzyme ratio and duration of the reaction. Comparison with related dications shows that furamidine inhibits Tdp1 more effectively than berenil, while pentamidine was inactive. Thus, furamidine represents the most potent Tdp1 inhibitor reported to date.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Discovered by Nash and coworkers in 1996, tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) belongs to the phospholipase D superfamily of phospholipids hydrolyzing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Functionally, Tdp1 is part of the DNA repair complex that resolves the irreversible topoisomerase I (Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes by catalyzing the hydrolysis of 3&#x02032;-phosphotyrosyl bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition to the removal of peptides bound via a 3&#x02032; phosphotyrosyl linkage, Tdp1 can catalyze the cleavage of other chemical bonds such as a phosphohistidine bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Tdp1 can also remove a 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate or biotin-linked substrate and act at 3&#x02032;-abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Tdp1 thus participates in the repair of a variety of 3&#x02032; adducts/base damages from DNA. An interaction of Tdp1 with DNA ligase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), members of the base excision repair (BER) complex has also been demonstrated. More recently, Tdp1 has also been implicated in the repair of topoisomerase II (Top2)-mediated DNA damage as bacterially expressed yeast Tdp1p processed the 5&#x02032; phosphotyrosyl linkage of a peptide derived from yeast Top2 covalently to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, Tdp1 may function in multiple DNA repair pathways.</p><p>Tdp1 is physiologically important since a point mutation in the TDP1 gene causes the neurological disorder called spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). SCAN1 cells exhibit hypersensitivity to camptothecin (CPT), a potent Top1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of a human or yeast Tdp1 fusion protein has been shown to alleviate some of the effects of CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These observations suggest that inhibitors of Tdp1 could act synergistically with CPT in a combined anticancer therapeutic regimen. Additionally, hypersensitiveness to CPT in Tdp1-defective yeast was conditional to deficiencies in the checkpoint (Rad9) and 3&#x02032;-endonucleases (Mus81/Eme1) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Thus, in principle, therapeutic selectivity can be achieved by combining Top1 and Tdp1 inhibitors as a significant number of tumors have defective DNA repair and checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>As Tdp1 inhibitors in association with Top1 inhibitors could confer a selective advantage for cancer chemotherapy, we began searching recently for Tdp1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Currently, the only reported inhibitors of Tdp1 are vanadate, tungstate, aminoglycoside antibiotics and ribosome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Our initial aim was to develop a high-throughput assay that would provide a sensitive, reliable and a rapid method to screen chemical libraries for novel Tdp1 inhibitors.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a sensitive high-throughput electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay to identify novel inhibitors of Tdp1. Identified by the ECL assay, the dication furamidine (DB75, NSC 305831) was further studied to determine its molecular interactions with recombinant Tdp1 and its DNA substrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Drugs and reagents</title><p>The 1981 compounds of the diversity set were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH.

The His-tagged human Tdp1 was purified from Novagen BL21 cells using chelating sepharose&#x02122; fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the company's protocol. The collected fractions were assayed immediately for Tdp1 activity. Fractions that showed Tdp1 activity were pooled and dialyzed in 20% glycerol, 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, 10&#x02009;mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 2&#x02009;mM EDTA. Dialyzed samples were aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Tdp1 concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Tdp1 purity was determined as a single &#x0223c;70&#x02009;kDa band representing over 95% of the detectable proteins stained by Coomassie after SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).</p></sec><sec><title>High-throughput electrochemiluminescent assay</title><p>Our electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay is based on the BioVeris (BV) ECL technology developed by BioVeris, Inc.

Twelve-microliter aliquots were resolved in 20% denaturing polyacrylamide (AccuGel; National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA, USA) (19:1) gel containing 7&#x02009;M urea. After drying, gels were exposed overnight to PhosphorImager screens (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Screens were scanned, and images were obtained with the Molecular Dynamics software. Densitometry analyses were performed using the ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Tdp1 activity was determined by measuring the fraction of substrate converted into 3&#x02032;-phosphate DNA product by densitometry analysis of the gel image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

Stem-loop oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 90&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min followed by snap cooling on ice for 15&#x02009;min. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were immobilized to neutravidin-coated sensor chips as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Approximately 5000 RU's of neutravidin was attached to all flow cells on the sensor chips. Oligonucleotides were reconstituted in buffer consisting of 10&#x02009;mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300&#x02009;mM NaCl and 1&#x02009;mM EDTA. Single-stranded and stem-loop oligonucleotides were injected over flow cell 2 and 4, respectively until approximately 500 RU's of oligonucleotide were captured on the chip surface. Furamidine was diluted into running buffer [10&#x02009;mM MES, 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA, 5% DMSO (v/v) pH 6.25] and injected over all flow cells at 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;l/min at 25&#x000b0;C. Following compound injections, the surface was regenerated with a 10&#x02009;s 1&#x02009;M NaCl injection followed by a 10&#x02009;s running buffer injection. A DMSO calibration curve was included to correct for refractive index mismatches between the running buffer and compound dilution series. Data was analyzed using the Scrubber software version 2 (David Myszka, University of Utah) and the equilibrium binding of furamidine was fit to either a single-site or two-site steady state binding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D).

An ECL substrate for Tdp1 was generated after coupling a ruthenium-containing tag (BV-Tag) to the 3&#x02032;-end of a 14-mer oligonucleotide with a 5&#x02032;-biotin and a 3&#x02032;-tyrosyl moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In the presence of Tdp1, the tyrosyl-bound BV-Tag is hydrolyzed from the ECL substrate (BV-14Y DNA) and washed away, leading to a loss of the electroluminescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). In this assay, a potential Tdp1 inhibitor would be detected as preventing this loss of signal with a level of signal retention reflective of the potency of the putative inhibitor. Thus, in our high-throughput ECL assay, active compounds were identified as restoring to the control levels (without Tdp1) the signal lost in the presence of Tdp1. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>High-throughput electrochemiluminescene assay developed to identify novel Tdp1 inhibitors.

After stopping the reactions, the samples are analyzed by the ECL analyzer. During the analysis, only the magnetic beads are retained in the analysis chamber by magnetic field while the rest of the sample is washed away. In the absence of Tdp1, the ECL signal is maximum as the BV-14Y DNA is retained on the magnetic beads.

However, inhibition of Tdp1 activity by furamidine is also evident in a single-stranded substrate. This is unlike aclarubicin, a known DNA intercalator that inhibits Tdp1 selectively only with double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, additional mechanism of Tdp1 inhibition by furamidine exists besides DNA intercalation or minor groove binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of furamidine to a double- and single-stranded substrate</title><p>We next evaluated the ability of furamidine to directly interact with DNA in the absence of Tdp1.

To elucidate whether the inhibition of Tdp1-mediated cleavage of the single-stranded DNA substrate could be due to a stabilization of a hairpin structure by furamidine, we plugged our sequence in the <italic>mfold</italic> web application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/">http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/</ext-link>).

In addition, the fact that we were able to measure a dissociation rate with the duplex but not with the single-stranded oligonucleotide by SPR leads us to believe that furamidine does not stabilize any hairpin structure.

The terminal thymine dinucleotide (&#x02013;TT) of the 14Y oligonucleotide was replaced with a cytosine dinucleotide (&#x02013;CC) to generate the 14Y-CC oligonucleotide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The ability of Tdp1 to process either the 14Y or 14Y-CC substrates was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). Kinetic plot analysis shows the processing of either substrate almost completely within 10&#x02009;min of the reaction time and at the same rate by 1&#x02009;ng of Tdp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Upon addition of varying concentrations of furamidine, the processing of both the substrates 14Y and 14Y-CC by Tdp1 was inhibited to the same degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E).

The 50% inhibition of Tdp1 activity observed by 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;M furamidine with 0.1&#x02009;ng of Tdp1 was almost completely reversed by increasing the concentration of Tdp1 to 1&#x02009;ng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and diamond in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D).

In 2002, Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) used chromagenic substrates like the 3&#x02032;-(4-nitro)phenyl phosphate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, spectrophotometric detection of 4-nitrophenol required high concentrations of Tdp1 because of its relatively poor extinction coefficient. More recently, fluorescence-based assays have been designed using oligonucleotide and nucleotide substrates containing 3&#x02032;-(4-methylumbelliferone)-phosphate (DNA-MUP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Tdp1-mediated cleavage releases the 4-methylumbelliferone from the DNA, and the resulting fluorescence can be quantitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our &#x02018;mix and read&#x02019; high-throughput electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay offers two main advantages. First, the ECL tag (BV-TAG) on the DNA substrate undergoes many excitation/emission cycles, which amplify the output signal, and increases sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Since the process is selective for the BV-Tag, the background signal typical of fluorescent methods is eliminated. Second, positive hits are inferred by a gain/restoration of signal as opposed to previous techniques that rely on loss of signal, thereby providing high sensitivity and reliability. More than 70% of the compounds identified by our ECL screen at a single concentration were confirmed as inhibitors of Tdp1 by gel assays. Additionally, the ECL assay is quick, as the high-throughput configuration can process a 96-well plate in &#x0223c;10&#x02009;min. Subsequent to screening the DTP diversity set by the ECL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the antiparasitic furamidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was identified as a positive hit for Tdp1 inhibition and further characterized by gel-based assays.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that furamidine inhibits the activity of recombinant human Tdp1&#x02009;at low micromolar concentrations both with single- and double-stranded DNA substrates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Moreover, we provide evidence that furamidine binds single-stranded DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and D). Our results also show that furamidine exhibits no preference for a TT sequence over a CC at the terminus of a single-stranded oligonucleotide for Tdp1 inhibition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, another diamidine, pentamidine was inactive against Tdp1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) despite the fact that furamidine and pentamidine have an overall similar structural curvature, that closely matches the curvature of the DNA minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). We also found that berenil was approximately one order of magnitude less effective than furamidine at inhibiting Tdp1. This suggests that the furan linker in furamidine contributes to furamidine's inhibition of Tdp1 activity. We believe that DNA binding is part of the furamidine's mechanism of action. Further studies such as crystallization will be required to fully elucidate its complete mechanism of action. It is plausible that furamidine could form a ternary complex by binding at the interface created by the DNA substrate and the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>To date, vanadate, tungstate, aminoglycoside antibiotics and ribosome inhibitors are the only known inhibitors of Tdp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Though vanadate and tungstate bound to Tdp1 provided insights into substrate binding and catalytic mechanism of Tdp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), they are general inhibitors of a variety of enzymes involved in phosphoryl transfer. Moreover, vanadate, tungstate, aminoglycoside antibiotics and ribosome inhibitors inhibit Tdp1 activity in biochemical assays only at high (millimolar) concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The present study demonstrates that furamidine is by far the most potent inhibitor of Tdp1 reported to date. However, determining the effect of furamidine on Tdp1 in cellular systems would be very hard to interpret as furamidine may have additional target(s) because of its DNA-binding activities. Nevertheless, furamidine presents a prototype, to explore the possibility of generating new chemotypes that would specifically target Tdp1. Evaluation and characterization of other novel Tdp1 inhibitors identified by our ECL screen are ongoing. Our present study with furamidine demonstrates that the ECL assay is a useful tool for the high-throughput screening of Tdp1 inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This project has been supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research and by federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, under contract N01-CO-12400.
