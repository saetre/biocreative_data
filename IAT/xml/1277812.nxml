Using <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting assays we mapped two <italic>in vivo</italic> Fob1p-binding sites, RFB1 and RFB3, located in the rDNA enhancer region and coincident with those previously reported to be <italic>in vitro</italic> binding sites. We previously provided evidences that DNA topoisomerase I is able to cleave two sites within this region. The results reported in this paper, indicate that the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage specific activity at the enhancer region is affected by the presence of Fob1p and independent of replication and transcription activities. We thus hypothesize that the binding to DNA of Fob1p itself may be the cause of the DNA topoisomerase I activity in the rDNA enhancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genes coding for ribosomal RNAs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are organized as a 9.1 kb basic unit repeated in tandem about 100&#x02013;150 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) coding for the 35S RNA (further processed in 5.8S, 16S and 25S RNA), and the 5S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). This genetic locus is transcribed by two different specialized RNA polymerases: RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III, transcribing the 35S RNA and the 5S RNA, respectively. This locus is fundamental for yeast life, providing the whole RNA content of the ribosomal particles.</p><p>The combination of both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) has established that the DNA&#x02013;protein interactions occurring in the <underline>N</underline>on-<underline>T</underline>ranscribed <underline>S</underline>pacer 2 region (NTS2) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), particularly at the 35S RNA promoter, are represented by a complex interplay of transcription factors acting to stimulate RNA polymerase I activity and other proteins like the Reb1p, or the DNA topoisomerase I enzyme, whose role in that particular region has not been established yet. <italic>In vivo</italic>, a fine mapping was obtained for UAF, CF, Reb1p and Top1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Important events such as the termination of RNA polymerase I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and the block of the DNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) occur at the NTS1 sequence (reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and in particular at the enhancer region (E). However, only very recently DNA&#x02013;protein interactions, have been reported for this region. In particular, it has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) that Sir2p, Net1p and Fob1p bind to this portion of regulatory sequences. It has also been shown that binding occurs at the promoter region although with different efficiency. The method utilized Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChrIP), while representing one of the best analysis available to reveal site-specific DNA&#x02013;protein interactions, does not allow mapping at nucleotide level of resolution. Furthermore, it has been shown that Fob1p can bind, <italic>in vitro</italic>, to two out of three replication fork block (RFB) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) providing a model for its activity in the block of the replication fork. The importance of <italic>FOB1</italic> gene is due to the following relevant findings: <italic>FOB1</italic> is required for rDNA recombination and for its replication fork blocking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) to prevent collision between DNA replication and rDNA transcription events. In addition, it is necessary for either contraction or expansion of ribosomal units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>); <italic>FOB1</italic> deletion expands life span in yeast, also reducing the production of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Moreover, it is involved in the control of transcriptional silencing occurring at the enhancer region of rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>In previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), we demonstrated that DNA topoisomerase I specifically cleaves DNA at two sites in the enhancer region and in one site at the 35S RNA promoter. Those regions overlap with those reported to be associated with Sir2p, Net1p and Fob1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that DNA topoisomerase I has an active role in both transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and in DNA recombination of rDNA units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Strikingly, all the genes involved in these pathways share similar phenotypes with DNA topoisomerase I. In particular, <italic>TOP1</italic>, <italic>NET1</italic>, <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FOB1</italic> are all connected with ribosomal silencing. <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FOB1</italic> are also engaged in DNA recombination of ribosomal units together with <italic>TOP1</italic>. In order to clarify the possible role, if any, of the DNA topoisomerase I in the ribosomal silencing or in rDNA recombination, we evaluated the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of Fob1p to the rDNA locus by a high resolution method. In order to investigate the potential connection between Fob1p activity and the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites, we provide evidences that DNA topoisomerase I cleavage activity is dependent on <italic>FOB1</italic> in the NTS1, while <italic>FOB1</italic> independent is in the NTS2. We also show that events like DNA replication or rDNA transcription do not affect the DNA topoisomerase I site-specific reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and culture media</title><p>The strains used in this study are: <bold>W303-1a</bold> (WT) (Mat<bold>a</bold>, ade 2-1, ura 3-1, his 3-11,15, trp1-1, leu 2-3112, can1-100); <bold>D128-1D</bold> (&#x00394;43) (Mat<bold>a</bold>, rpa43::LEU2 ade 2-101 uaa, ura 3-52, lys2-801 uag, trp1-&#x00394;63, his 3-&#x00394;200, leu 2-&#x00394;1/) pNOY102, kindly provided by P.

To accomplish this task we set up an <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting assay by DNAse I, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). WT and <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; cells were grown in rich medium to the exponential phase (0.4 OD/ml); nuclei were prepared [as in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)] and aliquots were subjected to digestion with different amounts of DNAse I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After the <italic>in vivo</italic> enzymatic treatment, DNA was extracted and purified. The digestion products were subjected to a primer extension with a [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP labelled oligonucleotide (r32, see map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), annealing from the position &#x02212;2453 to the position &#x02212;2429, numbering from the transcriptional start site of 35S RNA (+1). The primer extension reactions were conducted in PCR conditions (see Materials and Methods). The linear amplification products were purified, separated by sequencing gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and visualized by autoradiography. Mapping of footprinted positions was obtained comparing the digestion pattern of the samples with the molecular weights (M, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the sequencing ladders (A, C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the comparison between the DNAse I digestion profiles of WT and <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; samples, reveals interesting differences represented by enhanced (empty arrowheads) and protected (filled arrowheads) regions, strongly supporting that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, site-specific factor(s) are bound to rDNA. In fact at positions &#x02212;2232 and &#x02212;2220 two protections appear; at the 3&#x02032; of this protected region, (position &#x02212;2200) a clear enhancement is also present. We identified the region encompassing these three sites as &#x02018;a&#x02019; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, three additional DNA sites show differences between the two digestion profiles: positions &#x02212;2119 and &#x02212;2109 are protected while a strong enhancement is present at position &#x02212;2097. We named the region encompassing these three sites as &#x02018;b&#x02019;. Conversely all the remaining DNA regions show the same DNAse I pattern in the two strains. In order to better evaluate the different DNAse I digestion profiles occurring in these regions (&#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019;) we enlarged the gel area reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A&#x02032;</xref>. The protections/enhancements profile between regions &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019; clearly describes the specific interaction(s) of putative protein(s) in WT cells, as compared to <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; strain. Since the two strains differ exclusively for the presence of the <italic>FOB1</italic> gene (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) it is high likely that the regions &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019; correspond to Fob1p-binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, comparing the data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> with the HindIII&#x02013;HpaI portion of the NTS1 sequence and the purified protein, a close match with our findings is noticeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In fact, the &#x02018;a&#x02019; region reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> overlaps with RFB3 (from &#x02212;2232 to &#x02212;2200 <italic>in vivo</italic> and from &#x02212;2213 to &#x02212;2203 <italic>in vitro</italic>) and the region reported as &#x02018;b&#x02019; overlaps with RFB1 (from &#x02212;2119 to &#x02212;2097 <italic>in vivo</italic> and from &#x02212;2129 to &#x02212;2113 <italic>in vitro</italic>. See also the scheme reported in the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In order to show the strong overlapping between the <italic>in vivo</italic> Fob1p-binding sequences and DNA topoisomerase I specific cleavage sites in the NTS1 [observed previously, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)], we treated WT cells with CPT, a specific DNA topoisomerase IB inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Spheroplasts obtained from WT or <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; cells (as reported previously) were permeabilized by nystatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and treated with 0.8 M NaCl in order to remove most of the DNA topoisomerase molecules bound to DNA and to show the basal level of DNA integrity without the DNA topoisomerase I nicking activity. The DNA from treated cells was purified as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and subjected to primer extension in the same condition employed for the DNAse I treated samples. The purified material was loaded on a sequencing gel and the separated fragments were revealed by gel autoradiography. As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the two major cleavage sites lie very close to the footprinted regions observed with the DNAse I analysis (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) while in the top1D strain no cleavage production is observed.</p><p>The arrowhead labelled as &#x02212;2143 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> indicates the cleavage site located at the 5&#x02032; of the region &#x02018;b&#x02019; (reported in the graphical representation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); this map position is quite different from that shown in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>): the site is actually the same but the attribution of map position was corrected by shifting 45 bp away from the 35S RNA transcriptional start, used as numbering reference. The other cleavage site, occurring at position &#x02212;2236, at the 5&#x02032; of the region &#x02018;a&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) is also indicated by an arrowhead.</p><p>Previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) have demonstrated, by ChrIP, that Sir2p, Net1p and Fob1p are bound to NTS1 and NTS2 sequences.

We found that the two regions of Fob1p-binding (&#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019;) are still perturbed in the DNAse I digestions compared to the naked DNA profile (data not shown); therefore we can conclude that Fob1p-binding to the &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019; regions is <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>NET1</italic> independent.</p><p>From the data reported so far, we can conclude that Fob1p-binding <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) coincide, that the binding is <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>NET1</italic> independent, and that these specific-sites are nearly overlapping with the cleavage sites produced, <italic>in vivo</italic>, by DNA topoisomerase I.</p></sec><sec><title>The DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites of the enhancer region are FOB1 dependent</title><p>Given the strict colocalization of the Fob1p footprintings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites on the enhancer region of the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and considering the colocalization of Sir2p, Net1p and Fob1p described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), we wondered whether the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites are correlated with the presence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, <italic>NET1</italic> or <italic>FOB1</italic> functioning genes.</p><p>Thus, we studied the cleavage sites of DNA topoisomerase I in different strains lacking these genes. We assayed, by CPT blocking of DNA topoisomerase I activity, both the enhancer and the promoter regions in WT, <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>net1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, respectively). In the enhancer region, the characterization of the cleavage sites was obtained by primer extension using the oligonucleotide r32 (see map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Samples reported as U correspond to untreated cells and show the cleavage efficiency of DNA topoisomerase I in the absence of CPT. Samples named NaCl indicate cells pre-treated with 0.8 M NaCl that prevents cleavage induction, and samples 1 to 8 represent couples of treatments with 100 and 200 &#x000b5;M CPT. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, clearly indicate that only the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; mutant completely lacks these cleavage sites, in any tested condition (0, NaCl, 100 e 200 &#x000b5;M CPT, respectively) when compared with the other three strains. Moreover, in WT, <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>net1</italic>&#x00394; strains a very similar pattern shows, up with two DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that the presence/absence of Sir2p and Net1p does not basically interfere with the site-specific activity of DNA topoisomerase I in the rDNA enhancer region. We also studied the cleavage induction in the promoter region of the 35S rRNA, where colocalization of Sir2p, Fob1p and Net1p also occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The same DNA preparations used for the analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, were primer extended by oligonucleotide r3, annealing from position &#x02212;268 to position &#x02212;249 from the transcriptional start site of 35S RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, for mapping details). The elongation products were separated by sequencing gel electrophoresis and the bands revealed by gel autoradiography. In the promoter region only one specific-site at &#x02212;171 bp, due to the DNA topoisomerase I activity, is evidenced (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). While the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; strain in the enhancer region does not show any cleavage site, all the four strains show comparable cleavage pattern by DNA topoisomerase I in the promoter region (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that the DNA topoisomerase I site-specific activity depends on <italic>FOB1</italic> in the rDNA enhancer region, but it is <italic>FOB1</italic> independent on the promoter region. The DNA topoisomerase I activity is also independent of the presence of Sir2p and Net1p both at the enhancer and at the 35S RNA promoter. This observation recalls recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) concerning the association of the <underline>re</underline>gulator of <underline>n</underline>ucleolar silencing and <underline>t</underline>elophase exit (RENT) complex with the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), where the authors described that both this association and the ribosomal silencing are <italic>FOB1</italic> dependent in the enhancer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), while they are independent in the promoter, suggesting the involvement of different factor(s). It is to notice that both the DNAse I and DNA topoisomerase I cleavage site assays, show two faint bands in most of the untreated samples (U in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), analysed by extension of the oligo r32. We believe that these bands have been originated by the treatment of the &#x02018;U&#x02019;samples (as well as all the other samples) with the denaturing agent SDS that is used to stop the DNA topoisomerase I ongoing reactions (see Material and Methods for details). This procedure induces trapping of covalent complex of DNA topoisomerase I-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), thus revealing cleavages. This interpretation is supported by the absence of these faint bands in the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; untreated samples, observed in the DNAse I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane U <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394;), and in the DNA topoisomerase I experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane U <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394;), and in <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane U, <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394;).</p><p>We further investigated two additional aspects of the DNA topoisomerase I site-specific cleavage reaction: (i) The reactivity of the enzyme on a substrate located outside the chromosome XII. In order to accomplish this we analysed a strain that does not contain the rDNA repeats [rdn&#x00394;&#x00394;, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>)], and whose growth is supported by a 2 micron based plasmid carrying an entire ribosomal unit including the NTS sequence, pNOY373 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). When cleavage sites are induced by CPT as reported above, no difference were observed with respect to the WT condition, suggesting that it is not the chromosomal context that induces the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites (data not shown), (ii) we asked whether the complex Net1p-Sir2p, in association with Tof2p [all recently shown to be present in the RENT complex, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>)] could affect the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage. We performed the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage assay in a <italic>tof2</italic>&#x00394; strain: no differences were observed relative to the WT strain (data not shown), thus confirming that the RENT complex is not involved in DNA topoisomerase I cleavage site production.</p><p>We set up a series of experiments involving the DNA replication block, the rRNA transcription suppression as well as a chromatin structure analysis, to understand whether the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites on the rDNA enhancer are to be attributed to (i) the blocking of the replication fork over the RFB sequences, (ii) the swivel activity necessary to release the torsional stress created by the RNA polymerase I transcription or (iii) an alteration of the chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA topoisomerase I activity in the rDNA enhancer is unaffected when DNA replication is blocked or rDNA transcription abolished</title><p>We evaluated the possibility that the RFB, exerted by Fob1p on RFB sequences, may be the physical cause that stimulates the site-specific activity of DNA topoisomerase I on the &#x02212;2143 and &#x02212;2236 sites. In fact, the position of these sites matches quite well with the RFB sequences (see the schematic drawing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We analysed the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites after addition of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml of &#x003b1;-factor to WT cells grown to exponential phase (0.4 OD/ml), to block cell cycle progression and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). After a 2.5 h treatment the cells were checked for bud disappearance and processed for DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites induction as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. The two cleavage sites, at position &#x02212;2143 and &#x02212;2236, are present in both untreated and &#x003b1;-factor treated cells suggesting that stalled forks (occurring only in the untreated cells) are not responsible for the induction of DNA topoisomerase I activity.</p><p>We also investigated the possibility that the collision between the blocked forks and the transcription bubble progressing from the adjacent unit, in the rDNA cluster, could represent a triggering event for cleavage. We studied the yeast strain &#x00394;43, lacking the A43 subunit of RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), that is unable to support rDNA transcription. The viability of this strain in galactose medium is allowed in the presence of an episomal plasmid carrying a copy of the 35S RNA under the GAL7 promoter [plasmid pNOY102, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>)]. When we induced the DNA topoisomerase I cleavages sites, the comparison between the WT and the &#x00394;43 strains did not show any difference in the site production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both strains show a similar pattern, suggesting that cleavage induction is not due to the collision between blocked forks and the transcription bubble.</p></sec><sec><title>The chromatin organization of both enhancer and promoter regions does not change in the fob1&#x00394; strain</title><p>An alternative explanation for the loss of DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites within the enhancer region in the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; strain could be compatible with an altered nucleosome organization in the strain lacking the <italic>FOB1</italic> gene. Previously, we studied the NTS2 region of rDNA, where we found five well positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In the same study we also investigated the entire NTS region by nucleosome spacing analysis and concluded that a regular nucleosome structure is present in the enhancer region. In order to show whether the NTS1 chromatin could be altered in <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394;, we determined nucleosome positioning by end-labelling analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) comparing the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; strain with the WT strain.</p><p>Cells from exponentially growing conditions (0.4 OD/ml) were treated as reported in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Spheroplasts from cells grown in complete YPD medium, treated with nystatin to allow permeabilization, were digested with different amounts of MNase and DNA was purified. In order to evaluate whether the nucleosomes were regularly positioned, a specific restriction with PvuII of the MNase treated samples was coupled to hybridization with the En probe (mapping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The DNA fragments were then separated on 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter by Southern blotting. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> treated samples (Chr) were compared with deproteinized DNA (which provides the sensitivity of the naked DNA toward MNase), both of them previously digested with PvuII. This comparison does not show defined protections thus confirming that nucleosomes in the enhancer region are not organized as precisely positioned array. This result would also be compatible with nucleosome absence, but their presence in this region was demonstrated in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>When the same analysis reported above was employed using the <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, no differences were observed relative to the WT profile, [compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (<italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394;) with A (WT)]. Also in this experiment no protection from MNase digestion is visible compared to the naked DNA analysis, so that we can conclude that nucleosomes in both WT and <italic>fob1</italic>&#x00394; mutant in the enhancer region are not positioned.</p><p>The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> exclude that the <italic>FOB1</italic> dependence of the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites is due to the RFB activity, or to an alteration in the chromatin organization. Considering the close vicinity of the footprinted regions and the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), we conclude that the Fob1p-binding itself allows DNA topoisomerase I to specifically cleave DNA at positions &#x02212;2143 and &#x02212;2236.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Fob1p acts binding in the enhancer region of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> rDNA, where it controls the recombination of the ribosomal units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). We mapped, at nucleotidic resolution level, the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding sites of this protein, within the NTS1 region of the rDNA. In fact, it has recently been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>, that this protein is capable to bind, with different efficiency, the three RFB sequences (RFB1-3) lying in the NTS1 tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that Fob1p together with Sir2p and Net1p localizes <italic>in vivo</italic> both in the NTS1 (enhancer) and in the NTS2 (35S RNA promoter) although with different distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). However the <italic>in vivo</italic> approach utilized (chromatin immunoprecipitation) did not provide information with the nucleotide level resolution due to the method approximation ranging around 100&#x02013;200 bp.</p><p>Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting assay we mapped the binding sites of the <italic>FOB1</italic> gene product, (reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showing a good correlation with those mapped <italic>in vitro</italic> and reported previuosly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). As for the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, the best interactions are between Fob1p and the RFB1 and 3, respectively, being the RBF2 sequence not bound <italic>in vivo</italic> and weakly bound <italic>in vitro</italic> (compare the graphical scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The most important output of this fine mapping obtained <italic>in vivo</italic>, is the perception that these footprinted regions nearly overlap the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites that we have determined previously [also reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)]. In addition, we have clarified the absence of interference of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>NET1</italic> in Fob1p-binding, observing that the Fob1p footprint, in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>net1</italic>&#x00394; strains, is similar to the one shown by the WT cells. Given the proximity between DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites in the enhancer region and the binding sites of Fob1p, we asked the following question: are the cleavage sites produced by the DNA topoisomerase I in the NTS region due to the presence of the <italic>FOB1</italic> gene, or do they depend on the presence/absence of potential partners like <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>NET1</italic>?. When the study of the cleavage sites was conducted in strains mutant for <italic>SIR2</italic>, <italic>NET1</italic> or <italic>FOB1</italic> respectively, we observed, on the NTS1 region, a clear dependence on <italic>FOB1</italic> of the cleavages due to DNA topoisomerase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This represents the first observation in which the dependence of these sites upon a specific gene is reported. We hypothesize that a physical interaction, if any, between Fob1p and DNA topoisomerase I could be weak; in fact, previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) demonstrated that DNA topoisomerase I interacts only with two gene products, <italic>TOF1</italic> and <italic>TOF2</italic>, strongly enough to be detected in an extensive two-hybrids screening. When a &#x00394; to f2 mutant was analysed, we observed that the cleavage efficiency was not affected (data not shown) suggesting that TOF2, described to be present in the RENT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), does not interfere with the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage activity on the NTS1 sequence.</p><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) we found that the absence of transcription does not interfere with the capability of DNA topoisomerase I to cleave DNA nearby the 35S RNA promoter region. Actually, in the promoter region, where a specific cleavage site was also shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), <italic>FOB1</italic> dependence was not observed, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation confirms the reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) that consider the existence of two different mechanisms acting in the recruitment of silencing proteins on rDNA: one depending on Fob1p, Sir2p and Net1p contacting the enhancer region and the transcriptional silencing; the other involving components acting in a specific manner on rDNA, probably recruiting RNA polymerase I, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Our observation implies that these complexes could contain the DNA topoisomerase I activity, probably weakly bound and not detected by biochemical assays. The role of DNA topoisomerase I in this region does not seem to be related to rDNA replication, nor to rDNA transcription. In fact, when we analysed the DNA replication fork blocking activity on the RFBs and the RNA transcription (both of them proposed as important events for the induction of DNA recombination, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) we could not find any correlation between these processes and the possible production of alternative DNA topoisomerase I sites, as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>.</p><p>Thus the DNA topoisomerase I cleavage production does not depend on replication and transcription of rDNA. Since we demonstrated that the cleavage sites in the enhancer region are <italic>FOB1</italic> dependent, we consider that the most reasonable explanation relies on the binding of Fob1p itself to DNA and on the possible consequent distortion of the double helix due to its binding. In order to verify the involvement of the chromosomal context on the cleavage efficiency of DNA topoisomerase I on NTS1 sequence, we analysed the cleavage profile induced by CPT addition in a rdn&#x00394;&#x00394; strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) (lacking the whole chromosomal rDNA array) and containing the pNOY373 plasmid (carrying an entire rDNA unit). The results exclude an involvement of the chromosomal context because the ectopic copy of rDNA was cleaved by DNA topoisomerase I with an efficiency comparable to that one shown by the WT strain. Actually, it has been reported that bent DNA represents an efficient substrate for DNA topoisomerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and a similar deviation from linearity of the double helix could be exerted by Fob1p by binding the DNA. In a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) an observation was reported, compatible with the wrapping of DNA around Fob1p, structure that may produce a significant bent in the DNA molecule that DNA topoisomerase I can recognize and efficiently cleave. This implies that the nicks produced by DNA topoisomerase I may be the starting points of <italic>FOB1</italic> mediated recombination events. Conversely, the hyper-rec phenotype observed in <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394; strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) could be due to a different mechanism triggered by the accumulation of superhelical stress due to lack of the swivel activity of DNA topoisomerase I.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Net1p and Sir2p associate to DNA both in the enhancer and in the promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). These associations are <italic>FOB1</italic> dependent at the enhancer and <italic>FOB1</italic> independent at the promoter. Interestingly, also the DNA topoisomerase I site-specific behaviour, reported in this paper, turns out to be <italic>FOB1</italic> dependent at the enhancer and independent at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together these data suggest a possible involvement of DNA topoisomerase I in the RENT complex with Net1p, Sir2p and CdC14p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Given that Net1p shares significant sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) with Tof2 [Topoisomerase interacting factor 2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>)] of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, we hypothesize a possible interaction between Net1p and DNA topoisomerase I according to the previous idea that DNA topoisomerase I is also part of the RENT complex.</p><p>It has been recently reported that ribosomal DNA shows double strand breaks or nicked forms at positions overlapping those we found to be DNA topoisomerase I cleavage sites, and the authors of this work reported these ruptures to be <italic>FOB1</italic> dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). We strongly suppose that the nicks reported in those experiments are actually the cleavage sites produced by DNA topoisomerase I that we found in this and a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>); in addition we observed also the capability of <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; strain to produce the same pattern profile of WT strain (data not shown). For this reason we may exclude the involvement of DNA topoisomerase III activity [hypothesized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)] for the cleavage production in the regions analysed in our study.</p><p>The finding of an involvement of Fob1p in the site-specific activity of DNA topoisomerase I contributes to clarify the role of this enzyme in important events occurring in the rDNA such as the control of genome stability, transcriptional silencing and cellular aging.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partially supported by the &#x02018;Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti&#x02019; Universita' di Roma &#x02018;La Sapienza&#x02019; and by project &#x02018;Dinamica della cromatina&#x02019; MURST 2003.
