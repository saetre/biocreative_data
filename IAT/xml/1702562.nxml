Here we report that &#x003b2;-catenin is encoded by a labile transcript whose half-life is prolonged by Wnt and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#x02013;AKT signaling. AKT phosphorylates the mRNA decay-promoting factor KSRP at a unique serine residue, induces its association with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3, and prevents KSRP interaction with the exoribonucleolytic complex exosome. This impairs KSRP's ability to promote rapid mRNA decay. Our results uncover an unanticipated level of control of &#x003b2;-catenin expression pointing to KSRP as a required factor to ensure rapid degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin in unstimulated cells. We propose KSRP phosphorylation as a link between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#x02013;AKT signaling and &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During mammalian development and adulthood, &#x003b2;-catenin regulates the transcription of a family of genes with multiple essential roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. &#x003b2;-catenin also plays a role in cancer when it carries mutations that result in uncontrolled &#x003b2;-catenin function. Here, we report that the lifetime of the &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;encoding transcript is under regulatory control. We show that specific cellular signals relevant to proper mammalian development and implicated in tumor formation can prolong &#x003b2;-catenin transcript half-life, leading to the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin protein. We identify a molecular mechanism for this prolongation by showing that a protein factor responsible for &#x003b2;-catenin transcript instability (and thus degradation) is impaired by phosphorylation, a chemical modification. When this factor is impaired, &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA and protein accumulate.

KSRP was phosphorylated by recombinant purified AKT2 in vitro, whereas HuR was not phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In silico analysis (Motif Scan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite.mit.edu/motifscan_seq.phtml">http://scansite.mit.edu/motifscan&#x0005f;seq.phtml</ext-link>) of the human KSRP primary sequence performed at medium stringency indicated serine 193 (bold in the following peptide: GLPERSV<bold>S</bold>LTGAPES) as a potential AKT phosphorylation site (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, left). We evaluated the ability of AKT2 to phosphorylate KSRP deletion mutants expressed as GST-fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Only the KSRP fragments including KH1, where S193 is located, were phosphorylated by AKT2 in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6, and unpublished data). Importantly, myrAKT1 expression enhanced the phosphorylation of coexpressed FLAG-KSRP while not affecting FLAG-KSRP(S193A) mutant, as shown by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation following &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;orthophosphate metabolic labeling of intact HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In order to unambiguously identify the KSRP residue(s) phosphorylated by AKT, recombinant human KSRP was phosphorylated by AKT2 in vitro, the gel band was digested with trypsin and enriched for phosphopeptides, and the peptides were analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This led to the identification of the unique peptide SV&#x0005b;pS&#x0005d;LTGAPESVQK with phosphorylation at the second serine residue (S193) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). The entire sequence of the phosphorylated peptide is perfectly conserved in several mammalian species <italic>(Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris,</italic> and <italic>Bos taurus),</italic> and the phosphorylated serine is conserved, in a corresponding position, also in nonmammalian species <italic>(Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis,</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio)</italic> (unpublished data).

Knock-down experiments demonstrate that KSRP controls the t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> and the steady-state levels of &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA, thus increasing &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels and enhancing the &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent TOP-FLASH&#x02013; and c-myc promoter&#x02013;dependent reporter transcription.

The discrepancies might depend on the divergent regulation of protein decay in different cell types. Indeed, we have observed that insulin-induced PI3K-AKT activation does not affect &#x003b2;-catenin protein stability in HIRc-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050005-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), while myrAKT1 expression slightly prolongs &#x003b2;-catenin protein t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> in &#x003b1;T3-1 cells (unpublished data). However, our results indicate that PI3K-AKT consistently induces &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA stabilization and protein accumulation in both cell lines. Even though our data indicate that PI3K-AKT activation, regulating the mRNA decay machinery, can lead to &#x003b2;-catenin protein accumulation in the absence of changes in its protein degradation rate, it is conceivable that an integrated control of both mRNA and protein stability could be required to ensure rapid and sustained changes of &#x003b2;-catenin expression in response to certain proliferative and differentiative cues. Notably, AKT-induced interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin protein with 14-3-3 has been shown to increase both &#x003b2;-catenin levels and its transcriptional activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050005-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, AKT-dependent interaction of 14-3-3 either with a factor involved in &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA turnover, such as KSRP, or with &#x003b2;-catenin itself can lead to accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin protein.

It is possible to hypothesize that a certain signaling pathway can affect the turnover of select mRNAs regulating the function of distinct ARE-BPs, depending on the cellular context. On the other hand, the activation of different pathways can affect the turnover of different sets of transcripts targeting the same ARE-BP.

Unexpectedly, we found that AKT activation does not affect KSRP interaction with the deadenylase PARN and that deadenylated &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA accumulates when incubated with S100 from &#x003b1;T3-1-myrAKT1 cells in in vitro degradation assays.

As the amount of &#x003b2;-catenin rises, it accumulates in the nucleus, where it interacts with specific transcription factors, leading to regulation of target genes. Inappropriate activation of the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway is linked to a wide range of cancers, including colorectal cancer and melanoma. On the other hand, AKT has emerged as a crucial regulator of widely divergent cellular processes including apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. Disruption of normal AKT signaling has now been documented as a frequent occurrence in several human cancers, and it appears to play an important role in their progression. The results we obtained point to KSRP phosphorylation as a link between PI3K-AKT signaling and the control of &#x003b2;-catenin mRNA t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> and, consequently, of its expression. PI3K-AKT signaling activation, with consequent KSRP phosphorylation and functional deactivation, might contribute to sustain &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation and, as a result, activation of target genes potentially able to accelerate tumor development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents.</title><p>LY and insulin were obtained from Sigma (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com); triciribine, from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences (http://www.emdbiosciences.com); Wnt-3A, from R&#x00026;D Systems (http://www.rndsystems.com); and histone 2B, from Roche (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche.com">http://www.roche.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Plasmids.</title><p>cDNA fragments containing mouse &#x003b2;-catenin cDNA fragments (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050005-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) and GAPDH 3&#x02032; UTR (nucleotides 580&#x02013;810) were subcloned into PstI-XbaI&#x02013;restricted pCY2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050005-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.
