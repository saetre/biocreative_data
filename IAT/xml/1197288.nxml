The development of these features is a consequence of the specification of the identity of the fibre, and its differentiation in the context of its innervation and attachment to tendon cells. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the identity of a muscle fibre is specified by the expression of a combination of transcription factors unique to each muscle and by its location &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b01">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to characteristics that specify the identity of each muscle, all syncytial muscles in flies share a common mechanism of fibre formation. This common mechanism uses a special cell, the founder cell, that organises the fusion process and provides it directionality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b07">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. A founder cell attracts its neighbouring myoblasts&#x02014;the &#x0201c;fusion-competent&#x0201d; myoblasts&#x02014;that fuse with the founder, to form a multi-nucleate myotube. Specific molecules expressed in the founder and fusion-competent cells direct the fusion process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. One such molecule, expressed on the surface of the founder cells and encoded by the gene <italic>dumbfounded (duf</italic>, also called <italic>kin of irre</italic> or <italic>kirre),</italic> is an Ig domain containing membrane protein that interacts with other Ig domain proteins expressed on the surface of fusion-competent cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. This interaction initiates the process of cell fusion. The selection of founder cells and the expression of <italic>duf</italic> in founder cells are thus important first steps in muscle differentiation.</p><p>In the embryo, a founder cell is selected from a cluster of equivalent myoblasts that are specified by activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. From this &#x0201c;equivalent group&#x0201d;, a single cell&#x02014;the precursor cell&#x02014;is chosen by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The precursor cell divides to give rise to two embryonic founder cells or an embryonic founder cell and an adult myoblast progenitor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Founder cells, thus specified, express transcription factors unique to each founder, but all founders express the <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> reporter gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The remaining cells of the equivalent group constitute the fusion-competent myoblasts.</p><p>The muscles of the adult fly are also made using the founder mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The formation of each adult muscle fibre appears to be nucleated by a <italic>duf-lacZ</italic>-expressing cell, and these cells exhibit features characteristic of founders &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In adult myogenesis, <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> expression in a founder pattern is currently the earliest available molecular marker for the formation of muscle founder. The monoclonal antibody 22C10 has also been shown to be a marker of muscle founder cells in the adult abdomen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The antibody 22C10 recognises the microtubule-binding protein Futsch, which has been found to regulate microtubule architecture in neurons during development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Futsch, perhaps, serves a similar function in the developing myofibres and its expression in founder cells could indicate this. The pattern of expression of <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> during myofibre formation and the function of <italic>duf-lacZ</italic>-expressing cells suggest that the founder cell mechanism is conserved through <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and could, perhaps, be even more generally applicable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Significantly, though, the mechanism of founder cell selection during adult myogenesis is different from that used in the embryo: Notch-mediated lateral inhibition does not appear to be used in adult founder cell choice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, in the third larval instar, adult myoblasts in the abdomen, seen associated with nerves, all express <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> at low levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. During pupal development most myoblasts completely shut down <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> expression while some begin to express this reporter in a distinct founder cell pattern &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. This is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The question, then, in adult myogenesis is not how a founder cell is chosen from a group of apparently na&#x000ef;ve myoblasts, but how founder properties are up-regulated in a defined set of myoblasts at the sites of fibre formation, while properties characteristic of fusion-competent cells are up-regulated in other cells.</p><p>We show here that the maturation of adult founder cells in the abdomen of the fly is mediated by signalling through the Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor Heartless (Htl). In particular, we demonstrate a novel interplay of components of FGF signalling that results in a precise pattern of founder cells for each multi-fibre array of muscles. This interplay involves the regulation of Sprouty (Sty) (a negative regulator of FGF signalling) and Heartbroken (Hbr) (a positive regulator required for Htl signalling).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our previous study had shown that Notch-mediated lateral inhibition does not function in the choice of adult founders &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. We next investigated whether one of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family of proteins is involved in selection of adult founders. The family of FGF receptors (FGFRs) constitutes an important member of the RTK super-family, and we examined its role in adult founder cell selection. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has two FGFR-coding genes, <italic>htl</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>breathless</italic> (<italic>btl</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Htl plays a significant part in the patterning of a variety of mesodermal tissues in the embryo.

An average of four dorsal founders per hemi-segment, as opposed to wild-type numbers between 17 and 22, were observed in 49&#x00025; of the hemi-segments, while dorsal founders were completely absent in 17&#x00025; of these hemi-segments (<italic>n =</italic> 30). Lack of a complete suppression of founder cells in experimental pupae was most likely due to the incomplete penetrance of the dnHtl construct (also reported in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g003">3</xref>D show dorsal and lateral hemi-segments, respectively, of dnHtl mis-expressed pupae where the founder cells are completely lost.

In this case too, a decrease in founder number, similar to that in <italic>dnhtl</italic> mis-expression, was observed (data not shown). Yan, a downstream target of MAPK, functions as an RTK-pathway antagonist. It is an Ets-domain-containing transcription factor that keeps the RTK-responsive genes repressed.

Over-expression of an activated form of Htl (<italic>UAS-</italic>&#x003bb;<italic>htl</italic>), using the same <italic>1151-GAL4</italic> driver, led to an increased number of founders and, consequentially, an increased number of muscle fibres in the abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The effect was most prominent for founders for the lateral muscles, where a 2-fold increase in number of founder cells per hemi-segment was observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g004">Figure 4</xref>B shows the excess lateral founders (26 in number) at 28 h APF compared to the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g004">Figure 4</xref>A (13 founders).

The extra <italic>duf-lacZ</italic>-expressing dorsal founders (white arrows) are observed below the rest of the founders.</p><p>Pointed (Pnt), an Ets family protein and a target of MAPK, functions as a positive regulator of the RTK pathway. Upon phosphorylation by MAPK, Pnt outcompetes Yan and turns on genes formerly repressed by Yan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Over-expression of an active form of Pnt, therefore, should have the same effect as that of activated Htl.

During embryonic myogenesis, DER provides inductive signals to specify equivalence group for muscle founder cell selection. In the absence of the function of DER or Spitz (a ligand for DER), a large subset of myofibres and their progenitors fail to form in the embryo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d; Since both DER and Htl function via the Ras pathway, we wanted to ascertain that the phenotypes observed for the adult founders were specific for the Htl pathway. We decreased DER signalling by mis-expressing a dominant-negative construct of DER (<italic>UAS-dnDER</italic>) using <italic>1151</italic>. Separately, we also over-expressed the DER-inactivating ligand Argos (Aos) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d; in all myoblasts by driving <italic>UAS-aos</italic> using <italic>1151-GAL4</italic>. In both cases, mis-expressed progeny had no abnormality in founder cell number and pattern when compared to wild-type (data not shown).</p><p>The above results ruled out the role of DER and confirmed the involvement of the Htl receptor in muscle founder cell choice. However, RTK pathways are also known to function in cell proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;. What, if any, is the contribution of such a role of Htl signalling to the phenotypes we see? The expectation if Htl is not involved in myoblast proliferation is that decreasing Htl signalling in myoblasts should not affect the number of fusion-competent myoblasts. However, since founders are selected from the Twi-expressing myoblast pool, absence of founder cell selection should correspondingly correlate with an increase in myoblast number. We examined the number of Twi-expressing myoblasts at 24 h APF in wild-type pupae and in pupae in which the Htl pathway was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In these pupae, the number of myoblasts per hemi-segment did not show a significant change (lateral myoblasts &#x0005b;<italic>n =</italic> 5&#x0005d;, wild-type, 58 &#x000b1; 5, dnHtl, 60 &#x000b1; 14; dorsal myoblasts &#x0005b;<italic>n =</italic> 4&#x0005d;, wild-type, 96 &#x000b1; 8, dnHtl, 85 &#x000b1; 11). This ruled out the involvement of the Htl pathway in myoblast proliferation. However, because of the variation in number of myoblasts in control and in experimental pupae, it was not feasible to examine the conversion of specific founders into fusion-competent myoblasts. Activating the pathway using an activated-Htl construct caused a very slight increase in myoblast number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) (lateral myoblasts &#x0005b;<italic>n =</italic> 5&#x0005d;, wild-type, 58 &#x000b1; 5, activated Htl, 68 &#x000b1; 9; dorsal myoblasts &#x0005b;<italic>n =</italic> 4&#x0005d;, wild-type, 96 &#x000b1; 8, activated Htl, 122 &#x000b1; 11). This effect is, however, still consistent with the Htl pathway not being involved in myoblast proliferation as activated Htl can activate downstream effectors common to an RTK pathway that controls proliferation. In order to examine the effect of GAL4/UAS-induced Htl activation specifically at the time of founder selection, we used a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (TARGET) system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In this system, the activator function of GAL4 protein can be temporally regulated by a ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive GAL80 protein (GAL80ts) (functional at 18 &#x000b0;C, non-functional at 29 &#x000b0;C). When animals carrying the <italic>1151-GAL4</italic> driver, a UAS construct for the Htl pathway (either <italic>UAS-dnhtl,</italic> or <italic>UAS-</italic>&#x003bb;<italic>htl</italic>), and a <italic>tubulin (tub)&#x02013;GAL80ts</italic> gene were grown at 18 &#x000b0;C, we saw no effect on number of founders or fusion-competent myoblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This illustrated that the <italic>tub-GAL80ts</italic> was effective in preventing the function of GAL4 in the pupal mesoderm. The use of the GAL80ts conditional system thus allowed the Htl pathway to be modulated in a controlled background starting with a similar number of myoblasts. <italic>1151-GAL4; tub-GAL80ts; UAS-dnhtl</italic> pupae, raised at 18 &#x000b0;C for 30 h followed by a heat shock at 29 &#x000b0;C for 11 h, were scored for founder and myoblast number. Down-regulation of Htl resulted in no founders being selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, the number of fusion-competent myoblasts in each hemi-segment did not show any significant increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) over that in the control (lateral myoblasts, control 54 &#x000b1; 7, <italic>GAL4-GAL80ts-dnhtl</italic> 62 &#x000b1; 8; <italic>n =</italic> 4). <italic>1151-GAL4; tub-GAL80ts; UAS-</italic>&#x003bb;<italic>htl</italic> pupae were grown similarly as above. The expectation was that the activation of Htl would result in an excess of founder cells at the expense of Twi-expressing cells. Indeed, when GAL80 was rendered inactive and the GAL4 used to activate Htl, an excess number of founders were seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, myoblast number was comparable to the control (lateral myoblasts in a hemi-segment, control 54 &#x000b1; 7, <italic>GAL4-GAL80ts&#x02013;activated Htl</italic> 62 &#x000b1; 5; <italic>n =</italic> 4), though the pattern of the spatial location of myoblasts was found to be altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, we can safely say that the effect of Htl signalling on founder number is a consequence of a direct involvement of the pathway in founder selection and not due to an indirect effect on myoblast number. However, given the large variation in control myoblast numbers (such that conversion of founder cells into fusion-competent myoblasts is not effectively reflected as an increase in myoblasts in dnHtl pupa), and given that not all myoblasts are converted to founders upon activating Htl, it is not feasible to deduce a precise and predictable relationship between numbers of myoblasts and founders.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Hbr/Dof, a Signalling Protein Specific for <italic>Drosophila</italic> FGFR-Mediated Pathway, Is Expressed in Founder Cells</title><p>The continued expression of Htl in adult myoblasts throughout pupal development suggested that restricted presence of receptor protein is not the mechanism behind selection of founder cells from the myoblast pool.

This suggested that lateral inhibition mediated by Notch, the process that operates in the embryo, is not the mechanism by which adult founders are chosen. Indeed, the requirements are quite different, for adult myoblasts all express <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> at low levels, suggesting&#x02014;consistent with their origins as siblings of embryonic founders&#x02014;that they all already have some properties similar to founder cells. In choosing adult founder cells, therefore, <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> is to be up-regulated in cells that will become founders and down-regulated in others that will become fusion-competent cells. Our results show that the Htl pathway plays a key role in choosing adult founders. We also suggest that Htl does this using an unusual mechanism in which an intracellular positive regulator plays an important role.</p><p>Adult myoblasts in the third larval instar express Twi, Hbr/Dof, Htl, and <italic>sty-lacZ</italic>. At the onset of adult abdominal myogenesis, Twi expression declines. With this, the expression of Hbr and Sty declines in myoblasts. We suggest that, in the third instar larva, the presence of Sty prevents the activation of the Htl receptor, even if the ligand and Hbr/Dof are available. However, since both Hbr/Dof and <italic>sty-lacZ</italic> expression decline with Twi, at the onset of myogenesis, the Htl receptor will still be unable to function, because Hbr/Dof is necessary for the function of the Htl receptor. We would like to suggest that, as Sty and Hbr/Dof expression decline (as Twi expression shuts down at the onset of myogenesis), the Htl receptor is active in some myoblasts. Htl signalling maintains Hbr/Dof expression in these cells by a positive feedback mechanism. Maintenance of Hbr/Dof expression reinforces the Htl signal, which in turn up-regulates the expression of founder-specific genes such as <italic>duf</italic> in these cells, thereby imparting them with founder properties. Consistent with this hypothesis, activating the Htl receptor results in the maintenance of Hbr/Dof in adult myoblasts. This prolonged activation of Hbr/Dof, and therefore of <italic>duf</italic>, could be the cause of morphological changes associated with the excess founder cells, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g004">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g006">6</xref>B.</p><p>How could this localised activation of the receptor occur? One way is via the localised availability of the Htl ligand. Proximity of some of the cells to the source of the ligand could cause higher levels of Htl signalling in those cells than others, thus biasing their fate towards that of a founder. Examining the expression pattern of the recently identified ligands of Htl &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b55">55</xref>&#x0005d; should be able to resolve whether this indeed is the case. A second, and more likely, mechanism for localised activation of receptor is via a process that does not involve the localised presence of the ligand. We suggest this possibility because the continued mis-expression of Hbr/Dof in all adult myoblasts results in an increased number of founders and muscle fibres. Since Hbr/Dof function is dependent on ligand activation of the receptor, the ligand must be available to Htl on all myoblasts. Local activation of the receptor could occur by Hbr/Dof being maintained briefly in a founder cell pattern in some myoblasts even as all of the others down-regulate Sty and Hbr/Dof at the onset of myogenesis (with the decline of Twi expression). This continued expression of Hbr/Dof in some myoblasts, and the absence of Sty, could allow local activation of the receptor and the consequent maintenance of Hbr/Dof in a founder pattern.</p><p>The problem then shifts to deciphering the mechanism by which the (hypothetical) localised activation of Hbr/Dof takes place. Since abdominal myoblasts are associated with nerves, one possibility is that the signal could come from the nerves. This &#x0201c;solution&#x0201d; has two problems, however. First, it is not clear how a precise periodicity of signal, expressed along the nerve and seen by associated myoblasts, would be generated to organise the correct spacing of founder cells. More pertinent perhaps is the observation that surgical removal of the nerve does not affect the number of muscle fibres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b56">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, nerves are unlikely to be the source for the signal that organises myoblasts in a founder pattern. Another possible source for a signal that maintains and elevates Hbr/Dof expression in a founder pattern could be the epidermis. The abdominal epidermis develops from ectodermal cells, the histoblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b57">57</xref>&#x0005d;. As the epidermis differentiates during metamorphosis, muscle tendon precursor cells&#x02014;specified by and expressing the <italic>stripe</italic> locus&#x02014;can be identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b58">58</xref>&#x0005d;. The tendon precursor cells, given that they are in proximity to the differentiating myoblasts, could possibly be a source of organising signal that modulates Hbr/Dof expression to a founder pattern. Thus, the precise segmental and regional patterning of the epidermis could organise the pattern of founder cells in the developing abdominal musculature. In favour of this hypothesis is the finding that reduction of <italic>stripe</italic>-expressing cells in the dorsal thoracic disc results in the reduction of <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> expression in the larval templates that give rise to the thoracic dorsal longitudinal muscles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b53">53</xref>&#x0005d;, and increasing <italic>stripe</italic> expression in the ectoderm results in the increase of <italic>duf-lacZ</italic> expression in the developing dorsal longitudinal muscles (Arjumand Ghazi and K. VijayRaghavan, unpublished data). We do not know yet if these results apply to the abdomen.</p><p>A third possible mechanism of localised activation of Htl, not exclusive of either of the ones mentioned earlier, is that a dynamic interaction between ligands, other activators, and repressors results in the activation of Htl in a specific pattern. Such a process has been described in the embryo, e.g., in the anterior patterning of follicle cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030337-b59">59</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, while many mechanistic details still remain elusive, the implication of the FGF pathway as a key player in adult founder cell choice provides the molecular tools to identify missing elements in the pathway. Integrated within the broad question of founder cell specification are more specific questions pertinent to the different muscle groups. Activation of Htl signalling produces a less prominent effect on the dorsal muscles than on the lateral muscles. Also, the extra founders of the dorsal muscles are located in a characteristic fashion (altered in orientation; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030337-g004">Figure 4</xref>H) that is different from that observed for the excess lateral founders. These observations raise questions about whether the dorsal and lateral groups of founders have different levels of sensitivity to the FGF pathway and whether they employ the pathway in different ways.</p><p>Our results allow the testing of whether this pathway operates in a similar manner during myogenesis in other contexts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in other animals, in particular the higher vertebrates.
