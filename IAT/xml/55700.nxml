As a result, various damage occurs in DNA due to alterations in the chemistry of bases, sugars and phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c1">1</xref>). Such DNA damage may result in mutagenesis or cell death, because of alterations in the base pairing properties of damaged bases, with the formation of mismatched base pairs, or the consequent inhibition of DNA replication and transcription.</p><p> To counteract such deleterious effects of DNA damage, cells are equipped with several types of DNA repair systems. Damaged bases in DNA with relatively small chemical alterations are mainly repaired by the base excision repair (BER) system, which is initiated by excision of damaged bases by specific DNA glycosylases resulting in formation of base loss sites called apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c4">4</xref>). AP sites are also formed by spontaneous base loss.</p><p> BER in mammalian cells is classified into two pathways according to the repair patch size, namely short patch and long patch BER; the former replaces 1 nt while the latter replaces oligonucleotides during repair synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c4">4</xref>). In both pathways incision of DNA 5&#x02032; to AP sites is an essential step to generate accessible 3&#x02032;-OH termini prior to repair synthesis by DNA polymerase and is catalyzed by class II AP endonuclease. In short patch BER, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; removes the 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose 3&#x02032; to the nick due to its deoxyribose phosphatase (dRPase) activity, which generates a 1 nt gap, and then inserts the correct nucleotide; then the nick is sealed by DNA ligase I or III. In long patch BER DNA polymerase &#x003b4; or &#x0025b; extends the DNA strand from the 3&#x02032;-OH terminus for several nucleotides and displaces the strand containing the 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP). The resulting flap structure is removed by specific flap endonuclease (FEN1) and DNA ligase I or III joins the last newly incorporated nucleotide to the extant polynucleotide chain.</p><p> In human cells APE1 (HAP1&#x0002f;APEX&#x0002f;REF-1) is the major class II AP endonuclease in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c8">8</xref>), which is considered to be involved in both the short patch and long patch BER pathways for nuclear DNA.</p><p> On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in addition to nuclear DNA. mtDNA is more susceptible to attack by ROS than nuclear DNA since it is located in the vicinity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where ROS are continuously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c9">9</xref>). It has recently been noted that damaged bases in mtDNA appear to be efficiently repaired by BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c10">10</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that human cells possess nuclear and mitochondrial DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-A) or adenine opposite 8-oxoG, which are encoded by alternatively spliced forms of the OGG1 and MYH transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c12">12</xref>). The human <italic>UNG</italic> gene encodes both nuclear (UNG2) and mitochondrial (UNG1) forms of uracil DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c14">14</xref>). Another human DNA glycosylase encoded by the <italic>NTH1</italic> gene was also reported to have the potential to be localized in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c15">15</xref>), while thymine-glycol DNA glycosylase activity, which is similar to that of NTH1, was purified from rat mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c16">16</xref>). In addition to these DNA glycosylases, DNA polymerase &#x003b3; and DNA ligase III are considered to participate in mitochondrial BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c19">19</xref>). Although AP endonuclease activities were also detected and partially purified from mitochondria isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and a mouse cell line, no gene responsible for them has yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c20">20</xref>).</p><p> Based on genome databases from various organisms a novel group of AP endonucleases has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c24">24</xref>). Among them APE2 protein is the second human AP endonuclease that has been shown to have a weak class II AP endonuclease activity and was also suggested to be localized in the nuclei.</p><p> In the present study we have performed a homology search of various genome databases to retrieve candidates for human mitochondrial AP endonuclease and found APE2 to possess a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). We examined the subcellular localization of authentic APE2 protein in cultured human cells and APE2 was thus demonstrated to be localized in both nuclei and in mitochondria. Furthermore, we also showed that APE2 protein forms foci and is associated with PCNA in the nucleus of human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleotide and amino acid sequence accession numbers</title><p>The cDNA and amino acid sequences for APE2 have been deposited in DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank with accession nos ABO049211 and BAB13764, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals and others</title><p>Recombinant <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were all obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), New England Biolabs and Toyobo Co.

The APE2 protein consists of 518 amino acids, whose N-terminal region (amino acids 1&#x02013;313) is homologous to the XTH-like AP endonuclease family, including <italic>E.coli</italic> XTH and human APE1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>A).</p><p> We retrieved several candidate genes for novel AP endonucleases homologous to <italic>E.coli</italic> XTH and human APE1 from nucleotide sequence databases. Application of the MitoProt II program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c26">26</xref>) revealed that human APE2 protein, <italic>S.pombe</italic> APN2&#x0002f;ETH1 protein (SpAPN2) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> APN2 like protein (AtAPN2, accession no. CAA18499) possess putative MTS at their N-termini (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>B). We predicted that the MTS in APE2 consists of residues 1&#x02013;18 at the N-terminal region and may not be processed after being translocated into mitochondria, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>B.</p><p> The C-terminal region (amino acids 314&#x02013;518) of APE2 is not homologous to XTH or APE1, however, this C-terminal region is partially homologous to the corresponding regions of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> APN2&#x0002f;ETH1 protein (ScAPN2, accession no.

Substantial levels of expression were also detected in samples from adult kidney and brain, but the level was much less in fetal brain.</p><p> For immunological detection of human APE2 protein, rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-APE2) were raised against a TrpE&#x02013;APE2 fusion protein and purified using an antigen affinity column. The anti-APE2 specifically detected 0.1 ng of TrxA&#x02013;APE2 fusion protein in western blot analyses (data not shown). Whole cell extracts prepared from HeLa MRV and HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells expressing HA tagged APE2 protein (532 amino acids, calculated molecular weight 59 103) were subjected to western blotting. A single 60 kDa polypeptide (p60) was detected in the sample from HeLa MRV cells and its size is close to the predicted molecular weight of APE2 protein (518 amino acids, 57 363) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f2">2</xref>B). A 62 kDa polypeptide (p62), corresponding to the recombinant fusion protein APE2&#x02013;HA, was detected in a sample from HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells and its amount was estimated to be 10 times higher than that of authentic p60. To confirm that both p60 and p62 are specifically detected by anti-APE2 we used anti-APE2 pre-adsorbed to TrxA&#x02013;APE2&#x02013;Sepharose in western blot analysis. With this preparation neither p60 nor p62 was detected on the blot, which means that these peptides are authentic APE2 (p60) and recombinant APE2&#x02013;HA (p62). Using purified recombinant TrxA&#x02013;APE2 as the quantitative standard in western blot analysis we estimated that a single cell of HeLa MRV contains 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> molecules of authentic APE2 (data not shown).</p><p> Isolated nuclei and a cytoplasmic fraction prepared from HeLa MRV cells were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-APE2.

A plasmid encoding EGFP fused to the MTS from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit VIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c38">38</xref>) (COX8&#x02013;EGFPm) was also introduced into HeLa MR cells. Living cells incubated in the presence of a mitochondrial fluorescent marker, MitoTracker, were subjected to laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>A). Green fluorescence was evenly distributed in cells expressing EGFP itself and there was no apparent localization of EGFP in the mitochondria based on the findings with MitoTracker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Ac, Af and Ai). However, an exclusive mitochondrial localization of green fluorescence, mostly merged with MitoTracker, was evident in cells expressing COX8&#x02013;EGFPm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Ab, Ae and Ah), thus indicating that EGFP can be targeted to the mitochondria by fusion with a functional MTS. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Aa, in cells expressing APE2&#x02013;EGFPm a relatively intense degree of fibrous fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, which was co-localized with MitoTracker and, in addition, a weak fluorescence was seen to be evenly distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Ad and Ag). These results indicate that the first 15 amino acid sequence of human APE2 protein functions as an MTS but its potential is relatively lower than that of the MTS from COX8. We also analyzed the 20 amino acid leader sequence from APE2 protein, but it had a much lower MTS potential than the 15 amino acid sequence (data not shown).</p><p> We next prepared thin sections from fixed mitochondria isolated from HeLa MRV and HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells and the mitochondrial localizations of authentic APE2 and recombinant APE2&#x02013;HA were analyzed by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, using anti-APE2 in combination with protein A&#x02013;gold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>B). In each of the mitochondrial sections from the HeLa MRV cells one or two specific signals were observed adjacent to the low electron-dense areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Ba), which correspond to the inner membrane of mitochondria. An apparently increased number of gold signals were detected in sections from HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Bc). When anti-APE2 pre-adsorbed to TrxA&#x02013;APE2&#x02013;Sepharose was applied to the sections no signal was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>Bb and Bd). We randomly picked 10 sections from each sample shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>B and the number of gold signals in each section were counted and are shown as a histogram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f3">3</xref>C). From the information in the histogram we conclude that the gold signals in mitochondria from HeLa MR and HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells represent authentic APE2 and recombinant APE2&#x02013;HA, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>APE2 protein forms foci in the nucleus of human cells</title><p>The intracellular distribution of APE2 protein was examined by laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, using anti-APE2 and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled second antibody. In HeLa MRV cells green fluorescence signals were detected mostly in the nuclei as multiple foci and a fluorescent signal was barely seen in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f4">4</xref>Aa). A similar but apparently increased number of fluorescent foci were observed in the nuclei of HeLa MRV:APE2-HA cells and the fluorescence in the cytoplasm also increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f4">4</xref>Ac). The signals detected in both cells were completely diminished by pre-adsorption of anti-APE2 to TrxA&#x02013;APE2&#x02013;Sepharose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f4">4</xref>Ab and Ad).</p></sec><sec><title>APE2 and PCNA are partly co-localized in nuclear foci</title><p>We expected that APE2 protein might be associated with PCNA in the nucleus because APE2 has a putative PCNA-binding motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>C). We thus examined whether APE2 is co-localized with PCNA in the nuclei of human cells. HeLa MRV cells fixed in methanol&#x0002f;acetone were incubated with anti-APE2&#x0002f;Alexa Fluor 488-labeled second antibody and anti-PCNA&#x0002f;Alexa Fluor 594-labeled second antibody. The localization of APE2 and PCNA in the nuclei was analyzed by laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Red fluorescence signals for PCNA were exclusively detected in the nuclei of HeLa MRV cells as multiple foci, as well as APE2 foci shown by green fluorescence. About one-tenth of the APE2 foci were co-localized with the PCNA foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f4">4</xref>Ba&#x02013;Bc). On the other hand, most of the PCNA foci were co-localized with APE2 signals in the nuclei of HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells, thus reflecting overexpression of APE2&#x02013;HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f4">4</xref>Bd&#x02013;Bf).</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular interaction between APE2 and PCNA</title><p>To obtain direct evidence for the association of APE2 with PCNA whole cell extracts prepared from HeLa MRV and HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PCNA and co-precipitation of APE2 protein in the immune complex was examined by western blotting (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f5">5</xref>A). A 60 kDa polypeptide corresponding to authentic APE2 protein was barely detectable in a sample precipitated from HeLa MRV cell lysate, but a substantial amount of p62 corresponding to recombinant APE2&#x02013;HA protein was co-precipitated by anti-PCNA from HeLa MR:APE2-HA cell lysate. We repeated the same experiment six times and obtained similar results as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f5">5</xref>A in three independent experiments. However, no apparent co-precipitation of APE2 was seen in the other three experiments. We also tried to co-precipitate PCNA with APE2 by anti-APE2, but no PCNA was detectable in the samples from HeLa MRV or HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells (data not shown).</p><p> To further confirm the direct interaction between PCNA and APE2 proteins we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down binding assays using immobilized PCNA or TrxA&#x02013;APE2, respectively. First, PCNA or TrxA protein immobilized on TALON resin was incubated with whole cell extract prepared from HeLa MR:APE2-HA cells and APE2&#x02013;HA protein bound to each resin was quantified by western blotting. Nearly 50&#x00025; of the input APE2&#x02013;HA bound to the PCNA resin, while there was no detectable binding of APE2&#x02013;HA protein to the TrxA resin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f5">5</xref>B). Secondly, TrxA&#x02013;APE2 resin was incubated with a purified preparation of recombinant PCNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f5">5</xref>C, a substantial amount of PCNA bound to the resin and the interaction of PCNA with TrxA&#x02013;APE2 was apparently increased in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. Again, there was no detectable binding of PCNA to the TrxA resin. These results indicate that human APE2 protein specifically binds to PCNA.</p><p> To demonstrate that the putative PCNA-binding motif found in APE2 protein is functional by itself we prepared two synthetic biotin-labeled peptides, with a wild-type sequence (YF) or a mutant sequence (AA), corresponding to the PCNA-binding motif of APE2. In mutant (AA) the tyrosine and phenylalanine residues in the wild-type sequence were replaced by alanine residues. Whole cell extract from HeLa MRV was incubated with wild-type or mutant peptide conjugated to streptavidin&#x02013;agarose and bound fractions were subjected to western blotting using anti-PCNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f5">5</xref>D, a substantial amount of PCNA was detected in a sample pulled down with the wild-type peptide but not with the mutant peptide. As a result, the PCNA-binding motif of APE2 is considered to be functional.</p></sec><sec><title>Misincorporation of uracil in nuclear DNA increases association of APE2 and PCNA in the nuclear foci</title><p>Supplemention of the culture medium with HAT and dUrd was reported by Ingraham <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c39">39</xref>) to dramatically elevate the dUTP content in hamster lung fibroblasts. They assumed that the elevated dUTP level increased uracil misincorporation during genomic DNA replication since DNA fragmentation was observed in cells treated with HAT and dUrd. It has been established that misincorporated uracil is repaired via post-replicative BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c41">41</xref>). We thus added subtoxic doses of these supplements to the culture medium of HeLa MRV cells to induce post-replicative BER. After incubation in the medium with or without the supplements for 6 h, HeLa MRV cells were fixed and subjected to laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, as described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f6">6</xref>). The number of nuclear foci doubly labeled with both green and red fluorescence, which are shown in yellow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f6">6</xref>, apparently increased in cells incubated in the presence of HAT and dUrd compared to the cells incubated in the absence of the supplements. The number of APE2 foci, PCNA foci and dual positive foci, in which APE2 and PCNA were co-localized, was counted in 40 randomly selected cells incubated with or without the supplements and the percentages of dual positive foci for each protein were also calculated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke340tb1">1</xref>). The number of dual positive foci but not that of all the foci of each protein increased 3-fold in cells treated with HAT and dUrd in comparison to the cells&#x000a0;without treatment and a statistical analysis demonstrated the increase to be significant (Fisher&#x02019;s exact probability test, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.0001) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke340tb1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study we detected APE2 protein in cultured human cells. This is the first time that endogenous APE2 protein has been demonstrated. We examined its subcellular localization, in relation to the putative MTS and PCNA-binding motif, and came to the two major conclusions described below. Most human APE2 protein is localized in the nuclei, but some is in the mitochondria and such a distribution is partly determined by the N-terminal MTS, thus suggesting that APE2 plays an important role in both nuclear and mitochondrial BER. Furthermore, APE2 forms nuclear foci in human cells and some of them are associated with PCNA. Pull-down binding assays indicated that APE2 directly binds PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and their association is likely to be mediated by the PCNA-binding motif present in the C-terminal region of APE2. We thus propose the existence of a post-replicative BER complex in which APE2 plays a crucial role in a PCNA-dependent manner. <italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down binding assays demonstrated that the interaction between APE2 and PCNA is rather stable even in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. However, co-immunoprecipitation of authentic APE2 by anti-PCNA was not quantitative and co-immunoprecipitation of PCNA by anti-APE2 was hardly achieved. It is likely that both anti-PCNA and anti-APE2 may interfere with the interaction between PCNA and APE2, thus destabilizing the complex.</p><p> It has been believed for a long time that mitochondria have no functional DNA repair system for damage in its genome, since Clayton <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c42">42</xref>) reported that pyrimidine dimers in mammalian mtDNA are not repaired. However, recent studies by several groups have shown the existence of several repair enzymes in mitochondria, especially those involved in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c43">43</xref>). In BER an incision of the DNA strand by a class II AP endonuclease following base excision by DNA glycosylase is an essential step in the initiation of DNA repair synthesis by DNA polymerase. However, APE1, the major AP endonuclease of human cells, has no MTS and a APE1&#x02013;EGFP fusion protein has been reported not to be localized in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c15">15</xref>), thus indicating that APE1 is not involved in BER in the mitochondria. Tomkinson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c20">20</xref>) partially purified AP endonuclease activities from the mitochondria of a mouse cell line and reported that an &#x0223c;65 kDa peptide in the purified fraction cross-reacted with polyclonal anti-APE1 antibodies. Fung <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c44">44</xref>) also reported co-localization of immunofluorescent signals with polyclonal anti-APE1 antibodies and anti-mitochondrial protein in a human cell line. These results suggest that a protein(s) sharing an epitope(s) with APE1 protein is (are) present in the mitochondria of human cells.</p><p> We demonstrated that the N-terminal 15 amino acid sequence of APE2 protein is a functional MTS but its potential is relatively weaker than that of COX8 and that endogenous and recombinant APE2 proteins are localized in the mitochondria by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. We also isolated a cDNA encoding mouse APE2 protein and found that mouse APE2 protein has over 20&#x00025; identity to APE1 and its estimated molecular weight is 57 352 (our unpublished data). The 65 kDa polypeptide reacting with polyclonal anti-APE1 antibodies present in the mitochondrial AP endonuclease fraction from mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c20">20</xref>) may be mouse APE2.</p><p> Human APE2 protein was detected adjacent to the mitochondrial inner membrane by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. We previously reported that human OGG1 and MYH are also localized adjacent to the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c12">12</xref>). It is likely that a repair complex containing the entire machinery essential for BER is associated with the inner membrane and mitochondrial DNAs as expected for the two DNA glycosylases and APE2. As a result, efficient repair by the complex thus probably helps to maintain the functions and the integrity of mtDNA, even if threatened by attack of ROS produced during oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p> Most APE2 proteins are localized as foci in the nuclei of human cells. Although APE2 protein has no typical nuclear localization signal, an NNCN analysis using the PSORT II program was able to predict its nuclear localization because of its amino acid content (reliability 70.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c45">45</xref>). Hadi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that EGFP fused with the C-terminal region (amino acids 313&#x02013;518) of APE2 was localized in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c22">22</xref>). The C-terminal region (amino acids 314&#x02013;518, pI 10.56) of APE2, uniquely conserved in the APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>A, is far more basic than its N-terminal region (amino acids 1&#x02013;313, pI 5.14) and the basic property of this region is likely responsible for its nuclear localization. Furthermore, the C-terminal regions of the APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family contain a consensus sequence for a PCNA-binding motif that in human APE2 has been proven to be functional.</p><p> Unk <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c24">24</xref>) reported that the C-terminal region of ScAPN2 is completely dispensable for its AP endonuclease activity measured <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not for <italic>in vivo</italic> suppression of the increased sensitivity of an <italic>apn1</italic>&#x00394;&#x0002f;<italic>apn2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant to methyl methanesulfonate. A mutant ScAPN2 lacking a region to the TOP3 homologous sequence but not to the PCNA-binding motif from its C-terminus was able to complement the double mutant. This observation strongly suggested that the PCNA-binding motifs found in the APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family proteins are indeed essential for their <italic>in vivo</italic> function.</p><p> PCNA forms a homotrimer with a ring structure and functions as a DNA sliding clamp, which is an accessory factor for a number of proteins related to DNA replication and DNA repair, including DNA polymerase &#x003b4;&#x0002f;&#x0025b;, FEN1, DNA ligase I, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c47">47</xref>). Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c50">50</xref>) reconstituted a novel BER pathway dependent on PCNA using purified enzyme components. The PCNA-dependent BER pathway may have two biological roles. First of all, PCNA-dependent BER may repair modified AP sites which cannot be processed by the dRPase activity of DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, i.e. FEN1 cleaves the flapped ends generated during elongation of the DNA strand by DNA polymerase &#x003b4;&#x0002f;&#x0025b;. Secondly, post-replicative BER for efficient repair of dUMP misincorporated during DNA replication is also likely to be PCNA dependent, as proposed by Nilsen <italic>et al</italic>. (40) and Otterlei <italic>et al.</italic> (41). A nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) possesses a PCNA-binding motif and it may initiate post-replicative BER in association with PCNA once dUMP is misincorporated during DNA replication.</p><p> Oxidized nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, which are known to be substrates for oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase, MTH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c52">52</xref>), may also be incorporated during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c53">53</xref>). dAMP may be misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG in template DNA. These misincorporated nucleotides can be repaired by human OGG1 or MYH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c12">12</xref>) and post-replicative BER dependent on PCNA is likely to promote efficient and well-coordinated repair of these misincorporated nucleotides during DNA replication. OGG1 and MYH proteins also have putative PCNA-binding motifs, thus indicating the importance of PCNA-dependent post-replicative BER (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke340f1">1</xref>C). Recently MYH protein was reported to bind to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c54">54</xref>). In the PCNA-dependent BER pathway most steps are likely to be processed dependent on a DNA clamp, PCNA. Already, several catalytic components in the pathway have been demonstrated to have a PCNA-binding motif, i.e. their functions are somehow PCNA dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c50">50</xref>). Among them only APE1 lacks a PCNA-binding motif. Since APE2 has a functional PCNA-binding motif and is actually associated with PCNA in nuclei, APE2 is likely to be the AP endonuclease responsible for the PCNA-dependent BER pathway. The increased co-localization of APE2 and PCNA in nuclear foci after treatment with HAT and dUrd supports the involvement of APE2 in the post-replicative BER complex.</p><p> In the C-terminal regions of APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family proteins another subregion is also conserved. This subregion contains a sequence homologous to the C-terminal repeats found in TOP3 family proteins. This subregion may also play a role in the interaction with other proteins related to BER.</p><p> In mitochondria, DNA polymerase &#x003b3; accessory subunit p55 was reported to function as a DNA clamp on mtDNA, like PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c56">56</xref>). It is not likely that PCNA is localized in the mitochondria and thus accessory subunit p55 may function as a DNA clamp for APE2 in mitochondria, if necessary. Reconstituting mitochondrial BER with recombinant proteins is expected to help us answer this question.</p><p> APE2 and ScAPN2 have been reported to have class II AP endonuclease activities <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, their activities were much weaker than those of APE1 and XTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke340c24">24</xref>). The recombinant APE2 proteins expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and insect cells were mostly insoluble (our unpublished data). These observations suggest that the interaction of APE2 with other cellular components such as PCNA and DNA may facilitate its proper folding or enhance its catalytic function. It is possible that APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family proteins may exert their AP endonuclease activities only toward DNA with AP sites on the newly synthesized strand.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke340f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> APE2 and other members of the APE2&#x0002f;APN2 family.
