APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) are host cell DNA-editing enzymes that induce extensive HIV-1 mutation that severely attenuates viral replication. The HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif), expressed in vivo, counteracts the antiviral activity of A3G and A3F by inducing their degradation. Other APOBECs may contribute more to viral diversity by inducing less extensive mutations allowing viral replication to persist. Here we show that in APOBEC3C (A3C)-expressing cells infected with the patient-derived HIV-1 molecular clones 210WW, 210WM, 210MW, and 210MM, and the lab-adapted molecular clone LAI, viral G-to-A mutations were detected in the presence of Vif expression. Mutations occurred primarily in the <underline>G</underline>A context and were relatively infrequent, thereby allowing for spreading infection. The mutations were absent in cells lacking A3C but were induced after transient expression of A3C in the infected target cell. Inhibiting endogenous A3C by RNA interference in Magi cells prevented the viral mutations. Thus, A3C is necessary and sufficient for G-to-A mutations in some HIV-1 strains. A3C-induced mutations occur at levels that allow replication to persist and may therefore contribute to viral diversity. Developing drugs that inhibit A3C may be a novel strategy for delaying viral escape from immune or antiretroviral inhibition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>HIV has shown a chameleon-like nature, always changing to adapt to its environment. Defining the factors that drive and regulate genetic changes in HIV over time is key to understanding how HIV causes disease and escapes from the body's immune responses and drug treatment. The diversity of HIV has implications for the development of effective drugs and for fostering better immune responses. In this study, we showed that a human protein, called APOBEC3C (A3C), could induce certain mutations in some HIV-1 strains, including those derived from a patient who had developed rapid drug resistance. Eliminating the expression of this protein prevented the mutations in two different types of cells. Furthermore, short-term A3C expression was sufficient to cause mutation. We conclude that A3C is necessary and sufficient to induce signature mutations in HIV-1. A3C-induced mutations may provide potential benefit for the virus if the mutation rate is low enough such that the majority of viruses are able to replicate, while accumulating a limited number of novel mutations that may allow the virus to survive in the face of antiviral drugs or immune responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bourara K, Liegler TJ, Grant RM (2007) Target cell APOBEC3C can induce limited G-to-A mutation in HIV-1.

In this assay, the wild-type RT sequence gives rise to a blue colony whereas a mutated sequence containing a stop codon will give rise to a white colony. At day 5 post infection by 210WW, cellular DNA from PBMC, CEMSS, and SupT1 were amplified using primers that cannot distinguish between mutated and non-mutated sequences. The PCR fragments, containing six tryptophan codons susceptible to become stop codons if G-to-A mutations occur, were inserted in frame with the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene. After validating the assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we counted the number of white and blue colonies obtained from the different infections. In SupT1 cells infected with 210WW, four out of 1,219 clones were white (0.3&#x00025;). This rate is equivalent to the background of the assay. Upon sequencing, the few white clones that were found contained insertion-deletion mutations leading to frame-shifts, rather than G-to-A mutations leading to stop codons, consistent with the absence of A3C in SupT1 cells. In contrast, 78 out of 937 clones from PBMC were white (8.3&#x00025;), and 61 out of 1,290 clones from CEMSS were white (4.7&#x00025;). The low frequencies of lethal mutations (4&#x00025;&#x02013; 8&#x00025;) induced in A3C-expressing cells could explain the comparable kinetics observed between 210WW, which is susceptible to A3C, and NL4&#x02013;3, which is relatively resistant.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Overall Rate of G-to-A Mutations in the Viral Population Is Low in Cells Expressing A3C</title><p>The low frequency of lethal mutation suggests that the overall rate of G-to-A mutation within the viral population should also be low in cells expressing A3C.

We found that transient A3C expression was sufficient to cause mutation of a patient-derived infectious HIV-1 molecular clone in SupT1 cells. Reciprocally, specific abrogation of A3C expression prevented G-to-A mutation in Magi and 293T cells, demonstrating that A3C is required for mutation in these cell lines. Furthermore, G-to-A mutation is detected in CEMSS cells, which we found express A3C but not A3B, A3F, or A3G. A role for A3C in PBMC is suggested by the activity of the enzyme that can act on both <underline>G</underline>A and <underline>G</underline>G contexts: Both mutational patterns are widely observed in vivo with G-to-A mutation in the <underline>G</underline>A context more predominant than in the <underline>G</underline>G context &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, in CEMSS cells that endogenously express only A3C, G-to-A mutation was predominately detected in the <underline>G</underline>A context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030153-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). These data are consistent with the notion that A3C is necessary and sufficient to induce G-to-A mutation in HIV-1.</p><p>G-to-A mutations occurring at low rates in a high background of wild-type viruses were detected in this study using a sensitive G-to-A detection assay adapted from Janini et al, 2000 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this approach is useful to sensitively detect G-to-A mutations in the viral population, and to assess the relative frequency of mutation in the <underline>G</underline>A versus <underline>G</underline>G context, it is not quantitative. To confirm and quantify the rate of mutation detected in A3C-expressing cells we used the blue and white complementation assay and clonal analysis of sequences.</p><p>The blue and white complementation assay and clonal analysis of gene segments amplified using non-selective primers indicated that the majority of viral sequences was not altered after exposure to A3C: 27&#x00025; of the 210WW clones harbor only one to two G-to-A mutations. We also found that mutated sequences containing premature stop codons induced by G-to-A mutation reflect less than 9&#x00025; of the 210WW clones. A low rate of G-to-A mutation likely explains the negligible antiviral effect of A3C on the 210 and LAI viruses. Other studies reported that A3C did not exhibit strong antiviral activity against HIV-1 NL4&#x02013;3 replication, which is consistent with our own observations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The minimal antiviral effect of A3C reflects the low frequencies of mutation documented in blue and white complementation assay and clonal analysis of virus populations. Limited G-to-A mutation associated with A3C may be deleterious for some viral progeny, but surviving progeny would have greater genetic diversity. Protease D30N mutations, which confer clinically important resistance to the protease inhibitor nelfinavir &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, appeared in 5&#x00025; of 210WW clones from PBMC infections. While other proteins expressed in PBMCs may have contributed to the D30N mutations observed, A3C is a likely inducer for the following reasons: A3C is expressed in PBMCs; D30N mutations were observed exclusively in infections with 210WW, which is susceptible to A3C, but not in infections with NL4&#x02013;3 or NL4&#x02013;3 <italic>&#x00394;vif,</italic> which are susceptible to other deaminases; and all three viruses have the same reverse transcriptase, suggesting that reverse transcriptase errors could not account for the differential rates of mutation observed in the different infections.</p><p>The action of A3C was observed primarily in infectious molecular clones of HIV-1, derived from a patient who rapidly developed drug resistance and virological drug failure during therapy with a protease inhibitor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. G-to-A mutation associated with A3C expression was also observed in the molecular clone LAI, which may suggest that A3C action is not restricted to the 210 viruses. Susceptibility to A3C-mediated mutation was higher in the 210 family of viruses compared to the NL4&#x02013;3 family of viruses. The mechanism for this difference in susceptibility to A3C is not known, although the 210 family of viruses differs from NL4&#x02013;3 in Gag and Pro (the DNA alignment as well as the amino acid alignment of 210WW, LAI, and NL4&#x02013;3 is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030153-sg001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030153-sg002">S2</xref>). The patient-derived <italic>gag</italic> segment in 210 is 6&#x00025; divergent from NL4&#x02013;3 overall. Differences in Gag may alter the stability of the viral core, or the pre-integration complex, which would affect how long nascent single-stranded cDNA is available to bind with A3C in the target cell. More work is needed to identify the viral determinants of A3C susceptibility, and to seek clinical correlations of A3C susceptibility.</p><p>The action of A3C differs from that of A3G, A3F, and A3B in several ways. A3G appears to act both in the virion and the target cell: target cell action appears to involve impaired reverse transcription rather than cytidine deamination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. A3G, A3F, and A3B cause G-to-A hypermutation when incorporated in the budding virion, producing lethal hypermutation early in the synthesis of viral cDNA that frequently occurs in the virion. In contrast, A3C seems to act only in the target cell based on the following observations: G-to-A mutation was not observed in SupT1 cells (using the sensitive and the blue and white assays) that were infected with viruses produced in 293T cells, which express A3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030153-g001">Figure 1</xref>), while viruses propagated in SupT1 acquire mutation only when they infect A3C-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030153-t001">Table 1</xref>). Target cell action was further demonstrated by transient expression or transient knockdown of A3C in target cells, which determined the appearance of G-to-A mutation in single-cycle infections. The exposure of the viral cDNA to A3C in the target cell could be limited, which may decrease the frequency of viral mutation to sublethal levels, allowing surviving progeny to have greater genetic diversity to adapt and escape from immune responses or antiviral drugs.</p><p>HIV diversity is the major obstacle for effective treatment of HIV patients. It has been suggested that natural genetic variations in A3G/A3F and/or <italic>vif</italic> may result in an incomplete neutralization of those cytidine deaminases allowing the remaining enzymes to exert a low level of mutation on the HIV-1 genome and potentially inducing viral diversity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030153-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

In conclusion, we demonstrate here that A3C is necessary and sufficient for G-to-A mutations in some HIV-1 strains. A3C-induced mutations occur at levels that allow replication to persist and may therefore play a role in driving viral diversity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>The cell lines H9, CEMSS, SupT1, Magi, and 293T were directly obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.

We also determined that the background of this assay was around 0.3&#x00025;, which corresponded to the percentage of white colonies detected using 100&#x00025; wild-type plasmids. The sequences of the white clones obtained in this specific mix revealed insertions or deletions interrupting the reading frame, and not stop codons. We also sequenced 20 white and 20 blue clones obtained from the other mix to verify their mutation content and the presence of stop codons. 20/20 blue clones were wild-type sequences and 20/20 white clones were mutated sequences.
