The close association of homologous chromosomes during interphase, a phenomenon termed somatic chromosome pairing, has been observed in cancerous cells, but the functional consequences of somatic pairing have not been established. Gene expression profiling studies revealed that somatic pairing of chromosome 19 is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in renal oncocytoma, a neoplasia of the adult kidney. Somatic pairing was associated with significant disruption of gene expression within the paired regions and resulted in the deregulation of the prolyl-hydroxylase ELGN2, a key protein that regulates the oxygen-dependent degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Overexpression of ELGN2 in renal oncocytoma increased ubiquitin-mediated destruction of HIF and concomitantly suppressed the expression of several HIF-target genes, including the pro-death <italic>BNIP3L</italic> gene. The transcriptional changes that are associated with somatic pairing of chromosome 19 mimic the transcriptional changes that occur following DNA amplification. Therefore, in addition to numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, alterations in chromosomal spatial dynamics should be considered as genomic events that are associated with tumorigenesis. The identification of <italic>EGLN2</italic> as a significantly deregulated gene that maps within the paired chromosome region directly implicates defects in the oxygen-sensing network to the biology of renal oncocytoma.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Together, renal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) account for approximately 10&#x00025; of masses that are resected from the kidney. However, the molecular defects that are associated with the development of these neoplasias are not clear. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in genetics and computational analysis to screen for chromosomal abnormalities that are present in both renal oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC. We show that while chromophobe RCC cells contain an extra copy of chromosome 19, the renal oncoctyoma cells contain a rarely reported chromosomal abnormality. Both of these chromosomal abnormalities result in transcriptional disruptions of <italic>EGLN2</italic>, a gene that is located on chromosome 19 and is critical for the cellular response to changes in oxygen levels. Defects in oxygen sensing are found in other types of kidney tumors, and the identification of <italic>EGLN2</italic> directly implicates defects in the oxygen-sensing network in these neoplasias as well. These findings are important because the chromosomal defect present in renal oncocytomas may also be present in other tumor cells. In addition, deregulation of <italic>EGLN2</italic> reveals a unique way in which perturbations in oxygen-sensing are associated with disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular adaptation to changes in oxygen tension is vital for the integrity, maintenance and survival of cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the major transcription factor of the ubiquitous oxygen-sensing pathway, is a heterodimer composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Wang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While HIF&#x003b2; is constitutively expressed and stable, HIF&#x003b1; is oxygen-labile by the virtue of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain, which undergoes rapid oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Maxwell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Jaakkola1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the stability of HIF&#x003b1; dictates the transcriptional activity of HIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Jiang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Critical regulators of HIF&#x003b1; stability are the prolyl-hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD/EGLNs) that hydroxylate HIF&#x003b1; on conserved prolines within the ODD domain in the presence of oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Bruick1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Ivan2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Hydroxylated HIF&#x003b1; is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. VHL is the substrate-conferring component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase called ECV (Elongins/Cul2/VHL) that specifically polyubiquitinates prolyl-hydroxylated HIF&#x003b1; for subsequent destruction via the 26S proteasome.</p><p>Deregulation of HIF&#x003b1; regulatory proteins has been strongly associated with cancer development. Germline inheritance of a faulty <italic>VHL</italic> allele on chromosome 3p25 is the cause of VHL disease, characterized by a high frequency of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), cerebellar hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and retinal angioma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Latif1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Inactivation of the remaining wild-type VHL allele in a susceptible cell leads to tumor formation. Somatic biallelic inactivation of <italic>VHL</italic> is also responsible for the development of sporadic clear-cell RCCs, the predominant form of adult kidney cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Iliopoulos1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Kenck1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Cells that are devoid of functional VHL show elevated expression of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes due to a failure to degrade HIF&#x003b1;. In addition to VHL, deregulation of the PHD/EGLN family of prolyl-hydroxylases have also been associated with abnormal cell growth. Development of erythrocytosis, characterized by an excess of erythrocytes, has been associated with inactivating germline mutations in PHD2/EGLN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Percy1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Takeda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Pheochromocytoma, a neuroendocrine tumor of the medulla of the adrenal glands, is linked with deregulation of PHD3/EGLN3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Lee1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While biallelic inactivation of VHL is found in the majority of clear cell RCCs, kidney cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided into several subtypes based on morphological and cytogenetic features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Mostfi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Kovacs1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytoma are two related kidney tumors that together account for approximately 10&#x00025; of all renal masses. In contrast to clear cell RCC, <italic>VHL</italic> mutations and/or increased expression of hypoxia-inducible genes are not found in these tumor subtypes and molecular genetic defects that are associated with tumor development remain unclear. Identification of molecular genetic defects in renal oncocytoma is particularly challenging as these cells are often described as karyotypically normal and the presence of cytogenetically abnormal regions in which to search for tumor modifying genes is rare in this tumor subtype.</p><p>To identify molecular defects associated with renal tumor development, we analyzed gene expression data from a variety of kidney tumors. This analysis revealed that renal oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC have a striking transcriptional disruption along chromosome 19. While in chromophobe RCC the disruption reflected a chromosome 19 amplification, in the renal oncocytoma cells the disruption reflected the close association, or pairing, of chromosome 19q in interphase. <italic>EGLN2</italic> located within the paired region was dramatically overexpressed in renal oncocytoma cells and was associated with the deregulation of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes including a pro-death <italic>BNIP3L</italic>. Thus, chromosome 19q pairing in renal oncocytoma unveils a unique mechanism of disrupting oxygen homeostasis via altering the expression of EGLN2.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Gene expression profiling data derived from renal oncocytomas and chromophobe RCCs was scanned for regional increases or decreases in RNA production, which often indicate the presence of chromosomal amplifications or deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Hughes1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Pollack1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with previous cytogenetic studies, the renal oncocytoma cells were largely devoid of transcriptional abnormalities that would reflect a DNA amplification or deletion. In contrast, losses of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, and 17 are frequently found in chromophobe RCC. In our chromophobe RCC samples, these well-established chromosomal losses were strongly reflected in the gene expression profiling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, a transcriptional abnormality involving genes mapping to chr 19 was frequently identified in both the renal oncocytomas and the chromophobe RCCs but not other subtypes of RCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000176.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In renal oncocytomas, the transcriptional abnormality primarily involved the q arm of chromosome 19, while in chromophobe RCC the abnormality involved the entire chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000176-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000176.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Transcriptional abnormalities in oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC.</title><p>(A) Genomic regions that have significantly higher (red) or lower (blue) RNA production in renal oncocytoma (ON, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) and chromophobe RCC (CR, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) relative to non-diseased kidney (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) were identified using the comparative genomic microarray analysis (CGMA) method as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.

As gain of chromosome 19 has not been previously reported as a recurrent abnormality in either renal oncocytoma or chromophobe RCC, DNA copy number analysis was performed on a subset of these samples using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. From the SNP data, an amplification of the entirety of chromosome 19 was detected in the chromophobe RCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This whole-chromosome amplification was confirmed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using locus-specific probes that mapped to the p and q arms of chromosome 19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000176.s006">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, no change in DNA copy number was detected in the renal oncocytoma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>). As a positive control for the DNA copy number analysis, only oncocytoma (ON) samples derived from female patients were examined, and a relative gain of the X chromosome was clearly detected in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To determine the status of chromosome 19 in more detail in the renal oncocytoma cells, this chromosome was evaluated further using a panel of FISH probes. Two distinct and well-separated FISH signals, typical of diploid cells in interphase, were frequently observed when probes specific to the chr 19p arm were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000176.s007">Table S2</xref>). In contrast, a single, large FISH signal (singlet) or two FISH signals that were in close proximity (proximal doublet) were frequently observed when probes specific to the chr 19q arm were used. Approximately 35&#x00025; of cells examined contained the singlet signal, while an additional 18&#x00025; of cells contained proximal doublets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000176.s007">Table S2</xref> and data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000176-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000176.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Somatic chromosome pairing in renal oncocytoma.</title><p>Representative photomicrographs of tri-color interphase FISH on renal oncocytoma touch preparations.

This analysis demonstrated that the size of the singlet FISH signal was on average 1.5-fold larger than the size of two well-separated 19q FISH signals (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02). This large signal was observed using multiple probes directed against the q arm of the chromosome, including centromeric and telomeric probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g002">Figure 2C,E</xref>). The large FISH singlet had striking similarities to the FISH signals observed in studies of somatically paired chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Arnoldus1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Iourov1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Somatic pairing refers to the close association of homologous chromosomes and is typically associated with chromosomes in meiotic prophase.

The lack of evidence for a DNA copy number change coupled with the presence of large FISH singlets and proximal doublets using multiple locus-specific probes, suggested that chr 19q was somatically paired.</p><p>To confirm that the q arms of chr 19 were somatically paired in the renal oncocytoma cells, the p and q arms of chr 19 were visualized simultaneously using whole-arm chromosome painting (WCP). Using this approach, two distinct p arms, typical of diploid cells in interphase, were frequently observed in renal oncocytoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g002">Figure 2G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000176.s007">Table S2</xref>).

While the diffuse nature of the WCP prevented the quantification the fluorescence signal, this pattern is consistent with the locus-specific FISH analysis and further indicates that the q arms of the chromosomes are in close proximity or are paired in these cells.</p><p>The changes in gene expression that accompanied the somatic pairing suggested that deregulation of a gene, or multiple genes, associated with tumor development mapped within the paired chr 19q region. As deregulation of the oxygen-sensing network is a common event in other types of sporadic renal cell carcinomas, genes associated with HIF regulation and that mapped to chr 19q were identified from the Entrez Gene database and tested for expression defects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Specifically, a six-fold decrease in oxygen concentration (3&#x00025; to 0.5&#x00025; oxygen) resulted in approximately a four-fold increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; levels (2.5 to 9.8 densitometry units). Further, we noted that HIF-1&#x003b1; levels change in an analogous manner upon induction of hyper-oxygenated conditions: a six-fold increase in oxygen concentration (3&#x00025; to 18&#x00025; oxygen) results in greater than a three-fold decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; levels (2.5 to 0.75 densitometry units). The association between decreased HIF-1&#x003b1; and hyper-oxygenated conditions is easier to evaluate if the HIF dose-response data is plotted on a log-log scale rather than a linear-linear scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000176-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Deregulation of HIF, the principal driver of the adaptive response to hypoxia, is associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer. While the hypoxic tumor microenvironment - by the virtue of the ubiquitous oxygen-sensing pathway - results in modulation of HIF activity, loss-of-function mutations in a growing list of tumor suppressor genes also can affect HIF function. Mutations in PTEN, PML, TSC, and VHL have been identified in tumor cells that result in the deregulation of HIF via multiple distinct mechanisms involving Akt/PI3K, mTOR and the ubiquitin pathway. Emerging evidence now implicates cancer-causing mutations that directly impinge on EGLNs. For example, mutations in <italic>succinate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>SDH</italic>) result in the cytosolic accumulation of succinate, which inhibits EGLNs, leading to the stabilization and activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Isaacs1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Selak1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

More recently, an E3 ubiquitin ligase called Siah2 was identified to target EGLN2 for ubiquitin-mediated destruction and thereby revealing another level of HIF regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The activity of Siah2 is induced under physiologic hypoxia (&#x0003c;10&#x00025; oxygen), resulting in reduced levels of EGLN2 and stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1;. The present findings suggest that the overexpression of EGLN2 via somatic pairing is sufficient to counteract the suppressive activity of Siah2 under physiologic hypoxia. Under hyper-oxygenated conditions (21&#x00025; oxygen; frequently used as experimental normoxia), Siah2 activity is attenuated via a yet-defined mechanism, resulting in the increased abundance of EGLN2 and concomitant reduction in the level of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000176-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The ectopic expression of EGLN2 under 21&#x00025; oxygen did not result in further diminution of HIF-target gene expression (data not shown), which is likely due to the fact that endogenous EGLN2 is highly abundant or that every available EGLN2 is already activated under hyper-oxygenated conditions.</p><p>HIF-regulated genes are involved in many physiological processes including angiogenesis, metabolism, cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. As such, disruption in the regulation of HIF may affect several regulatory pathways that contribute to the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells.
