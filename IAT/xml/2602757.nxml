In cells containing wild-type p53, the levels of <italic>PPM1D</italic> mRNA and protein increase following exposure to genotoxic stress, but the mechanism of regulation by p53 was unknown. <italic>PPM1D</italic> also has been identified as a CREB-regulated gene due to the presence of a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the promoter. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in HCT116 cells were used to characterize a conserved p53 response element located in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene that is required for the p53-dependent induction of transcription from the human <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter. CREB binding to the CRE contributes to the regulation of basal expression of <italic>PPM1D</italic> and directs transcription initiation at upstream sites. Following exposure to ultraviolet (UV) or ionizing radiation, the abundance of transcripts with short 5&#x02032; UTRs increased in cells containing wild-type p53, indicating increased utilization of downstream transcription initiation sites. In cells containing wild-type p53, exposure to UV resulted in increased PPM1D protein levels even when <italic>PPM1D</italic> mRNA levels remained constant, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of PPM1D protein levels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>PPM1D, a member of the PP2C family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, was first identified as a wild-type p53-induced phosphatase (Wip1), the expression of which was increased in human cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The human PPM1D and mouse Ppm1d proteins are 83% homologous and are similarly induced in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcription is induced following exposure to many DNA damage-inducing agents, including NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and MNNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <italic>PPM1D</italic> was identified as a component of a 16-gene signature characterizing the p53-dependent DNA-damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The transient increase in <italic>PPM1D</italic> mRNA levels following exposure to IR is similar to that of the well-characterized, direct, p53 target gene <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (p21<italic><sup>Waf1</sup></italic>). Despite the robustness of the p53 dependence of <italic>PPM1D</italic> induction in human and mouse cells and tissues, evidence for the direct control of this induction by p53 has been lacking.</p><p>Basal expression of <italic>PPM1D</italic> exhibits tissue and developmental stage-specific variation that normally is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Cells derived from <italic>Ppm1d</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice exhibit a slower doubling time, suggesting that Ppm1d also functions in the normal, regulated proliferation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Overexpression of PPM1D is frequently observed in several types of cancer, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), ovarian adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and the tumors in which PPM1D is overexpressed frequently contain wild-type p53. PPM1D functions in a negative regulatory loop coordinating p38 MAPK activity and p53 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). PPM1D negatively regulates stress response signaling by specifically dephosphorylating the protein kinase p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Since p53 is a target of p38 MAPK signaling, this activity also indirectly reduces p53 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). More recently, Ser15 of p53 as well as Ser1981 of ATM were found to be directly dephosphorylated by PPM1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p><italic>PPM1D</italic> was identified as a potential cyclic AMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) target gene in a genome-wide comparison that examined the sequence and positional conservation of CRE sites in human and homologous mouse genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). CREB and the activating transcription factors (ATF) constitute a family of closely related proteins that bind to CRE (5&#x02032;-TGACGTCA-3&#x02032;) sequences present in the promoter regions of many genes involved in the response to proliferation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Subsequently, a genome-wide localization analysis detected highly significant association of CREB with chromatin in the region of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter in human kidney, hepatocyte and islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These results suggest that CREB contributes to the control of the basal expression of <italic>PPM1D</italic>.</p><p>p53 and CREB directly associate through protein&#x02013;protein interactions involving the N-terminal activation domain of p53 and the bZip domain of CREB, implying that CREB and possibly other CREB/ATF family members may influence the transactivation of p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Recently, a complex containing p53, CREB and KLF4 was found to control the basal expression of the bradykinin B2 receptor promoter in the developing kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>PPM1D</italic> induction after treatments that damage DNA occurs with similar kinetics in human and mouse cells and is similarly dependent on wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In the present work, we report that the p53-dependent induction of <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression in human cells after exposure to IR or UV is mediated through a conserved p53 response element (p53RE) located within the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR), 150 nt before the translation initiation codon. In the absence of stress, the binding of CREB or a CREB/ATF family transcription factor contributes to the basal transcription of <italic>PPM1D</italic>. Increased expression of <italic>PPM1D</italic> following DNA-damaging treatments requires the presence of wild-type p53. Here we show that binding of p53 to the p53 RE within the proximal promoter shifts the major site of transcription initiation closer to the beginning of the PPM1D open reading frame, thereby producing mRNAs with shorter 5&#x02032; UTRs that may be more efficiently translated. Thus the location of the p53 RE within the 5&#x02032; UTR provides a mechanism for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene by p53.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Putative p53 binding sites were identified using the p53MH algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) with the following parameters: unweighted gap sizes from 0 to 13; core weighting factor, 2; likelihood ratio scoring method; minimum score, 21.5.

To locate potential p53REs regulating <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression, we applied the p53 MH algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) to the human <italic>PPM1D</italic> and mouse <italic>Ppm1d</italic> genomic sequences from 5 kb upstream of the translation start site through the 3&#x02032; UTR.

For both species, two of these high-scoring sites are located in the proximal promoter. Interestingly, both sites reside in regions of high sequence conservation among mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

The upstream site in the mouse gene is located at a similar distance from the translation initiation site but does not align exactly with the human p53 RE site. The downstream p53RE identified by the p53 MH algorithm consists of two half-sites separated by a spacer of 4 bp that match the consensus at 18 of 20 positions. The human and mouse sequences are identical over this 24-bp span. A third half-site, which deviates from the consensus pattern at three positions, immediately follows the second half-site.

The amount of the p53 expression vector was adjusted to produce a level of p53 similar to that produced in the related HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells after exposure to 10 Gy IR. Cellular extracts were prepared 4 h after exposure to IR, and the resulting relative, normalized firefly luciferase activities are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B. The promoterless construct pGL3.4 produced a low level of activity either in the absence or presence of wild-type p53. Insertion of the 848-bp EcoRI to BamHI fragment of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter into the pGL3-Luc vector resulted in substantial expression of firefly luciferase, even in the absence of p53, consistent with basal expression of <italic>PPM1D</italic> in most cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The same construct resulted in 1.5-fold higher expression in the presence of wild-type p53. Constructs containing shorter <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter fragments similarly resulted in substantial luciferase activity in the absence of p53 and &#x0223c;1.6-fold higher levels in the presence of wild-type p53. The pGL3 derivative containing the promoter region of the human <italic>BBC3</italic> (PUMA) gene produced only a low level of luciferase activity in the absence of p53, but the activity increased &#x0223c;2.6-fold in the presence of p53, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These experiments show that the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter region exhibits substantial p53-independent transcription initiation activity in HCT116 cells and that the increased expression in the presence of wild-type p53 results from components within the 470 bp upstream of the translation start site. Under our conditions, the &#x02013;0.7-kb site does not contribute to the observed p53-dependent increased activity of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter. However, the presence of a nearby conserved E2F-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) in the human sequence and the identification of a potential p53 RE in the mouse <italic>Ppm1d</italic> promoter at similar distances from the respective E2F site and translation initiation codon suggests that the upstream p53-binding sites may be functional in some circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>The p53RE located within the 5&#x02032; UTR conferred p53-responsiveness to the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter</title><p>The putative p53-binding site is situated downstream of the transcription initiation site of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> reference mRNA (NM_003620) and is located 178 bp upstream of the translation start site.

Insertion of the p53 response element from the p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) resulted in a low level of expression in the absence of p53 that was strongly increased in the presence of p53. Insertion of the 36-bp sequence encompassing the <italic>PPM1D</italic> p53RE site or any of the mutated forms into the pGL3/E1b TATA vector resulted in only slightly increased expression in the absence of p53. Luciferase activity resulting from expression from the construct containing the <italic>PPM1D</italic> p53RE sequence was strongly increased in the presence of wild-type p53, exhibiting about a 12-fold increase over that in the absence of p53. In comparison with the wild-type p53RE sequence, mutation of the first half-site reduced the expression level in the presence of p53 by 35%. Mutation of the third half-site or all three half-sites abolished p53-dependent expression. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Functional analysis of p53 binding to <italic>PPM1D</italic> proximal promoter sequences.

In the absence of p53, the wild-type promoter and the three mutant forms resulted in very similar levels of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, right panel).

The lack of a measurable effect of mutation of the first half-site within p53RE suggests that the second and third half sites form the functional p53 response element under these conditions. The finding that the <italic>m</italic>(3) and <italic>m</italic>(123) mutants result in significantly lower luciferase activity in the presence of p53 than in its absence is interesting and may result from a general repressive effect of p53 on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) or from the p53-dependent induction of a repressor. The more robust p53-dependence exhibited by the minimal promoter constructs suggests that the observed p53-responsiveness of the intact promoter may reflect the balance of positive and negative contributions.</p><p>To determine whether p53 bound to the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed ChIP experiments.

The transient presence of p53 in the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter region corresponds to the transient increase in <italic>PPM1D</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). We also tested for p53 association with the &#x02013;0.7-kb site, but recovered only background levels of chromatin fragments (data not shown). The amounts of p21 upstream promoter fragments that were recovered from material immunoprecipitated by the anti-p53 antibody followed the expected pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Furthermore, we examined changes in histone acetylation patterns in the <italic>PPM1D</italic> and p21 promoter regions following exposure to IR. Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter fragments exhibited distinct changes following exposure to IR, but the pattern was very similar in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells. In both cell lines, histone H3 acetylation was detectable in untreated samples, increased by 2 h after exposure to IR and fell to background levels by 4 h after exposure to IR. Histone H4 acetylation was not detected in the untreated or 2-h samples but was apparent 4 h following exposure to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, although histone H3 acetylation increased in p21 upstream promoter fragments following exposure to IR in both HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells, the strong increase in histone H4 acetylation 2 h after exposure to IR was observed only in cells containing wild-type p53, as reported previously for the p21 and <italic>BBC3</italic> (PUMA) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).

These results suggest that PPM1D exhibits higher turnover following exposure to UV and, consequently, that the increased protein levels observed in p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells result from a combination of increased <italic>PPM1D</italic> mRNA levels and an increased utilization of the mRNA for protein synthesis.</p><p>We used the same PCR-based method to examine UV-induced changes in the utilization of transcription start sites in the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, the increased transcription of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene that occurred following exposure to UV in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells resulted from increased production of transcripts with short 5&#x02032; UTRs and decreased production of transcripts with long 5&#x02032; UTRs. In p53<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells, however, exposure to UV resulted only in the decreased production of transcripts with a long 5&#x02032; UTR with no change in the number of transcripts with a short 5&#x02032; UTR, leading to a decrease in the total level of <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcripts. Thus the increase in PPM1D protein levels observed in p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells correlated with the increase in production of transcripts with short 5&#x02032;UTRs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Implications of p53REs located near transcription initiation sites</title><p>In response to DNA damage and other stress signaling, wild-type p53 positively or negatively affects the transcription of a large number of genes, possibly hundreds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Typically, transcriptional activation of a particular gene by p53 involves the stabilization and activation of p53 by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), the binding of p53 to a response element located usually either within 1 kb upstream of the promoter or within the first few introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators that acetylate the tails of nearby histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) that result in increased transcription. Several distinct mechanisms have been found to operate in the p53-dependent repression of specific genes, including recruitment of histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and displacement of essential activating transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The phosphatase PPM1D has been shown to be induced after exposure to ionizing radiation with the rapid kinetics characteristic of primary targets of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but the mechanism was not known. In the present work, we identified a functional p53RE in the proximal promoter region of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene that lies within the 5&#x02032; UTR. Further experiments showed that after exposure to IR or UV, transcription initiation increased at sites closer to the initiation codon in cells with wild-type p53. Following exposure to UV, the increased abundance of transcripts with shorter 5&#x02032; UTRs correlated with an increased rate of PPM1D synthesis. The length of the 5&#x02032; UTR may affect the rate of nuclear export of the mRNA or the rate of initiation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Thus, the location of the p53 RE within the 5&#x02032; UTR and the resulting shift in transcription initiation site usage provides a mechanism for post-transcriptional as well as transcriptional regulation of <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression by p53.</p><p>Although the p53-binding site identified by the p53 MH algorithm contained a spacer of 4 bp, our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) indicated that the functional site consists of the downstream decameric half-site plus the adjacent 10-bp sequence. This site matches the consensus sequence at 10/10 and 7/10 positions, with no spacer between the two decamers. Recent work suggests that most functional p53-binding sites have no spacer between the decameric half-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). A survey of functional p53 REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), revealed that many sites deviate substantially from the consensus sequence. Moreover, of the two p53 REs in the p21 promoter region, the distal site has a better match to the consensus sequence and higher binding of p53, but it is the occupancy of the proximal site that correlates with increased histone acetylation and increased transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>The location of a p53-binding site within the 5&#x02032; UTR is unusual but not unprecedented. Two other well-characterized p53-responsive genes contain p53REs within their 5&#x02032; UTRs. The gene for LRDD, also known as PIDD, is a pro-apoptotic gene induced by p53 following DNA damage, and it contains a conserved p53RE located 26 nt before the translational initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). In contrast, <italic>DNMT1</italic>, which encodes a CpG-specific methyltransferase, is repressed by wild-type p53 in the absence of DNA damage, but after treatment with DNA damage-inducing agents, the amount of bound p53 decreases and transcription of <italic>DNMT1</italic> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). The identified p53RE is located 129 nt upstream of the translational initiation codon ATG but after the point of transcription initiation, a location that can be rationalized with repression of <italic>DNMT1</italic> transcription by bound p53. For <italic>PPM1D</italic>, the p53-dependent shift in the site of transcription initiation after IR means that the p53RE is close to but still upstream from the TSS, consistent with the activation of <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcription by p53. Furthermore, although the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases is generally considered to be the main mechanism through which p53 activates transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), p53 has been shown to interact with other components of the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65 B66 B67">65&#x02013;67</xref>). The direct interaction of p53 with transcription complexes may be more important in the transcriptional activation of genes that have a functional p53 response element located near the transcriptional start site.</p><p>Although the function of p53 as a modulator of transcription is, perhaps, the best understood of its many activities, the regulation of transcription and of translation are interrelated. The expression of p53, itself, is regulated at many levels, including translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>) and an alteration in the transcriptional start sites of p53 was found to occur in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). The p53-dependent production of alternate transcripts of the p21 gene has been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Interestingly, a p53-dependent change in promoter usage was shown to produce a 5&#x02032; UTR with a different sequence for the human MDM2 mRNA and, by consequence, change the AUG used for the initiation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). In the case of <italic>PPM1D</italic>, the location of a p53-binding site so close to the translational start codon suggests that the level of PPM1D protein also may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. The increased utilization of <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcripts in the production of PPM1D protein may be critically important in determining the cellular response to transcription-impairing DNA damage. McKay <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) have shown that, following exposure to UV, the mRNA levels of smaller, generally pro-apoptotic p53 target genes increased whereas the mRNA levels of larger p53 target genes, including MDM2 and PPM1D, did not change or decreased. Thus, since PPM1D phosphatase activity has been shown to reduce p38 MAPK and p53 activities in response to UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), the p53-dependent increase in <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcripts with short 5&#x02032; UTRs may allow PPM1D to function as a tissue-specific survival factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of <italic>PPM1D</italic> transcription by p53 and CREB/ATF family transcription factors</title><p>Transcription of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene is regulated by both p53 and CREB. We have provided evidence that CREB contributes to basal transcription of <italic>PPM1D</italic> and, in response to IR, that p53 is required for induced <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression. Although CREB and p53 each affect the transcription of hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>), the transcriptional programs regulated by the two factors are largely distinct. CREB is implicated in the response to growth and differentiation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>), whereas the genes regulated by p53 function in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). The deregulation of key genes that are controlled by both pathways may contribute to tumor progression. CREB and p53 have opposed effects on the transcription of the genes for Cyclin A and BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76 B77 B78">76&#x02013;78</xref>). That CREB and p53 act in the same direction in their regulation of <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression may be rationalized by the negative regulation of p53 by PPM1D through dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Functional linkage between the p53 and CREB/ATF pathways also was suggested by the induction of p53 in cells transfected with CRE-decoy oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>) and by the characterization of protein&#x02013;protein interactions between p53 and CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The complex promoter of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene contains identifiable binding sites for many transcription factors that may control its transcription in particular cellular or functional contexts. The regulation of <italic>PPM1D</italic> expression by E2F1 recently was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The presence of a conserved CRE in the promoter of <italic>PPM1D</italic> together with data presented here suggest that basal transcription of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> gene is regulated, in part, by CREB or related family members. Although CREB activates transcription through CBP-mediated histone acetylation, the localization of functional CREs within 50 to 150 bp of the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) suggests that the direct interaction between bound CREB and transcription complexes is an important aspect of the regulation of transcription by CREB. CBP also interacts with transcription complexes and may function as a bridge between CREB and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CREB at Ser111 and Ser121 following exposure to IR inhibits the interaction between CREB and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>), thus reducing its capacity as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, ATM-dependent signaling to wild-type p53 in response to IR results in its stabilization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). Binding of p53 to p53RE within the <italic>PPM1D</italic> promoter increases transcription and shifts the position of transcription initiation. Ultimately, the increased levels of PPM1D reduce stress-induced phosphorylation of target proteins, allowing for the recovery of normal function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn888/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute; a Laboratory Directed Research and Development Award at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Low Dose Program of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy (to C.W.A.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
