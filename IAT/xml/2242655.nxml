These proteins exhibit properties that could potentiate tumorigenesis or decrease invasiveness. These seemingly opposing roles of HGFIN suggest that this protein might be central to malignancies and might also behave as a tumor suppressor. Consistent with the reported roles for HGFIN is the fact that this gene is regulated by p53 through multiple binding sites in the 5' flanking region, and is expressed in osteoblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study used siRNA to knock-out <italic>HGFIN </italic>in non-tumorigenic breast cells and ectopically expressed HGFIN in breast cancer cells.

HGFIN shares sequence similarities with the G-protein, 7-transmembrane coupled neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This similarity results in HGFIN being able to interact with the high affinity ligand for NK1, substance P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The murine homolog of HGFIN, osteoactivin, has been reported to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase-3 and -9 in atrophied skeletal muscles from denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Osteoacvtivin is involved in osteoblast development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The fact that osteoactivin is expressed in differentiated osteoblasts is consistent with human HGFIN being linked to differentiated immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HGFIN has been reported to act as a negative regulator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent description of a protein with 99% homology to HGFIN, DC-HIL show that this gene is promotes adhesion in an RGD-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Osteoactivin and HGFIN are widely expressed in normal and malignant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Osteoactivin is expressed in breast cancer cells and has been associated with bone invasion, an aggressive form of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression is partly regulated by p53 through multiple sites within the 5' flanking region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to its expression in cancer cells, in non-transformed cells <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression appears to be critical in cell cycle quiescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The link between p53 and the regulation of <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression leaves the question of the role of <italic>HGFIN </italic>in tumor development open. Presence of <italic>HGFIN </italic>confers low metastatic potential in melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>This study further investigates the regulation of <italic>HGFIN</italic>, and also determines its involvement in breast cancer. Here, we report on a repressive effect of the non-coding exon 1. We also report on the cause&#x02013;effect relationship between defect in <italic>HGFIN </italic>and transformation of non-tumorigenic breast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>RPMI-1640, DMEM, &#x003b1;-MEM, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, neurokinin-A, and anti-Flag were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).

The highly aggressive cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from Dr Ian Whitehead, New Jersey Medical School (Newark, NJ, USA), and was originally described by ATCC. CCL64 has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Vectors and reporter gene assay</title><p>pGL3-basic and the luciferase detection kit were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). The &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) detection kit and pHyg were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). pFLAG-CMV2-HGFIN and pPMSKH1 (siRNA) were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. pCR2.1 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The p53 expression vectors and mutants were kindly provided by Dr Yuzuru Shiio (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, USA): pME18S-SN3 wild-type human p53, pME18S-SCX3 contained 143 Val&#x02192;Ala mutant human p53, and pPME18S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee has suggested the official symbol of HGFIN as GPNMB: human transmembrane glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B. A two-step cloning procedure has been used to add exon 1, with the translational start site omitted, downstream of HGFIN-RM/2.0. The clone has been designated HGFIN-RM/2.0E. The first step used PCR with pooled human gDNA as template and Hot Start Ex <italic>Taq </italic>Polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following primers: 5'-ggtgcagggaaggaaaaaagac-3' (sense) and 5'-tagagacattccatgctgaa-3' (antisense). The fragment was inserted into pCR2.1 and was designated HGFIN-RM/2.1. In the next step, we cloned HGFIN-RM/2.0E with primers that include exon 1 with omission of the translation start site: 5'-ctcgaggtgcagggaaggaaa-3' (sense with <italic>Xho</italic>I linker) and 5'-aagctttccatgctgaattcc-3' (antisense with <italic>Hin</italic>dIII linker). The fragment was first ligated into pCR 2.1 for sequencing at the Molecular Core Facility, New Jersey Medical School (Newark, NJ, USA). After the DNA sequencing verification, the insert was subcloned into pGL3-basic reporter vector within <italic>Xho</italic>I/<italic>Hin</italic>dIII sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfection and reporter gene assay</title><p>Reporter gene assays were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, non-tumorigenic cells at 60&#x02013;80% confluence were co-transfected with pGL3-HGFIN-2.0 or -HGFIN-2.0E and p&#x003b2;-gal-control (0.2 &#x003bc;g each). Transfections with Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) results in 60&#x02013;80% efficiency as determined by labeling for &#x003b2;-gal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Controls were transfected with pGL3-basic p&#x003b2;-gal. After 48h, cell extracts were quantitated for luciferase and &#x003b2;-gal using kits from Promega and Clontech, respectively. The ratios of luciferase/&#x003b2;-gal in cells transfected with vector alone were normalized to 1. Luciferase activities were presented per &#x003bc;g of total protein and the levels normalized with cells transfected with vector alone. Total protein in cell extracts was quantitated using a protein assay kit from BioRad (Hercules, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Stable HGFIN knock-out and expression</title><p>The method to construct HGFIN-specific siRNA into pPMSKH1 has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HGFIN siRNA was based on NCBI accession number AF322909 spanning +343/+361: 5'-catttgcggtgaacctgat-3'. Blast analyses using NCBI database determined no significant homology to any human gene. The 19 nucleotide sequence (sense) was placed in tandem with the loop structure followed by the antisense sequence of the upstream 19 nucleotide sequence compliment, resulting in 64 nucleotides. Control siRNA contained single nucleotide mutations within the gene-specific insert. Double-stranded DNA was ligated into pPMSKH1 at a molar ratio of 1:50 (vector to insert). Digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII confirmed inserts of ~280 bp. Negative clones without inserts showed bands at ~220 bp. The insert was further verified by DNA sequencing at the Molecular Resource Facility, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. Stimulated (GM-CSF) bone marrow fibroblasts have been shown to induce HGFIN and were therefore used to verify the efficiency of siRNA in HGFIN knock-out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>HGFIN knock-out was performed for MCF12A by co-transfecting with pPMSKH1-HGFIN (wild-type or mutant) and pHyg. Stable transfectants were selected with hygromycin at 5 &#x003bc;g/mL. HGFIN expression was studied by co-transfecting T47D with pFLAG-HGFIN and pHyg. Stable transfectants were selected with 150 &#x003bc;g/mL hygromycin. Selected cells were positive for Flag by western blots with combination of whole cell and membrane extracts (data not shown). The combinations of extracts were necessary as HGFIN is a membrane molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blots</title><p>Cell membrane extracts were obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Briefly, cells were incubated with 400 &#x003bc;L of 1&#x000d7; lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 <italic>g </italic>for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the membrane fractions were resuspended in 300 &#x003bc;L of PBS and then vortexed. Whole cells extracts were prepared by repeated cycles of freeze&#x02013;thaw. The membrane and whole cell extracts were combined and then analyzed for total protein using the BioRad protein assay.</p><p>Extracts (10 &#x003bc;g total protein) were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA), and then developed with anti-Flag by overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C. After this, membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/2,000) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. HRP was developed with chemiluminescence western blot detection reagents (Perkin Elmer). The molecular weights were determined by comparing to Kaleidoscope prestained standards (BioRad).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell migration assay</title><p>Cell migration was studied in a transwell system with 8.0 &#x003bc;m inserts using 24-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA). Cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) were re-suspended in sera-free media and then added into the inner chamber to a volume of 500 &#x003bc;L. Plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 1.5 h. After this, cells within the inserts were removed with cotton swabs. The filter along with the cells that migrated were fixed and stained with methylene blue. The total numbers of migrated cells were counted with an inverted light microscope (Olympus, Long Island, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of primary breast cancer cells</title><p>Breast tissues were obtained at the initial diagnosis of patients with Stages IIIA or IIIB.

By RT-PCR, we screened two different non-tumorigenic cells (NT), MCF12A and MCF10, which resulted in single bands at the predicted sizes for HGFIN at 112 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, top row). In contrast a light band was observed for DU4475 (T) breast cancer cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, top row).

The report was based on studies with a 2.0 kb fragment upstream of exon 1, pGL3-HGFIN-RM/2.0. Exon 1 is an untranslated region of HGFIN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). We examined the role of exon 1 in non-tumorigenic cells to determine if this region has regulatory functions. To this end, we used a reporter gene system with exon 1 (minus the translational start site), pGL3-HGFIN-RM/2.0E, to study expressions in MCF12A and three breast cancer cell lines. The studies were compared with pGL3-HGFIN-RM/2.0 in which exon 1 was omitted.

As we previously reported that HGFIN-RM/2.0 was under the control of p53, an increase by wild-type p53 was not a surprise (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>, left bars). Despite ectopic wild-type p53, exon 1 still retained its inhibitory properties, although it was less effective (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>, right bars).

We screened primary breast tissues and found <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression in non-tumorigenic cells, but low to undetectable expression in malignant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The fact that <italic>HGFIN </italic>is regulated by multiple p53 binding sites, combined with other studies linking the human gene to low metastatic potential in melanoma cells suggest that <italic>HGFIN </italic>might function as a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar to most genes with tumor suppressor activity, <italic>HGFIN </italic>and <italic>osteoactivin </italic>have also been linked to properties consistent with malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our laboratory has just begun to focus on <italic>HGFIN </italic>as a tumor-associated gene, indicating an early investigational stage in studies linked to this gene. To fully understand a role for HGFIN in breast tissues, research studies beyond those presented are required. These include quantitative studies to determine if HGFIN levels are linked to the status of the cancer cells. This could be accomplished in follow-up studies with patients' samples in longitudinal studies, or with isogenic breast cancer cells. It is interesting that <italic>HGFIN </italic>is located on chromosome 7, which is surrounded by microsatellite regions. Thus, it would be of interest to examine malignant cells for loss of the <italic>HGFIN </italic>gene or loss of heterozygosis.</p><p>Exon 1 appears to be critical in the control of <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression mainly due to being partly inhibitory in the enhancing function of its activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a,b</xref>). It is interesting that the most aggressive cell line, MDA-MB-231 cannot activate <italic>HGFIN </italic>reporter gene activity unless p53 was expressed, suggesting that p53 might be the limiting dysfunction in some cancers with respect to HGFIN expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b,c</xref>). In addition to the multiple p53 sites reported for HGFIN-RM/2.0, a consensus sequence has been found in exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Ectopic expression of p53 led to the activation of HGFIN-RM/2.0E (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). However, it is unclear if this increase involves exon 1, as a significant increase was observed for HGFIN-RM/2.0, which has exon 1 omitted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Exon 1 could be important in unraveling the role of HGFIN in malignancies, not only in breast but also in other cancers. The molecular analysis of HGFIN is the subject of intense research investigation in our laboratory.</p><p>We have observed an inverse relationship between <italic>HGFIN </italic>reporter gene activity and the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The reporter gene activities are consistent with decreased HGFIN mRNA in cancer cells, as compared to non-tumorigenic cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although we have shown knock-out of <italic>HGFIN </italic>causes an increase in cell growth, contact independent growth and migration (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), its role needs to be examined with robust genetic approaches. Indeed, computer analyses have shown evidence of HGFIN within a region of microsatellites, which is linked to instability (data not shown). This observation is currently under investigation, with pairs of autologous samples to show whether loss of <italic>HGFIN </italic>might be an early event in breast cancer transformation.</p><p>In summary, the <italic>HGFIN </italic>(or <italic>nmb</italic>) gene and its murine homolog, <italic>osteoactivin </italic>are unexplored in cancer biology and in particular in the capacity of oncogenes. This study has begun the further examination of this gene at the genetic level. Networks comprising HGFIN with cell cycle regulators, established oncogenes and tumor suppressors need to be elucidated. The location of this gene and its control via multiple p53 sites is intriguing, and might have a critical role in tumor biology.

Finally, the hormone status of patients appears to be irrelevant to the functions of HGFIN, suggesting a global function of HGFIN (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>HGFIN </italic>exhibits properties that are consistent with tumor suppressor gene functions. In its absence, non-tumorigenic cells show evidence of transformation and loss of contact dependency as well as increased migration.

The relationship between mutated <italic>p53 </italic>and <italic>HGFIN </italic>expression in malignancy of breast cancer and bone invasion will begin to unravel a new pathway used by p53 in breast cancer biology. Also, as this study was performed by overexpression of one variant of HGFIN, it is unclear how the extra 12 amino acid insert between exons 1 and 2 in the extracellular domain of the other human variant will affect the biology reported in this study [29].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'
