In the nucleus Tat greatly stimulates the synthesis of full-length transcripts from the HIV-1 promoter by causing efficient transcriptional elongation. Tat induces elongation by directly interacting with the bulge of the transactivation response (TAR) RNA, a hairpin-loop located at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts, and by recruiting cellular transcriptional co-activators. In the cytoplasm, Tat is thought to act as a translational activator of HIV-1 mRNAs. Thus, Tat plays a central role in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression both at the level of mRNA and protein synthesis. The requirement of Tat in these processes poses an essential question on how sufficient amounts of Tat can be made early on in HIV-1 infected cells to sustain its own synthesis.

In addition, HIV-1 encodes for six regulatory proteins, among which the Tat and the Rev factors are absolutely required for viral gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. HIV-1 Tat is a small basic protein that mainly localizes to the nucleus of infected cells, where it acts as a potent transcriptional activator that is indispensable for the synthesis of the full length viral RNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Transcriptional activation by Tat is mediated by multiple interactions between Tat and the nascent viral TAR RNA and between Tat and cellular factors involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in transcription initiation and elongation such as P-TEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, Tat has been shown to stimulate translation of viral mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Importantly, this cytoplasmic function of Tat seems to require a nuclear experience, since the RNA-protein complex formed between Tat protein and nuclear factors must be assembled in the nucleus in order to later exert its function in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the HIV-1 Tat protein plays a central role in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression both at the level of transcription and protein synthesis. The requirement of Tat in these processes poses an essential question on how sufficient amounts of this viral protein can be made early on in HIV-1 infected cells to sustain its own synthesis. Soon after completion of viral DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase and before its integration into the host genome, the viral DNA can be transcribed, but this generates only low levels of fully spliced viral mRNAs encoding Tat and Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These observations led us to hypothesize that Tat mRNA is translated even under conditions where it is present in minute quantities together with a high concentration of cellular mRNAs.</p><p>Translation of mRNA into protein represents an essential step in gene expression. The regulation of translation is a mechanism used to modulate gene expression in a wide range of biological situations including cell growth, development and the response to biological cues or environmental stresses such as viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. During viral infection at least two general modes of translational control can be envisaged. The first represents a global control, in which the translation of most cellular mRNAs is regulated. This is evident during the infection of some members of the <italic>Picornaviridae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] where global regulation mainly occurs by the modification of translation initiation factors. The second corresponds to a mRNA-specific control, whereby the translation of a particular mRNA or a defined group of mRNAs is modulated without affecting general protein biosynthesis or the translational status of the cellular transcriptome as a whole. Translational control of a specific mRNA is normally driven by regulatory protein complexes that recognize particular elements that are usually present in the 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the target mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is well recognized that translation control of protein synthesis is mostly exerted at the initiation step.</p><p>Translation initiation of eukaryotic mRNAs mostly occurs by a scanning mechanism, whereby the 40S ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA 5' cap structure and scans the RNA in the 5' to 3' direction until an initiation codon in a favourable 'Kozak' context is encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Translation initiation involves the recognition of the mRNA 5' cap structure by eIF4F, which is composed of eIF4E, which binds the 5' cap, eIF4A, and eIF4G, which links the mRNA 5' cap (via eIF4E)] and the 40S ribosomal subunit (via eIF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Studies on picornavirus protein synthesis led to the discovery of an alternative mechanism of translation initiation, via an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A major difference between cap-dependent <italic>versus </italic>IRES-mediated ribosome binding and initiation of translation is that the eIF4E component of the eIF4F complex is dispensable for most of the latter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At present IRESes are defined solely by functional criteria and cannot yet be predicted by the presence of characteristic RNA sequences or structural motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Despite these apparent experimental restraints, since the initial characterization of IRESes in <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, viruses from other families including several members of the <italic>Retroviridae </italic>were found to initiate translation via an IRES ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). Indeed, internal ribosome entry has been described in alpha- (ASLV), gammaretroviruses (MoMuLV) and lentiviruses (SIV and HIV).</p><p>Based on these findings we wanted to study the mechanism by which the Tat mRNA is translated using recombinant monocistronic and bicistronic RNAs containing all or part of the 5' UTR of the Tat mRNA. In addition, we examined the mechanism by which translation of the Tat mRNA is controlled <italic>in vitro </italic>in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) and in human cells. Our results show that the Tat mRNA is efficiently translated <italic>in vitro </italic>and in cells, despite the presence of large amounts of cellular mRNAs. Moreover, we show that the Tat protein exerts a positive feedback on the translation of its cognate mRNA. Thus, Tat mRNA appears to be efficiently translated even under conditions where it is in minute amounts among highly abundant cellular mRNAs. Taken together our data explains how minute amounts of Tat mRNA can account for viral protein production required to kick-start HIV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning of the Tat mRNA sequences</title><p>To study the mechanism of protein synthesis from the Tat mRNA, we cloned the Tat1 and Tat2 sequences, the two major forms of Tat mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], by means of a PCR-DNA reconstruction protocol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Sequence analysis confirmed that by this strategy (see methods and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel B; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), we were able to fully reconstitute the Tat1 and Tat2 mRNA sequences. Also, we constructed recombinant clones where the Tat1 and Tat2 RNA sequences were inserted next to the Renilla luciferase gene in either a monocistronic or bicistronic vector (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To study translation of the Tat RNA, we compared its level of translation with that of a canonical efficiently translated mRNA, namely the globin mRNA, in nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) or untreated RRL (URRL) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, we investigated Tat mRNA translation in HeLa cells, and the impact of the Tat protein on translation of its cognate RNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Reconstitution of the complete Tat RNA sequences</bold>. A. Organization of the splicing donor and acceptor sites in the HIV-1 pNL4.3 genome. B. Reconstitution of the complete Tat1 and Tat2 DNA sequences by PCR. "Hybridization PCR" can associate two different exons. Each Tat1 and Tat2 exon located in the pNL4.3 plasmid sequence (top panel) was independently amplified with specific oligonucleotides (Table 1). In fact, the antisense oligonucleotides used for exon amplification were designed in such a way that their 5' extremity is complementary to the 5' extremity of the next exon sense strand (see the colour codes). With this first PCR, the exon1 sense strand partially hybridizes with the exon2 antisense strand and the exon1 antisense strand with the exon2 sense strand. Then "Amplification PCR" resulted in the accumulation of DNA corresponding to exon1 + exon2. All further steps needed to completely reconstitute the Tat1 and Tat2 sequences were performed using this procedure (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The only difference between Tat1 and Tat2 sequences corresponds to exon EX' (see bottom lane).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-74-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Tat RNA <italic>versus </italic>globin RNA translation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Soon after its completion the viral DNA can be transcribed by the host cell machinery, but this generates only low levels of fully spliced viral RNAs in the absence of Tat and Rev proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To evaluate the efficiency of Tat mRNA translation, we examined the relative translation levels in the RRL of Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc), in the presence of an excess of Glob-Fluc RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), a 5' capped RNA that harbors the 5' UTR of globin mRNA and drives expression of Firefly luciferase (Fluc). Results revealed that the two Tat mRNAs were efficiently translated even in the presence of a high concentration of Glob-Fluc RNA (data not shown). These observations showed that even under unfavorable conditions the Tat mRNA can be efficiently translated. These results prompted us to further characterize the ability of Tat mRNAs to be translated, despite being at a low concentration within a mixture of mRNAs.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Translation of Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs in the untreated RRL system</bold>. The top three lanes depict the Glob-Fluc, UTRTat1-Rluc and UTRTat2-Rluc RNAs used in the translation assays in the untreated RRL (URRL). The vertical bar in the 5'UTR of Tat2 represents exon EX' (See fig. 1). Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs were translated in the URRL in the presence of a large excess of endogenous globin mRNA and of <italic>in vitro </italic>generated Glob-Fluc RNA. Independent experiments showed that 50 ng of Glob-Fluc RNA were saturating the URRL. Therefore 50 ng of Glob-Fluc RNA (grey bars) were used per assay together with increasing amounts of UTRTat1-Rluc (white bars) or UTRTat2-Rluc RNA (black bars). Note that under these stringent competition conditions, namely an excess of endogenous globin mRNA as well as Glob-Fluc RNA, UTRTat1/2 RNA at 5 ng (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>M) were well translated (white and black bars, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-74-2"/></fig><p>The efficiency of Tat RNA translation was studied in the non-nuclease treated RRL (URRL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], because it contains a high concentration of endogenous globin mRNA (about 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7 </sup>M). We examined translation of Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs expressing Rluc in the URRL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) using conditions where the 5' cap Glob-Fluc was also present in excess (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; grey bars). Results show that under these stringently competitive conditions Tat1 RNA and Tat2 RNA at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>M were translated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, white and black bars, respectively) and levels of Tat RNA translation linearly increased with increasing RNA concentrations (see white and black bars).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that the two HIV-1 Tat RNAs were efficiently translated in the URRL under conditions where both the endogenous globin mRNA and the recombinant Glob Fluc RNA were in vast excess. These findings also show that even at low concentrations the Tat mRNA can efficiently recruit ribosomes for its own translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigating Tat RNA translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate</title><p>The full-length mRNA from gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses can initiate protein synthesis by a cap-independent mechanism ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). In most instances IRESes in retroviruses and retroelements are found within the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) of the full length mRNA. Furthermore, a report from Brasey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] suggests that the Tat mRNA would exhibit IRES activity. In order to explore this possibility, translation initiation of the Tat mRNA was studied in the RRL using both monocistronic and bicistronic RNAs. As experimental controls, we used canonical monocistronic and bicistronic RNAs, the translation of which is exclusively 5' cap-dependent (5' UTR of the globin RNA) or cap-independent (5' UTR of EMCV) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Translation of the Tat RNA in the RRL system</bold>. A. Structure of the recombinant Glob- and EMCV RNA templates. All recombinant RNAs encode LacZ as the sole gene for the monocistronic RNAs, and as the 3' one for the bicistronic RNAs. The 5' UTR sequences correspond to either the complete 5' leader of the globin mRNA or the EMCV leader (see materials and methods). B. Translation of the mono- and bicistronic RNAs in the RRL system. RNAs were 5' capped (+) or not (-). Note that the non-capped mono-Glob RNA was translated at 15% (lane 3) of the control level (lane 2) while the non-capped mono-EMCV RNA was translated at 125% (lane 6) of the control level (lane 5). LacZ was not translated with the Bi-Glob RNA (lane 4) while it was at 90% (lane 7) the control level with the Bi-EMCV RNA. C. Structure of the recombinant Tat RNAs. The monocistronic and bicistronic recombinant Tat RNAs are shown. D. Translation of the mono- and bicistronic Tat RNAs in the RRL system. Note that mono-Tat1 and mono-Tat2 were translated at the same level either capped (lanes 1 and 4) or non-capped (lanes 2 and 5). Translation of the Tat ORF occurred with the Bi-Tat RNAs, but levels were about 40% (lanes 3 and 6) of the control levels (lanes 1 and 5). E. Translation of the Tat RNAs in the presence of the cap analog 7m-Gppp. Translation conditions were as in B (upper panel), but contained 7m-Gppp (lower panel) during the whole reaction (see methods). Translation of the mono-Glob RNA was extensively inhibited (lane 2) but this was not seen with mono-EMCV RNA (lanes 4 and 5), as expected. Note that translation of the Tat RNAs was not inhibited by the cap analog (compare lanes 6-9 in upper and lower panels).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-74-3"/></fig><p>Results reported in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> show that translation in the RRL of the mono 5'Glob-RNA was 5' cap-dependent (see &#x003b2;-galactosidase levels in lanes 2 and 3), while that of the mono EMCV RNA was not (compare lanes 5 and 6). In agreement with this, &#x003b2;-galactosidase was synthesized in the context of the bicistronic Bi-EMCV RNA (lane 7) but clearly not synthesized when the Bi-Glob RNA was used as template (see B-Gal in lane 4). Results showed that for the The Tat RNAs the mono-Tat1 and mono-Tat2 RNAs (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) were translated in RRL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Strikingly, in the monocistronic context, Tat1 and Tat2 RNA translation occurred independently from the 5' cap structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, compare lanes 1&#x02013;2 and 4&#x02013;5, respectively). In agreement with this observation, the two cistrons of the Bi-Tat RNAs were clearly expressed in the RRL (see Renilla and Tat in lanes 3 and 6) albeit Tat was synthesized about 2.5 fold less as compared with the monocistronic RNA (compare lanes 2&#x02013;3 and 5&#x02013;6 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Thus, data show that Tat can be synthesized in a cap-independent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;2) and as the 3' cistron of a bicistronic mRNA (lane 3) while the globin 5' UTR was unable to direct &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis under the same experimental conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 4).</p><p>To further investigate Tat RNA translation in the RRL, the monocistronic RNAs encoding the Tat protein were translated in the presence of the 7methyl-GTP cap analog (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, bottom panel). The rational of this experiment relies on the competitive binding of initiation factor eIF4E to the m<sup>7</sup>Gppp cap analog, which has been added in excess to the <italic>in vitro </italic>reaction. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> (top panel, lane 2 and 3) recapitulates results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> (lanes 2 and 3) where translation of the mono-Glob RNA is cap dependent. As expected, the 7m-GTP cap analog reduced by 7 fold the translation of the capped mono-Glob RNA in the RRL (lanes 2 and 3 in top and bottom panels) and had only a marginal effect on the uncapped mono-Glob RNA. The 7m-GTP cap analog did not affect translation from the mono-EMCV RNA (compare lanes 4&#x02013;5, in top and bottom panels). In agreement with previous data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), translation of the mono-Tat RNAs was not altered by the addition of the 7m-GTP cap analog (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, top and bottom panel, lanes 6&#x02013;9).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that in the RRL the HIV-1 Tat mRNA can be translated by an IRES mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Tat mRNA translation in human HeLa P4 cells</title><p>To examine Tat mRNA translation in cells, we selected the human HeLa P4 cells because this cell line is known to support HIV-1 replication and is a convenient indicator system to monitor HIV-1 Tat-mediated transactivation of the viral LTR. In HeLa P4 cells the expression of the LacZ gene is under the control of the LTR. Therefore, Tat expression will trans-activate the viral LTR and turn on production of &#x003b2;-galactosidase (see methods). In this experimental setting, the expression of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter is used as an indicator of Tat protein production. In a first series of DNA transfection assays, it was found that &#x003b2;-galactosidase was efficiently expressed upon transfection of the full length Tat1 and Tat2 DNAs (data not shown).</p><p>Next, we constructed bicistronic vectors containing the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as the cap-dependent 5' cistron and the full length Tat1 or Tat2 sequences as the 3' one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, pdualTat1 and pdualTat2, respectively). In addition, we constructed a deletion mutant where the Tat 5' UTR was removed; thus this construct contained only the Tat coding sequence with the Tat initiation codon and 12 upstream nucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, pdualTatcod). In addition a stable stem-loop (SSL) structure was inserted between the two cistrons in order to prevent translating ribosomes from reading through the intercistronic region, thus driving protein synthesis of the second cistron by a termination-reinitiation mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Tat in HeLa P4 cells</bold>.

The pdualTatcod lacks the 5' UTR of the Tat RNA, except for the 12 nucleotides upstream from the Tat AUG codon (see materials). B.

Because Tat binds with high affinity to the 5' TAR element, we wondered whether such a specific interaction would have an impact on the translation of the Tat mRNAs.

In addition, we used constructs where the 5' UTR of Tat1 and Tat2 was deleted from the R-U5 sequences (pos. 1&#x02013;104) (p5'UTR2-Tat Renilla) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

In the next series of assays, we transfected low quantities of the Tat expressing DNA (from 2 to 20 ng) and monitored Rluc activities (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>). Upon normalization to the same RNA copy number as assessed by RT-qPCR (see methods), the results showed that Tat was able to activate by 5&#x02013;10 fold the translation of the viral Tat RNA and genomic RNA 5' UTRs (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A</xref>). This Tat-mediated activation of translation occurred for very low quantities of transfected Tat DNA (2 to 20 ng per 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells), and this was clearly less efficient with higher amounts of Tat DNA (40&#x02013;200 ng per 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>). It should also be noted that the 5' UTR of the HIV-1 genomic mRNA was about 3&#x02013;4 fold less efficient than the Tat 5' UTR in promoting Rluc expression in HeLa cells, with or without Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, compare top and bottom panels, first and last bars, respectively).</p><p>Interestingly, deletion of the TAR-polyA sequences (p5'UTR2-Tat Renilla) had two effects, leading to a higher level of Rluc translation and no influence of Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) as compared with the p5'UTR-Tat Rluc construct (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Studies in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes show that the HIV-1 RNA-Tat protein complex must be assembled in the nucleus in order to facilitate translation in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In agreement with these observations, the above findings show that Tat protein exerts a translational control on viral mRNA translation from the 5'UTR. Furthermore, data show that this phenomenon occurs even when low quantities of the Tat plasmid are used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Since Tat has potent RNA binding and chaperoning activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and stimulates translation from the viral mRNA, we sought to evaluate if the Tat-TAR interaction was responsible for the activation of viral RNA translation and to establish if translational control by Tat required other cellular factors. This possibility was investigated <italic>in vitro </italic>in the RRL and URRL using a recombinant version of the Tat (1&#x02013;86) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], under different experimental conditions.</p><p>Firstly, Tat was added to the RRL or URRL followed by either one of the viral RNA, namely UTR-Tat or UTRg-RNA expressing Rluc. Under these conditions, Tat was found to have no, or at best a modest, positive effect on viral RNA translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). Secondly, Tat was mixed with the RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and then the mix was added to the RRL/URRL translation mixture. Under these conditions translation of RNA containing either the complete 5' UTR of the Tat RNA or of the genomic RNA was decreased up to 3&#x02013;4 fold upon addition of Tat (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). At the same time, Tat only slightly decreased the translation of the Rluc RNA and that of a 5' UTR-Tat RNA where the TAR-polyA has been deleted (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Thirdly, Tat synthesized in the RRL and the Tat/RRL mixture was added to either one of the viral Rluc RNAs and to the control Rluc RNA. Under these conditions, increasing quantities of Tat/RRL were found to strongly inhibit Rluc translation from the viral 5'UTR and only slightly inhibit that of the control Rluc RNA (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together these results show that the recombinant Tat protein was not capable of exerting a positive effect on the translation of its cognate mRNA. Furthermore, data suggest that the Tat-TAR interaction inhibited protein synthesis. We therefore reasoned that Tat-mediated translational activation of the HIV-1 RNA might require post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and/or cellular cofactors that are absent from the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. To examine this possibility, URLL was supplemented with HeLa cell extracts. The rationale of using these extracts relies on reports showing that HeLa cell extracts support translation of the full length HIV-1 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and that supplementation of RRL with cytoplasmic HeLa extracts allowed efficient translation from the HIV-1 genomic 5' UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The addition of increasing amounts of HeLa cell extracts, up to 0.2 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, to the URRL prior to RNA translation did not modify the pattern of Rluc translation using the viral RNAs or the control RNA. Addition of recombinant Tat (see materials and methods) to the cell extract before translation had a slightly inhibitory effect on viral and control Rluc RNA translation (data not shown).</p><p>Finally, Tat was transiently expressed to a high level in HeLa cells as assessed by western blotting (see methods and data not shown), and these cells were used to prepare a Tat-HeLa cell extract (see methods). Addition of increasing amounts of the Tat-HeLa extract to the <italic>in vitro </italic>URRL, prior to translation, caused a two fold increase in the level of viral mRNA translation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), while it had little or no effect on the translation of the control Rluc RNA, or viral RNA deleted from the TAR and polyA structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). To further study this Tat-mediated activation of translation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a recombinant Rluc RNA where the 5' leader corresponded to the viral 5' TAR-polyA stem-loops. Translation of this recombinant RNA was increased, up to 3 fold, by the Tat-HeLa cell extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Influence of Tat-HeLa cell extracts on Tat RNA translation in the RRL</bold>.

On the contrary, there was no effect on the translation of Rluc RNA, or of 5' UTR-Rluc RNA lacking the TAR-pA sequences (panel B).

This last possibility stems from the fact that HeLa cell extracts were incapable of assisting Tat-associated translational activation when directly mixed with the viral protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In an attempt to understand how the viral transcriptional factor Tat is initially synthesized for the sustained expression of the viral DNA in newly HIV-1 infected cells, we investigated translation of the Tat mRNAs <italic>in vitro </italic>in rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems (RRL and URRL) and in HeLa cells. Our study focused on the two major forms of the Tat mRNA, namely Tat1 and Tat2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), because they represent about 80% of all Tat mRNAs in HIV-1 infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Results showed that the HIV-1 Tat mRNA is efficiently translated <italic>in vitro </italic>and in cells to the benefit of Tat synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The Tat mRNAs possess a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail together with a long 5' leader formed of stable stem-loop structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Our data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicate that like the full-length HIV-1 mRNA the Tat mRNA can be actively translated by an IRES mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], even when present in low concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, and in accordance with Tat protein function, our data show that low quantities of Tat (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) can transactivate the HIV-1 promoter. The ability of the Tat mRNA to be efficiently translated in combination with the low amount of protein required to transactivate the viral promoter would be essential during the virus replication cycle as Tat protein is absolutely required for the expression of the viral DNA in both its unintegrated and integrated forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Computer-assisted folding of the 5' UTR of Tat RNA</bold>.

This finding is not without precedent since the Env mRNA of the gammaretrovirus MoMuLV was shown to be translated by an IRES mechanism, in a manner similar to that of the full-length RNA coding for Gag and Gag-Pol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the case of the HIV-1 genomic IRES, Brasey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] showed that the IRES overlaps the primer binding site (PBS), the DIS, the splice donor (SD) and the major Psi packaging signal that are located upstream from the Gag initiation codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Evidence was also provided showing that sequences encompassing the PBS, the DIS and the SD had an IRES activity (Figure four in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). In agreement with these observations, we found that the TAR and polyA stem-loops were not necessary for the IRES activity of the Tat RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, the Tat1 IRES activity was found to be clearly more active than its genomic counterpart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>The above prompted us to look for a possible secondary structure of the 5' UTR of the Tat RNA using a bioinformatic approach (see methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A putative consensus secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] is proposed in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> where the most conserved secondary structures in the 5' UTR of Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs, which are not found in the 5' UTR of the genomic RNA [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and ref. therein], are (i) an interaction between the PBS sequence and the 5' part of Tat exon 2, (ii) a small non-structured segment rich in guanine and adenine residues 5' to the Tat AUG codon, and (iii) a small stem-loop next to the Tat AUG codon. In contrast, the TAR and polyA stem-loops remain as individual structures present in the 5' UTR of both the Tat and genomic RNAs, but are not required <italic>per se </italic>for the IRES activity ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The single-stranded segments present in the Tat 5' UTR could function as a landing pad for the binding of ribosomes near or at the Tat initiator codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This possibility is presently under investigation. Moreover, the Tat IRES appears to actively recruit the translation initiation complex to the benefit of Tat synthesis, a process absolutely required for the sustained expression of the viral DNA in the unintegrated or integrated forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cap-dependent translation is suppressed during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Interestingly, HIV-1 full length RNA synthesis is highly stimulated during the viral induced G2/M arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this IRES activity ensures Tat protein synthesis during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Synthesis of Tat during G2/M would be partially responsible for the high degree of transcriptional activity from the viral promoter observed during this phase of the cell cycle.</p><p>Next we studied the influence of Tat on the translation of its cognate mRNA. Results showed that Tat was able to trans-activate the translation of Tat RNA, by up to tenfold in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>), but not the translation of the Rluc RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top panel). In addition, the 5' terminal TAR-polyA sequences are required for the activation of Tat RNA translation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lower panel). The Tat-mediated activation of translation also most probably benefits the other viral RNAs, notably the genomic RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lower panel), which is in agreement with the finding of Leibowitz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. We did not succeed in fully reconstituting the translational activation of the viral RNAs by Tat in the RRL systems (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and data not shown). A likely explanation for these observations is that the recombinant Tat protein used here conserves the RNA binding activity but is incapable of recruiting cellular proteins required for the Tat-mediated activation of translation. Results obtained with HeLa and Tat-HeLa cell extracts are however in agreement with what has been described in other experimental systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and favour the notion that Tat needs to be post-translationally modifed or needs to contact cellular factors in order to be able to activate translation from the viral mRNA. An interesting possibility that also stems from our findings is that Tat expression in cells might transactivate cellular mRNAs coding for proteins required for Tat to function as a translational activator of its cognate mRNA. Tat is a basic protein with nucleic acid binding and chaperoning activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and thus appears to behave as a scaffolding protein for both viral transcription and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Yet, cellular factors recruited by Tat for the translational activation of the viral RNA remain to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and this recruitment is presently under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that the Tat mRNA can be efficiently translated under unfavourable conditions, suggesting that only minute concentrations of mRNA are required to assure the Tat protein concentration needed to stimulate viral mRNA synthesis and translation.

Tat2 RNA is identical except for an additional very small exon, EX', pos. 4910&#x02013;4962 (A1-D2; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>DNA oligonucleotides used in the present study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Oligo DNA</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Sequence and position on Tat mRNA</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">LeaderR sense EcoRI</td><td align="left">5' GAATTCGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGATC 3'<break/>(exon1 sense for Tat1 et Tat2: 1&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Leader rev1</td><td align="left">5' TATTCTGCTATGTCGACACCCAATTCAGTCGCCGCCCCTCG 3'<break/>(exon1 reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 290)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Leader rev2</td><td align="left">5' GGATCTCTGCTGTCCCTGCAGTCGCCGCCCCTCG 3'<break/>(exon1 reverse for Tat2:&#x02190; 290)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex2Tat sense</td><td align="left">5' AATTGGGTGTCGACATAGCAGAATAGGCG 3'<break/>(exon2 sense for Tat1:290&#x02192; and for Tat2:343&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex2Tat rev</td><td align="left">5'GGGATTGGGAGGTGGGTTGCTTTGATAGAGAAGCTTGATGAGTCTGACTG3' (exon2: reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 558 and for Tat2:&#x02190; 611)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex'Tat sense</td><td align="left">5'CAGGGACAGCAGAGATCCAGTTTGGAAAGGACCAGCAAAGCTCCTCTGGAAAG 3' (exon':sense for Tat2:290&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex'Tat rev</td><td align="left">5' CTGCTATGTCGACACCCAATTCTTTCCAGAGGAGCTTTGCTG 3'<break/>(exon':reverse for Tat2:&#x02190; 343)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex3Tat sense</td><td align="left">5' ACCCACCTCCCAATCCCGAG 3'<break/>(exon3: sense for Tat1:558&#x02192; and for Tat2: 611&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tatrev NotI</td><td align="left">5' TAATAATGCGGCCGCAGTACAGGCAAAAAGCAGCTGCTTATATGC 3'<break/>(exon3: reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 1718 and for Tat2:&#x02190; 1770)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PBSEcoRI sense</td><td align="left">5' TATATTAGAATTCGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACT 3'<break/>(exon1: sense for Tat1 and for Tat2:104 &#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SDEcoRI sense</td><td align="left">5' ATATAAGAATTCCGAGGGGCGGCGACTG 3'<break/>(exon1: sense for Tat1 and for Tat2:274&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AUGEcoRI sense</td><td align="left">5' TATAATAGAATTCATGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAGACTAGAG 3'<break/>(exon2: sense for Tat1:343 &#x02192; and for Tat2:396 &#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TatNcoI sense</td><td align="left">5' TAATATACCATGGGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGATC 3'<break/>(exon1: sense for Tat1 and for Tat2:1&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TatSmaI rev</td><td align="left">5' TATATACCCGGGAGTACAGGCAAAAAGCAGCTGCTTATATGC 3'<break/>(exon3: reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 1718 and for Tat2:&#x02190; 1770)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TatXbaI sense</td><td align="left">5' ATATATTCTAGAGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGATC 3'<break/>(exon 1:for Tat1 et Tat2:1&#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TatXbaI rev</td><td align="left">5' TAATAATTCTAGAAGTACAGGCAAAAAGCAGCTGCTTATATGC 3'<break/>(exon3 reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 1718 and for Tat2:&#x02190; 1770)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(111)NcoI rev</td><td align="left">5' TATATACCATGGGGCACACACTACTTTGAGCACTCAAGG 3'<break/>(exon1:reverse:&#x02190; 111)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">UTRTatNcoI rev</td><td align="left">5' TATATTACCATGGTTCTTGCTCTCCTCTGTCGAGTAACG 3'<break/>(exon2: reverse for Tat1:&#x02190; 342 and for Tat2:&#x02190; 395)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(1-336)NcoI rev</td><td align="left">5' ATATATACCATGGCTCTCTCCTTCTAGCCTCCGC 3'<break/>(reverse: 5' to AUG of the RNAg)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">UTR2TatNcoI sense</td><td align="left">5' TAATATACCATGGGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACT 3'<break/>(exon1: sense for Tat1 and for Tat2:104 &#x02192;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LTRPvuII sense</td><td align="left">5' TAATATACAGCTGTGGAAGGGCTAATTTGGTCCC 3' (sense for U3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LTRPvuII rev</td><td align="left">5' TATATTACAGCTGAGTACAGGCAAAAAGCAGCTGC 3' (reverse for U3)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The Tat DNA constructs also contain either the 5' LTR for <italic>ex vivo </italic>expression, or the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for <italic>in vitro </italic>RNA synthesis (see below).

Reconstitution of the complete Tat1 and Tat2 RNA sequences was carried out by manual splicing. Then, the sequences were aligned with the ClustalW software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and the alignments were manually edited. The obtained alignments were used to establish a consensus secondary structure for the Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs, using the RNAalifold software of the Vienna RNA package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Variability in the aligned RNA sequences, with special emphasis on co-variant sites, together with the consensus structure, was used to infer putatively conserved secondary structures in Tat1 and Tat2 RNAs. Apart from the TAR stem-loop, the most conserved structural features in the 5' UTR of Tat RNAs are: <italic>(i) </italic>an interaction between the PBS sequence and the 5' part of Tat1 exon 2 which is conserved in all sequences of the Los Alamos database; <italic>(ii) </italic>a small, non-structured segment rich in guanine and adenine 5' to the Tat AUG codon; and <italic>(iii) </italic>a small stem-loop next to the Tat AUG codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).
