Although a substantial body of evidence underpins this hypothesis, it is challenged by recent findings including strong expression of NG2 in regenerating peripheral nerve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We studied axonal regeneration in the PNS and CNS of genetically engineered mice that do not express NG2, and in sex and age matched wild-type controls. In the CNS, we used anterograde tracing with BDA to study corticospinal tract (CST) axons after spinal cord injury and transganglionic labelling with CT-HRP to trace ascending sensory dorsal column (DC) axons after DC lesions and a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve. Injury to these fibre tracts resulted in no difference between knockout and wild-type mice in the ability of CST axons or DC axons to enter or cross the lesion site. Similarly, after dorsal root injury (with conditioning lesion), most regenerating dorsal root axons failed to grow across the dorsal root entry zone in both transgenic and wild-type mice.</p><p>Following sciatic nerve injuries, functional recovery was assessed by analysis of the toe-spreading reflex and cutaneous sensitivity to Von Frey hairs. Anatomical correlates of regeneration were assessed by: retrograde labelling of regenerating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells with DiAsp; immunostaining with PGP 9.5 to visualise sensory reinnervation of plantar hindpaws; electron microscopic analysis of regenerating axons in tibial and digital nerves; and by silver-cholinesterase histochemical study of motor end plate reinnervation. We also examined functional and anatomical correlates of regeneration after injury of the facial nerve by assessing the time taken for whisker movements and corneal reflexes to recover and by retrograde labelling of regenerated axons with Fluorogold and DiAsp. None of the anatomical or functional analyses revealed significant differences between wild-type and knockout mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings show that NG2 is unlikely to be a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration after injury to the CNS, and, further, that NG2 is unlikely to be necessary for regeneration or functional recovery following peripheral nerve injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>NG2 is a large transmembrane proteoglycan of the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) family, with a large ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is expressed in many different tissues, especially during development, but in the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord, it is expressed predominantly by a subset of glial cells with astrocyte-like morphology and the antigenic characteristics of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These cells are present throughout white and grey matter at a density similar to that of oligodendrocytes and microglial cells, and in recent years it has been proposed that they constitute a novel class of glial cells (for which the term polydendrocytes has been proposed) with as yet poorly understood roles in adult nervous system function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence from studies in vitro that NG2, like most other CSPGs, inhibits neurite outgrowth in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and possesses several domains that cause growth cone collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has also been shown that antibodies against NG2 block its inhibitory effects on neurite growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and that among a variety of CSPGs expressed by a growth-inhibitory astrocyte cell line, NG2 is the one with by far the strongest inhibitory effects on neurite growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This evidence is complemented by evidence, from in vivo studies, that NG2 is present at sites at which regenerative growth of axons within or into the CNS is arrested, notably around CNS injury sites and at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), where NG2-expressing cells proliferate and accumulate after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; see reviews by Butt <italic>et al</italic>, 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and Nishiyama, 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Findings such as these have led to a widespread belief that NG2 is one of the major inhibitors of axonal regeneration within or into the mammalian CNS after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], a view that has been strongly reinforced by recent work reporting that neutralising monoclonal antibodies against NG2 applied at dorsal column lesion sites in adult rats, promote regeneration of sensory axons into the lesion site, and when combined with a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve, result in regenerative growth of axons rostral to the lesion site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>However, in addition to abundant evidence for the presence in the CNS of other molecules which are thought to inhibit regenerative axonal growth (including Nogo, myelin associated glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoproteins), there are numerous findings that cast doubt on the general validity of the view that NG2 is a major axon growth inhibitor and suggest the need for further investigation. For example, AN2, the mouse homologue of NG2, does not inhibit outgrowth of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell neurites growing on a laminin substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and mouse cerebellar granule cells adhere to and extend neurites on substrates containing AN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Also, whereas NG2 inhibits neurite outgrowth from rat cerebellar granule cells plated on a substrate of L1 (an axon-growth-promoting cell adhesion molecule), it has no effect on the outgrowth of neurites from DRG cells on the same substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] suggesting that the inhibitory effects of NG2 are exerted selectively on only some types of neuron. There is also evidence that regenerating CNS axons may grow through regions rich in NG2-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, in very recent work, it has been shown that NG2-expressing cells promote neurite outgrowth from hippocampal and neocortical neurons in vitro and that both in vitro and in vivo NG2-expressing cells are preferentially and extensively contacted by axonal growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], in keeping with earlier evidence that NG2-expressing cells may receive synaptic input from glutamatergic axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The presence of NG2 in the normal and regenerating PNS raises further questions about its roles. NG2 is expressed by fibroblast-like cells and microvascular pericytes in peripheral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], is present at nodes of Ranvier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and may also be expressed by a subset of non-myelinating Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the peripheral axons of DRG cells in the sciatic nerve regenerate through the prominent cap of NG2-positive cells that forms over the proximal stump following resection of the nerve, and continue to grow along the distal stump in close proximity to NG2-expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such observations suggest that NG2 has no generalised inhibitory effect on regenerating PNS axons or that it is involved in subtle focal inhibitory functions directed at preventing profuse branching of the axons and/or perhaps serving to confine regenerating axons to the bands of von B&#x000fc;ngner.</p><p>Our approach to elucidating the possible roles of NG2 in inhibiting axonal regeneration after injury was to compare regeneration and reinnervation in a variety of well-established CNS and PNS injury models, between normal and NG2 knockout mice. Thus we have studied axonal regeneration in the CNS after lesions of the corticospinal tract and dorsal column, and at the dorsal root-spinal cord interface following dorsal root injury. We have also examined regeneration and reinnervation in peripheral nervous system following facial and sciatic nerve injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of phenotype</title><p>For all of the studies reported below, identification of knockout and wild-type mice was based on immunohistochemical phenotyping of tail snips with anti-NG2 antibody, which provided unequivocal evidence for the absence or presence of NG2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Many of the labelled axons displayed terminal end-bulbs in this area. No labelled axons penetrated the lesion site, none was observed bypassing the lesion site laterally or ventrally, none was found in the dorsal part of CST caudal to the lesion site, and there was no evidence to suggest that axons in the injured CST had grown or sent branches into the intact contralateral CST in either group. Fine lateral branches were observed to emerge from labelled CST axons rostral to the lesion site (not illustrated) but these were as likely to have been normal collateral branches as regenerative sprouts and no difference in the distribution or frequency of such side branches was detected between knockout and wild-type mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Anterograde labelling with BDA of the CST after spinal cord injury</bold>.

The threshold stimulus for eliciting withdrawal was identical for both hindpaws preoperatively and for the control hindpaw postoperatively in both wild-type and knockout mice. After sciatic nerve crush, wild-type mice recovered the preoperative withdrawal reflex threshold after a mean of 10.2 days and knockout mice after a mean of 9.8 days (p = 0.63 n.s.; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). After simultaneous excision of 3 mm of the saphenous nerve, recovery times were not significantly different: the withdrawal reflex was restored by 10.3 days in wild-type mice and by 11.0 days in knockout mice (p = 1.0, n.s. (calculated using a two tailed Fisher exact test because all 6 NG2 knockout mice recovered on the same day); Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). These results confirm that recovery times after sciatic nerve injury alone could not be due to reinnervation as a result of sprouting from branches of the saphenous nerve, which, if it occurred, might give rise to false positive results. After sciatic nerve section and reanastamosis, which presents a greater barrier to regeneration than crush injury, recovery times were 16.7 days on average for wild-type and 15.3 days for knockout mice (p = 0.18 n.s.; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury</bold>.

The toe spreading reflex was restored, on average, at 8.5 days in wild-type and 9.2 days in knockout mice after sciatic nerve crush (p = 0.36 n.s.; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) and at 10.7 versus 10.3 days after simultaneous sciatic nerve crush and saphenous nerve resection (p = 0.50 n.s.; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>).

Di Asp was injected two days prior to sacrifice, because it takes this time to be taken up by the axons and retrogradely transported in sufficient quantity to fill the neuronal cell bodies. Because of variable uptake of DiAsp after injection into the hindpaw and variability in the intensity of neuronal cell body labelling, the threshold for identifying (and counting) labelled cells was set at a relatively high level. The numbers of labelled cells recorded may therefore represent gross underestimates of the actual number of DRG cells with regenerated axons.

Although NG2, a molecule widely regarded as a potent inhibitor of axonal regeneration, is strongly expressed at injury sites in the CNS, where regeneration is abortive, it is also strongly expressed in injured peripheral nerves, where axonal regeneration is vigorous (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; and see review by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). It might have been expected, therefore, that the absence of NG2 would enhance axonal regeneration in the CNS and/or reduce regeneration in peripheral nerves. Our findings were consistent and in some respects surprising: the absence of NG2 had no effect on axonal regeneration in vivo. Specifically, we could find no evidence that regenerative growth of dorsal root axons into the spinal cord after dorsal root injury, or of ascending (sensory) axons within the spinal cord following dorsal column injury, was enhanced in the NG2 knockout mice. Similarly, descending corticospinal tract axons failed to show enhanced regeneration in NG2 knockout mice following spinal cord injury. In addition, we have shown, by quantitative methods and for the first time, that sciatic nerve fibres, both motor and sensory, and facial (motor) nerve fibres, regenerated and re-established functional innervation of target tissues to the same extent and at the same speed in the NG2 knockout and wild-type groups.</p><p>Because there is evidence that neurons may vary in their sensitivity to NG2 (see below) it is important that we have examined regeneration in a number of models. Two different populations of projection axons within the spinal cord (dorsal column sensory axons and CST axons), dorsal root axons at the PNS/CNS interface, and motor and sensory axons of two peripheral nerves (sciatic and facial) were all tested for possible effects of the absence of NG2 on regeneration after axotomy. Furthermore, in the case of the injured peripheral nerve, different types of lesion were examined, and both functional and multiple types of anatomical analyses of regeneration were carried out. In all of the systems and experimental conditions tested we found only insignificant differences between NG2-deficient and normal animals. We therefore conclude that: i) NG2, on its own, does not exert a profound influence on the regenerative growth of peripheral nerve fibres; and ii) absence of NG2 from the microenvironment of the CNS does not enhance the regenerative growth of injured axons or facilitate the entry of regenerating dorsal root axons into the CNS even when the regenerative potential of the DRG cells is enhanced by a conditioning lesion. In other words, NG2 cannot be viewed as a major cause of failure of axonal regeneration within or into the CNS. The latter conclusion is entirely in keeping with the recent findings of de Castro <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], who carried out closely related studies on NG2 knockout mice. They transected the spinal cord at vertebral level T9/10 and found that the penetration of immunohistochemically visualised CGRP-containing (presumptive sensory axons) into the NG2-rich scar tissue at the transection site was no more extensive in the knockout mice than in the wild-type controls, and that penetration into the scar tissue of serotoninergic (5HT-immunopositive) axons was <italic>greater </italic>in the wild-type than in the knockout mice.</p><p>Our findings and conclusions are also in line with other evidence that NG2 is neither a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the CNS nor a promoter of longitudinal regeneration in peripheral nerves. This includes the recent work of Yang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] which provides some of the strongest and most direct in vitro evidence that NG2-expressing cells do not inhibit or repel growing/regenerating neurites, and indeed provides both in vitro and in vivo data suggesting the opposite, albeit based heavily on CNS neurons derived from neonatal rather than mature animals (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>NG2 as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the CNS</title><p>A number of previous in vivo studies have suggested that NG2 and other CSPGs play an important part in limiting axonal regeneration in the CNS. NG2 is the most strongly upregulated CSPG at CNS injury sites, with a time course very closely matched to the arrested growth of axonal sprouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and enzymatic degradation of CSPGs (in particular, removal of chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycans by chondroitinase ABC) promotes regenerative axonal growth in the adult CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, such enzymatic degradation is not specific to NG2 and will affect many other molecules with potential axon growth inhibiting properties and it is relevant that there are strongly inhibitory domains in the NG2 core protein which would be unaffected by treatment with chondroitinase ABC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. More recently, Tan et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have described more direct evidence that NG2 is involved in inhibiting CNS regeneration by well controlled studies of regenerative growth of transganglionically CTB-labelled dorsal column axons at thoracic cord transection lesion sites in young adult rats. They demonstrated a convincing enhancement of growth into (and beyond) the lesion site, when NG2 was neutralised with function-blocking monoclonal antibodies applied directly at the lesion site, especially when the DRG neurons were primed with a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve. We recognise that the work of Tan <italic>et al</italic>. provides a strong challenge to the conclusion de Castro et al. and we have reached on the basis of our studies of NG2 knockout mice. A possible explanation of the effects of the antibody reported in the study of Tan <italic>et al</italic>. is that they may have resulted from modulation of the behaviour of NG2-expressing cells or cell complexes, rather than by direct blocking of axon/NG2 interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>NG2 as a facilitator of regeneration in peripheral nerves</title><p>Whether or not NG2 has an insignificant role in preventing axonal regeneration in the CNS &#x02013; as our findings suggest &#x02013; or is a contributory factor in this process, NG2 is upregulated in vigorously regenerating peripheral. Hence it may be that NG2 has facilitatory roles with respect to axonal regeneration, especially in the PNS where it has been suggested that NG2 may promote enhanced mobility of non-neuronal cells after injury, thereby aiding the formation of cellular (Schwann cell) bridges to act as a supportive substrate for regenerating axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We have also previously suggested, based on its distribution within normal and injured peripheral nerve, that a plausible role for NG2 might be to facilitate regeneration by helping to confine regenerating axons within the endoneurial compartment and/or within the bands of Von B&#x000fc;ngner of the distal stump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, our finding that regeneration of sensory and motor axons in peripheral nerves is not reduced or delayed in NG2 knockout mice suggests that any such effects are of very minor significance for peripheral nerve regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential confounding factors</title><p>It is pertinent to consider why the absence from the transgenic mice of NG2, a molecule with powerful effects in vitro, had so little effect on axonal regeneration in vivo. First, it is possible that NG2 has a redundant role in this process since NG2 is only one of a number of potential growth inhibitory or repulsive molecules at injury sites in the nervous system. For example, NG2, tenascin-C and CSPGs other than NG2 are expressed in similar regions of lesion sites in spinal cord (e.g. the meningeal scar) and peripheral nerves (the perineurium and the surface of bands of Von B&#x000fc;ngner) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It would be interesting to analyse with immunohistochemistry whether these molecules are upregulated in the NG2 KO mice compared to wild-type mice in the tissues studied.</p><p>Second, elimination of the NG2 gene may have induced upregulation of other molecules with similar functions during development, thus further compensating for any effects of the absence of NG2 in the knockout animals. Conditional knockout and/or knockdown experiments (e.g. with siRNA) would be necessary to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Third, it is also possible that the neuronal populations investigated in this study were particularly insensitive to NG2. It is known that neuronal populations differ in their responsiveness to NG2 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and it is conceivable that (some of) the neuronal populations we examined do not normally express receptors for NG2 and are thus intrinsically less responsive to NG2 than other populations. However, among neuronal types that have been reported to show inhibition of neurite growth in the presence of NG2 are DRG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and neocortical neurons (albeit not specifically CST neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). This and the fact that we tested several types of neurons make it extremely unlikely that our findings are not generally applicable. It is also possible that age is a relevant factor when considering the negative findings in our study. Thus we used adult animals and studied regeneration in vivo whereas much of the data suggesting inhibitory effects of NG2 on axonal growth derive from in vitro studies using embryonic or neonatal neurons: for example, embryonic or neonatal rat (or chick) DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; rat E17 cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; E24-25 chick retinal ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; and early postnatal rat cerebellar granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Inhibition by NG2 of regenerative axonal growth from adult neurons has not been directly demonstrated, and it would not be surprising if developing neurons differed significantly from their adult counterparts with respect to their responsiveness to NG2. However, in view of the body of (largely indirect) evidence favouring a role for NG2 in inhibiting axonal regeneration in the adult CNS (see Introduction and further discussion below), our failure to find evidence for such a role of NG2 is unlikely to be explicable solely in terms of the age/maturity of our experimental animals.</p><p>Experiments on mice lacking the putative myelin-derived inhibitory molecule Nogo-A have also failed to show consistent enhancement of axonal regeneration after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], even though treatment with Nogo-A-blocking antibodies increase sprouting and regeneration of injured corticospinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Similarly, genetically inactivating the Nogo receptor (NgR) failed to produce significant regeneration of one class of axon (the corticospinal tracts) that express the receptor strongly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], whereas subcutaneous administration of the NgR antagonist NEP1-40 enhanced regeneration of corticospinal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The reason for the discrepancy between genetic and pharmacological inactivation of both Nogo and NgR is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Part of the lack of effect of knocking out NG2 may have been due to the genetic background of the mice we studied- C57BL/6. Genetic background can have considerable effects on axonal regeneration in strains of transgenic mice. Recently Dimou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] showed that corticospinal axons regenerated less well in Nogo-A knockout mice with a C57BL/6 background (as used in the present study) than in knockout mice with a 129X1/SvJ background, a finding that may be produced by a weaker intrinsic regenerative response by neurons from the C57BL/6 strain. None the less, C57BL/6 mice can regenerate axons vigorously following peripheral nerve injury and intrinsic CNS neurons from such animals can regenerate axons into peripheral nerve implants in the brain (unpublished observations). If NG2 was the major factor preventing axonal regeneration in the spinal cord of C57BL/6 mice, some enhancement of regeneration in the knockout animals would have been expected.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies suggest that NG2 is not a major inhibitory molecule preventing regeneration in the CNS and, further, that it is not essential for successful axonal pathfinding, regeneration and functional reinnervation in injured peripheral nerves. It is conceivable that if CNS regeneration-promoting interventions such as enhancing the intrinsic regenerative ability of CNS neurons, expressing neurotrophic molecules to support regenerating axons and neutralising other putative inhibitory molecules were to be applied, NG2 knockout mice would show enhanced regeneration relative to wild-type mice. However, such studies have not yet been carried out and for the moment the evidence that NG2 is not a key inhibitor of axon regeneration appears to be very strong.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Phenotyping</title><p>NG2 knockout mice were bred with C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Harlan, UK) to produce a breeding stock of heterozygous mice, the offspring of which were phenotyped as follows.

The sections were post-fixed for 5 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (PFA), rinsed (x3) in 0.1 M TBS containing 0.05% Tween detergent (TNT), and incubated with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 15 minutes, rinsed again in TNT and placed for 1 hour in 10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, Dorset, UK) made up in TBS. The polyclonal anti-NG2 antibody was then added (1:5000) and the sections incubated for 72 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. (A polyclonal antibody was used in preference to a monoclonal antibody because it would be expected to recognise many sites on the NG2 protein, and therefore be more likely to detect a (possibly functional) truncated form of NG2 in the KO mouse). The sections were then washed again in TNT (x3) and incubated in Alexafluor-488- conjugated goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:400) for two hours, washed in TBS and coverslipped with DABCO anti-fade medium. Mice with no evidence of NG2 staining, following comparisons with positive control tissue (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), were designated as knockouts (KO) and used in experiments with age and sex matched C57BL/6 mice as wild-type (WT) controls. Homozygous mutants were viable, fertile, and morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>General surgical procedures</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with local ethical committee and UK Home Office approvals. Male and female adult mice, between 6 and 9 weeks old were used, with wild-type and transgenic mice matched for age and sex. For all experiments the animals were coded and randomised so that their phenotype was unknown at the time of surgery and in the course of data analysis. All surgical procedures were performed under aseptic technique and general anaesthesia. Animals were initially anaesthetised with 4% halothane and anaesthesia was maintained with 1.5% halothane (plus oxygen and nitrous oxide 1:1). In the case of the experiment in which DiAsp (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA) was introduced into whisker pads, anaesthesia was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 150 &#x003bc;l of 2.5% Avertin (tribromoethanol; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) per 10 g of body mass. In animals with sciatic nerve or dorsal root injuries, approximately 0.5 ml sucrose octa-acetate and denatonium benzoate (Mentholatum, Glasgow, UK) was applied to the hindpaw on the injured side to prevent autophagy. Following surgery, all animals received intramuscular buprenorphine (20 mg/kg) opiate analgesic (Vetergesic; Alstoe Ltd., Yorks., UK) and recovered in an incubator.

The dura was opened and two puncture holes were made with a fine insulin syringe, one immediately medial to the left dorsal roots and the second on the immediate opposite side of the midline. The points of a pair of straight-bladed microscissors were inserted vertically into the needle holes and the scissors closed to transect the left dorsal column. The insulin needle, marked at 2 mm, was passed across the injury site to ensure a uniform depth of lesion. Superficial muscles were sutured and the wound closed. To maximise the regenerative response of injured ascending axons in the dorsal column, a conditioning peripheral nerve injury was performed at the same time as the dorsal column lesion. The ipsilateral sciatic nerve was exposed at mid-thigh level, crushed for ten seconds with watchmakers' forceps (No. 7) and the skin incision was closed with Histoacryl glue (B. Braun, Melsungen AG, Germany). After 25 days, the animals were reanaesthetised, the left sciatic nerve exposed and an incision made into the nerve proximal to the previous crush site. A fine glass micropipette attached to a Hamilton syringe was pushed into the nerve through the incision, and 1 &#x003bc;l of CT-HRP (dissolved at 14 mg/ml; List Biological Laboratories) was slowly injected into the endoneurium. The micropipette was withdrawn and the sciatic nerve was ligated immediately above the incision in the nerve to prevent leakage of injectate. The skin incision was then sutured and the animals allowed to recover and survive for 3 further days.</p></sec><sec><title>Dorsal root injury</title><p>The lumbar spine was exposed via a midline dorsal incision and a unilateral left L4 and L5 laminectomy performed to expose the lower lumbar dorsal roots. The L5 root was identified, transected with microscissors and the cut ends reapposed and held together with fibrinogen (Sigma, Dorset, UK). The ipsilateral sciatic nerve was crushed as described above. After 25 days, the animals were reanaesthetised and 1 &#x003bc;l of CT-HRP was injected into the sciatic nerve as described above, in order to label axons in the dorsal root. As the purpose of these experiments was to test for the ability of regenerating axons to enter the CNS they are included under the general heading of CNS injury models.</p></sec><sec><title>Controls for spared axons</title><p>Because incomplete dorsal column (or dorsal root) lesions might result in CT-HRP labelling of uninjured axons in the dorsal column, transverse sections were cut through the medulla at the level of the gracile nucleus in every animal in these two experimental groups. These sections were processed alongside the sections of the injury site. Three animals with evidence of axon sparing (labelled axons in or immediately caudal to the gracile nucleus) were excluded from the study on the basis of these controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Corticospinal tract injury and labelling</title><p>The skin over the back of the neck was incised, muscles of the neck reflected, and the spinal cord exposed by bilateral laminectomy of vertebrae C6 and C7. The area of dorsal column between the DREZ and the midline on the left side was cut using a pair of microscissors, and the lesion was extended across the midline and checked to extend to a depth of 2 mm below the dorsal surface of the cord with a marked needle. Care was taken to undercut and avoid damage to the dorsal spinal vein. The dura was closed and overlying muscle and skin sutured. While the animals remained under anaesthesia, BDA (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA; 10% solution in dissolved in 0.1 M PBS) was injected into the contralateral sensorimotor cortex to anterogradely label corticospinal tract axons. A 2 &#x000d7; 1 mm burr hole was made over the right parietal cortex, the dura opened, and a glass micropipette attached to a Hamilton syringe was pushed into the cortex from the rostral edge of the burr hole, at a very shallow angle and advanced for 2 mm in a caudal direction. The pipette tip was kept almost parallel to the cortical surface and at a depth of no more than 1 mm. BDA solution (1.7 &#x003bc;l) was then injected while the pipette was slowly retracted to its entry point. The pipette was then advanced through the same entry point, for the same distance and at the same depth but directed slightly medially with respect to the first injection and a second aliquot of BDA (1.7 &#x003bc;l) injected in the same manner as the first. Finally the process was repeated a third time, with the pipette tip directed slightly laterally with respect to the first injection. Thus a total of approximately 5 &#x003bc;l BDA solution was injected, filling a large area of the right sensorimotor cortex. The burr hole was then covered with Gelfoam (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Skipton, UK) and the scalp incision sutured.</p><p>Animals with dorsal column or dorsal root injuries survived for 28 days and those with CST injuries survived for 21 days. Following an anaesthetic overdose of intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbitone (Sagatal; Rh&#x000f4;ne Merieux, UK) supplemented with halothane, they were perfused transcardially with 50 ml of PBS followed by 100 ml PFA. The relevant portions of cervical, thoracic or lumbar spinal cord and dorsal roots were removed and post-fixed for 2 hours in PFA. The tissue blocks, in some cases further dissected, were then transferred to PBS containing 30% sucrose for 48 hours. The cryoprotected tissue blocks were frozen in Tissue-Tek (Sakura, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands) cooled with dry ice. Serial horizontal sections of spinal cord were cut on a freezing microtome at 40 &#x003bc;m and collected in 0.1 M PBS.</p></sec><sec><title>BDA immunohistochemistry</title><p>Free floating sections, maintained in serial order, were washed twice in 0.05 M TBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (TBST), and incubated in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 15 minutes, rinsed again in TBST (2 &#x000d7; 10 minutes) and incubated overnight in 1:200 ABC kit solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlington CA, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C.

In other mice, sciatic nerve crush was supplemented by excision of 3 mm of the saphenous nerve at mid-thigh level, in order to control for the possibility that sensory recovery following sciatic nerve injury might result from sprouting of saphenous nerve axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In other mice, the left sciatic nerve was transected with microscissors at the same level as the crush lesions and the cut ends immediately reanastamosed with 2 &#x000d7; 10/0 sutures.

The threshold thickness of Von Frey hair required to elicit a repeated withdrawal response was assessed in all animals, prior to nerve injury, by stimulating the lateral glabrous skin of the hindpaw. After injury, the time taken for mice to recover the ability to withdraw their paw in response to the same Von Frey hair as pre-operatively was assessed twice daily and continued for two days after recovery of function. At each testing session, the contralateral, uninjured hindpaw was assessed for comparison. Motor function was tested immediately after the sensory assessment, by assessing (recovery of) the toe spreading reflex (involuntary spreading of the digits when the hindlimbs are raised off their supporting surface by lifting the mouse by the tail).</p></sec><sec><title>Facial nerve injury and assessment of functional recovery</title><p>The right facial nerve was exposed postero-inferior to the right ear and crushed immediately distal to the stylomastoid foramen for ten seconds with watchmakers' forceps.

Two days later, the animals were overdosed with anaesthetic and the L4 and L5 DRG on both sides removed and placed in PFA for 2 hours. The ganglia were then placed whole onto a cavity slide, coverslipped with glycerol containing DABCO, and examined and photographed immediately in a confocal microscope. If labelled cells were present, an average of 25 images was collected through the entire thickness of the DRG. Retrogradely labelled cells (visible above a fixed luminescence threshold) were counted using Openlab image processing software.

The muscles were fixed, whilst slightly stretched, in buffered formol-calcium at 4&#x000b0;C for 6 hours, then placed in 10% sucrose at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The muscles were cut at 40 &#x003bc;m with a freezing microtome and the sections collected in chilled dH<sub>2</sub>O.
