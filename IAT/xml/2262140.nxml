The siRNA population can be augmented and silencing amplified via transitivity, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR)-dependent pathway that uses the target RNA as substrate to generate secondary siRNAs. Here we report that <italic>Arabidopsis DCL2</italic>&#x02013;but not <italic>DCL4</italic>-is required for transitivity in cell-autonomous, post-transcriptional silencing of transgenes. An insertion mutation in <italic>DCL2</italic> blocked sense transgene-induced silencing and eliminated accumulation of the associated <italic>RDR</italic>-dependent siRNAs. In hairpin transgene-induced silencing, the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation likewise eliminated accumulation of secondary siRNAs and blocked transitive silencing, but did not block silencing mediated by primary siRNAs. Strikingly, in all cases, the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation eliminated accumulation of all secondary siRNAs, including those generated by other DCL enzymes. In contrast, mutations in <italic>DCL4</italic> promoted a dramatic shift to transitive silencing in the case of the hairpin transgene and enhanced silencing induced by the sense transgene. Suppression of hairpin and sense transgene silencing by the P1/HC-Pro and P38 viral suppressors was associated with elimination of secondary siRNA accumulation, but the suppressors did not block processing of the stem of the hairpin transcript into primary siRNAs. Thus, these viral suppressors resemble the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation in their effects on siRNA biogenesis. We conclude that <italic>DCL2</italic> plays an essential, as opposed to redundant, role in transitive silencing of transgenes and may play a more important role in silencing of viruses than currently thought.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA silencing is an ancient network of highly related pathways that repress gene expression in eukaryotic organisms by means of small regulatory RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Baulcombe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Vaucheret1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism is triggered by dsRNA and specifically targets any related RNA (post-transcriptional pathways) or DNA (transcriptional gene silencing). Key steps in the process are: 1) the dsRNA trigger is cut into 21&#x02013;24 nucleotide (nt) short-interfering (si) RNA duplexes by a ribonuclease III-like enzyme termed Dicer, 2) one strand of the siRNA duplex associates with an argonaute-like protein to form the core of a silencing effector complex, and 3) the siRNA directs the complex to complementary genetic elements. In post-transcriptional gene silencing, the complex targets mRNA, which is then cleaved by the ribonuclease-H activity of argonaute (AGO).</p><p>Higher plants, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and fungi additionally amplify silencing via transitivity, a pathway that produces dsRNA and additional siRNAs from the targeted mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Baulcombe2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Sijen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Production of dsRNA in transitive silencing depends on cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) activity, and the siRNAs generated are termed secondary siRNAs, while those that derive from the initial dsRNA trigger are termed primary siRNAs. In plants, production of both primary and secondary siRNAs entails cleavage of dsRNA by the Dicer-like (DCL) family of enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Baulcombe2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Moissiard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In plants, therefore, transitivity not only increases the siRNA population, but also degrades the target mRNA in the process of making secondary siRNAs, thereby amplifying silencing in two ways. Interestingly, secondary siRNA production itself is not a mechanism of target degradation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> because antisense secondary siRNAs are transcribed directly from the target mRNA template in that organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Pak1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Sijen2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The importance of transitive silencing has recently come to light in studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showing that the vast majority of siRNAs that accumulate during RNA silencing in that organism are secondary siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Pak1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Transitive silencing is also important in plants, where it is essential for some types of transgene-induced silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Himber1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and thought to play a key role in defense against viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Schwach1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Ding1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although RNA silencing was initially considered simply a novel defense mechanism against viruses and other invading nucleic acids, the subsequent discovery of endogenous small regulatory RNAs led to the realization that it is a fundamental genetic regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic organisms. There are three major classes of endogenous small regulatory RNAs in plants: micro (mi) RNA, trans-acting (ta) siRNA, and heterochromatin-associated (hc) siRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Reinhart1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Zilberman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The biogenesis and mechanism of action of the different silencing-associated small regulatory RNAs are highly related; however, hc-siRNAs suppress transcription as opposed to mediating RNA degradation and, in animal systems, miRNAs primarily repress translation. Many of the enzymes involved in RNA silencing are encoded by multigene families, allowing for the possibility of diverse, specialized pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Brodersen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Vazquez2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are four <italic>DCL</italic>, ten <italic>AGO</italic>, and six <italic>RDR</italic> genes. The roles of the four <italic>Arabidopsis DCL</italic> genes in small RNA biogenesis and silencing have been the subject of intense study, and the picture that has emerged is one of primary roles for many of the enzymes, plus functional redundancy. Thus, <italic>DCL1</italic> is required for the biogenesis of 21-nt miRNAs, and <italic>DCL3</italic> is responsible for the biogenesis of 24-nt hc-siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Reinhart1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Park1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Xie1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>DCL4</italic> seems the most versatile, being required for production of 21-nt ta-siRNAs, which derive from <italic>RDR6</italic>-generated dsRNA, as well as for production of 21-nt <italic>RDR6</italic>-independent siRNAs from hairpin transgenes, in which case dsRNA can be produced directly by transcription of an engineered inverted repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Gasciolli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Fusaro1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>DCL4</italic> also plays a primary role in production of siRNAs from viruses, with <italic>DCL2</italic> as the substitute if <italic>DCL4</italic> has been inactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Fusaro1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Deleris1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Although <italic>DCL2</italic> has been reported to produce an endogenous siRNA from a convergently transcribed and overlapping gene pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Borsani1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, it is otherwise considered to play a subordinate and redundant role in siRNA biogenesis. Another possibility, however, is that the primary role of <italic>DCL2</italic> has simply not yet been identified.</p><p>With this idea in mind, we undertook a systematic study of the impact of mutations in <italic>DCL</italic> genes and the effect of viral silencing suppressors on siRNA biogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> carrying different types of silenced transgene. Our experiments focused on three general cases: 1) sense transgene-induced silencing, in which case a construct that was designed to express a reporter gene becomes post-transcriptionally silenced instead, 2) hairpin transgene-induced silencing of a sense transgene, in which case a transgene that produces a self-complementary transcript is used to target an expressing, homologous sense transgene, and 3) processing of the hairpin transcript itself (hairpin transgene self-silencing). We expected that these cases might differ in their <italic>DCL</italic> requirements because sense transgene-induced silencing requires a set of genes that are not required for hairpin-induced silencing of transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Beclin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Boutet1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Some of these genes are thought to mediate production of dsRNA from the sense transgene transcript and include <italic>RDR6</italic>, <italic>AGO1,</italic> and <italic>SGS3</italic>&#x02013;which encodes a coiled-coiled domain protein of unknown function, while <italic>HEN1</italic> encodes a methylase that acts downstream of dsRNA and stabilizes siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Li1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The transgenes we used differ in several important respects from those in other studies. First, no other study to date has analyzed the <italic>DCL</italic> requirements for sense transgene-induced silencing. The exact nature of the silencing trigger is still unknown in this type of silencing, but it is thought that the locus gives rise to an aberrant transcript, which might lack normal 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends. The aberrant transcript becomes a template for RDR6, which synthesizes the complementary strand and produces dsRNA. Second, with respect to hairpin transgene-induced silencing, the loop portion of the hairpin construct we used is retained in the mature transcript and has sequence identical to that of the targeted sense transgene. Thus, this hairpin construct is unusual in that it has a region that requires <italic>RDR6</italic> to produce dsRNA in addition to one that can directly produce dsRNA, and siRNAs from both regions can target the sense transgene. Furthermore, although hairpin transgene-induced silencing has been the subject of numerous studies, no other study has examined the fate of the hairpin transcript itself and the <italic>DCL</italic> requirements for self-silencing of the hairpin. Lastly, we used transgenes driven by the ubiquitously expressed cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Consequently, silencing occurs throughout the plant without the need for a silencing signal.</p><p>In all three cases of silencing we examined, accumulation of secondary siRNAs required <italic>DCL2</italic> but not <italic>DCL4</italic>, providing evidence that DCL2 plays an essential, as opposed to redundant, role in transitive silencing of transgenes. This result strongly suggests that there are natural targets of silencing for which DCL2 plays a primary role. Furthermore, we found that viral suppressors of silencing and a <italic>dcl2</italic> null mutation had similar effects on accumulation of secondary siRNAs, supporting a primary role for <italic>DCL2</italic> in antiviral defense.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>DCL2</italic> but not <italic>DCL4</italic> is Required for Sense Transgene-induced Silencing</title><p>To study sense transgene-induced silencing, we used the L1 transgenic line, which carries a direct repeat of the T-DNA insert and is silenced for the <italic>uidA</italic> gene encoding &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Elmayan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

(B) Accumulation of GUS mRNA, GUS siRNAs, and siR255 in wild type (wt) and mutant plants carrying the L1 GUS locus was determined using RNA gel blot analysis. <sup>32</sup>P-labelled RNA probes were used for hybridization except that a DNA oligonucleotide probe was used for the siR255 blots and a full length GUS cDNA probe was used for the high molecular weight (HMW) RNA blot of lanes 18&#x02013;21.

The post-transcriptional silencing induced by a single copy of the L1 GUS locus is comparable to that observed in plants homozygous for the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 13 and 14). An L1 GUS line that expressed the P1/HC-Pro viral suppressor of silencing was used as a positive control showing expression of the GUS transgene. The <italic>dcl2</italic> and <italic>dcl3</italic> mutant lines were null mutants generated by T-DNA insertion, whereas the <italic>dcl1</italic> mutant lines were partial loss of function mutants. The <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant lines had point mutations in <italic>DCL4</italic> that eliminated or greatly reduced accumulation of the 21 nt species of ta-siR255 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;4 and 9&#x02013;10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Yoshikawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>). Because 21 nt ta-siRNAs are produced by DCL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Gasciolli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Yoshikawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, this result confirms that these <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant lines are highly deficient for DCL4 activity. All F2 progeny homozygous for the <italic>dcl3</italic> mutation were transcriptionally silenced for GUS, whether they carried one or two copies of the GUS transgene (Mlotshwa and Vance, manuscript in preparation), preventing examination of the role of <italic>DCL3</italic> in sense transgene-induced silencing in this system. Transcriptional silencing could be avoided, however, in the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutant by using progeny that were hemizygous for the GUS transgene: Run-off transcription assays showed that whereas <italic>dcl2</italic> mutant progeny homozygous for the L1 locus were transcriptionally silenced for GUS, ones hemizygous for the L1 locus were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The transcriptional silencing induced by T-DNA insertion mutations is likely due to the CaMV 35S promoter in the engineered T-DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Alonso1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Daxinger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This propensity of the L1 locus to become transcriptionally silenced in the presence of additional copies of the CaMV promoter highlights the importance of examining siRNA accumulation before concluding that absence of GUS mRNA or activity indicates that the locus is post-transcriptionally silenced. Transcriptional silencing was not a problem in the <italic>dcl1</italic> or <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant lines, which were not T-DNA insertion mutants.</p><p>Silencing of the L1 GUS transgene was severely impaired in <italic>dcl2</italic> mutant plants, as shown by greatly increased accumulation of GUS mRNA and the absence of GUS siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 14, 16, and 17). Thus, <italic>DCL2</italic> plays a primary role in this <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent silencing pathway. In contrast, silencing of the L1 GUS transgene was enhanced in both <italic>dcl4-2</italic> and <italic>dcl4-10</italic> mutant plants, as shown by reduced accumulation of GUS mRNA compared to wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6 and 9&#x02013;12).

Preferential accumulation of the loop mRNA, however, indicates that degradation of the hairpin transcript occurs mainly via processing of the stem of the hairpin. Degradation of the loop portion of the transcript, which requires transitive silencing, apparently does not occur very effectively in this system. Analysis of &#x00394;GUS-SUG mRNA and siRNA accumulation in an <italic>rdr6</italic> mutant backgound confirms that elimination of the full-length &#x00394;GUS-SUG transcript and accumulation of siRNAs from the stem of the hairpin are <italic>RDR6</italic>-independent, whereas accumulation of siRNAs from the loop is <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent: Loop mRNA, but little full-length &#x00394;GUS-SUG transcript, accumulates in <italic>rdr6</italic> mutant plants, as in wild type; however, siRNAs from the loop are eliminated by the <italic>rdr6</italic> mutation, while those from the stem are largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;2). Thus, as expected, siRNAs from the stem are primary siRNAs, while those from the loop are secondary siRNAs and part of the transitive silencing pathway. The increased accumulation of GUS loop mRNA in the <italic>rdr6</italic> mutant compared to wild type provides additional confirmation that degradation of the loop occurs via transitive silencing.</p><p>The &#x00394;GUS-SUG primary siRNAs are predominantly 21-nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), suggesting that DCL4 is normally responsible for processing the dsRNA stem of the hairpin.

Because loop siRNAs are RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), this result implies that <italic>DCL2</italic> is required for transitive self-silencing of the hairpin transgene.

The <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation blocks transitive silencing even in a <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant background: Loop siRNAs are absent and high levels of loop mRNA accumulate in <italic>dcl2 dcl4</italic> double mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;10), indicating that degradation of the hairpin transcript occurs mainly via processing of the dsRNA stem of the hairpin in the absence of both <italic>DCL2</italic> and <italic>DCL4</italic>. Thus, the shift to transitive silencing observed in <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant plants requires <italic>DCL2</italic>. Processing of the dsRNA stem of the hairpin transcript in the <italic>dcl2 dcl4</italic> double mutant presumably involves DCL3, DCL1 or residual low-level DCL4 activity, as 24-nt and a small amount of 21-nt primary (stem) siRNAs accumulate in these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;10).</p><p>Altogether, these results show that <italic>DCL2</italic> is required for production of <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent siRNAs from a hairpin transgene as well as from a sense transgene. In addition, self-silencing of the hairpin transcript provides another example of the hierarchical action of the DCL proteins and reveals that different DCL proteins are preferentially associated with different mechanisms of transcript degradation. In wild type plants, the major pathway for degradation of the &#x00394;GUS-SUG hairpin transcript appears to be <italic>DCL4</italic>-dependent processing of the stem into primary siRNAs. In a <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant, transitive silencing is prominent and involves <italic>DCL2</italic>- and <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent production of secondary siRNAs.

Thus, P1/HC-Pro and P38 have little or no inhibitory effect on processing the dsRNA stem of the hairpin, but they suppress the secondary siRNA-dependent pathway responsible for degradation of the loop. Consistent with this interpretation, P1/HC-Pro and P38 reduced accumulation of secondary (loop) siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5).

The relatively minor accumulation of full-length transcript in the P1/HC-Pro and P38 lines suggests that although most &#x00394;GUS-SUG transcripts are degraded via processing of the dsRNA stem into primary siRNAs, some are degraded as a result of being targeted by primary siRNAs and that P1/HC-Pro and P38 block this latter pathway. The increase in primary siRNA accumulation in the viral suppressor lines compared to wild type plants is consistent with the idea that some full-length hairpin transcripts are degraded by transitive silencing in wild type plants, thereby reducing production of primary siRNAs.

The enhancement of loop mRNA accumulation by P38 was so great that loop mRNA in wild type plants was barely detectable at the exposure appropriate for the samples from P38-expressing plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;9), although it was clearly visible at a 3-fold longer exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, image of lanes 7&#x02013;9 labeled &#x0201c;loop 3x exp&#x0201d;).

P38 also had a more pronounced effect than P1/HC-Pro on the size distribution of primary siRNAs, causing the accumulation of a closely spaced smaller species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;6), suggesting that altering the processing of small RNAs is part of the P38 mechanism of action.</p><p>Some of our viral suppressor results differ from those of another group.

Surprisingly, even <italic>DCL4</italic>-dependent 21-nt and <italic>DCL3</italic>-dependent 24-nt secondary siRNAs are eliminated by a <italic>dcl2</italic> null mutation, suggesting that DCL2 is required for DCL4 and DCL3 participation in production of <italic>RdR6</italic>-dependent siRNAs from these transgenes. Our results show that DCL2 plays a primary role in transitive silencing of transgenes and suggest that there are as-yet-unidentified natural substrates for which DCL2 is the primary DCL enzyme. One possible origin of natural substrates of DCL2 is foreign genes that are introduced into the plant genome during infection with pathogens like <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>. Such genes constitute a natural analogue of transgenes. In addition, our observation that a <italic>dcl2</italic> null mutation and two viral suppressors of silencing have the same effect on secondary siRNA accumulation suggests that natural substrates of DCL2 might be produced in viral infection. The similarity in effect of the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation and the viral suppressors applies only to accumulation of secondary siRNAs, however, and not to suppression of silencing in general: The suppressors eliminated both hairpin and sense transgene-induced silencing, whereas the <italic>dcl2</italic> mutation impaired only the latter.</p><p>Although DCL2 was initially proposed to play an antiviral role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Xie1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, subsequent studies suggested that the enzyme functions in only a subordinate and redundant capacity in antiviral defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Fusaro1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Deleris1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Moissiard2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. A key piece of evidence for this conclusion is that 22-nt viral siRNAs accumulated primarily when DCL4 was inactive. Those studies, however, either involved only primary siRNAs or did not distinguish between primary and secondary siRNAs. In contrast, our results point to a requirement for <italic>DCL2</italic> specifically in the production of secondary siRNAs. <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent production of secondary siRNAs is thought to be particularly important in slowing the systemic spread of viruses by allowing systemically invaded cells to respond before the virus starts replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Schwach1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, <italic>DCL1</italic> and <italic>AGO1</italic> are involved in the biogenesis and function of miRNAs, while <italic>RDR2</italic>, <italic>DCL3</italic>, and <italic>AGO4</italic> are involved in that of hc-siRNAs. <italic>RDR6</italic> and <italic>DCL4</italic> constitute a module that functions in the biogenesis of ta-siRNAs and works downstream of miRNA-directed cleavage. Our results suggest that <italic>DCL2</italic> and <italic>RDR6</italic> also constitute a module in the case of some substrates. These substrates differ from ones previously identified for the <italic>DCL4/RDR6</italic> module in that neither DCL4 nor DCL3 appears to process them in the absence of DCL2, perhaps due to unique structural features of the substrates or their localization in the cell. One possibility is that DCL2 might be required upstream of dsRNA production to recognize the substrates and/or recruit RDR6, after which DCL2 and other DCL enzymes produce siRNAs from the resultant dsRNA. Because the majority of secondary siRNAs in wild type plants are 21-nt for all three cases of silencing we examined, DCL4 appears to be overall the most active one of the enzymes on the <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent dsRNA substrates produced by transgenes. Alternatively, 21-nt siRNAs might simply be the most stable. For all of three transgenes, however, 21-nt and 22-nt secondary siRNAs are equally abundant at the 3&#x02032; end of the GUS sequence, consistent with a specific requirement for <italic>DCL2</italic> early in the <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent arm of transgene silencing. The processivity of DCL4 appears to be greater than that of DCL2 on these substrates because only 21-nt siRNAs accumulate from the middle region of the GUS sequence. This difference in processivity of the two enzymes might be at least partially responsible for the perception that DCL2 plays a purely subordinate role. The reduced accumulation of loop mRNA and primary siRNA in <italic>dcl2</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) suggests that DCL2 might also stabilize its substrates against non-silencing related nucleolytic degradation.</p><p>Because transitivity and sense transgene-induced silencing&#x02013;like ta-siRNA biogenesis-require <italic>RDR6</italic>, DCL4 has been considered the likely DCL enzyme for siRNA production in sense transgene silencing.

The present work, however, shows that <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent production of siRNAs from transgenes that do not have a miRNA cleavage site differs from ta-siRNA biogenesis.</p><p>A number of studies have examined the <italic>DCL</italic> requirements of hairpin transgene induced silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Dunoyer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Fusaro1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Dunoyer2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Finnegan1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The studies variously differ from one another and from our work with respect to structure of the hairpin transgene, dependence on a silencing signal, and whether the target of silencing is a transgene or an endogenous gene. Our study is the only one to date that has focused specifically on cell-autonomous silencing of transgenes and systematically distinguished between accumulation of primary and secondary siRNAs. Using this approach, we find that hairpin transgene-induced silencing occurs in <italic>dcl2</italic>, <italic>dcl4</italic>, and <italic>dcl2 dcl4</italic> mutants. The mechanism of target degradation varies, however, depending on which of the DCL enzymes are active. DCL4-dependent processing of the stem of the hairpin into primary siRNAs is the major pathway utilized in wild type and <italic>dcl2</italic> mutant plants. Inactivation of DCL4 promotes a shift to transitive silencing and the production of secondary siRNAs. The very high level of accumulation of secondary siRNAs in <italic>dcl4</italic> mutant plants transgenic for both the &#x00394;GUS-SUG and 6b4 GUS loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) suggests that under some conditions, secondary siRNA production itself is a major contributor to degradation of the targeted transcript, consistent with the observation that <italic>AGO1</italic> is not required for silencing of a GUS transgene by the &#x00394;GUS-SUG locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Beclin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. When both DCL2 and DCL4 are inactive, silencing is again dependent on primary siRNAs, and processing of the stem of the hairpin by DCL3 becomes evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g003">3B</xref>). Our observation that DCL4 completely processes the 558-bp dsRNA stem of a hairpin construct into primary siRNAs, leaving only the loop portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggests that the enzyme is highly processive on <italic>RDR6</italic>-independent dsRNA as well as on <italic>RDR6</italic>-dependent dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001755-g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Moissiard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>) and is consistent with the observation that <italic>DCL4</italic> is required when silencing depends entirely on production of primary siRNAs from a hairpin transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Dunoyer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The gene families involved in RNA silencing in plants have evolved to provide a large degree of functional diversity.

The DCL enzymes and functional modules undoubtedly evolved to efficiently handle a wide variety of natural substrates&#x02013;many of which have probably not yet been identified, and it is likely that the enzymes recognize signature structural features of their preferred substrates. The multiplicity of functional pairings is just beginning to be elucidated. For example, although RDR2/DCL3 is a well established module involved in hc-siRNA biogenesis, DCL3 activity without RDR2 and the pairing of RDR2 with DCL4 has recently been proposed for a particular case of hairpin transgene targeting of an endogenous gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001755-Smith1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.
