We hypothesized that by cleaving hyperactive ultralarge VWF (ULVWF) multimers, ADAMTS13 down-regulates both thrombosis and inflammation.

Furthermore, in inflammatory models, ADAMTS13 deficiency resulted in enhanced extravasation of neutrophils, and this process was also dependent on VWF.

These steps in the leukocyte adhesion cascade are controlled by selectins, integrins, and other adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). It is now evident that several adhesion molecules involved in inflammation are also important in thrombosis. For example, P-selectin expressed on activated platelets and endothelium contributes to both thrombosis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (VWF) are present in the platelet &#x003b1;-granules and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. P-selectin mediates leukocyte and platelet rolling, and VWF mediates initial adhesion of platelets, the first step in inflammation and thrombosis. Thus, Weibel-Palade bodies constitute a prominent link between thrombosis and inflammation. The role of VWF in inflammation needs to be explored.</p><p>The essential role of VWF in hemostasis is illustrated by von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder associated with functional VWF deficiency in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and defective occlusive thrombus formation in the arteries and veins of <italic>Vwf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). VWF levels are elevated in both chronic and acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Normally, the glycoprotein GPIb&#x003b1; platelet-binding domain is not exposed on circulating VWF, but it becomes exposed under pathological high shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) or upon binding to exposed subendothelium. Circulating active VWF has also been found in von Willebrand disease type 2B, malaria, antiphospholipid syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In mice, VWF deficiency delays the formation of fatty streaks in two models of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These studies suggest that VWF could play an active role in inflammation in addition to hemostasis.</p><p>The VWF contained in Weibel-Palade bodies is extremely large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and is designated as ultralarge VWF (ULVWF; &#x0223c;20,000 kD). Upon cellular activation or stimulation with secretagogues (such as histamine, calcium ionophore, thrombin, and TNF-&#x003b1;), ULVWF is released from the storage granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). These ULVWF multimers are considered biologically hyperactive because they bind better to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and form higher strength bonds with platelet GPIb compared with small plasma multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats&#x02013;13 (ADAMTS13) inhibits platelet adhesion by quickly cleaving hyperactive ULVWF multimers released from the Weibel-Palade bodies under conditions of fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In 1982, Moake et al. found ULVWF multimers in the plasma of patients suffering from chronic relapsing TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), a disorder clinically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological abnormalities, fever, and renal dysfunction. The pathogenesis of TTP has been linked to a deficiency of ADAMTS13, which can be either familial (a mutation in the <italic>ADAMTS13</italic> gene) or acquired (through inhibitory antibodies generated against ADAMTS13). Studies in mice show that ADAMTS13 deficiency is necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of TTP, suggesting the existence of additional genetic and/or environmental contributing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Recently, we and others have found that a complete deficiency of ADAMTS13 in mice results in a prothrombotic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although it is not known whether ADAMTS13 plays a role in inflammation, recent studies have found reduced ADAMTS13 activity in patients with acute systemic inflammation or sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-8, and IL-6, released during inflammation have been shown to have distinct effects on the endothelial release of ULVWF and its processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Recently, it was shown in vitro that VWF promotes leukocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) and that platelets bound to ULVWF can support leukocyte tethering and rolling under high shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We hypothesize that ADAMTS13, by cleaving hyperactive ULVWF, down-regulates not only thrombosis, but also inflammation. To investigate the role of ADAMTS13 and its substrate VWF in inflammation, we studied leukocyte rolling and adhesion in <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>/Vwf<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Vwf<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>/Vwf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Vwf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice using intravital microscopy. We also examined the role of the ADAMTS13&#x02013;VWF axis in neutrophil extravasation in two different models of inflammation (thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and wound healing).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Deficiency of ADAMTS13 results in increased numbers of leukocytes rolling per minute in unstimulated veins</title><p>To determine whether ADAMTS13 plays a role in inflammation, we visualized leukocyte rolling, as a measure of endothelial activation, on unstimulated mesenteric veins.

We found a similar increase in leukocyte rolling per minute in these <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (mean &#x000b1; SEM &#x0003d; 98 &#x000b1; 13) compared with <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (mean &#x000b1; SEM &#x0003d; 35 &#x000b1; 6; P &#x0003c; 0.001; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 mice of each group), indicating that the endothelium in <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was preactivated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We next asked whether platelets on VWF strings were present in the untreated veins and could be responsible for the observed increase in leukocyte rolling in the <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. We labeled the endogenous platelets and leukocytes with Rhodamine 6G and visualized the veins by intravital microscopy. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>(top) and Video 1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080130/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080130/DC1</ext-link>) show the absence of platelet-VWF strings on the endothelium of the unstimulated <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> veins, suggesting that it is most likely an up-regulation of an endothelial selectin that is responsible for the increased leukocyte rolling. Indeed, the observed leukocyte rolling in <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was dependent on P-selectin, because infusion of a blocking antibody to P-selectin completely abolished leukocyte rolling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom; and Video 1). Because the only known substrate for ADAMTS13 in thrombosis is VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), we studied leukocyte rolling in <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice on a VWF-deficient background to evaluate whether the increase in leukocyte rolling per minute was also VWF dependent.

These results suggest that the elevated baseline leukocyte rolling observed in the veins of <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was caused by the combined effect of P-selectin and VWF, most likely the unprocessed hyperactive ULVWF in the circulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>ADAMTS13 deficiency in mice results in increased leukocyte rolling per minute in unstimulated mesenteric veins.</bold> (A) Leukocyte rolling on the vessel wall was recorded in two to three unstimulated veins (200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m diameter) per mouse.

We have previously demonstrated in vivo that ADAMTS13 cleaves platelet-VWF strings, regulates platelet interaction with the &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; vessel wall in the veins, prevents thrombi formation in activated microvenules, and modulates thrombotic response in injured arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Thus, these studies indicate that ADAMTS13 forms a new link between thrombosis and inflammation. The increase in leukocyte rolling and adhesion was dependent on the presence of VWF. These in vivo findings could be explained in part by recently published in vitro studies by Bernardo et al., who showed that platelets bound to endothelial ULVWF could support leukocyte tethering and rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), and by Pendu et al., who showed that VWF acts as a ligand for the leukocyte receptors P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 and &#x003b2;2 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). This binding involves multiple domains of VWF, including D'-D3 and A1-A2-A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>We also found an increase in endothelial P-selectin expression, soluble P-selectin, and VWF in the plasma of <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. It is interesting to speculate how ADAMTS13 deficiency results in increased plasma VWF. ADAMTS13 deficiency could produce slower clearance of ULVWF from the circulation and, thus, elevated VWF levels. Alternatively, ULVWF multimers activate platelets, which in turn may activate the endothelium. Recently, our laboratory showed that activated platelets, by binding to leukocytes, promote the release of Weibel-Palade bodies and stimulate leukocyte rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of platelets in <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice resulted in the normalization of leukocyte rolling as compared with <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice. This indicates that platelets, likely activated by ULVWF either in circulation or directly on endothelium, stimulate Weibel-Palade bodies secretion. Elevated expression of endothelial P-selectin is also consistent with increased Weibel-Palade body exocytosis.</p><p>Leukocytes roll and tether on the endothelium through P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 interaction under low shear conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). We observed that the presence of platelet-ULVWF strings in the veins of <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice treated with histamine decreased leukocyte velocity in the presence of P-selectin. Our in vivo findings are in agreement with the in vitro study of Bernardo et al. reporting that the leukocyte rolling on ULVWF-platelet strings was significantly slower than leukocyte rolling on endothelial cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Remarkably, this study showed that leukocytes can tether and roll on platelet-ULVWF strings under high shear stress. These results, together with our findings, suggest that ULVWF multimers&#x02212;released together with P-selectin from Weibel-Palade bodies by many stimuli, including hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), changes in shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), or inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>)&#x02212;could accelerate inflammatory responses in diseases such as atherosclerosis by slowing down leukocytes and facilitating their extravasation.</p><p>Increased plasma VWF levels have been reported in diseases implicating inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), viral and bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), and ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In addition, several studies suggest that inflammation is accompanied by a decrease in ADAMTS13 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). In the present study, we provide evidence that ULVWF that is likely released and present under these circumstances further promotes inflammation, as ADAMTS13 deficiency results in increased extravasation of neutrophils in both thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and wound healing. Our results complement previous studies that reported decreased extravasation of neutrophils in VWF-deficient mice, which was attributed to a lack of P-selectin storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), and delayed formation of atherosclerotic lesions in <italic>Vwf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice either on an <italic>apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic>LDLR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The results from our study suggest that ADAMTS13 down-regulates inflammation by cleaving hyperactive ULVWF multimers, and that deficiency of ADAMTS13 not only can induce TTP but also accelerates inflammatory diseases. Because thrombosis and inflammation constitute an integral part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including the major killers atherosclerosis and stroke, the results reported in this paper may provide new insights into the possible uses of ADAMTS13 as a therapeutic agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>Preliminary experiments to investigate the role of ADAMTS13 on leukocyte rolling were done on mixed background mice (C57BL/6J/129&#x000d7;1/SV) using littermates for comparison. <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were then backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J background for eight generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

The control <italic>Adamts13<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> (WT) mice on a C57BL/6J background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The male and female mice used for intravital microscopy were approximately 4 wk old and weighed 13&#x02013;15 g. Male and female mice used for experimental thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and excision wounds were 9&#x02013;11 wk old and weighed 23&#x02013;26 g. Animals were bred at the Immune Disease Institute, and the experimental procedures were approved by its Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Intravital microscopy.</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% tribromoethanol (0.15 ml/10 g), and a midline incision was made through the abdominal wall to expose the mesentery and mesenteric veins (200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m diameter). Venules (25&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m diameter) were labeled as microvenules and were also examined by intravital microscopy. The exposed mesentery vein was kept moist throughout the experiment by periodic superfusion of warmed (37&#x000b0;C) bicarbonate-buffered saline (131.9 mM NaCl, 18 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4.7 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) equilibrated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>. The mesentery vein was transluminated with a 12-V, 100-W, direct current&#x02013;stabilized source. Veins were visualized using an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a 32&#x000d7; objective connected to an SVHS video recorder (model AG-6730; Panasonic) using a charge-coupled device video camera (model C2400; Hamamatsu Photonics). Leukocyte interaction with the endothelium vessel wall was recorded in phase contrast for 10 min each in two to three veins per mouse. To study leukocyte rolling velocity, veins were stimulated with 200 &#x003bc;l of 1-mM histamine per 15 g of mouse body weight. To study leukocyte adhesion under inflammatory conditions, mice were infused i.p. with 500 ng TNF-&#x003b1; per 15 g of mouse body weight 3.5 h before intravital microscopy. A single mesenteric venule of &#x0223c;30 &#x003bc;m in diameter was studied per mouse. The wall shear rate for mesenteric veins (200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m diameter) and microvenules (25&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m in diameter) was calculated based on Poiseuille's law for a Newtonian fluid: &#x003b3;<sub>w</sub> &#x0003d; (8 V<sub>m</sub>/D<sub>v</sub>). The interfacial shear rate (&#x003b3;<sub>i</sub>) for microvenules was calculated as follows: &#x003b3;<sub>i</sub> &#x0003d; 4.9(8 V<sub>m</sub>/D<sub>v</sub>), where V<sub>m</sub> is mean blood velocity, D<sub>v</sub> is the diameter of the venule, and 4.9 is a median empirical correction factor obtained from velocity profiles measured in microvessels in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). It is about five times greater than values described in the literature for wall shear rate because of the slope of the velocity profile of blood in small venules and the presence of the endothelial surface layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). The centerline erythrocyte velocity (V<sub>rbc</sub>) was measured using an optical Doppler velocimeter (Microcirculation Research Institute). V<sub>mean</sub> is estimated from the measured V<sub>rbc</sub> by multiplying with an empirical factor of 0.625 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Quantification of leukocyte rolling, velocity, and adhesion.</title><p>Recorded images for leukocyte rolling were analyzed as follows. First, the number of leukocytes passing through a plane perpendicular to the vessel axis during a 1-min interval was counted. Leukocyte rolling per minute per vein for each mouse was determined by taking the average of five 1-min counts, as observed on the video screen during the entire 10-min recording. Second, the rolling velocity was determined by recording the time it took for a leukocyte to transverse a certain distance in a vein &#x0223c;250 &#x003bc;m long and 200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m wide, as observed on the video screen. All of the analysis was done by an investigator blinded to genotype. Third, the leukocyte was considered to be adherent if it remained stationary for &#x0003e;30 s.
