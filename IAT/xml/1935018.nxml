The PIAS proteins (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) were originally identified as inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway. Subsequently, crosstalk between the PIAS proteins and other signaling pathways has been shown to be involved in various cellular processes. Particularly, previous studies have demonstrated that PIAS proteins regulate p53-mediated transcription through sumoylation. hZimp10, also named zmiz1, is a novel PIAS-like protein and functions as a transcriptional co-activator. We recently identified p53 to be an hZimp10 interacting protein in the yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction between p53 and hZimp10 was confirmed by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Co-localization of p53 and hZimp10 proteins was also observed within cell nuclei by immunostaining. Moreover, we show that expression of exogenous hZimp10 enhances the transcriptional activity of p53 and knockdown of endogenous hZimp10 reduces the transcriptional activity of p53. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that hZimp10 binds to p53 on the p21 promoter. Finally, p53-mediated transcription is significantly impaired in Zimp10 null embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, these results provide the first line of evidence to demonstrate a role for Zimp10 in regulating p53 function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle checkpoint pathway in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The p53 gene is the most frequent target for genetic alterations in cancer, with mutations occurring in &#x0223c;50% of all human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The tumor suppressor functions of p53 are directly linked to its ability to control the expression of gene products implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). p53 binds as a tetramer to specific response elements located in the transcriptional control regions of p53 target genes, which initiates the recruitment of other transcriptional co-regulators to assemble a transcriptional complex that initiates RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A broad spectrum of p53 downstream target genes have been identified to be controlled by p53 in a positive or negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The fact that a variety of pathways are mediated by these p53 target genes demonstrates the role of p53 as an integrator of diverse cellular signals.</p><p>The p53 protein contains two N-terminal activation domains, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The critical step for p53-mediated transcriptional activation is facilitated by the ability of p53 to simultaneously bind to specific DNA sequences and recruit CBP/p300 and other transcriptional co-regulators to p53-responsive promoters. CBP/p300 recruitment appears to concomitantly bring the general transcription machinery, including TFIIB and TBP, and RNA polymerase II to the target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although a wealth of information exists concerning p53, it is unclear about the actual mechanism by which this critical tumor suppressor protein directly interacts with its target genes and co-regulators to mediate its transcriptional activity.</p><p>The PIAS proteins (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) were first identified as transcriptional co-regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). PIAS1 and PIAS3 can inhibit the activity of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Recent studies imply that the PIAS proteins may play a role in chromatin modulation through sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Sequence analysis indicates that the SUMO E3 ligase RING domain shares significant homology with the Miz domain of PIAS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Several PIAS proteins, such as PIASx&#x003b1;, x&#x003b2;, 1 and 3, have been shown to interact with SUMO-1 and Ubc9 to sumoylate a variety of transcriptional factors and other regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">17&#x02013;23</xref>). Particularly, it has been shown that the transcriptional activity of p53 can be regulated by PIAS through sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>hZimp10 and hZimp7, also named zmiz1 and zmiz2, respectively, are novel PIAS-like proteins that share a ring finger domain, termed Miz (msx-interacting zinc finger), with other PIAS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This domain has been shown to be important for PIAS-target protein interactions and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). A novel <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene, termed <italic>tonalli</italic> (<italic>tna</italic>), appears to be the ortholog of hZimp7 and 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The protein encoded by <italic>tna</italic> genetically interacts with the SWI2/SNF2 and Mediator complexes, implying a potential role for the hZimp proteins in transcription. To further explore their roles in transcription, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to seek out potential interacting proteins of hZimp7 and 10. Intriguingly, p53 was identified in the screen. Using different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, we demonstrated that hZimp10 physically interacts with the p53 protein, and through the interaction hZimp10 augments p53-mediated transcription. These data elucidate a link between hZimp10 and p53 and demonstrate that hZimp10 is a transcriptional co-regulator of p53.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid system</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

Total RNA was then extracted using RNAWiz RNA isolation reagent (Ambion, TX; Cat#: 9736). The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

The immunoprecipitates were serially washed with different TSE-based buffers and eluted for PCR analysis. For re-ChIP, the immunocomplexes were eluted with re-ChIP elution buffer (10&#x02009;mM DTT), and the supernatant was diluted 1:40 in ChIP dilution buffer.

Intriguingly, only a weak interaction was observed between the Miz domains and endogenous p53 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In addition to the Miz domain, the SAP (Scaffold attachment factor A/B, Acinus and PIAS) domain has also been shown to be involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Thus, we included it in our binding assays, although only slight binding activity above background was observed with this construct. Notably, the GST-fusion construct containing amino acids 451&#x02013;753 of hZimp10 showed the strongest binding activity with p53. Since this region only covers a small portion of the Miz domain, this result suggests that the Miz domain of hZimp10 may not be required for the interaction with p53. In addition, the GST-fusion protein containing the N-terminal fragment of hZimp7 also showed an interaction with p53, which is consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results. Taken together, the above results show that the regions spanning hZimp10 amino acids 451 to 753 and hZimp7 amino acids 1&#x02013;643 are mainly responsible for binding to p53. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Physical interaction between hZimp10 and p53 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in intact cells.

In order to avoid potential confounding effects of endogenous p53, we chose p53-null cells for these experiments. A luciferase reporter driven by the MDM2 promoter (MDM2-Luc) was co-transfected with plasmids expressing p53, hZimp7 and hZimp10 into HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> colon cancer cells in various combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). An approximate 2-fold increase of p53-mediated transcriptional activity above the baseline was observed when cells were transfected with 0.4&#x02009;ng of p53 expression vector. The p53 activity was further increased &#x0223c;7- or 9-fold in the presence of 40 or 80&#x02009;ng of hZimp10, respectively, above the baseline. In contrast, co-transfection of hZimp7 showed no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), which is consistent with the yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays that showed only a weak interaction between p53 and hZimp7. There was no effect when hZimp7 or hZimp10 were transfected alone with the reporter plasmid, indicating that the Zimp10-mediated induction in reporter activity was indeed through p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

All three hZimp10 shRNA constructs reduced the expression of FLAG-tagged hZimp10 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, there was no change in tubulin expression in the same samples. The hZimp10 shRNA construct 2 appeared most effective in the knockdown experiment using overexpressed hZimp10 and also significantly reduced the expression of endogenous hZimp10 protein in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In addition, we evaluated the specificity of shRNA vectors for hZimp7 and hZimp10 in MCF7 cells.

In HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> cells, the hZimp10 shRNA construct selectively reduced hZimp10 enhancement of p53-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E), which is consistent with the western blot results. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous hZimp10 expression by the hZimp10 shRNA vector in MCF7 cells resulted in a 5-fold reduction in p53-mediated transcription on both the p21-Luc and MDM2-Luc reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F and G).

HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS. Soluble chromatin was prepared after formaldehyde treatment of the cell cultures, and specific antibodies against hZimp10 were used to immunoprecipitate hZimp10-bound genomic DNA fragments. The genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the p53-binding sites in the p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Both p53 and hZimp10 recruitment was detected within the region of the p21 promoter that contains a functional p53-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) in HEK293 cells after UV treatment. As the average length of the genomic DNA fragments produced in these experiments was &#x0223c;800&#x02009;bp (data not shown), we could not distinguish with certainty whether the occupancy of hZimp10 on the p21 promoter is through an interaction with p53 or through interactions with other DNA-binding proteins. Therefore, we performed re-ChIP assays to assess the relationship between p53 and hZimp10 on the p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Using the hZimp10-specific antibody, we re-immunoprecipitated the elutions from the immunoprecipitates with a p53 antibody or normal IgG.

In addition, the samples re-immunoprecipitated with anti-hZimp10 showed a more intense p21 promoter PCR fragment than the ones using normal IgY. These data suggest that the recruitment of hZimp10 onto the p21 promoter is mediated through p53.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The p53 tumor suppressor is a DNA sequence-specific transcriptional factor that is mutated in &#x0223c;50% of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In response to a variety of cellular signals, perhaps the most well studied is its DNA damage function. p53 regulates the transcription of numerous genes involved in different cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest and cell death. Like other transcriptional factors, the transcriptional activity of p53 is largely dependent on its ability to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences and to recruit other necessary transcriptional co-regulators. In recent years, numerous transcription co-regulators have been shown to either directly or indirectly interact with p53 to modulate its transcriptional activity. For instance, physical and functional interactions between p53, p300 and HAT proteins have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The involvement of PRMT1 and CARM1 methyltransferases has also been demonstrated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Importantly, p53 has been shown to facilitate formation of a preinitiation complex via direct interactions with the components of the general transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The experiments reported here demonstrate a specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction between p53 and hZimp10, a novel PIAS-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The interaction was first identified by a modified yeast two-hybrid screen. Using GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, we then show that p53 binds to hZimp10 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in intact cells. Moreover, immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that p53 co-localizes with hZimp10 within cell nuclei. Furthermore, analysis of the interaction by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation assay) on the promoter of the p21 gene, a downstream target of p53, showed that hZimp10 is involved in the p53-mediated transcriptional complex. Taken together, these multiple lines of evidence clearly indicate that p53 and hZimp10 can specifically interact in a biologically relevant manner.</p><p>To search for the biological consequence of the interaction between p53 and hZimp10, we performed a series of experiments to assess the effect of hZimp10 on p53-mediated transcription. As shown in this article, hZimp10 acts as a transcriptional co-activator to augment p53-mediated transcription. We observed that expression of exogenous hZimp10 or knockdown of endogenous hZimp10 affects p53-mediated transcription on both the p21 and Mdm2 promoters. Introducing exogenous hZimp10 into MCF7 cells also augments endogenous p53-mediated transcription by increasing p21 transcript levels. Interestingly, hZimp10 consistently up-regulates p53-mediated transcriptional activity in all cell contexts examined to date. This result is consistent with the observation that hZimp10 harbors a strong intrinsic transactivation domain within its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It appears that through this domain hZimp10 can act as a transcriptional co-activator to augment p53-mediated transcription, which is consistent with previous observations showing that hZimp10 functions as a transcriptional co-activator of the androgen receptor and Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that the transcriptional activity of p53 can be regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In addition, p53 can also be covalently modified by sumoylation, which is mainly regulated through SUMO-1 (Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Recent studies have shown that PIAS proteins can bind to, sumoylate, and influence the activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In particular, PIAS1 and PIASx&#x003b2; act as E3 ligases to enhance sumoylation of p53 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although it has been shown that PIAS proteins negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of p53 through sumoylation, recent data indicated that PIAS1 and PIAS3 may function as activators of p53-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Previously, we have shown that Zimp10 co-localizes with the AR and SUMO-1&#x02009;at replication foci and enhances AR sumoylation. However, the mechanism for hZimp10-mediated enhancement of p53 activity appears to be through a sumoylation-independent pathway because over-expression of hZimp10 and SUMO-1 in HEK293 cells showed no effect on sumoylation of the p53 protein (Supplementary Data). In addition, our results indicate that the hZimp10-mediated enhancement of p53 activity may be at least partially Miz domain-independent because the strongest interaction was observed with a hZimp10 region containing only a portion of the Miz sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that both hZimp7 and hZimp10 enhance the transcriptional activity of several transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, the precise mechanism(s) for these Zimp proteins in transcriptional regulation still remains unclear. Our previous data showing that hZimp10 co-localizes with newly synthesized DNA at replication foci throughout S phase suggest that hZimp10 may play an important role in both chromatin assembly and maintenance of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Intriguingly, a homolog of human Zimp proteins, termed <italic>tonalli (tna)</italic>, has been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and was shown to genetically interact with SWI2/SNF2 and the Mediator complexes in complementation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In addition, we have shown previously that the C-terminal proline-rich domains of hZimp7 and 10 possess significant intrinsic transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and through these domains, the Zimp proteins can enhance transcription both in trans and in <italic>cis</italic>. The finding that hZimp10 augments p53-mediated transcription is consistent with our previous studies showing that hZimp10 functions as a transcriptional co-activator of the androgen receptor and Smad3/Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Interestingly, the C-terminal proline-rich region is not found in other PIAS or PIAS-like proteins, suggesting that the Miz domain family may consist of distinct groups of proteins that contain unique structures and play distinct roles in regulating transcription and other cellular processes. Therefore, it is conceivable that although hZimp10 and other PIAS proteins interact with p53 physically, they may regulate the function of p53 through different mechanisms. Indeed, this is in agreement with our results suggesting that the Miz domain is generally dispensable for the hZimp10&#x02013;p53 interaction while published reports suggest that the Miz domain is important for PIAS&#x02013;p53 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>hZimp7 and hZimp10 share significant sequence similarity, particularly within their C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Both proteins contain an intrinsic transactivation domain and function as transcriptional co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These two Zimp proteins show different tissue distribution profiles, which may suggest unique roles for these proteins in regulating different target genes. Our recent data showing that disruption of the Zimp10 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at approximately E10.5 suggest that hZimp7 and 10 are not functionally redundant. In this study, even though we observed that hZimp7 interacts with p53 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, it showed no interaction between the two intact proteins in immunoprecipitation assays (see Supplementary Data). In addition, we only observed a very weak effect of hZimp7 on p53-mediated transcription. These data suggest that hZimp7 and hZimp10 proteins, although structurally similar, likely play a different role in p53-mediated transcription.</p><p>In this study, we also assessed the interaction between hZimp10 and p53 in Zimp10 null cells. Using MEFs generated from Zimp10 knockout mice, we demonstrated that the disruption of <italic>Zimp10</italic> inhibits p53-mediated transcription. In MEFs with an intact wild-type <italic>Zimp10</italic> allele, a clear dose-dependent induction of p53 transcriptional activity was observed in cells transfected with increasing amounts of p53. In contrast, no enhancement was observed in cells where both <italic>Zimp10</italic> alleles were disrupted. This perhaps provides the most convincing evidence that Zimp10 can indeed regulate p53 activity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system. Further study using this <italic>in vivo</italic> system should help to elucidate the biological influence of Zimp10 on p53-mediated tumor repressive effects.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that hZimp10, a novel PIAS-like protein, augments the transcriptional activity of the p53 tumor suppressor. This interaction provides an additional line of evidence to demonstrate that Zimp10 is involved in transcriptional regulation. Further studies into the molecular mechanisms by which hZimp10 and other PIAS proteins regulate p53-mediated transcription may provide new insight into the biological role of PIAS and PIAS-like proteins in cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm476_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm476_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm476_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants CA070297, CA087767, DK061002 and 5T32 CA09302-27.
