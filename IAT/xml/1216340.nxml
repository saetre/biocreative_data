To better understand mechanisms that regulate transcription of <italic>CFTR</italic>, we examined transcription factors that specifically bind a <italic>CFTR</italic> CArG-like motif we have previously shown to modulate <italic>CFTR</italic> expression. Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the <italic>CFTR</italic> CArG-like motif binds serum response factor both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Transient co-transfections with various SRF expression vector, including dominant-negative forms and small interfering RNA, demonstrated that SRF significantly increases <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity in bronchial epithelial cells. Mutagenesis studies suggested that in addition to SRF other co-factors, such as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) previously shown to bind the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter, are potentially involved in the <italic>CFTR</italic> regulation. Here, we show that functional interplay between SRF and YY1 might provide interesting perspectives to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of the basal <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the identification of multiple CArG binding sites in highly conserved <italic>CFTR</italic> untranslated regions, which form specific SRF complexes, provides direct evidence for a considerable role of SRF in the <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional regulation into specialized epithelial lung cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<italic>CFTR</italic>) gene occurs in a subset of specialized cells of epithelial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and is tightly regulated both temporally and spatially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). However, no clear mechanism responsible for this regulation has yet been reported in part due to the complexity of the non-coding regions structure of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene.</p><p>Despite the absence of a TATA element, the transcription of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene may be initiated through several discrete start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), including those that are tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). An intact CCAAT consensus is also required for accurate transcript initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of <italic>CFTR</italic> transcription involve a weak cAMP response element (CRE) nucleotide consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) in tandem with a consensus inverted CCAAT element or Y box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In addition, <italic>CFTR</italic> transcription may be modulated by additional overlapping <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, including a polymorphic YY1 site, located in the human minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter activity may be enhanced by exogenous transfected NF-&#x003ba;B via its binding to the &#x02013;1103 &#x003ba;B element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). <italic>CFTR</italic> expression is also regulated through interactions with factors involved in remodeling of chromatin structure, such as CDP/<italic>cut</italic> and hGCN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Because none of these <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements confers tissue-specific control of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression, several studies focused on identifying potential regulatory elements that lie mainly outside the coding region. Extensive analyses of the chromatin structure identified multiple clusters of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), some of which contain tissue-specific enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Multiple binding sites for a tissue-specific transcription factor, called HNF1&#x003b1;, recently identified in various DHS core, modulate likewise <italic>CFTR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Despite extensive studies, the transcriptional regulatory networks of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression remain to be unraveled.</p><p>Our current model for the regulation of human <italic>CFTR</italic> expression proposes that multiple transcription factors interact with previously reported polymorphic and composite <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements encompassing a CArG-like motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The CArG box (CC(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG), originally defined as the core component of the serum response element (SRE), is found in the 5&#x02032; region of immediate early response genes, such as <italic>c-fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and in many muscle-specific gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). This DNA element binds serum response factor (SRF), highly regulated and interactive transcription factor, which is phylogenetically conserved and belongs to the MADS box family of proteins, with MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens and SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Although SRF is particularly enriched in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), it is also expressed in a variety of human cell lines from distinct tissue origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), and, to a lesser extent, in ectoderm-derived tissue such as gastric epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> SRF homolog is expressed in a subset of tracheal cells and regulates cytoplasmic outgrowth during terminal branching of the tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Hence, it has been suggested that SRF plays an essential role in the formation of the respiratory system. Moreover, it has been recently shown that SRF is involved in myofibroblast differentiation during lung damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors interacting with CArG-like motif, such as SRF, could be important in <italic>CFTR</italic> expression regulation. We provided evidence that SRF is expressed in bronchial epithelial cell expressing endogenous CFTR protein. Through the use of combined gel mobility shift&#x02013;chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we first demonstrated that SRF protein binds, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter region spanning the CArG-like motif. Mutagenic studies and transient co-transfections experiments showed that SRF alone is not sufficient to transactivate the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene. Upon some mutations of the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element, promoter activity is severely decreased, potentially implying YY1 as a co-repressor. Given the YY1 well-defined role in the transcriptional regulation of some SRE-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), we explored the putative role of YY1 on the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter activity and demonstrated functional interplay between this factor and SRF. Finally, by stringent <italic>in silico</italic> structural analysis, we identified additional multiple near consensus CArG sites within the highly conserved promoter and intronic regions of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene. We also documented the existence of SRF-containing protein complexes on numerous predicted <italic>CFTR</italic> CArG-like elements. Taken together, the data obtained classify <italic>CFTR</italic> as a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation, and open the gate to further investigate how SRF may be involved in the regulation of <italic>CFTR</italic> gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human bronchial epithelial cells, Beas2B and A549 expressing endogenous CFTR were kindly provided by Dr Marc Chanson, Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, Switzerland.

After a culturing period of 24 h, cells were transfected with PolyFect<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> transfection reagent (Qiagen Corporation, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For transient transfection, we used 1.8 &#x000b5;g of plasmid reporter and 0.2 &#x000b5;g of internal control pRL-SV40 containing <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Promega Corporation). The pGL3-Basic vector lacking both eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences was used as a negative control. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was evaluated with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Luminescence measurements were performed on a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (ThermoLabsystem Corporation, France). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity. All luciferase activities represent at least three independent experiments with each construct tested in triplicate per experiment. Luciferase activity data are expressed as the means &#x000b1; SD computed from the results obtained from each set of transfection experiments. To minimize the possibility of errors in DNA amplification, at least two independently constructed clones were tested. For co-transfection assays, unless otherwise indicated, 1.8 &#x000b5;gof luciferase reporter and 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;g of each expression vector were used. Transfection with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2.5 &#x000b5;g of siRNA. The cells were transfected with <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter plasmid reporter, and luciferase activity was determined as described above.

The membranes were then washed and incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody at 1:15&#x02009;000 in PBS-5% milk. The membranes were reacted with chemiluminescence reagent ECL (Roche Diagnostic) as described by the manufacturer and subsequently exposed to Biomax photographic film (Kodak Corporation).

The cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively, for 20 min durations at room temperature. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. The cells were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1:100 in PBS&#x02013;BSA. Antibodies used included, the clone L12B4 (Upstate biotechnology), an anti-CFTR antibody known to recognize human, rat, mouse and bovine CFTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and the H-300 or the A11 anti-SRF antibody (sc-13029 and sc-25290, Santa Cruz). The specificity of the anti-CFTR antibody has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and was also verified by using a CFTR-positive human Caco-2 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). For nuclear counterstaining, DAPI (sc-3598, Santa Cruz) was applied at a concentration of 1:5000.

Densitometric analysis was performed using computerized densitometry and ImageQuant<sup>TL</sup> v.3.0 software (Amersham Biosciences).

Because so far all described CArG-box elements were found in the regulatory regions of immediate early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) and in muscle-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), we confirmed our first binding site prediction by using two other algorithms, AliBaba (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alibaba2.com/"/>) and ConSite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clustalw.genome.ad.jp/"/>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element sequence (<bold>G</bold>C(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG) diverges slightly at the 5&#x02032; from the published SRF consensus sequence (<bold>C</bold>C(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). However, this divergence is similar to that observed in the smooth muscle-gamma-actin promoter which has been demonstrated to bind SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p><p>To assess the putative functional importance of <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like binding site, we used an orthogonal approach of deducing regulatory elements by considering orthologous <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter regions from several mammalian species representing the Primates, Artiodactylia and Lagomorpha orders. Comparison of human/species homologies was carried out using ClustalW multiple <italic>CFTR</italic> sequence alignments according to the numerous alignment parameters described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), we showed that the human minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter is remarkably conserved across the orders studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). We found that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element is conserved within all the Primates species studied and also within the pig while, within the sheep, cow and rabbit species, some substitutions occur in the middle of the CArG-like motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data are consistent with previous <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter phylogenetic work that identified two types of regulatory elements: some are conserved between species, such as a non-consensus CRE at positions &#x02013;0.1 kb relative to ATG and some are species-specific elements, such as a 300 bp purine.pyrimidine (Pu.Py) stretch that is present only in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bronchial epithelial expression of SRF</title><p>Because we could not previously identify SRF binding to the <italic>CFTR</italic> CArG-like element, even though an anti-SRF antibody had been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), we asked whether SRF, mainly described as highly expressed in muscle cells, was also present in epithelial cell lines. To measure the expression levels of <italic>SRF</italic> mRNAs, we used a RT&#x02013;PCR-based procedure previously described by Davis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). As reverse-transcribed control, the <italic>Hypoxanthine PhosphoRybosyl-Transferase</italic> (<italic>HPRT</italic>) housekeeping gene was amplified. Amplification of <italic>SRF</italic> from bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts yielded a fragment of the same size, 651 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as that of the full-length <italic>SRF</italic> transcript produced by RT&#x02013;PCR from human hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). The 453 bp band corresponding to <italic>SRF</italic> lacking exon 5 (SRF&#x00394;5) was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To ensure that these bands were not the result of a PCR artifact or genomic contamination of samples, negative controls such as exclusion of RT or RNA during cDNA synthesis were included in each assay. As expected, no PCR product appeared when either RT or the template was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Densitometric analysis revealed that bronchial epithelial cells contained an appreciable amount of <italic>SRF</italic> mRNA. Nuclear extracts from A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells were electrophoresed and then assayed by western blotting with anti-SRF antibody reported to recognize all four isoforms of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, we found that robust expression of a 67 kDa band, that based on molecular mass, corresponds to full-length SRF (SRF-FL) in all of the cell lines examined. Consistent wit RT&#x02013;PCR analysis, a 57 kDa band corresponding to SRF&#x00394;5 was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line. As a control, we checked the &#x003b2;-actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Densitometric analysis of western blot revealed no apparent difference in the expression level of SRF proteins between the myoblasts and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In subsequent western blot analyses in which parallel blots were probed with only the secondary antibody, no band was detected (data not shown), thus confirming that these bands are indeed specific for SRF. As further evidence, A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells express relatively large amounts of SRF, the cell lines were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling. A similar staining pattern was noted in the bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, rows A&#x02013;C). The nuclei have been stained blue with DAPI. As negative control, no staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, row D). Consistent with other studies reporting that SRF is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>), our SRF expression studies demonstrated that human SRF gene is expressed in bronchial epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SRF binds the CFTR-CArG-like element</title><p>Because the CArG box is not only found in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes but also located at the center of other SREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) and forms the core binding site for SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), we have attempted to determine whether or not SRF binds to the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element sequence. We performed two series of bandshift experiments. First, we incubated the <sup>32</sup>P-labelLed WT oligonucleotide corresponding to <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element sequence (as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) with bacterially expressed SRF. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (lane 3), EMSA revealed a recombinant SRF&#x02013;WT duplex. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (lane 5), bands defined as the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared when 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor containing the consensus SRE motif, derived from human <italic>c-fos</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), was added. In contrast, competition by an irrelevant oligonucleotide (noted UC) did not appear to significantly alter the complex suggesting specificity of binding (lane 6). To confirm precisely the identity of protein binding in the minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter (from &#x02013;121 to &#x02013;83 bp), bacterially expressed SRF was preincubated with anti-SRF antibody before incubation with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (lane 4), bands corresponding to <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared, and more slowly migrating bands appeared when anti-SRF antibody was added. To verify the antibody specificity, control experiments were performed either in the absence of the SRF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 7) or in the presence of an irrelevant antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 8). These results demonstrate that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element is a bona fide SRF-binding site. Second, we performed additional EMSA with the WT oligonucleotide, as main binding target, and nuclear extracts from both epithelial and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). While three nucleoprotein complexes were formed from nuclear extracts of Beas2B and C2C12 cells on the WT probe, five complexes were detected from A549 cells. Each nuclear protein complex was designated by an upper case relative to nuclear lysate followed by a Roman numeral indicating its position into the gels. The binding specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition analyses with both specific and non-specific unlabeled oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Although a few non-specific binding activities were observed, complexes BII, BIII, AIII, AV, CI, CII and CIII were efficiently competed with an excess of both WT and <italic>c-fos</italic> SRE unlabeled specific competitors indicating binding specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Control experiments including an irrelevant oligonucleotide did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 4). To evaluate whether the SRF protein contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the CFTR-derived SRF site, we used a specific antibody against the SRF protein. Although the incubation with the anti-SRF antibody apparently failed to give any discrete supershift from various sources of nuclear proteins, a significant decrease of specific complexes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 6). This effect seemed to be specific because none of these nuclear protein complexes was supershifted or abolished when a non-specific antibody was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 7). Control experiments containing only the anti-SRF antiserum and the radiolabeled WT oligonucleotide did not reveal any binding activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 8). In addition, supershift assays performed with the radiolabeled <italic>c-fos</italic> SRE oligonucleotide instead of the WT probe showed that bands corresponding to SRE&#x02013;SRF complex disappeared and more slowly migrating bands appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 10). The absence of supershift for specific WT binding complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 6) may be explained if the epitope recognized by the anti-SRF antibody is part of (or located near) the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like DNA-binding site. Antibody binding would compete DNA binding, resulting in a significant decrease or total disappearance of CArG-like complexes rather than in supershifted complexes. Alternatively, if the interaction between the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like DNA-binding site and the SRF protein is insufficiently strong, it could be not as stable as the one observed with the SRE probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 10) to be detected as a supershift in gel retardation assays. On the one hand, other DNA-binding proteins that are potentially part of this complex could interfere with the antibody's access to SRF protein. Taken together, these EMSA studies establish SRF-binding CArG-like box within the minimal promoter of the human <italic>CFTR</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>SRF binds the CArG-like motif of the <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter within intact chromatin under physiological conditions</title><p>Although there is extensive evidence that SRF can bind to CArG-like elements in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and that it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CArG elements in reporter assays in cultured cells with a typical epithelioid morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>), there is a lack of direct evidence for involvement of SRF in transcription of the endogenous <italic>CFTR</italic> gene within the context of intact chromatin. To directly address whether SRF also binds <italic>in vivo</italic>, ChIP was carried out in bronchial epithelial cells. For this purpose, DNA-binding proteins of Beas2B epithelial cells were covalently linked to genomic DNA by treatment of the cells with formaldehyde. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with either specific or irrelevant antibodies, anti-SRF and anti-HA, respectively. The precipitated chromatin DNA was then purified and amplified by PCR with specific primers of the target sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The promoter of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene, which lacks CArG elements, was used as negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, row A). The skeletal <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> promoter sequence, which contains at least a consensus SRF-binding site, was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, row B). As expected, PCR signals were obtained when the DNA/protein adducts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-SRF antibody from both Beas2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, rows B and C, lane 1) and A549 (data not shown) epithelial cell lines. In contrast, the negative controls, in which immunoprecipitation was performed with an irrelevant antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, rows A&#x02013;C, lane 3) or without antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, rows A&#x02013;C, lane 2), did not show any PCR signal. These results were reproduced in several independently isolated ChIP populations. These data show that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like binding site identified within the <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter binds SRF <italic>in vivo</italic>, in bronchial cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>The human minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter shows activity in both epithelial and muscular cells</title><p>As the SRF transcription factor is thought to mainly mediate the tissue-specific transcription in muscular cells, we first assessed the activity of the minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter in both epithelial and muscular cell types. We therefore addressed the ability of the WT-pGL3 construct, previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) to drive the expression in Beas2B, A549 and C2C12 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, an efficient transcription of the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter could be readily observed in all three cell lines compared with monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7), which are negative for CFTR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Surprisingly, the activity of the minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter in C2C12 cells was 4 to 5.5 times higher than that observed in Beas2B and A549 cells, respectively. Although the expression of the CFTR protein was previously evidenced in some muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>), it has never been investigated in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Therefore, we investigated the CFTR expression at both mRNA and protein levels. To examine <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA expression in mouse myoblasts (C2C12), total RNA isolated from epithelial and non-epithelial cells was analyzed via RT&#x02013;PCR with <italic>CFTR</italic>-specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, while no PCR product for <italic>CFTR</italic> was seen with COS-7 cells, the expected <italic>CFTR</italic> amplified product was obtained for both epithelial (A549 and Beas2B) and muscular (C2C12) cell lines. No product was detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase or RNA (noted No RT or No RNA, respectively). Although the <italic>HPRT</italic> PCR control showed non-equivalent amounts of cDNA used in the different PCRs, densitometric analysis revealed that C2C12 cells contained an appreciable amount of <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA. Further determination of CFTR expression in C2C12 myoblasts was conducted by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Caco-2 cells were used as positive control and COS-7 as negative control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, while mature fully glycosylated band C CFTR was observed in A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells, the core glycosylated band B CFTR occurred at the same molecular mass only in a subset of cell lines, indicative of potential variations in glycosylation process. To rule out the possibility of antibodies cross-reactivity or non-specific labeling, indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed with another anti-CFTR antibody, L12B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, the Caco-2 cell line used as a positive control showed strong immunoreactivity for CFTR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, row D). In contrast, and as expected, COS-7 cells used as negative control did not stain with this anti-CFTR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, row E). No staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, row F). The comparison of immunofluorescence images between epithelial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, row A, B and <italic>D</italic>) and muscular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, row C) cells provides evidence that CFTR is significantly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts. However, because the indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed in permeabilized cells, they do not distinguish between CFTR that is located in the apical membrane and CFTR that is located in a vesicular pool just beneath the apical membrane. These findings, together with the transcriptional activities presented above, suggest that the minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter might contain tissue-specific enhancer(s) as well as repressive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that have the ability to mitigate the activity of the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter between epithelial and non-epithelial lineages. Because CF affects mainly epithelial tissues and Beas2B consistently yielded higher enhancer activity than A549, we restricted subsequent studies to this bronchial epithelial cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of SRF on the proximal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter</title><p>To assess whether SRF protein might affect <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional regulation, we took two related approaches. First, we co-transfected either exogenous full-length SRF or truncated SRF mutants with the wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter. Second, we utilized a siRNA approach to ask whether a reduction in endogenous SRF levels could affect basal <italic>CFTR</italic> activation. Luciferase assays were carried out in Beas2B cells using the indicated SRF expression vectors and the WT-pGL3luciferase reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panel). The 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter gene was used as positive control because its transcriptional activity is highly dependent on SRF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel). As expected, while this synthetic promoter containing several consensus SREs was markedly and significantly activated (&#x0003e;2-fold) by forced expression of full-length SRF protein (pHiv-SRF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel), truncated SRF mutants either containing only the amino acids 133&#x02013;264 corresponding to DNA-binding domain of SRF (pHiv-DBD-SRF), or deleted of amino acids 153&#x02013;165, an essential part for the DNA binding (pHiv-DN-SRF) induced modest but significant decrease of SRE activity (&#x0223c;10% and &#x0223c;30%, respectively). When these SRF expression vectors were transiently co-transfected with the WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct, the <italic>trans</italic>-activator effect of SRF was notably reduced. Indeed, overexpression of full-length and dominant-negative (pHiv-DN-SRF) SRF proteins resulted in &#x0223c;50% increased and &#x0223c;30% decreased of luciferase activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panel). Unexpectedly and inconsistent with previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), the pHiv-DBD-SRF construct induced &#x0223c;40% increase of the WT-pGL3 luciferase activity. This results disparity may be explained by the fact that the c-fos promoter study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>) assessed the DBD&#x02013;SRF domain activity via microinjection of corresponding truncated SRF polypeptide. Perhaps, the best explanation for this increased activity is that the DNA-binding domain of SRF, also called MADS box, is sufficient for transcriptional activation of some SRF-dependent genes because it mediates interactions with accessory co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). These results suggest that neither of the regions outside the MADS box, N- or C-terminal, appear essential for transactivation of the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter by SRF.</p><p>To further establish the role of SRF in mediating the increase in <italic>CFTR</italic> gene transcription, we performed siRNA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To demonstrate the efficacy of specific SRF siRNA construct, Beas2B cells were co-transfected with either control or SRF siRNA plasmids and western blots were performed to analyze levels of SRF in these cells. Densitometric analysis of western blot showed that endogenous SRF levels were strongly reduced in the presence of the SRF siRNA plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left panel). Then, control and SRF siRNA plasmids were co-transfected into Beas2B cells with either the WT-pGL3 or the 3XSRE luciferase reporter construct. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> (right panel), reduction of endogenous SRF protein level decreased the activity of both wild-type <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter and 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter constructs by &#x0223c;25%.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that endogenous SRF into bronchial epithelial cells normally function as transcriptional coactivator for the CArG-mediated transactivation. However, we found that SRF activated the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter less well than the SRE-containing synthetic promoter, suggesting that the CArG-like element mediated <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activation probably required other bridging or co-activating factors.</p></sec><sec><title>The CArG-like element contained in the human minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter is important but not sufficient for basal transcriptional activity in Beas2B cells</title><p>To assess the transcriptional relevance of the CArG-like binding sequence of <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter, mutants were performed to create either more consensus CArG element or degenerated motif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We used the D upper-case and the C upper-case to designate the Degenerated CArG motifs and the Consensus CArG elements, respectively. To ensure the efficacy of mutations in abrogating transcription factor binding, we first performed a series of EMSA experiments with each CArG mutant and the WT probe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). As expected, based on the sequence analysis, the mutations resulting in more degenerated CArG motifs (D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutants) completely abolished SRF-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), when we compared with SRF-WT complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 5). In addition, the probes containing more consensus CArG boxes (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 mutants) bound SRF more strongly in nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;10). Inclusion of an anti-SRF antibody partially abolished SRF-binding activity and resulted in a slower mobility band, confirming the identity of the binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 11). Then, minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter constructs bearing the same consensus and disrupted CArG boxes were tested in a transient transfection assays in Beas2B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Compared with luciferase activity resulting from the WT-pGL3 construct, variable increases in reporter activity are observed when D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutant constructs, with disrupted CArG motif, were transiently transfected. On the other hand, mutations that create more consensus CArG element result in either reducing or increasing in the transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with the preceding gel-shift results revealing an uncharacterized protein/DNA complex with slightly slower mobility and variable intensity compared with the SRF&#x02013;DNA complex, these finer mutagenesis studies suggest that both co-activators and co-repressors might interact with the studied promoter sequences. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element alone is not sufficient to confer basal transcriptional activation of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through competition for the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like binding</title><p>As a further means of establishing the role for SRF-binding CArG boxes in mediating either the <italic>CFTR</italic>-enhancer or silencer activity observed with the different minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter mutants, we performed additional computational analyses. Sequence analysis of CArG boxes and their immediate flanking sequences showed that C1, C3 and C4 constructs contain consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors, in addition to SRF, including the transcription factor YY1. These findings with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) have particularly evoked our interest to examine the role of YY1 in SRF-mediated <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity.</p><p>In a first set of experiments, we evaluated whether the YY1 factor contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the WT, C1, C3 and C4 radiolabeled probes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, incubation with specific anti-YY1 antibody resulted in either a significant decrease or total disappearance of some complexes normally formed between the CArG boxes and a component of Beas2B nuclear extracts, establishing DNA binding between YY1 and the sequences tested. As expected, control experiment performed with radiolabeled probe, D2, devoid of any YY1 binding site and the anti-YY1 antiserum did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles indicating specificity of the YY1 binding. Thus, these EMSAs demonstrated that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like (WT probe) and more consensus CArG elements (C1 &#x0003c; C3 &#x0003c; C4) served as binding site for at least two distinct nuclear factors, namely SRF and YY1 from bronchial epithelial cells.</p><p>Then, to determine whether the interaction of these two factors with their target DNA (<italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like or more consensus CArG sequence) was either mutually inclusive or exclusive, EMSAs were conducted using bacterially expressed SRF and nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B cells transfected with a YY1 expression vector as a source of YY1 DNA-binding activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, the YY1-binding complex was significantly reduced by increasing SRF binding activity, suggesting their mutually exclusive binding to CArG sites.</p><p>Consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>), these EMSAs results suggested as a working hypothesis that both SRF and YY1 likely act as functional competitors in the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter activity. Since the minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter is activated by SRF and knowing from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) that YY1 negatively regulates some promoter containing CArG elements, it seemed logical to first assess whether YY1 could also repress the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter. We asked whether CArG-like-binding site in the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter acted as negative regulatory elements. Several <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter reporter constructs containing either CArG-like (namely, WT) or consensus CArG element (C1, C3 and C4) were co-transfected with SRF and/or YY1 expression vectors into Beas2B cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, while co-transfections with SRF alone resulted in 1.5- to 2-fold luciferase activation, forced expression of YY1 protein caused a strong decrease in reporter activities (&#x0223c;50&#x02013;75% of the control luciferase value). Therefore, we wanted to determine the functional relationship of both factors in the <italic>CFTR</italic> activity regulation. Transient co-transfections analysis of combination of protein expression vectors showed that over-expression of SRF either did not restore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, panel with the WT and C4 reporter constructs) or only very slightly raised the YY1-repressed reporter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, panel with the C1 and C3 reporter constructs). These findings are consistent with results obtained from co-transfections performed with the YY1 expression vector alone and previous alpha-actin promoter studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), in which YY1 acted as a strong repressor. Taken together, these data suggested functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through DNA-binding competition.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of multiple CArG binding sites in the non-coding regions of the human <italic>CFTR</italic> gene and assessment of their putative functional importance</title><p>To assess the putative importance of CArG motifs in the human <italic>CFTR</italic> expression regulation, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> inspection of additional sequences upstream of the minimal promoter and in the intronic regions. Four CArG binding sites were found in the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter regions, and seven in the intronic regions. The distribution and the positions of these putative binding sites for SRF are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. Then, to confirm the computational predictions, we used several approaches. First, the nucleotide regions harboring these predicted <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements were analyzed for conservation in the cow, as physiologically relevant transcription factor binding sites are frequently conserved in the non-coding regions of orthologous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Second, the SRF-binding sites were tested by EMSAs and also for one of them by ChIP.</p><p>We showed that all the predicted CArG elements occur in highly conserved <italic>CFTR</italic> non-coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), which may contain tissue-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). We provided evidence that the majority of <italic>in silico</italic> predicted CArG motifs form specific DNA&#x02013;protein complexes with bacterially expressed SRF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, left panel). We also demonstrated by using Beas2B nuclear extracts and supershift assays that some of these CArG elements bound <italic>in vitro</italic> SRF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, right panel, lanes 1, 3, 7 and 9). Finally, additional ChIP experiments indicated that the only tested CArG element, located at &#x02013;2373 bp in the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter, bound SRF in chromatin from intact cultured Beas2B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, lane 1). Collectively, these findings support the concept that SRF may play a key role in the <italic>CFTR</italic> expression regulation via binding to multiple <italic>CFTR</italic> CArG elements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>While great strides have been made in CFTR research with emphasis on the structure and function of this protein, only incremental advances have been achieved in the field of transcriptional regulation. In our previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), we have identified a polymorphic CArG-like site and showed that a naturally occurring sequence variation in this motif may enhance the basal <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity. The goal of the present study was to better characterize the human <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter region encompassing the CArG-like element.</p><p>Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of this <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter region in eight mammalian species representing three different orders (Primates, Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha) revealed high levels of conservation of the minimal promoter region, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). However, the CArG-like element (<bold>G</bold>C(T/A)<sub>6</sub>GG), which does not conform to the authentic CArG box (CC(T/A)<sub>6</sub>GG), is absent from three species (sheep, cow and rabbit). Even though this motif occurs in only a subset of the input sequences, it does not necessarily mean that it is of no functional importance. Instances of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements being species-specific have been already reported for the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). More generally, it is well known that some transcription factors can tolerate more than one type of nucleotide at a given position of the binding site. Instances of substitutions in both the central core of the CArG element and the highly conserved contact points for SRF, at the terminal ends, not impairing SRF binding have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). Taken together, these data support the notion that the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element has possible important implication in the <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Interestingly, analysis of SRF expression has revealed relatively high expression levels of SRF protein in the bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as shown in other differentiated epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Accumulating evidence supports the concept that SRF could contribute to the <italic>CFTR</italic> expression regulation. In addition to regulating growth-responsive genes and numerous muscle-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>), SRF is also described as a key <italic>trans</italic>-binding factor in various important physiological events. For example, SRF has been shown to regulate pulmonary development in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), to promote both re-epithelialization and muscular structure restoration during gastric ulcer healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>) and more recently to be involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-targeted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). Therefore, it was relevant to examine the potential role of SRF on the <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like element forms specific DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that include SRF protein as part of the complex, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We have investigated the expression driven by the proximal human <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter in a pGL3 construct in both epithelial and myoblasts lines. Results of our transient transfections of 3XSRE-fos TATA and WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter genes showed that the human minimal <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter encompassing a CArG-like motif was sufficient to drive the expression in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with other studies showing <italic>CFTR</italic> expression in smooth muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>), our results demonstrated that the human <italic>CFTR</italic> minimal promoter had the ability to drive the expression in muscle lineages. Our transient co-transfections analyses performed with full-length and dominant-negative SRF forms expression vectors, and also specific SRF siRNA constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panels B and C) provide the first evidence for a positive role of the SRF protein in the regulation of the human <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter. However, the SRF-induced <italic>CFTR</italic> transactivation, though significant, is relatively modest. These data with the results of finer mutagenesis studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> support the concept that SRF alone is not sufficient to drive the basal expression of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene. As suggested by other previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>), it is likely that additional factors might be required to optimally drive the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter, as well as to specify the cell-type-restricted expression. Since YY1 was previously shown to bind the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and a subset of SREs serve as binding sites for YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), we first evaluated this candidate in the SRF-mediated <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activity. The data analysis suggests a functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through binding competition for the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like box. However, the analysis of combinatorial co-transfection studies, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, suggests that the functional interplay between SRF and YY1, alone, is not sufficient to account for basal <italic>CFTR</italic> transcriptional activation. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether another player might be involved in this functional interplay and accounted for the basal transcriptional <italic>CFTR</italic> activity observed in the Beas2B bronchial epithelial cells.</p><p>Interestingly, we showed that, in addition to the CArG-like element defined in the minimal promoter of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene, there are three CArG motifs located at the 5&#x02032; end of the gene and seven are present in the intronic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We also evidenced SRF binding to CArG elements of the endogenous <italic>CFTR</italic> gene in the context of intact chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>). Although the role of these more distal CArG boxes has yet to be assessed, these findings are of major importance, since it has been shown that optimal activity of the SRF-dependent target genes may require a number of CArG boxes, including those that are defined in the intronic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). Moreover, as already suggested for the &#x003b1;-actin promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>), perhaps the presence multiple CArG elements in the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene with cooperative binding events might be essential for SRF to prevent YY1 from binding to the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter. Clearly, further studies are needed to directly investigate the role of these multiple CArG elements in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the human <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter is a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation partially due to functional antagonism between YY1 and SRF through mutually exclusive DNA-binding activities of YY1 versus SRF to the <italic>CFTR</italic>-CArG-like site.</p><p>A critical question is, thus, how might SRF contribute to orchestrating cell-restricted and context-dependent programs of <italic>CFTR</italic> gene expression? Our findings and investigations to date clearly indicate the presence of several different underlying mechanisms of SRF-dependent transcriptional activation, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. These might include association of SRF with a variety of cell-restricted co-factors (noted in gray bubbles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), such as MRTF-A highly expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, colon and testis, and MRTF-B also expressed in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>), ternary complex factors, such as p62 and SAP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>) and remodeling chromatin co-factors in an HAT-dependent manner, such as the CREB-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>). In addition, it is well known that binding of SRF to the CArG box induces an acute bend in the DNA and that this bending may vary with changing base compositions across the CArG box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>). Such bending can probably facilitate interactions with other proteins already involved in the <italic>CFTR</italic> expression regulation, such as NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and C/EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and described as interacting with SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref>). Finally, the Ras-related GTPases family (rac, RhoA and cdc42) might have a critical role in the activation of SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref>). Indeed, it is reported that RhoA-induced SRF activation occurs through a phenomenon of &#x02018;actin treadmilling&#x02019; restricted to CArG-dependent genes that do not have adjacent ETS-binding sites (e.g. smooth muscle cell restricted CArG genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">84</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of SRF may be mediated by the NF-&#x003ba;B and C/EBP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref>).</p><p>These data provide the foundation for further studies on the regulation of <italic>CFTR</italic> and will unable the rational design of further functional studies, including various strategies aiming to further dissect the different regulation pathways.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by grants from both French associations: Vaincre La Mucoviscidose (VLM) and Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM).
