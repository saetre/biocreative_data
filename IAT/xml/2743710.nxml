It originates from primitive mesenchymal cells committed to myogenic differentiation. RMS belongs to the broader category of small blue round cell tumors of childhood and histologically resembles normal foetal skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It can be classified into two main histological subtypes with distinct appearances and clinical behaviours. The rarer alveolar type (ARMS) arises mainly in the extremities and trunk. It is also associated with worse prognosis and higher disease stage at diagnosis. The unfavourable prognosis is related to the propensity for early and wide dissemination, often involving the lungs, bone marrow and bones and poor response to chemotherapy. In contrast, the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) usually affects younger children, at more favourable sites, and shows a less aggressive clinical behaviour than ARMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The frequent tumor dissemination and metastasis characteristics of ARMS, less common in ERMS, suggest a different expression of molecules involved in these events between the two subtypes. An important process in host tissue invasion is the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation due to secreted and cell surface bound protease and glycosidase activities. These ECM-remodelling enzymes affect and modify cell and tissue functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The ECM is composed of a complex network of macromolecules which fills the extracellular space in tissues and provides an essential physical barrier among cells, as well as a molecular scaffold for cell growth, migration, differentiation and survival. It also undergoes continuous remodelling during development and in a variety of pathological conditions such as cancer. While intensive research focused on enzymes capable of degrading protein components in the ECM has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], presently attention is directed towards enzymes (e.g., heparanase) cleaving glycosaminoglycan side chains. The heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), the main polysaccharide component of the ECM, are ubiquitous macromolecules associated with the cell surface and the ECM of a wide range of cells in vertebrate and invertebrate tissues. Heparan sulphate (HS) plays a key role in the self-assembly and integrity of the ECM. In fact, HS chains can bind large number of proteins and several bioactive molecules like growth factors, chemokines, cytokines and enzymes to the cell surface and ECM, thereby regulating their availability and function in the control of some physiological processes, such as cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Malignant tumor growth, neo-vascularization and metastasis represent pathological invasive phenomena that involve the enzymatic degradation of the ECM. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-&#x003b2;-D-glucuronidase that cleaves HS side chains of HSPGs. Heparanase cleavage of HS in the ECM, particularly in epithelial and sub-endothelial basement membranes, is a critical step in cancer development and progression in correlation with metastatic potential, tumor vascularity and reduced survival of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Its activity is regulated by gene expression and pro-enzyme activation. In fact heparanase is synthesized as a 65 kDa inactive precursor whose activation involves proteolytic cleavage, resulting in 8 and 50 kDa protein subunits that heterodimerize to form the active enzyme. Remarkably, the active form of heparanase is secreted in the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that this enzyme is upregulated in an increasing number of primary human tumors providing a strong clinical support for its pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], thus making it a promising target for the development of anti-cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to frequent cancers occurring in adults, little information is available on RMS with regard to molecules involved in tumor invasion. We analyzed HPSE expression and activity in ARMS and ERMS cell lines and investigated the relationships of the different metastatic phenotype of ARMS and ERMS with expression and activity of heparanase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) cell lines RH30, RH4, RH18, RH28 and human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) cell lines RD, SMS-CTR, RH36, CCA were grown in RPMI (EuroClone, Pavia, Italy) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, both HPSE isoforms were detected in all cell lines under investigation. In particular, ARMS cell lines displayed two different patterns: RH30 and RH4 cell lines were characterized by high levels of the active isoform and low levels of the inactive one, whereas RH18 and RH28 showed a low expression of the active enzyme. Similarly, all ERMS cell lines displayed low levels of active HPSE isoform.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Heparanase expression in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines</bold>.

The rarer ARMS is more aggressive and associated with a significantly worse outcome than ERMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The more frequent tumor dissemination and metastatic characteristic of ARMS, compared to ERMS, suggest that different enzymatic activities may be involved in host tissue invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whereas upregulation of heparanase is well documented in an increasing number of human solid tumors showing a correlation with their invasive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], its role has not been elucidated in RMS thus far.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we investigated HPSE expression and activity in RMS cell lines in order to establish whether any correlation between HPSE levels and histotype exists.</p><p>HPSE protein may be present both in the active/inactive form. Only the active one (50 kDa) is responsible for HS degradation in the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since <italic>HPSE </italic>mRNA expression results similar in all RMS cell lines analyzed, we performed a Western blot analysis to discriminate between the two isoforms.</p><p>All RMS cell lines showed the expression of HPSE protein. All ERMS cell lines along with RH18 and RH28 showed a similar and moderate expression of active HPSE isoforms and high levels of inactive HPSE isoforms. On the other hand, RH30 and RH4 cell lines were characterized by high levels of active HPSE and moderate expression of the inactive one. It was interesting that the total amount of HPSE protein, the active plus the inactive isoforms, was comparable in all RMS cell lines.</p><p>Furthermore, we evaluated HPSE activity by an ELISA assay on serum-free conditioned media from RMS cell lines. This assay confirmed a heterogeneous HPSE activity among RMS cell lines without a clear-cut difference between ARMS and ERMS cell lines.</p><p>The difference between active and inactive heparanase isoforms in RMS cell lines lysates and the discrepancy between the cytoplasmic amount of the enzyme and its activity in conditioned media could be explained in light of HPSE complex protein activation and secretion. In fact, heparanase is synthesized as a 65 kDa inactive precursor, shuttled to the Golgi apparatus and then secreted via vesicles. Once secreted, heparanase interacts with HSPGs forming a complex which is endocytosed. Conversion of endosome in lysosome results in HPSE cleavage, yielding 8 and 50 kDa protein subunit that heteodimerize to form the active enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, heparanase active heterodimer can get secreted in response to local or systemic cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In order to determine the HPSE role in the ECM degradation associated with the different invasive potential in alveolar and embryonal histotypes, we stably silenced one cell line from each histotype by shRNA technique. Based on the ELISA assay results, we selected ARMS RH30 and ERMS RD cell lines characterized by the highest HPSE activity in the conditioned media. After puromycin selection, clones appearing to be silenced more than 50% were chosen from both cell lines. Using a Matrigel-invasion assay, we demonstrated that <italic>HPSE </italic>silencing significantly reduced the invasive potential of RH30 and RD cell lines compared with the untreated cells. Although previous experiments demonstrated a relevant role of other ECM degrading enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], <italic>HPSE </italic>silencing emphasizes the importance of this enzyme both in alveolar and embryonal RMS invasiveness. Because Zcharia E. <italic>et al</italic>. have recently demonstrated in a knock-out mouse model that absence of <italic>HPSE </italic>expression was associated with an increased expression of <italic>MMPs </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we determined the effects of <italic>HPSE </italic>silencing in RH30 and RD cell lines by analyzing the expression of <italic>MMP2</italic>, <italic>MMP9 </italic>and <italic>MMP14</italic>. In our cellular model we did not observe the same phenomenon since <italic>HPSE </italic>silencing did not result in significant differences of <italic>MMPs </italic>expression in silenced vs. wild type cells. In addition, after <italic>HPSE </italic>silencing, no change in cell proliferation was observed by MTT analysis.</p><p>It has recently been observed that elevated HPSE levels in patients' blood correlates with a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For this reason we analyzed by an ELISA assay HPSE activity in plasma samples from RMS patients and healthy subjects. RMS patients showed a statistically significant higher heparanase activity with respect to healthy individuals. Coherently, a significantly higher expression of <italic>HPSE </italic>transcripts was assessed in biopsies from RMS patients compared to foetal skeletal muscle tissue used as normal counterpart of the tumor.</p><p>Although high HPSE plasma levels have been previously reported in other paediatric malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], this is the first demonstration of a significantly high HPSE expression in RMS patients. Additionally, although it should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of patients, there is some suggestion of higher HPSE plasma levels in ARMS compared with ERMS patients. Further clinical and histo-pathological analyses on larger cohorts of RMS patients are necessary to establish whether HPSE may be considered as a novel marker able to distinguish the more aggressive ARMS from ERMS. Since a single functional heparanase has been identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the relevant effect of the specific gene knockdown described here should encourage the development of novel heparanase-targeting therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting RMS invasive potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we detected for the first time HPSE expression and activity in RMS and showed its implication in tumor cell invasiveness <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also demonstrated a significantly high HPSE expression in RMS patients with a trend to higher levels in ARMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VM carried out immuno-blotting analysis, ELISA assays and HPSE silencing of RMS cell lines; CM and ET carried out qRT-PCR, cell transfections and invasion-assay.
