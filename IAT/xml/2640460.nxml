A functional or physical connection between these &#x003b2;-catenin pools has been suggested in previous studies, but not conclusively demonstrated to date. To further examine this intersection, we treated A431 cell colonies with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which forces rapid and synchronized dissociation of AJ. A combination of immunostaining, time-lapse microscopy using photoactivatable-GFP-tagged &#x003b2;-catenin, and image analyses indicate that the cadherin-bound pool of &#x003b2;-catenin, internalized together with E-cadherin, accumulates at the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) upon AJ dissociation, and can be translocated into the cell nucleus upon Wnt pathway activation. These results suggest that the ERC may be a site of residence for &#x003b2;-catenin destined to enter the nucleus, and that dissociation of AJ may influence &#x003b2;-catenin levels in the ERC, effectively affecting &#x003b2;-catenin substrate levels available downstream for the Wnt pathway. This intersection provides a mechanism for integrating cell-cell adhesion with Wnt signaling and could be critical in developmental and cancer processes that rely on &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenesis and integrity of tissues requires interactions between neighboring cells and properly coordinated regulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-BenZeev1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a recent review, Nelson and Nusse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Nelson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> elegantly summarized the issue by asking a direct question: &#x0201c;Can the cadherin-bound pool of &#x003b2;-catenin be released and made available for signaling?&#x0201d; Here, we report experimental evidence that this is indeed the case.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Perinuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin and E-cadherin following fast dissociation of AJ</title><p>Colonies of the A431 squamous carcinoma cell line are rapidly dissociated by exposure to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Jourquin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. To confirm this in our system and further focus on &#x000df;-catenin localization during this process, we pretreated A431 cells with LPA (or PBS for control) for various periods of time, immunostained cells for &#x000df;-catenin, and captured high magnification images with confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g001">Figure 1</xref>). After a single application of LPA to cells at the initial time point (0 min), AJ began to disintegrate between 30&#x02013;90 min, and full colony dispersal was observed between 6&#x02013;12 h. However, after 12 h, cells began to reconstruct AJ formations, a task almost completed after 24 h. In dissociating cells, dense &#x003b2;-catenin immunostaining can be observed in a perinuclear compartment residing at one side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g001">Figure 1; arrows</xref>). This apparent accumulation of internalized &#x003b2;-catenin in the perinuclear compartment lasted up to 6 h, and declined as cells migrated out of colonies (12 h) or rebuilt AJ (24 h). In contrast, PBS-treated cell colonies showed no change in AJ formation, nor accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin at any time (6 h only shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to &#x003b2;-catenin, AJ components E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin were also disorganized by LPA treatment, as expected in disintegrating AJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004580.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, these shorter treatments with LiCl still caused nuclear translocation of ERC-resident &#x003b2;-catenin in LPA-treated cells, more so at 30 min than 10 min. These results further support the idea that Wnt activation acts on AJ dissociated &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>To confirm that, in these experiments, ERC-resident &#x003b2;-catenin was translocated inside the nucleus, we reconstructed its physical location by confocal microscopy generated z-stack analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows a lateral view of an immunostained representative cell captured from each treatment (PBS, LPA, or LPA&#x0002b;LiCl).

However, when both LiCl and LPA were added, colocalization instead occurred in the central nuclear region of cells (solid arrow). AJ &#x003b2;-catenin expression (arrow) is obviously reduced in both cases. These results confirm that AJ associated &#x003b2;-catenin was translocated into the nucleus given co-stimulation with LPA (for dissociation of AJ) and LiCl (for GSK-3&#x000df; inhibition).</p><p>To further confirm the microscopy results with an independent approach, we lysed cells and performed cytosol/nuclear fractionation followed by western blotting with antibodies specific for &#x003b2;-catenin or PCNA, a nuclear antigen. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, co-stimulation with LPA and LiCl increased the &#x003b2;-catenin level in the nuclear fraction (normalized by PCNA band intensity) by 2.4 fold (compared to&#x02212;/&#x02212;band), while LPA or LiCl alone induced almost no change or a 1.4 fold-increase, respectively.

These experimental reports are generally centered around the idea that the balance between AJ and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin is regulated biochemically, and that adhesion and transcription functions of &#x003b2;-catenin are relatively independent and coordinated by differential allotment of available &#x003b2;-catenin to the two functionally distinct pools.</p><p>In contrast, our present study points to an additional, more direct mechanism of coordination that links adhesion and transcription function of &#x003b2;-catenin in a more straight-forward manner, which suggests functional integration between adhesion and Wnt-dependent differentiation. Of course, since multiple mechanisms may control pool distribution of &#x003b2;-catenin, studies are warranted to determine how these mechanisms may interface with each other.

Since ERC is a common compartment used for recycling after endocytosis and has a longer lifetime than other vesicular structures, these reports, though not conclusive, are consistent with &#x003b2;-catenin reaching the ERC, where it may intersect Wnt signaling.</p><p>Interestingly, clathrin-dependent endocytic internalization of Wnt protein itself was recently shown to be required for full activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Blitzer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The internalized Wnt ligand was targeted to the same region where internalized transferrin accumulated&#x02013;presumably the ERC. Taken together with our results, these observations raise the possibility that ERC may be an intracellular site where Wnt-signaling molecules and internalized AJ &#x003b2;-catenin intersect. In addition, two recent reports showed a requirement of GSK-3&#x000df; for endocytic recycling of integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Roberts1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and Glut1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Wieman1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Our preliminary result from immunofluorescence staining of GSK-3&#x003b2;, a target of Wnt signaling, also showed that it overlapped well with transferrin and &#x003b2;-catenin in cells stimulated by LPA (unpublished data). While these data further support intersection of AJ &#x003b2;-catenin with Wnt pathway at the ERC, different vesicular compartments either upstream or downstream of ERC should also be considered. Thus, while the characterization of intracellular transport mechanisms that support the journey of &#x003b2;-catenin from AJ to ERC are outside the scope of this manuscript, it poses some intriguing challenges and should stimulate more detailed studies in the future.</p><p>On a speculative note, the AJ-to-Wnt &#x003b2;-catenin connection provides an intuitive mechanism to integrate cell-cell adhesion with gene expression (i.e., spatial tissue organization with cell differentiation). More explicitly, the implications of an intersection between cell-cell adhesion and Wnt pathways are manifold. First, in this scenario, AJ integrity becomes a key factor to determine susceptibility to Wnt signaling. For instance, at constant Wnt activity, the amount of &#x003b2;-catenin that reaches the nucleus may increase if AJ are disrupted. That is, the intensity of Wnt signaling response could be affected by AJ stability. Thus, cells would modulate gene expression by integrating AJ status with Wnt-like external signaling. Second, the effects of the AJ/Wnt axis may be compounded by other transcriptional changes induced by AJ disruption. For example, a recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Bryant3">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that, after fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulation, FGF receptor is translocated to the nucleus in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. In pathological contexts, AJ disruption may have abnormal, constitutive effects in cell lines that carry mutations in the Wnt pathway. For example, we have found that several colorectal cancer cell lines with <italic>APC</italic> mutations show more nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin when treated with LPA (unpublished data), which is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Yang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Kuphal1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it appears that <italic>APC</italic> mutations uncouple AJ stability from Wnt-mediated regulation and, whether or not the Wnt pathway is activated, cadherin-bound &#x003b2;-catenin traveling from dissociated AJ may end up in the nucleus and presumably alters transcriptional regulation.</p><p>While our results clearly demonstrate that the cadherin-bound pool of &#x003b2;-catenin can be made available to Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Nelson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, it has been difficult, in our hands, to directly prove physiological significance of this intersection experimentally. This difficulty stems in large part from our observation that the increase of AJ &#x003b2;-catenin in ERC, and subsequently the nucleus upon Wnt activation (via LiCl&#x0002b;LPA), does not translate directly into activation, or super-activation of canonical Wnt target genes in A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, this antagonistic effect was even more pronounced in Wnt3a/LPA co-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004580.s005">Figure S5</xref>). On a side note, while Wnt3a is the physiological relevant ligand, we focused on the steps related to &#x003b2;-catenin degradation, following accumulation in the ERC. LiCl appears to be a better reagent for this, since it simply prevents &#x003b2;-catenin degradation by inhibition of GSK3-&#x003b2;, presumably without the additional effects that Wnt3a may have. Therefore, the majority of experiments were carried out with LiCl stimulation.</p><p>The &#x003b2;-catenin-&#x00394;GSK-GFP mutant used in photo-activation experiments also revealed that LPA suppresses the gene expression that is elevated by mutating &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004580.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Results from several additional cell lines, with or without mutation in APC or beta-catenin, further revealed that the effect of LPA on Wnt-induced transcription varies depending on cell line. For example, no clear pattern could be discerned among various colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-8, HCT-15, HCT-116, HT-29) we tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004580.s007">Figure S7</xref>). However, LPA showed a rather synergistic effect on the transcription with LiCl in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004580-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple possible explanations for these mixed results. The first possibility is that the cadherin-bound/Wnt-bound &#x003b2;-catenin intersection is devoid of physiological significance. The second possibility is that regulation of Wnt-dependent gene expression is more complex than we expected, and increased levels of AJ-bound &#x003b2;-catenin are compensated for by other mechanisms (e.g., non-canonical Wnt pathway suppression of canonical Wnt activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004580-Nemeth1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>). A third possibility is that LPA acts like non-canonical Wnt signals (e.g., Wnt5) that repress canonical Wnt signaling. There was a previous report that Wnt5 suppresses LEF/TCF dependent gene expression, without changing nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin (56). Interestingly, LPA downstream signaling networks share common nodes with non-canonical Wnt signaling, such as calcium, though there are currently no reports of these being antagonists of canonical Wnt. Another possibility is that APC mutations, or lack thereof, could make a significant difference. It has been reported that even with nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin elevated, transcription of target genes is still under tight regulation by APC (57). This hypothesis is supported by our data showing the antagonistic effect of LPA on the LEF/TCF-dependent transcription induced by mutant form of &#x003b2;-catenin, &#x003b2;-catenin-&#x00394;GSK-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004580.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In addition, a recent report suggested that &#x003b2;-catenin is also subjected by further regulation at the plasma membrane to be &#x02018;competent transcriptionally&#x02019; in APC and Wnt-receptor complex dependent manner (58). Yet another possibility is that fast recycling of &#x003b2;-catenin to re-form AJ might be induced by LPA. LPA increases lamellipodia formation in A431 cells. This event is expected to be related with Rho and Rac small G-protein activities, which are tightly involved in the initiation and expansion of AJ (59). If LPA can promote new AJ formation, the fast consumption of &#x003b2;-catenin for AJ from the ERC can be considered as a possible mechanism for LPA-induced downregulation of Wnt signaling, vis-&#x000e0;-vis increased nuclear concentration.</p><p>In a sense, it is not surprising that gene expression, in differentiated cells, would be &#x0201c;protected&#x0201d; by several alternative fail-safe mechanisms. Future experiments, including some planned in our laboratory, will have to address the issue of how to unveil the physiological significance of this novel link between AJ- and Wnt-associated &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>L-&#x003b1;-lysophosphatidic acid (oleoyl, LPA 18&#x02236;1) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C at a stock concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M.
