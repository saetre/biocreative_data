To&#x000a0;ensure ribosome synthesis, 3&#x02032; end formation of rRNA uses multiple nucleases acting in parallel; however, a similar parallel mechanism had not been described for 5&#x02032; end maturation. Here, we identify Rrp17p as a previously unidentified 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease essential for ribosome biogenesis, functioning with Rat1p in a parallel processing pathway analogous to that of 3&#x02032; end formation. Rrp17p is required for efficient exonuclease digestion of the mature 5&#x02032; ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNAs, contains&#x000a0;a catalytic domain close to its N terminus, and is highly&#x000a0;conserved among higher eukaryotes, being&#x000a0;a member of a family of exonucleases. We show that Rrp17p binds late pre-60S ribosomes, accompanying them from the nucleolus to the nuclear periphery, and provide evidence for physical and functional links between late 60S subunit processing and export.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>PROTEINS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is a highly coordinated process that largely takes place in the nucleolus. Work by many groups has defined the processing pathway for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and identified &#x0223c;170 proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, while proteomic analyses have provided a roughly outlined pathway of preribosome assembly in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="bib17 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002; Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). Three of the four rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, and 25/28S rRNA) are derived from the 35S rRNA precursor transcribed by RNA polymerase I, while the fourth rRNA (5S rRNA) is transcribed separately by RNA polymerase III. The 35S pre-rRNA is packaged into a 90S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) together with a subset of assembly factors and ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). After undergoing extensive site-specific modifications, internal and external spacer regions (ITS and ETS) are removed (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>) by an ordered series of endonucleolytic cleavages and exonucleolytic digestion steps to form functional 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>).</p><p>A large number of studies have made it clear that, apart from the r-proteins, a multitude of <italic>trans</italic>-acting, nonribosomal factors play a crucial role in the assembly of functional eukaryotic ribosomes (<xref rid="bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002; Fromont-Racine et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Although the precise function of many of these factors is still unknown, recent data have shown that some of them determine separate but parallel-acting assembly and processing routes that ensure maturation of preribosomes through a network of redundant parallel pathways (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rez-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). One such example of a parallel pathway is the maturation of 5.8S rRNA. Roughly 80% of 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA is cleaved at site A<sub>3</sub> by RNase MRP, and the resulting 27SA<sub>3</sub> precursor is processed exonucleolytically into 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA; however, the remaining 20% are converted into the 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA by an endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). As a result, two mature 5.8S rRNA species (5.8S<sub>L</sub> [long] and 5.8S<sub>S</sub> [short]) are produced, in a ratio of about 1:5.</p><p>The 5&#x02032; end maturation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> (and 25S rRNA) in yeast has been attributed to the nuclear 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease Rat1p and its cofactor Rai1p (<xref rid="bib10 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Its cytoplasmic homolog Xrn1p is involved in the degradation of aberrant rRNA precursors, and its absence does not affect the ratio of 5.8S L:S rRNAs (<xref rid="bib10 bib25" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Johnson, 1997</xref>). However, defects in both 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNA maturation were exacerbated by deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> in cells depleted for Rat1p, indicating that Xrn1p could take over rRNA maturation steps in its absence (<xref rid="bib10 bib21 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Geerlings et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). While Rat1p seems to be the only 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease implicated in the maturation of 5&#x02032; ends, 3&#x02032; end formation of 5.8S rRNA involves multiple nucleases that act sequentially to ensure correct and precise trimming of the pre-rRNA (<xref rid="bib5 bib8 bib13 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et&#x000a0;al., 1998; de la Cruz et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Faber et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of any one of these nucleases, 3&#x02032; end maturation still occurs, albeit not as efficiently (<xref rid="bib2 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Allmang et&#x000a0;al., 2000; de la Cruz et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). This ensures that even in the absence of one of these nucleases, production of mature ribosomal subunits still continues. However, a similarly redundant mechanism involving multiple nucleases had not been uncovered for 5&#x02032; end maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNA. Here, we describe the characterization of the yeast protein Ydr412p as a highly conserved exonuclease that is required for the 5&#x02032; end maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, demonstrating that 5&#x02032; end processing also has a redundant pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Rrp17p Is Part of NPC-Associated Pre-60S Ribosomal Subunits</title><p>We have previously described a method for purifying yeast nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). This NPC fraction was highly enriched in proteins known to be associated with late processing and export of mRNA and ribosomal subunits, likely caught during the process of chaperoning these cargoes to and through the NPC (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rout et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). One of these NPC-associated proteins caught our attention; this protein, Ydr412p, had no previously assigned function, yet localized to the nucleolus, as does its human homolog, Nol12/Nop25 (<xref rid="bib24 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Huh et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Suzuki et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Its association with the NPC and with the nucleolus suggested that it might be a late-acting ribosome synthesis factor. As discussed below, this hypothesis proved correct, and we have thus termed it a member of the <italic>r</italic>ibosomal <italic>R</italic>NA <italic>p</italic>rocessing family, Rrp17p.</p><p>To better understand the function of Rrp17p, we isolated&#x000a0;a genomically tagged version of the protein ex vivo to determine the&#x000a0;proteins with which it interacts, using our fast single-step affinity purification procedure (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Oeffinger et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). We identified 109 proteins in the isolated Rrp17p complex. Ten of these were NPC components, consistent with the association of Rrp17p with NPCs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rout et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). We also found 48 ribosomal proteins, 45 of which were components of the large subunit, and 43 known preribosomal processing factors involved in late steps in 60S subunit maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A, right) (<xref rid="bib4 bib18 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Bassler et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Fatica et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Nissan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, we were able to isolate several transient components, such as nucleoporins, the pre-60S subunit export factor Crm1p, and the exonucleases Rat1p, Xrn1p, and Rrp6p (<xref rid="bib23 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994; Johnson et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with a role for Rrp17p in ribosomal maturation and/or export. In addition, we also dentified Npl3p and Yra2p. Depletion of Npl3p (Nop3p) affects ribosome synthesis (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Russell and Tollervey, 1992</xref>), but no role for Yra2p in ribosome synthesis has so far been reported.</p><p>To confirm the association of Rrp17p with preribosomes, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation on whole-cell lysates from cells expressing Rrp17-Protein A (PrA) and compared the sedimentation of Rrp17-PrA to that of the pre-rRNAs of both the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A). Rrp17-PrA cosediments with 27SB pre-RNA, a component of pre-60S subunits, but not with 20S pre-rRNA, the precursor to mature 18S rRNA and component of 40S preribosomes. We also determined which rRNA precursors were associated with the isolated Rrp17-PrA containing complexes. Coisolation was seen for late pre-60S RNA components with Rrp17-PrA complexes compared to mock purifications (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B and S2Cb-S2Ce), while no 90S (35S pre-rRNA) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>Ca) or 40S components (18S rRNA) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>D) were detected. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Rrp17p associates only with pre-60S ribosomal subunits.</p><p>Using a functional GFP-tagged allele, we assessed whether the in&#x000a0;vivo cellular localization of Rrp17p is consistent with an association with preribosomes. Rrp17p is concentrated mainly in the nucleolus, with some residual nuclear staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B).&#x000a0;This same pattern is found for numerous proteins known to associate with late preribosomes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Huh et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). We also noted a faint punctate signal at the nuclear periphery, which is consistent with the association of Rrp17-GFP with the NPC. Taken together, these data indicate that Rrp17p is a bona fide component of pre-60S ribosomal subunit that associates with the complexes in the nucleolus and accompanies them to the NPC prior to their export.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Rrp17p Is Involved in 5&#x02032; End Maturation of 60S Subunit rRNAs</title><p>Since Rrp17p was associated with late 60S preribosomes, we examined its possible function during 60S maturation. Deletion of <italic>RRP17</italic> was shown to be lethal (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Giaever et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Hence, we studied the effect of depletion of Rrp17p in a strain expressing an HA-Rrp17p fusion construct under the control of the repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter at the endogenous <italic>RRP17</italic> locus. Growth of isogenic wild-type and <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strains was identical in galactose-containing medium. However, growth of the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strain declined progressively following transfer to glucose medium (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). Northern hybridization analysis showed mild accumulation of 35S and 23S pre-rRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>Ae), the latter being a product of premature cleavage of 32S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub>. The 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA also accumulated in Rrp17p-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B, lanes 1-3), as well as 27SB pre-rRNA, while mature 25S rRNA was reduced &#x0223c;3-fold after 16 hr in glucose, compared to wild-type and 18S rRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Ac, 2Ad, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>A). In addition, primer extension analysis showed a moderate increase of 26S pre-rRNA, the 5&#x02032;-extended precursor of 25S rRNA and product of C<sub>2</sub> cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). In wild-type cells,&#x000a0;26S pre-rRNA is processed very rapidly by the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p and is not usually detected (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Geerlings et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). However, accumulation of 27SB and 26S precursors suggested a delay in both cleavage at site C<sub>2</sub> and subsequent processing of 26S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). No alterations were seen in the levels of 20S pre-rRNA and mature 18S rRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Ae and&#x000a0;2Af).</p><p>Analysis of the 5.8S rRNA synthesis pathway following transfer to glucose showed no accumulation of 7S pre-rRNA in the absence of Rrp17p, but a minor accumulation of 3&#x02032;-extended intermediates indicated that 3&#x02032; end processing of 5.8S rRNA was less efficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>Bd). Moreover, 5&#x02032;-extended forms of 7S pre-rRNA (A<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>; A<sub>3</sub> to E) were detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Bb&#x02013;2Bd), indicating that processing in ITS2 occurred prior to that in ITS1, a phenotype that has previously been observed when processing in ITS1 was slowed (<xref rid="bib12 bib14 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Eppens et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Faber et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>). In addition, the Rrp17p-depleted strain showed a clear alteration in the alternative processing pathways that generate the mature 5.8S<sub>L</sub> and 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>Be, lanes 3&#x02013;5), in which more 5.8S<sub>L</sub> was found than in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>Be, lane 1). Accumulated aberrant 5&#x02032;-extended forms of 5.8S rRNA were also observed, indicating inefficient exonucleolytic maturation of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA and thus a delay in ITS1 processing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Bb and 2Bc). Synthesis of 5S rRNA was not affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>Bf).</p><p>A switch from 5.8S<sub>S</sub> to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA was previously observed only in mutants that impair either cleavage at A<sub>3</sub> (Rrp5p or RNase MRP) or subsequent 5&#x02032; exonuclease processing to site B1<sub>S</sub>, the 5&#x02032; end of mature 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA (Rat1p and Xrn1p) (<xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib15 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Eppens et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Faber et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rrp17p is required for efficient exonuclease digestion to the mature 5&#x02032; ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S RNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The delay in early processing at the sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub> is probably secondary, as similar effects have previously been described for several other factors, though their basis is not fully understood (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Rrp17p Is Involved in 5.8S<sub>S</sub> Maturation Parallel to Processing by Rat1p</title><p>The formation of the 5&#x02032; end of both 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S rRNAs has previously been attributed to the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). However, deletion of the nonessential Xrn1p alone did not lead to detectable 5&#x02032; end processing defects, while depletion of the essential nuclear Rat1p exhibited significant 5.8S and 25S maturation defects, which were exacerbated by deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> in this background, indicating that Xrn1p function in 5&#x02032; end processing is seen only in the absence of Rat1p (<xref rid="bib10 bib21 bib23" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Geerlings et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Henry et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Hence, we focused on potential links between the functions of Rrp17p and Rat1p during 5.8S rRNA maturation in an <italic>xrn1&#x00394;</italic> background.</p><p>We constructed a <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> strain and compared synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNA to <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> and <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> strains. Analysis of the triple mutant under restrictive conditions revealed a strong accumulation of both 27SA, specifically 27SA<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>Ba), and 27SB pre-rRNAs and a decrease in mature 25S rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, right a and b), whereas maturation of 18S rRNA was not affected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, right c). This suggests that processing in both ITS1 and ITS2 was delayed. In comparison, less accumulation of 27S precursors was observed in the <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> mutant under restrictive conditions, but instead, a substantial increase of 26S was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, middle a) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Geerlings et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>); after 16 hr, no more 26S was detected, while levels of mature 25S rRNA remained normal. This points toward the presence of another exonuclease, taking over in the absence of both Rat1p and Xrn1p to ensure production of mature 25S rRNA. Given the phenotype of the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> strain, it is conceivable that Rrp17p may be this exonuclease. However, a potential fourth nuclease does not appear to be involved, as 25S rRNA levels reduce over time under restrictive conditions in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, right b).</p><p>As previously shown, 5&#x02032;-extended forms of 5.8S rRNA accumulated in <italic>P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> cells when Rat1p was depleted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 5, and 3C, lanes 7&#x02013;9) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>); similar 5&#x02032;-extended forms were also observed in the <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 3, and 3C, lanes 3&#x02013;5), but not in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B lane 1, and 3C, lane 1), in restrictive medium. In contrast, the 5&#x02032; end-extended forms were not present in <italic>P<sub>GAL</sub>::rrp17/P<sub>MET</sub>::rat1/xrn1&#x00394;</italic> cells when both proteins were depleted. Instead, a drastic drop in mature 5.8S<sub>S</sub> rRNA and a switch to the 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA was observed, together with the appearance of a single 5&#x02032;-extended RNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, lane 7, and 3C, lanes 11&#x02013;13).

Therefore, residues F43, R46, and R70 were each changed to alanine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Aspartic acid residues have been found in the catalytic centers of different exonucleases; thus, we also changed the aspartic acid residues at sites 32 and 38 to alanine, as well as to arginine, as this has been shown to preserve RNA binding while disrupting any potential exonuclease activity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terribilini et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). T41 is a residue that is entirely conserved in all homologs of Rrp17p, except <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where it has been replaced by serine. Thus, we converted T41 to an alanine residue.

The loss of activity could be due to disruption of charge-based interactions between the aspartic acid and nucleobases.

Taken together, these data show that defects in 5&#x02032; maturation of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs hinder pre-60S subunit export and, moreover, point toward a link between late processing of rRNA and ribosomal export. To determine whether this phenomenon is specifically true for 5&#x02032; maturation of pre-60S components or extends to late maturation steps in general, localization of ITS2-containing pre-rRNAs was determined in the absence of Rai1p, the cofactor to Rat1p, and Rrp6p, a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease required for 3&#x02032; maturation of 5.8S rRNA (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>C).

Indeed, we find such a redistribution. Both Rrp17p and another late processing factor, Noc3p (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Milkereit et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), redistribute (in &#x0003e;95% of cells) upon exposure to a metabolic poison cocktail that is known to reversibly arrest nuclear transport (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A, 7B, 7E, and 7F) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shulga et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, both proteins accumulate at the nuclear periphery, consistent with their biochemical association with the NPC and nuclear peripheral components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). By contrast, the early ribosomal processing factor Noc1p (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Milkereit et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), did not redistribute under these conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C and 7D), underscoring the specificity of this result. It seems unlikely that Rrp17p is involved in the transport of ribosomes, as its redistribution in poison resembles that of Noc3p but not of Rrp12p (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Oeffinger et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), a shuttling factor known to facilitate ribosome export, which becomes more cytoplasmic upon metabolic arrest (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>G and 7H).

Rrp17p is an essential protein that binds late pre-60S ribosomes and is required for efficient exonuclease digestion to the mature 5&#x02032; ends of 5.8S<sub>S</sub> and 25S RNAs. Moreover, it accompanies the 60S subunit from the nucleolus to the nuclear periphery and even to the NPC. With a putative catalytic domain close to its N terminus, Rp17p is highly conserved among fungi and higher eukaryotes, though it lacks homology to other known nucleases.

The characterization of Rrp17p reveals that, similar to 3&#x02032; end processing of 5.8S rRNA, 5&#x02032; end maturation also involves multiple nucleases. The presence of another nuclear 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease provides the cell with redundant pathways to ensure robust and efficient production of 60S ribosomal subunits. Interestingly, using in&#x000a0;vitro transcribed pre-RNA substrates starting from either cleavage sites at A<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>, degradation did not occur for the same number of nucleotides for the two substrates (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S7</xref>G and S7H). Instead, processing was stopped at different distances from the 5&#x02032; end in each case, suggesting that the enzyme is most likely stopped by either secondary structure or nonpreferred sequence. The latter is known to exist for Rat1p, which is inhibited by poly-G-rich sequences (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Poole and Stevens, 1997</xref>). This suggests that, although able to degrade ITS regions on their own, each exonuclease is likely to have preferred substrate regions within ITS1 and 2, underlining the potential gain in efficiency provided by another exonuclease and a shared role during 5&#x02032; end pre-rRNA maturation.

However, the association of Rai1p with pre-rRNA may be required for conformational changes within ITS1 that allow efficient exonucleolytic processing by both nucleases, which could explain the increase in endonucleolytic processing and shift in 5.8S<sub>S</sub> to 5.8S<sub>L</sub> ratio in <italic>rai1&#x00394;</italic> cells.</p><p>Very little is known about whether processing within the two ITS regions is coordinated; however, it has been observed that defective processing in ITS1 can lead to either premature or less-efficient processing in ITS2 (<xref rid="bib7 bib12 bib18 bib41" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Eppens et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Fatica et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Shuai and Warner, 1991</xref>). In the&#x000a0;absence of an efficient exonucleolytic 5&#x02032; end processing pathway, a gradual shift to endonucleolytic 5&#x02032; end maturation of 5.8S rRNA and increase in 5.8S<sub>L</sub> occurs. In agreement with previous studies, the concomitant accumulation of ITS2-containing precursors (27SB, 26S, and 7S) suggests a linkage between the processing of both spacers. Specifically, the appearance of 3&#x02032;-extended 5.8S precursor RNAs in both Rrp17p- and Rat1p-depleted strains implies a connection between 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end maturation of 5.8S rRNA (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, in the past, it has been suggested that Rai1p may coordinate the 5&#x02032; end and 3&#x02032; end processing activities of Rat1p and the nuclear exosome, as deletion of <italic>RAI1</italic> strongly accumulated 3&#x02032;-extended precursors of 5.8S rRNA and was synthetically lethal when combined with a deletion of the exosome component <italic>RRP6</italic> (<xref rid="bib10 bib16" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Fang et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>The Association of Rrp17p with the Nuclear Periphery</title><p>Biochemical, functional, and localization evidence all agree that Rrp17p can be associated with the nuclear periphery and the NPC. Upon immunoisolation, 13 nucleoporins, nuclear peripheral proteins (such as the Mlp proteins), and nuclear transport factors copurify with tagged Rrp17p. This provides strong evidence for a close physical connection between Rrp17p and regions on and immediately surrounding the NPC's nuclear face. We also show that Rrp17p partially colocalizes with the nuclear periphery in&#x000a0;vivo and that this localization is significantly and specifically enhanced by conditions that disrupt nuclear transport. A functional connection between Rrp17p's role in late ribosomal processing and nuclear export is shown by the inhibition of late pre-60S export upon depletion of Rrp17p. It is formally possible that the pool of Rrp17p associated with the NPC is not the same as the pool involved in late 60S processing; however, taken together, the most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that Rrp17p accompanies the late 60S subunit to the nuclear periphery and NPC and that correct processing is a prerequisite for export of the subunit through the NPC. Indeed, we provide evidence that there may be a general physical and functional link between late processing of 60S subunits and export, as the latter is not only delayed in Rrp17p-depleted cells but also in strains carrying mutants of Rat1p, Xrn1p, Rai1p, or&#x000a0;Rrp6p&#x02014;all components of the late 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; processing machinery. Such a link would not be altogether surprising, as a similar mechanism has been identified for the late mRNA processing and proofreading machinery, which associates with the nuclear periphery and NPC (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carmody and Wente, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Rrp17p Is Part of a Family of Conserved Eukaryotic Exonucleases</title><p>Rrp17p is just one member of a conserved family of putative RNA exonucleases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). Although the rat homolog of Rrp17p, Nop25, has previously been characterized in COS7 cells as a nucleolar RNA-binding protein involved in ribosome synthesis, no functional data were shown at the time (<xref rid="bib20 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Fujiwara et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Suzuki et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). The ability of Nol12 to rescue a <italic>RRP17</italic> deletion, however, denotes the protein not only as a sequence but also as a functional homolog of Rrp17p, and it will be interesting to determine if Nol12 fulfills a similar role during rRNA processing in higher eukaryotes to Rrp17p. So far, we are only slowly unraveling the mechanism of ribosome maturation in higher eukaryotes, due to its even greater complexity. The characterization of Nol12 will therefore provide us with useful insight into&#x000a0;ribosome biogenesis in mammalian cells. Moreover, given the multifunctional nature of Xrn2/Rat1p as an exonuclease in mRNA degradation as well as rRNA processing (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), it will be interesting to see if the sole function of Nol12 and Rrp17p lies in rRNA maturation or if the protein has additional roles in degradation of other RNA species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Yeast Strains</title><p>Growth and handling of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were carried out using standard techniques.
