The spectrum of VILI includes not only air leaks and increases in endothelial and epithelial permeability but also increases in pulmonary and systemic inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategy has been shown to reduce VILI in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the effectiveness of the LPV strategy may be limited because of severe spatial heterogeneity of lung involvement resulting in incomplete prevention of regional alveolar distension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Alternative therapeutic strategies based on a precise understanding of its pathophysiology are necessary to completely eliminate the iatrogenic consequences of VILI.</p><p>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme involved in the cellular response to DNA injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Upon encountering DNA strand breaks, PARP catalyzes the cleavage of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and then uses the latter to synthesize polymers of ADP-ribose in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, under conditions of severe DNA injury, overactivation of PARP severely depletes the intracellular stores of NAD<sup>+</sup>, slowing the rate of glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and high-energy phosphate generation, ultimately leading to cell death via the necrotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This 'suicide mechanism' is closely related to the pathogenesis of disease in several pathophysiologic conditions of inflammation, and PARP inhibition or inactivation was shown to be protective against the development of inflammation due to cellular necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, there is accumulating experimental evidence that suggests that PARP plays a role in nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B)-dependent transcription and thus contributes to the synthesis of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In studies of acute lung injury (ALI) by various causes, PARP was shown to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injury and PARP inhibitors have therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, such findings have not been replicated in studies concerning the development of VILI, induced directly by an injurious ventilation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of injurious MV strategy in PARP activation and the effects of a PARP inhibitor, in the mouse VILI model of normal lung, under the hypothesis that PARP overactivation may participate in inflammatory and transcriptional mechanisms of VILI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and mechanical ventilation</title><p>The experimental methods were approved by the animal research committee of Korea University and the ethics committee of Korea University Medical Center. Five-week-old specific pathogen-free male C57BL/6 mice, each weighing 20 to 25 g, were randomly divided into the following four experimental groups: (a) sham tracheostomized group (sham group, n = 18); (b) LPV group (n = 18), in which the mice were ventilated with low tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); (c) VILI group (n = 18), in which the mice were ventilated with high V<sub>T </sub>without PEEP; and (d) VILI with PJ34 pretreatment group (PJ34+VILI group, n = 18), in which the mice were pretreated with the PARP inhibitor PJ34 and ventilated with the same settings as in the VILI group. Each group was subdivided into three experimental subgroups: (a) tissue subgroup (n = 6) for histopathologic examination and measurements of wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio and PARP activity assay; (b) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) subgroup (n = 6) for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay and measurements of inflammatory cytokine concentration and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in BAL fluid (BALF); and (c) tissue homogenate subgroup (n = 6) for measurement of NF-&#x003ba;B activity in lung tissue homogenates.</p><p>Each mouse was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium and intubated via tracheostomy. MV was performed with a rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). The mice in the LPV group were ventilated with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, a PEEP of 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and a respiratory rate of 90 breaths per minute. Adequate setting for the VILI model has been determined by preliminary studies using various MV settings. Histopathologic examination of the lung tissues every 30 minutes allowed determination of the time and setting that yielded typical pathological findings of VILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The typical indications developed under the following setting: PIP 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O + PEEP 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O + 90 breaths per minute. These changes were most prominent after about 2 hours of MV. Therefore, the VILI and PJ34+VILI groups were ventilated at this setting for 2 hours, and the LPV group mice were also ventilated for 2 hours. PIP and V<sub>T </sub>were measured and monitored using a linear pneumotach (series 8430; Hans Rudolph, Inc., Shawnee, KS, USA) and research pneumotach system (model RSS 100 HR; Hans Rudolph, Inc.). Changes in dynamic compliance (C<sub>D</sub>) between the beginning and after 2 hours of MV were calculated from the V<sub>T</sub>, PIP, and PEEP: C<sub>D </sub>= V<sub>T</sub>/(PIP - PEEP). To maintain deep anesthesia, half of the initial dose of pentobarbital sodium was administered after 1 hour of MV.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation, wet-to-dry weight ratio, and bronchoalveolar lavage</title><p>After MV, the tissue subgroup mice were rapidly exsanguinated by dissecting the abdominal aorta. The heart and lungs were removed <italic>en bloc </italic>through a midsternal incision. After ligation of the left main and right upper bronchi, the left lung was excised, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in a cryomold, and stored at -70&#x000b0;C for PARP activity assay. Excised right upper lobe was weighed in a tared container and dried in an oven until a constant weight was obtained, and the W/D weight ratio was calculated. The remnant of the right lung was immediately instilled with 4% paraformaldehyde through the right main bronchus at a hydrostatic pressure of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours. Paraffin blocks were prepared by dehydration with ethanol and embedding in paraffin.</p><p>For the BAL subgroup mice, the thorax was opened following euthanasia by exsanguination, and three BAL procedures were performed, each with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The retrieval fluid was centrifuged (2,000 <italic>g </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C) for 10 minutes and the supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis for MPO activity and measurements of inflammatory cytokine concentration and NO.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of degree of ventilator-induced lung injury</title><p>The posterior portions of the right lower lobe were sectioned at a thickness of 5 &#x003bc;m, placed on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. A pathologist blinded to the protocol and experimental groups examined the degree of lung injury and graded the specimens by ALI score based on (a) alveolar capillary congestion, (b) hemorrhage, (c) infiltration or aggregation of neutrophils in the airspace or the vessel wall, and (d) thickness of the alveolar wall/hyaline membrane formation. Each item was graded according to the following five-point scale: 0, minimal damage; 1, mild damage; 2, moderate damage; 3, severe damage; and 4, maximal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The degree of VILI was assessed by the sum of scores for items 0 to 16 in five randomly selected high-power fields (HPFs) (&#x000d7;400). The average of the sum of each field score was compared among groups.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP activity assay and administration of PARP inhibitor</title><p>PARP activity in lung tissues was measured by using an immunohistochemical method of PARP activity using biotinylated NAD<sup>+</sup>, the substrate of the PARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, cryosections of 10 &#x003bc;m were fixed for 10 minutes in 95% ethanol at -20&#x000b0;C and then rinsed in PBS. Sections were permeabilized by incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0). A reaction mixture consisting of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 30 &#x003bc;M biotinylated NAD<sup>+ </sup>in 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0) was then applied to the sections for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Reaction mixtures containing PJ34 or without biotinylated NAD<sup>+ </sup>were used as controls. After three washes in PBS, incorporated biotin was detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 for 30 minutes at room temperature). After three 10-minute washes in PBS, color was developed with cobalt-enhanced nickel-DAB substrate. Sections were counterstained in Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), dehydrated, and mounted in Vectamount (Vector Laboratories). PARP activity was quantified by summing the numbers of cells positive for PARP activity in five HPFs.</p><p>The mice in the PJ34+VILI group were intraperitoneally pretreated with 20 mg/kg of PJ34 [<italic>N</italic>-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dimethylacetamide, hydrochloride] (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), which is not antioxidant and does not directly interfere with the reactivity of peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and there are no reports that it has an independent inhibitory effect on NF-&#x003ba;B. The dose was proven to be effective in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To determine optimal pretreatment time, PJ34 was administered intraperitoneally at each of 24, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 hours before MV to six mice at each time. The lowest PARP activity was observed after 2-hour pretreatment with PJ34. Thereafter, PARP activity increased at 1 and 0.5 hours. Therefore, the VILI+PJ34 group mice were pretreated at 2 hours before MV and the mice in the sham, LPV, and VILI groups were pretreated with 200 &#x003bc;L of PBS 2 hours before tracheostomy or MV.</p></sec><sec><title>BALF analysis and estimation of nuclear factor-kappa-B activation in lung tissue homogenates</title><p>As an indicator of activated neutrophil accumulation, a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activity of MPO was determined directly in cell-free BALF according to the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], with minor modifications. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in BALF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Pulmonary production of NO was determined by measuring nitrate and nitrite (NO<sub>X</sub>), the stable end products of NO metabolism, in the BALF using an NO (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) assay kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Nuclear proteins from the tissue homogenate subgroup mice were prepared with a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 subunit in 5 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extracts was measured using an NF-&#x003ba;B p65 ELISA-based transcription factor assay kit (TransAMTM NF-&#x003ba;B p65 Transcriptional Factor Assay Kit; Active Motif) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean.

To develop alternative therapeutic strategies directed at preventing VILI, it is necessary to understand the precise mechanisms involved in inflammatory reactions in lung injury. PARP, which has been known to play important roles in inflammation and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcription, is worthy of investigation in the pathogenesis of VILI. PARP is a protein-modifying and nucleotide-polymerizing enzyme that is abundant in the nucleus and involves in DNA repair resulting from genotoxic stress by poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, in the case of excessive DNA damage, massive PARP activation leads to energy failure followed by necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This mechanism and the protective effects of PARP inhibitors have also been reported to play important roles in the cases of ALI induced by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], bleomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], burn and smoke inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], hyperoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], ischemia reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and hyperoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, until recently, the role of PARP activation has not been elucidated in severe inflammatory lung injury of VILI. The present study demonstrated that PARP overactivated in the development of histopathological lung injury, pulmonary edema, and the worsening of pulmonary mechanics induced by injurious MV strategy. These changes were significantly correlated with PARP activity, and pretreatment with PARP inhibitor decreased the enzyme activity and reduced the injuries, suggesting a pivotal role of PARP in the pathogenesis of VILI. Recently, Vaschetto and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] reported the effect of PARP inhibitor in the rat model in which MV was performed after intratracheal LPS instillation. This model is clinically relevant in studying the mechanism of ventilator-associated lung injury, which refers to the additional injury imposed on a previously injured lung by MV in either the clinical setting or experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but intratracheal administration of LPS has been reported to induce PARP overactivation in the lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, this model might have limitations in examining the roles of stretch and shearing injury itself in PARP activation. It would be difficult to determine whether PARP is activated by LPS, injurious MV setting, or both and whether the PARP inhibitor exerts its effect by inhibition of PARP from LPS, injurious MV setting, or both. The primary purpose of our study was to investigate the roles of stretch and shearing forces by injurious MV in PARP activation using the VILI model of healthy animals. Through this model, we could examine and conclude that the injurious MV itself could induce the PARP activation and the PARP inhibitor could protect the injury by PARP activation, regardless of primary insult of ALI.</p><p>ROS, a major cause of lung injury, is an important trigger of DNA damage and PARP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although recently ROS has been reported to be produced by repetitive mechanical stretching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and shearing stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] in cultured endothelial cells, ROS originate primarily from activated neutrophils. In the present study, oxidative stress from activated neutrophils was measured indirectly by MPO activity in BALF and the activity was increased in the VILI group and closely associated with PARP activity. In the presence of 'oxidative stress', another reactive species NO reacts rapidly with free radicals produced by activated neutrophils &#x02013; superoxide &#x02013; to yield peroxinitrite, a labile and toxic oxidant species and the key pathophysiologically relevant triggers of DNA single-strand breakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the setting of ALI, airspace NO is derived primarily from the inducible form of NO synthase (NOS2), which can be induced in activated neutrophils either by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines or by high V<sub>T </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Despite the absence of direct measurement of peroxynitrite in this experiment, the increased level of the NO<sub>X </sub>due to injurious MV could yield peroxynitrite by reaction with increased ROS, along with PARP activity, and inhibition of PARP reduced MPO activity and NO<sub>X </sub>level. Injurious MV upregulates pulmonary cytokine production, which may result in an inflammatory reaction that aggravates lung injury. Most alveolar cells are capable of producing proinflammatory mediators when stretched <italic>in vitro </italic>or when ventilated with a large V<sub>T </sub>in <italic>ex vivo </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, NF-&#x003ba;B plays a central role as a common messenger in cytokine regulation and inflammation. In experimental models, blockage of NF-&#x003ba;B decreases VILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B activation is a critical step in the transcription of genes necessary in perpetuating the innate immune response that ultimately results in activation and extravasation of neutrophils and other immune cells, a process that starts within minutes after commencement of MV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that PARP regulates the expression of various proteins at the transcriptional level. NF-&#x003ba;B is a key transcription factor in the regulation of this set of proteins, and PARP has been shown to act as a coactivator in NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated transcription and thus contributes to the synthesis of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. There is no consensus in the literature regarding whether the modulation of NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated transcription by PARP is dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme or its physical presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Similar to other studies, we showed that injurious MV strategies increased the concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in BALF and NF-&#x003ba;B activity in lung tissue homogenates. These changes were closely related to PARP activity. The PARP inhibitor reduced NF-&#x003ba;B activity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations, which were correlated with PARP activity. These results suggest the transcriptional modulation of PARP in inflammatory lung injury during VILI. To clarify whether transcriptional modulation is dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme or on its physical presence, experiments with PARP knockout mice are necessary. The lack of such data is a major limitation of this study, and the higher activity of NF-&#x003ba;B of the PJ34+VILI group than the sham and LPV groups suggests that NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by complex mechanisms other than PARP. Another limitation is the omission of PJ34+sham and PJ34+LPV groups. Although PJ34 has been reported to exert its effect predominantly by inhibition of PARP activity, it would be necessary to experiment with PJ34+sham and PJ34+LPV groups in order to rule out the effects of PJ34 other than PARP inhibition in the VILI model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overactivation of PARP plays an important role in the inflammatory and transcriptional mechanisms of the pathogenesis of VILI.
