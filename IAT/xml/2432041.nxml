We have studied the relationships between Cav-1 abundance, atherosclerotic plaque characteristics and clinical manisfestations of atherosclerotic disease.We determined Cav-1 expression by western blotting in atherosclerotic plaques harvested from 378 subjects that underwent carotid endarterectomy. Cav-1 levels were significantly lower in carotid plaques than non-atherosclerotic vascular specimens. Low Cav-1 expression was associated with features of plaque instability such as large lipid core, thrombus formation, macrophage infiltration, high IL-6, IL-8 levels and elevated MMP-9 activity. Clinically, a down-regulation of Cav-1 was observed in plaques obtained from men, patients with a history of myocardial infarction and restenotic lesions. Cav-1 levels above the median were associated with absence of new vascular events within 30 days after surgery &#x0005b;0&#x00025; vs. 4&#x00025;&#x0005d; and a trend towards lower incidence of new cardiovascular events during longer follow-up. Consistent with these clinical data, Cav-1 null mice revealed elevated intimal hyperplasia response following arterial injury that was significantly attenuated after MMP inhibition. Recombinant peptides mimicking Cav-1 scaffolding domain (Cavtratin) reduced gelatinase activity in cultured porcine arteries and impaired MMP-9 activity and COX-2 in LPS-challenged macrophages. Administration of Cavtratin strongly impaired flow-induced expansive remodeling in mice.This is the first study that identifies Cav-1 as a novel potential stabilizing factor in human atherosclerosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that local down-regulation of Cav-1 in atherosclerotic lesions contributes to plaque formation and/or instability accelerating the occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, given the large number of patients studied, we believe that Cav-1 may be considered as a novel target in the prevention of human atherosclerotic disease and the loss of Cav-1 may be a novel biomarker of vulnerable plaque with prognostic value.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation, destabilization and rupture with subsequent thrombus formation give rise to acute coronary syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Falk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, symptomatic carotid artery disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Verhoeven1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and sudden cardiac death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Burke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The current lack of knowledge about the natural history of human atherosclerotic disease and plaque progression restricts the possibility to identify subjects at risk for cardiovascular events. In order to evaluate the relationship between local protein expression in atherosclerotic plaques and future vascular events, the ATHERO-EXPRESS vascular bio-bank was established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Verhoeven2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> . The main goal of this study is to identify the expression patterns of specific proteins expressed within the vascular tree that may make patients prone to suffer cardiovascular events in all vascular territories. These proteins, diffusely expressed in the vasculature, could then be locally detected using local molecular imaging or in endarterectomy specimens, and serve as a surrogate marker to identify the patient at risk for future adverse cardiovascular events, the so-called vulnerable patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Hellings1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, the analysis of plaques from hypercholesterolemic rabbits and humans showed reduced Cav-1 levels, suggesting athero-protective actions for Cav-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Lin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Schwencke1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However; the study of the relationships between Cav-1 abundance, atherosclerotic plaque phenotype and clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease has not been undertaken yet.</p><p>Therefore, we determined Cav-1 expression in carotid atherosclerotic plaques from a cohort of 378 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy obtained from the ATHERO-EXPRESS study. We hypothesized that plaque levels of Cav-1 might be related to plaque morphology, inflammation and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. We also investigated if local Cav-1 expression levels in the carotid plaque were related to clinical characteristics. In addition, the design of the bio-bank study allowed the execution of a follow up with the objective to study the predictive value of local Cav-1 expression for the future development of cardiovascular adverse events and thus might help identifying patients at risk. Additionally, we hypothesized that potential associations of Cav-1 expression with adverse outcomes could be explained by an inhibitory effect on MMP activity in the atherosclerotic lesion. In order to address this hypothesis we further analyzed the effect of Cav-1 on intimal hyperplasia in Cav-1 null mice and whether an increased intimal hyperplasia response could be attenuated by MMP blockade. In addition, we studied the impact of Cav-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) on gelatinase activity, COX-2 expression and expansive arterial remodeling in vitro and in mice.</p><p>This clinical and pre- clinical data provides evidence supporting an important role for Cav-1, and its related peptides, in vascular pathologies such as intimal hyperplasia, expansive remodeling and human atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and rupture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human study</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>The Athero-Express vascular bio-bank</title><p>Athero-Express is an ongoing vascular bio-bank project with the goal to investigate locally expressed plaque markers in relation to clinical presentation and clinical outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Verhoeven2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cav-1 levels were lower in atherosclerotic plaques compared to unaffected arteries and low Cav-1 levels were strongly associated with features of plaque vulnerability. Consistently, neo-intima formation after femoral cuff placement was increased in Cav-1 null mice, which could be reversed by addition of a MMP-inhibitor. Over-expression of the active domain of Cav-1 impaired inflammation, MMP-activity and arterial expansive remodeling. In addition to our descriptive clinical data, we show that patients with high plaque Cav-1 expression seem to be protected from cardiovascular events within 30 days after surgery, making Cav-1 the first available plaque biomarker with a prognostic value. The concept on local plaque markers that are predictive for adverse cardiovascular events that originate elsewhere in the vascular system is currently explored.</p><p>Several processes such as elevated proteolytic activity, inflammation, and expansive remodeling are directly related to plaque rupture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Hansson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Galis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Pasterkamp1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Using different experimental approaches including cultured cells, animal models and the determination of Cav-1 levels in plaque specimens, we have evaluated the involvement of Cav-1 in the above-mentioned processes. We initially found that Cav-1 levels were inversely associated with MMP-9 activity and the glycosylation status of the MMP inducer, known as EMMPRIN, in carotid plaques. We next tested whether gelatinase activity contributes to enhanced intimal hyperplasia development in injured Cav-1 null femoral arteries. Here, we show that cuffed-arteries in Cav-1 null mice have larger intimal area and intima-media ratio than WT mice. These results are in line with a previous study reporting that carotid artery ligation in Cav-1 null resulted in an increased intimal area response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Hassan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, we studied the contribution of gelatinase to intima formation in Cav-1 null mice; MMPs were pharmacologically targeted using the MMP inhibitor doxycycline. Besides its anti-microbial actions, doxycycline is able to reduce expression and activity of several MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Golub1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. MMP inhibition in Cav-1 null mice resulted in a significant attenuation of the increased intimal formation in Cav-1 null mice.</p><p>The existence of a positive relationship between Cav-1 and MMP-9 and the negative association with MMP-2 in the human specimens is supporting previous observations in which MMP-9 but not MMP-2 is associated with a stable plaque phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Sluijter2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In a previous study, we demonstrated that MMP-2 is strongly associated with the presence of plaque stabilizing smooth muscle cells while MMP-9 is associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Therefore, the negative association of Cav-1 with MMP-9 but not MMP-2 is supporting the hypothesis that Cav-1 is a plaque stabilizing molecule. As mentioned earlier, EMMPRIN glycosylation has previously been associated with either a stable &#x0005b;the 45KD glycosylated form&#x0005d; or an unstable plaque phenotype &#x0005b;the 58KD glycosylated form&#x0005d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Sluijter2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we considered that EMMPRIN glycosylation could be the mechanism by which MMP-9 expression is controlled via Cav-1. For this reason the expression of MMPs and EMMPRIN glycoslyation in relation to Cav-1 were studied in more depth.</p><p>Intracellular delivery of peptides that mimic Cav-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) (Cavtratin) in mouse macrophages and arterial rings impaired gelatinase activity. These results are in agreement with recently published data showing that Cav-1 inhibits MMP-2 activity in the heart and MMP-2 activity can be blocked using purified CSD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Chow1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Another potential mechanism by which Cav-1 might affect MMP cascade might imply changes in glycosylation status of EMMPRIN. It has been shown that up-regulation of Cav-1 prevents transition of EMMPRIN to a highly glycosylated (HG) form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Tang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Tang2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. This HG-EMMPRIN forms a homodimer and augments MMP production and subsequent activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Tang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Tang2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In our in vitro studies we could not demonstrate an effect of Cavtratin on EMMPRIN levels and therefore we could not prove that Cav-1 influences EMMPRIN glycosylation levels. Whether the reduction of Cav-1 levels leads to an increase in EMMPRIN 58kD glycosylation forms requires further investigation.</p><p>MMP-9 activity plays a major role in expansive remodeling in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Galis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Expansive remodeling is clinically associated with aortic aneurysms formation and a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Pasterkamp1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously, it was shown that pharmacological inhibition of MMPs impaired arterial expansion upon vascular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Karwowski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we assessed the inhibitory potential of Cavtratin on this process. Here we show that treatment of mice with Cavtratin significantly reduced carotid expansive remodeling after flow increase. Although mechanically different, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are considered to play similar roles in atherosclerotic expansive remodeling and flow induced expansion of the artery. The current results therefore point to another potential mechanism by which Cav-1 may prevent plaque growth and destabilisation: expansively remodeled lesions may hide accelerated plaque growth with formation of large lipid pools with massive inflammatory response and protease activity that remains clinically silent and untreated for a long time.</p><p>We focused on protease activity as a mechanism by which Cav-1 exerts protective effects that would explain the observed outcomes in the clinical and animal studies. Although our results strongly suggest that a mechanistic link exists between Cav-1 and protease activity, we cannot rule out that Cav-1 has broader anti-inflammatory properties. The lower amount of IL-6 and IL-8 found in plaques with high Cav-1 content indeed suggests the importance of Cav-1 in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cascades associated with atherosclerosis. We also showed that incubation with Cavtratin reduced COX-2 expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Likewise, over-expression of Cav-1 full length in macrophages was capable of reducing inflammation via a MAPK-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Wang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The factors that are driving Cav-1 down-regulation during atherogenesis need further investigation. The clinical descriptive data obtained in this study may be helpful to generate hypothesis to answer these questions. Interestingly, we have found that women showed significantly higher Cav-1 expression levels than men. It is known that Cav-1 expression levels are up-regulated upon estrogen treatment in vascular smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, this observation could suggest that Cav-1 is a potential player in gender associated differences observed in atherosclerotic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Hellings3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Low expression levels of Cav-1 were observed in restenotic plaques, although restenotic plaques in general have a fibrous phenotype with high smooth muscle cell content. However, these plaques are in a highly proliferative status. Cav-1 is now recognized as an inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and decreased Cav-1 expression has been linked to increased smooth muscle cell proliferation in human atheroma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Schwencke1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the low levels of Cav-1 found in restenotic and unstable plaques could be related to a hyperproliferative cell phenotype.</p><p>Next to the descriptive clinical observations, we also found a relation between local Cav-1 expression and new peri-operative (30 days) vascular events. The ATHERO-EXPRESS is the first vascular bio-bank with a longitudinal design which allows studies on locally expressed biomarkers in the atherosclerotic plaque as surrogate marker to identify the so-called vulnerable patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Hellings1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This unique design allows investigating the process of atherosclerotic plaque progression independent of the traditionally identified vulnerable plaque characteristics as defined by post-mortem series. In the current study, all patients in the group with high Cav-1 levels (&#x0003e;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;median level) did not suffer any adverse event in the peri-operative period. This suggests that down-regulation of Cav-1 levels in the vascular tree may induce a vulnerable status and atherothrombotic events, while patients with high Cav-1 levels seem protected. In addition, patients with a history of myocardial infarction had lower levels of Cav-1, supporting the relation between local plaque levels of Cav-1 and vulnerability for vascular events. A systemic predisposition to vascular events and plaque irregularity beyond classical cardiovascular risk factors has been shown on basis of carotid angiograms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Rothwell1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> . Since the systemic vulnerability ultimately leads to formation of an unstable plaque, it is conceivable that the atherosclerotic plaque hides information regarding systemic vulnerability. Although we observed a trend towards lower risk of vascular events in patients with high Cav-1 during follow-up after 30 days, the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate a strong reduction of Cav-1 levels in human carotid plaques in comparison to non-atherosclerotic arteries. Low Cav-1 levels were associated with signs of plaque vulnerability and conversely, plaque Cav-1 levels showed a positive correlation with plaque stabilizing elements. Clinical follow-up revealed that high Cav-1 levels were associated with absence of major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days of surgery.</p><p>Previous reports have shown other <italic>in vivo</italic> actions of Cavtratin targeting inflammation, tumor progression and right ventricle hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002612-Bucci1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref

as a novel stabilizing factor in human atherosclerosis.</p><p>Although our data demonstrate that Cav-1 expression levels influence MMP activity within the plaques contributing to plaque instability, we can not rule out at this point other possibilities regarding how Cav-1 might influence plaque stability such as reduction in the total number of Caveolae and/or effects on plaque vascularisation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors are grateful to Els Busser and Chaylendra Strijder for their technical support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
