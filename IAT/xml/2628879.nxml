Initially, these cells evaginate from the foregut endoderm to form the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds that later fuse to form the proper pancreas. The pancreatic epithelium proliferates and branches into the surrounding mesenchyme to form a highly branched epithelial sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Concomitant with branching morphogenesis, cells of the pancreatic ductal epithelium differentiate into Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3)-expressing endocrine precursors through regulation of Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. During the secondary transition which starts around embryonic day (E)13, these Ngn3-positive progenitors differentiate into hormone-producing islet cells which delaminate and migrate out into the surrounding mesenchyme to initiate clustering into vascularised islets of Langerhans, consisting of the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b5;-, &#x003b4;- and PP-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although morphological evidence for delamination of endocrine cells from ducts was first shown by Pictet and Rutter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the delamination and migration processes are poorly understood. Regarding the potential mechanisms for delamination, it has been proposed that it may involve breaking down the basal lamina, e.g. through the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This hypothesis was tested by analysing mice deficient for MMP2 and MMP9 or overexpressing TIMP1, an inhibitor of MMPs, during pancreas development. However neither endocrine cell delamination nor islet cell migration was effected in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, these results are consistent with electron micrographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] which provide morphological evidence for cells not breaking through the basal lamina during delamination, but rather budding off with a piece of the basal lamina intact around the delaminating endocrine cells. Thus, other processes are likely to be responsible for islet cell delamination during islet morphogenesis. Insights into the potential mechanisms for islet cell migration have been contributed by gene ablation studies demonstrating that Wnt5a and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor are required for migration of newly formed &#x003b2; cells from the ductal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the mechanism of action remains unknown. Furthermore, the fact that these mice succumb to other severe phenotypes shortly after birth, suggests that it cannot be excluded that the pancreas phenotype is secondary to other phenotypes.</p><p>Cell migration requires dynamic regulation of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, as well as of cytoskeletal rearrangement. Pioneering work highlight Rho-GTPases as key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and lamellipodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Rho family of small GTPases act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Numerous reports have demonstrated an active role of the Rho-GTPase member Rac1 in cell migration and cell-cell adhesion in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and Rac1 null mutant mice show severe developmental defects, including failure to form the three germ layers during gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], precluding studies of its role in later processes such as organogenesis. In Drosophila, Rac1 regulates both tubulogenesis and dorsal closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting an important <italic>in vivo </italic>role of Rac1 in both cell migration and cell-cell adhesion. Notably, a common denominator when Rac1 function is perturbed is consequences on E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, inconsistent results, such as Rac1 being capable of both promoting and inhibiting E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion, make it difficult to extract a clear picture of how Rac1 regulates E-cadherin function <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To shed more light on the <italic>in vivo </italic>function of Rac1 as a regulator of cell-cell adhesion and cell migration during tissue formation and organogenesis, we have addressed its role in pancreatic islet morphogenesis. For this purpose, transgenic mice were generated where a dominant negative form of Rac1 (RacN17) was expressed under regulation of the Rat Insulin Promoter (RIP-RacN17). RacN17 has been extensively used to study Rac1 function both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>(reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). RacN17 has a low affinity for GTP and thereby remains in its inactive GDP bound state. By binding to upstream activating exchange factors (GEFs) it is believed to prevent these factors from activating endogenous Rac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We identify Rac1 as a key signalling molecule regulating migration of endocrine cells away from the ductal epithelium. Changes in the expression and levels of cell-cell contact E-cadherin, suggest that the mechanism of action may involve control of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments show that betacellulin stimulated islet cell spreading and actin remodelling is compromised in transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of Rac1 activity and islet migration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Previously, it was demonstrated that Rac1 mRNA is expressed in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here we show that in the developing pancreas Rac1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all major pancreatic cell types, including ductal, acinar, endocrine and mesenchymal cells at E15.5 and postnatal day (P) 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Notably, the most terminal parts of the ductal tree, including acinar cells, express the highest level of Rac1 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,C</xref>). Results from microarray analysis of E15.5 embryonic pancreas suggest that the closely related Rac2 and Rac3 are expressed to a much lower extent (&#x0003c;5% of Rac1 expression) (data not shown). We speculate that these low levels of Rac2 and Rac3 mRNAs most likely represent either very low level expression within the epithelium or normal expression within haematopoetic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Rac1 mRNA in embryonic and neonatal pancreas</bold>.

Three independent transgenic lines, confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown), expressing comparable levels of the transgene were identified. RacN17 was found to be expressed on average at approximately four fold higher levels compared to endogenous Rac1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;C</xref>, and data not shown). Because all three lines showed the same phenotype, the presented data is from one line. Control experiments demonstrated that expression of the transgene was restricted to insulin-producing cells both in embryos (E17.5) and adults, and that the expression levels of the transgene varied between individual cells within the islets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;L</xref>).

Careful analysis of pancreas development in RIP-RacN17 mice revealed no defects preceding islet morphogenesis, the ductal epithelium showed normal branching and differentiation (data not shown). Whereas delamination of newly differentiated &#x003b2; cells and subsequent clustering into vascularised islet-like structures proceeded normally, movement of islets away from ducts was perturbed. The latter was evident from the observation that islets were consistently found more closely associated with ducts compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Since almost all islets are to some extent in contact with a duct in the neonatal pancreas this phenotype was quantified by estimating the percentage of the islet circumference in contact with a duct at P3, demonstrating a significant increase in islet-duct contact in transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,C,E</xref>). Further analysis showed that this phenotype persisted in the adult (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,D,F</xref>). In support of this finding was the observation that mild collagenase-perfusion resulted in a significantly higher number of transgenic islets attached to ducts compared to wild-type islets &#x02013; a phenotype that could be attributed to stronger islet-ECM interactions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Importantly, control experiments showed that this phenotype was not secondary to an increased ductal area, i.e. the duct/pancreas ratio was the same in wild-type and RIP-RacN17 mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Furthermore, no changes in &#x003b2; cell area, or endocrine cell ratios were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E&#x02013;H</xref>). Finally, careful examination of the final islet morphology and shape revealed more irregularly shaped large islets in RIP-RacN17 mice compared to wild-type littermates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), whereas small and medium sized islets exhibited a normal shape. Altogether, these findings suggest a functional role of Rac1 in islet cell migration and morphogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Blocking Rac1 activation results in impaired migration of &#x003b2; cells</bold>.

However, neither wild-type nor transgenic cells showed any characteristic signs of migratory cells, such as lamellipodia and active remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, rendering this method unfeasible for comparative studies of cell migration <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown).

Therefore, the <italic>in vitro </italic>behaviour of isolated wild-type and RIP-RacN17 islets plated on gelatin-coated dishes was compared. Normally, islets attach to the surface and after a few days in culture they start to plate out on the surface, changing from a three-dimensional to a two-dimensional structure. Interestingly, although transgenic islets attach to the surface, they plate out less efficiently compared to wild-type islets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B,E</xref>). Nonetheless, the transgenic islets that do plate out show the same type of actin remodelling as seen in the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>), suggesting that the actin cytoskeletal rearrangements normally involved in the basic migratory machinery is not blocked in all islets.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Blocking Rac1 activation inhibits plating of islets <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>.

To regulate such events the on and off state of cell-cell adhesion must be dynamically regulated. Although cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is crucial for the initial clustering of islet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], its contribution to movement of islets during islet morphogenesis remains unknown. The fact that numerous reports support a regulatory role of Rac1 in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), led us to investigate whether expression of RacN17 affected E-cadherin function. Since isolation of neonatal islets is not feasible, Western blot analysis cannot be used to quantify E-cadherin protein abundance. As an alternative method quantification of E-cadherin staining intensity was used. Indeed, E-cadherin protein was upregulated in transgenic islets at P3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>), whereas &#x003b2;-catenin levels appeared unaffected (data not shown). Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR on single isolated adult &#x003b2; cells showed a correlation between E-cadherin and RacN17 expression, i.e. cells expressing higher levels of RacN17 expressed higher levels of E-cadherin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), suggesting that Rac1 inhibition stimulates <italic>E-cadherin </italic>transcription and/or E-cadherin mRNA stability. Importantly, Rac1 does not seem to exhibit a general effect on cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion since no/weak correlation was observed between N-cadherin and transgene mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). R-cadherin is also expressed in islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but since it is expressed at low levels and distributed mainly intracellularly (Dahl and Semb, unpublished) it is not considered to contribute to islet cell adhesion.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Deficient activation of Rac1 in &#x003b2; cells correlates with characteristic signs of enhanced cell-cell adhesion</bold>.

The latter may also require proteolytic cleavage of the basal lamina ECM to get access to the surrounding ECM that function as a substratum for cell migration. To investigate whether the impaired migration of the islets away from the pancreatic ducts in RIP-RacN17 mice could be explained by an excessive deposition of ECM around the islets which would physically prevent movement of the islets, the distribution of various islet ECM components were examined. Consistent with the demonstration that islet ECM is mainly produced by blood vessels, which are recruited to islets during islet morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], no change in the deposition of laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin were observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3A&#x02013;F</xref>).

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Rac1 affects islet cell-cell adhesion but appears not to affect expression/distribution of the analysed ECM components.</p></sec><sec><title>Rac1 regulates betacellulin-induced spreading of islets <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To identify the signalling pathway that regulates islet migration through Rac1, two previous observations were of particular interest. First, deficient migration of islets away from ducts was observed in EGF-receptor-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Secondly, Rac1 activity has previously been shown to be dependent on EGF-receptor stimulation in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To investigate whether Rac1 is a downstream signalling component of the EGF-receptor during islet cell migration, isolated islets were cultured in the presence or absence of the EGF-receptor ligand betacellulin. Interestingly, betacellulin stimulated plating of wild-type islets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Consistent with Rac1 acting downstream of the betacellulin/EGF receptor complex, betacellulin's stimulatory activity on islet plating was blocked in RIP-RacN17 islets. These results suggest that Rac1 acts downstream of the EGF-receptor during betacellulin-induced islet cell spreading.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Betacellulin-stimulated plating of islets is blocked when Rac1 function is inhibited</bold>.

In the developing pancreas, islet morphogenesis, including endocrine cell delamination from ducts and islet cell migration, has not been resolved at a cellular and molecular resolution. The fact that these events most likely involve cellular processes that have been reported to be coordinated by Rac1, such as cell migration and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], led us to study the functional role of Rac1 in islet morphogenesis. For this purpose, a dominant negative form of Rac1 was expressed in &#x003b2; cells. We show that blocking Rac1 activity in &#x003b2; cells results in compromised migration of islets away from ducts. In fact, more islets remain in direct contact with ducts. The result can neither be explained by a general developmental delay, nor by an increase in the area of the ductal network. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the function of Rac1 in islet cell migration may be controlled by modulation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Compromised islet cell migration does not result in a major impact on islet cell function, since fasting glucose levels remained unaltered.</p><p>The conclusion that Rac1 is involved in islet cell migration is based on both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>observations. <italic>In vivo</italic>, islet cells normally migrate away from ducts subsequent to delamination and clustering. Blocking Rac1 function resulted in deficient migration away from ducts. To study the migration in more detail we used an <italic>in vitro </italic>model where isolated islets were seeded onto gelatin-coated culture dishes. Normally, islets attach and eventually flatten out due to induced cell spreading. Cell spreading is associated with increased formation of cell-ECM interactions (focal contacts) and actin remodelling by leading edge cells. However, blocking Rac1 function in &#x003b2; cells resulted in reduced islet cell spreading. Altogether, the <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>results suggest that Rac1 is directly involved in the migration of islets and that the underlying mechanism may involve regulation of cell-ECM interactions, cell-cell adhesion, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. The <italic>in vitro </italic>studies show that betacellulin stimulated islet cell spreading and actin remodelling is compromised in transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of Rac1 activity and islet migration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Rac1 has previously been shown to regulate E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. However, the picture is rather complex since Rac1 has been reported to both promote and inhibit E-cadherin function. For example, E-cadherin activity is regulated by endocytosis, and Rac1 has been demonstrated to both promote and block E-cadherin endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To explain such contradictory results, it has been speculated that the effect of Rac1 on E-cadherin endocytosis may depend on different downstream effectors due to the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence in support of Rac1 controlling E-cadherin function during pancreatic islet morphogenesis by demonstrating that blocking Rac1 function in &#x003b2; cells results in increased levels of E-cadherin mRNA and protein. Increased levels of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts may create a more static cell-cell adhesion, which may inhibit the cell movement/rearrangement needed for islets cells to spread <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as for their <italic>in vivo </italic>migration away from ducts. Consistently, recent data demonstrate that the consequence of blocking Rac1 function (either through loss of function mutations or by a dominant negative approach) during Drosophila tubulogenesis, results in perturbed cell rearrangement due to increased E-cadherin protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The observed increase of cell-cell contact E-cadherin may also explain the irregular shape of the largest islets in RIP-RacN17 mice. Normally, islets form by fusion of the initial endocrine cell clusters that appear soon after delamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In order to form the final shape of the mature islet, dynamic cellular rearrangements between neighbouring cells are necessary. Such processes most likely require dynamic changes in cell-cell adhesion and remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. The existence of large islets with an irregular shape in transgenic mice could either be explained by a failure of smaller islets to separate from each other or by perturbed cellular rearrangement in the largest islets. Altogether, our results support the concept that islet migration away from ducts depend on Rac1-mediated regulation of E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal remodelling.</p><p>It has been suggested that migration of endocrine cells away from the ductal epithelium requires degradation of the basal lamina by MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, gene ablation studies of MMPs in the developing pancreas showed no effect on islet formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These results indicate that degradation of the ECM is not necessary for islet migration, suggesting that Rac1's role in islet migration does not involve proteolytic cleavage of ECM components. Furthermore, this conclusion is consistent with the observation that the deposition of basal lamina components, such as laminin and collagen IV, as well as fibronectin was unaffected upon Rac1 inhibition.</p><p>To identify in which signalling pathway Rac1 acts as an effector for islet cell migration, we considered the previous findings that EGF-receptor gene ablation results in a similar phenotype with increased association of islets with ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and that EGF-receptor signalling regulates Rac1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To establish a potential link between Rac1 and EGF-receptor signalling during islet migration, we tested the activity of the EGF-receptor ligand betacellulin on wild-type and RIP-RacN17 islet cell spreading <italic>in vitro</italic>. These experiments showed that betacellulin stimulates islet cell spreading. The fact that betacellulin was unable to promote spreading of transgenic islets suggests that Rac1 acts as a downstream component in the betacellulin/EGF-receptor signalling pathway during islet cell spreading. Apart from the EGF-receptor (erbB-1) betacellulin also binds to erbB-4. However the fact that the expression of erbB-4 in neonatal and adult pancreas is restricted to ductal- and &#x003b1;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggests that betacellulin signals through erbB-1. Based on these results, we propose a model for islet cell migration where betacellulin/EGF-receptor signalling controls the activity of Rac1, which coordinates changes in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and actin rearrangements to facilitate islet cell movement. This model predicts that the reported deficient migration of islets in EGF-receptor-deficient mice is at least in part due to compromised Rac1 activation.</p><p>RacN17 may affect other GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], thus expression of RacN17 could in theory inhibit other Rac members, such as Rac2 and Rac3. However, Rac2 and Rac3 are not expressed in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, RacN17 could affect other Rho-GTPases, such as Cdc42. However, analysis of pancreas specific ablation of Cdc42 shows that the RIP-RacN17 phenotype cannot be attributed to blocking Cdc42 activity (Kesavan and Semb; unpublished). Thus, although we cannot rule out that RacN17 may affect other GTPases in &#x003b2; cells, we believe that the phenotype observed in RIP-RacN17 mice primarily involves Rac1.</p><p>Our model predicts a potential link between EGF-receptor signalling and E-cadherin function via Rac1 in &#x003b2; cells. How does Rac1 control the levels of E-cadherin protein in pancreatic &#x003b2; cell-cell contacts? To this end we provide evidence in support of Rac1 controlling E-cadherin transcription and/or mRNA stability. Post-translational effects may also be operational because a recent study showed that EGF induces macropinocytosis of E-cadherin through Rac1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Based on such findings, we speculate that inhibiting Rac1 could block EGF-induced recycling of E-cadherin, resulting in an accumulation of E-cadherin at the cell surface, thereby creating a more static "on-state" of cell-cell adhesion. Consequently, the mechanism by which betacellulin induces migration of islets through Rac1 could tentatively be explained by an effect on E-cadherin recycling &#x02013; a question to be resolved by future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results provide new insight into how Rac1 controls organogenesis. Specifically, our data support a model where Rac1 signalling controls islet cell migration by modulating E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments show that betacellulin stimulates cell spreading and actin remodelling in wild-type but not transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of Rac1 activity and islet migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results further emphasize Rac1 as a key regulator of cell migration and cell adhesion during tissue and organ morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of transgenic mice</title><p>A cDNA with a C-myc-tagged RacN17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was inserted in to a vector containing 0.7 kb of the Rat Insulin Promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the rabbit &#x003b2; globin intron and polyA sequences.

For the mild Collagenase P treatment we used a lower concentration of the enzyme (0.57 U/ml). The tissue was dispersed by manual shaking and islets were picked manually. To obtain single cells, isolated islets were incubated in Calcium free media (138 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, 3 mM Glucose, 1 mM EGTA 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4) at 37&#x000b0;C for 12 minutes and islets were dissociated by pipetting.

Endocrine cell ratios was determined by quantifying the ratio of the area occupied by glucagon, somatostatin or pancreatic polypeptide compared to the insulin area on ten islet profiles each from the head and tail of pancreata from eight to nine weeks old mice on frozen sections.</p><p>Measurement of the contact between insulin positive islets and DBA positive ducts was used to estimate islet/duct association at P3. To measure the contact between islets and ducts the percentage of the circumference of insulin positive islets in contact with a DBA positive duct on sections was estimated. In total, 50 islets per pancreas were analysed on stained sections separated by 200 &#x003bc;m. Duct distance was estimated by measuring the distance between the islet border, marked by insulin expression and the closest duct, determined by DBA staining and the presence of a lumen. Pancreas from eight to nine weeks old mice were used and 60 islets per pancreas were measured. Sections were separated by 200 &#x003bc;m. Duct area was examined by measuring the percentage of the pancreas area occupied by DBA labelled ductal epithelium on 30 20&#x000d7; images per animal. E-cadherin levels in islets were determined by measuring the average staining intensity of the pixels in the islet relative to acinar cells surrounding the islet on images of 10 &#x003bc;m thick frozen sections. Four regions of acinar cells per islet were measured and six islets per animal were analysed (n = 4). Islet shape was determined by calculating the circularity ratio of 110 islets per animal, marked by a continuous insulin stained area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Briefly, the area (A) of the islet is related to its perimeter (p) in the formula 4&#x003c0;A/p2, which gives a value of one for a perfect circle and the value decreases as the perimeter increases relative to the area indicating an irregular shape of the measured object. The values from the largest ten percent, i.e. the 11 largest islets per animal are presented in the results.
