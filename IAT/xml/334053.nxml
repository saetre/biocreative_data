Here we demonstrate that in mouse strain 129-derived ES cells, the gene is at least 25-fold more efficiently targeted with an isogenic, 129-derived vector (129-pRV8.3) than with a nonisogenic, BALB/c-specific vector (BALB/c-pRV8.3). The two targeting constructs were identical except for allelic differences which were typed by partial sequencing. These included base pair mismatches (2%) and a polymorphic [GTC]-repeat length variation. Both in separate transfections as well as in cotransfections with mixed vectors, homologous disruption of the CKM gene resulted uniquely from the 129-isogenic DNA. Our data confirm earlier observations on requirements for homologous recombination in pro- and eukaryotic systems and indicate that targeting of the CKM locus is highly sensitive to small sequence differences between cognate segments in the endogenous and incoming DNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0018-a" xlink:role="3818"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00226-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3820"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
