We show here that these RGS domains interact with Rab11 and GTP-bound Rab4, the first demonstration of RGS domains binding small GTPases. Rab4 and Rab11 help regulate membrane trafficking through the endocytic recycling pathways by recruiting effector proteins to specific membrane domains. Although D-AKAP2 is primarily cytosolic in HeLa cells, a fraction of the protein localizes to endosomes and can be recruited there to a greater extent by overexpression of Rab4 or Rab11. D-AKAP2 also regulates the morphology of the Rab11-containing compartment, with co-expression causing accumulation of both proteins on enlarged endosomes. Knockdown of D-AKAP2 by RNA interference caused a redistribution of both Rab11 and the constitutively recycling transferrin receptor to the periphery of cells. Knockdown also caused an increase in the rate of transferrin recycling, suggesting that D-AKAP2 promotes accumulation of recycling proteins in the Rab4/Rab11-positive endocytic recycling compartment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">F32GM082146</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">DK070856</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">DK48370</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">DK054441</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dual-specific A-kinase-anchoring protein 2 (D-AKAP2/AKAP10), <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6"><sup>5</sup></xref> which was first discovered as a binding partner for both the RI and RII regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), is a ubiquitous scaffold protein containing two tandem RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling) domains and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO1)-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The PDZ-binding motif was subsequently shown to interact with the multi-PDZ domain proteins PDZK1 and NHERF-1, allowing D-AKAP2 to link indirectly to membrane proteins such as the sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter (NaP<sub>i</sub>-IIa), which is regulated by trafficking into and out of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). D-AKAP2 is considered the sole member of its own subfamily of mammalian RGS proteins and is the only one to contain two RGS domains, referred to as RGS-A and RGS-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). RGS proteins contain conserved &#x003b1;-helical domains of around 120 residues, which usually interact with heterotrimeric G protein &#x003b1;-subunits, in many cases acting as GTPase-activating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry experiments suggest that RGS-B folds into the traditional &#x003b1;-helical structure, RGS-A is predicted to have a &#x0223c;122 residue insertion (residues 170&#x02013;291), but it is unknown how RGS-A, which is predicted to have a &#x0223c;122-residue insertion (residues 170&#x02013;291), folds or interacts with RGS-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). D-AKAP2 has so far demonstrated no specific interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, and no ability to activate them, raising the possibility of nontraditional targets.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>In this study, we show that the RGS domains of D-AKAP2 interact not with heterotrimeric G proteins but with the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab11, which regulate endocytic recycling. Endocytic membrane traffic determines the cellular destination of internalized receptors and other membrane proteins, receptor ligands, lipid, and solute molecules. The Rab subfamily of Ras-like GTPases is known to play a key role in regulating such processes as vesicle formation, motility, and docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Rab proteins help to establish the identity of membrane compartments and organize distinct membrane domains, typically by interacting in their GTP-bound active state with downstream effectors, which may be recruited to membranes through combinatorial interactions in a highly specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The transferrin receptor (TfnR) is a commonly studied marker of constitutive recycling. TfnR endocytosed in Rab5-positive vesicles is delivered initially to Rab5/Rab4-positive peripheral tubular-vesicular structures called sorting endosomes or early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Bound transferrin, after releasing its iron in the sorting endosomes, is segregated with its receptor and the vast majority of lipid molecules and membrane proteins into the Rab4 domain, where they are separated from the soluble molecules in the lumen of the sorting endosomes by the pinching off of narrow membrane tubules, a process called &#x0201c;geometry-based sorting&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The receptor then recycles to the plasma membrane either directly in the &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; recycling pathway, which is thought to be regulated by Rab4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), or indirectly via the Rab4/Rab11-positive endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) in the &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; recycling pathway. The ERC is a collection of tubular structures associated with microtubules, which in many cell types is condensed around the microtubule-organizing center but in others is more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Rab11 localizes mainly to the ERC and regulates trafficking through this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here, we show that through interactions with Rab4 and Rab11, D-AKAP2 can alter the morphology of the Rab11 compartment and affect the recycling of the transferrin receptor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>The following monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibodies were used: AKAP10 mAb (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan); transferrin receptor mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA); LAMP-2 mAb (H4B4, developed by J.

Propidium iodide was added to cells just prior to analysis in order to distinguish broken cells. The amount of total fluorescent transferrin remaining in each cell was quantified on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) by counting 10,000 intact cells from each plate, with three plates per condition. The mean fluorescence intensity &#x000b1; S.E. is reported after subtracting the background fluorescence of control cells with no added transferrin and then normalizing to the fluorescence of the control cells at 0 min. To determine the statistical significance of differences between control and knockdown plates, we used an independent two-sample, two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test with a <italic>p</italic> value for type 1 error.

Cell fractionation showed that endogenous D-AKAP2 is almost entirely cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Transfection of D-AKAP2 tagged with mCherry (mCh) also showed diffuse cytosolic localization in most cells. However, imaging of live cells revealed a subpopulation of mCh-D-AKAP2 molecules localized to dynamic and motile puncta that was visible against the cytosolic background. D-AKAP2 in these puncta colocalized significantly with internalized fluorescently labeled transferrin, a marker of the endocytic recycling pathway (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.022582/DC1">supplemental Movie 1</ext-link>). Some fixed cells also displayed visible accumulation of mCh-D-AKAP2 on what appeared to be intracellular membranes, and confocal microscopy confirmed that many of these puncta colocalized with internalized transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Staining cells for various membrane markers also revealed colocalization with a subset of the endogenous transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>), which was more widely distributed than pulse-chased transferrin. D-AKAP2 showed partial colocalization with the early endosome marker EEA1 but most often appeared to be present on adjacent endosomes or endosomal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). D-AKAP2 showed very little colocalization with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, lysosomes, peroxisomes, or mitochondria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.022582/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). D-AKAP2 was suggested previously to localize partially to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).

D-AKAP2 not only colocalized with Rab4 and Rab11, two Rab proteins known to regulate endocytic recycling, but also showed increased endosomal localization upon co-expression with the Rab proteins. This was especially true of Rab11; its co-expression with D-AKAP2 caused accumulation of both proteins on enlarged, dynamic endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.022582/DC1">supplemental Movie 2</ext-link>). These enlarged endosomes were still accessible to internalized transferrin (data not shown). Neither the GDP-locked form (dominant negative S25N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)) nor the GTP-locked form (GTPase-deficient S20V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)) of Rab11 was as effective as WT in recruiting D-AKAP2 onto endosomes, implying that the cycle of GTP hydrolysis was important for their colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). Rab11 Q70L also has been used by several groups as a putative GTPase-deficient mutant by analogy to other Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), but it has been found that S20V, and not Q70L, acts as a dominant active mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

The increased internalization of transferrin during the pulse was not due to a change in the rate of endocytosis but rather to increased surface expression of the receptor, presumably caused by the faster recycling (data not shown). These results suggest that endogenous D-AKAP2 may promote the accumulation of transferrin in the slow recycling pathway of the Rab4/Rab11-containing ERC. In the D-AKAP2 knockdown cells, the increased rate of traffic to the plasma membrane may exceed the rate of exocytosis, resulting in increased localization of internalized transferrin near the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of D-AKAP2 increases the rate of transferrin recycling.</bold><italic>A&#x02013;F</italic>, after 2 days of treatment with control (<italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>) or D-AKAP2 siRNA (<italic>D&#x02013;F</italic>), HeLa cells were incubated for 20 min with fluorescently labeled transferrin and then chased with unlabeled transferrin for 0 (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), 15 (<italic>B</italic> and <italic>E</italic>), or 30 min (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>F</italic>) before being washed and fixed.

Another mechanism would be by increasing the rate of trafficking from the ERC to the plasma membrane. The former model would predict a decrease in the amount of colocalization of internalized transferrin with Rab11. The fact that the knockdown of D-AKAP2 had similar effects on the membrane compartments of endogenous Rab11 and TfnR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>I</italic>), which continued to colocalize, suggests that D-AKAP2 is not required for trafficking from the sorting endosomes to the ERC. Likewise, pulse-chased transferrin continued to colocalize with mCh-Rab11 in knockdown cells (data not shown). We therefore prefer a model in which the rate of traffic from the ERC to the plasma membrane is increased in the D-AKAP2 knockdown, leading to a shift in the localization of TfnR and Rab11 toward the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>H</italic>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although the mechanisms that regulate recycling of endocytosed proteins back to the plasma membrane are poorly understood, the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab11 are known to play key roles. Here we report that D-AKAP2 can bind to both Rab4 and Rab11 through its two RGS domains, recruiting D-AKAP2 from the cytosol onto endosomes of the recycling pathway. This represents a novel interaction for RGS domains, which typically interact with heterotrimeric G proteins rather than with Ras-like G proteins.</p><p>D-AKAP2 appears to act as a traditional effector for Rab4, binding most stably to GTP&#x003b3;S-bound Rab4 or to its GTP-locked mutant form. Rab11, on the other hand, interacts in a more nontraditional manner. Three observations support the presence of this protein complex: 1) Rab11 co-immunoprecipitated with D-AKAP2 from human cells, 2) the RGS domains interacted with Rab11 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and 3) overexpression of Rab11 recruited D-AKAP2 to Rab11-positive endosomes. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, D-AKAP2 interacted with both dominant negative and wild-type Rab11, but only wild-type Rab11, and not the GDP- and GTP-locked forms, formed stable complexes in mammalian cells. Rab effectors are often recruited to membranes by the coordinated interactions of multiple proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, the preference of D-AKAP2 for wild-type Rab11 in mammalian cells could be because the mutant forms do not localize to the proper membrane microdomains to make additional stabilizing interactions. The lack of binding to the GTP-locked form could also indicate that D-AKAP2 may have guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward Rab11. If this were the case, D-AKAP2 could serve to activate and recruit Rab11 to membranes containing active Rab4 or to maintain Rab11 in an active state while in the Rab4/Rab11-containing ERC.</p><p>Because the interactions of a number of effectors with Rab proteins are mediated by coiled coils or helical hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), the helical RGS domains could present a similar binding interface. The RGS domains of D-AKAP2 may constitute a single functional unit, as neither domain alone showed Rab binding by yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>L</italic>) or showed strong recruitment to endosomes in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>J</italic>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.022582/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>R</italic></ext-link>). It is possible that simultaneous interactions with both Rab proteins may be important for the localization of D-AKAP2 to endosomes. No protein is currently known to bind simultaneously to both Rab4 and Rab11. The Rab-coupling protein was found to interact with both Rab4 and Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), but subsequent results indicated that <italic>in vitro</italic> they share the same binding site and that <italic>in vivo</italic> Rab11 is probably the dominant interacting partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported that a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen for targets of Rab proteins had identified D-AKAP2 as an interacting partner for Rab proteins 4A/B, 14, 19, 40A/B/C, and 41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The fragments of D-AKAP2 pulled from the mouse cDNA library appear to be similar to the 292&#x02013;662 truncation, which showed faint localization to GFP-Rab4 endosomes but did not accumulate with Rab11 on enlarged endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>H</italic>). Taken together, these results suggest that the second half of RGS-A may combine with RGS-B (residues 292&#x02013;513) to form the Rab4-binding domain, whereas the first half of RGS-A (residues 120&#x02013;291) may be necessary but not sufficient for Rab11 binding. RGS-A is atypical among RGS proteins for its large insertion predicted to be between helices &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>D-AKAP2 appears to regulate the morphology of the Rab11-containing compartment, with co-expression causing enlarged Rab11 endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>) and knockdown causing movement of Rab11 to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>I</italic>) and an accompanying increase in the rate of transferrin recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>G</italic>). D-AKAP2 may act in a fashion analogous to Rabaptin-5, a divalent Rab effector that is also primarily cytosolic but can be recruited onto specific endosomal domains by simultaneous interactions with Rab4 and Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Rabaptin-5 inhibits the formation of recycling vesicles <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas its depletion accelerates their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Overexpression of Rabaptin-5 leads to enlarged endosomes and delayed recycling of transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Although Rabaptin-5 would be expected to regulate recycling from Rab5/Rab4-positive sorting endosomes, D-AKAP2 may similarly inhibit recycling from Rab4/Rab11 domains.</p><p>Given its carboxyl-terminal interactions, it seems likely that D-AKAP2 helps mediate PKA- or PDZ-dependent regulation of trafficking. D-AKAP2 has been shown to interact with the PDZ-containing proteins NHERF-1 and PDZK1/NHERF-3 through a carboxyl-terminal type I PDZ ligand, TKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Such PDZ ligands can act as transplantable &#x0201c;recycling sequences&#x0201d; that are sufficient to cause endocytosed receptors such as the &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor to recycle rapidly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We found that D-AKAP2 could recruit PDZK1 to endosomes but not if its PDZ ligand was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic>). At endogenous protein levels, the PDZ domain proteins may help recruit D-AKAP2 to membrane domains rich in proteins containing PDZ-binding motifs.</p><p>PKA tethered to D-AKAP2 may have several effects. Binding either type I or type II PKA could affect the binding of other proteins to D-AKAP2 and vice versa. PKA could modulate D-AKAP2 function by phosphorylating its conserved consensus phosphorylation site (residue 554). Proteins binding to D-AKAP2 could also be targets, because phosphorylation of PDZK1 by PKA has been shown to cause increased protein expression of a PDZK1 binding partner, scavenger receptor class B type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Finally, PKA anchored by D-AKAP2 could phosphorylate recycling membrane proteins directly. Phosphorylation of aquaporin-2 by PKA, for instance, is required for its vasopressin-induced translocation from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Although the biological function of D-AKAP2 has remained unknown for many years, it has been linked genetically to disease in humans. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) causing an I646V transition in the PKA-binding motif of D-AKAP2 shows the strongest correlation with morbidity or mortality of 6,500 SNPs studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The I646V SNP, which increases the affinity for the RI regulatory subunit of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), is associated with myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), heart rate dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and familial breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In mice, a gene disruption deleting the last 51 residues of D-AKAP2 acts in a dominant negative fashion to increase cardiac arrhythmia, cholinergic sensitivity, and premature adult deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our results show that the interactions of D-AKAP2 with Rab4 and Rab11 allow it to regulate protein recycling and suggest that these disease phenotypes could be the result of altered surface expression of various receptors or channels. D-AKAP2 may help fill several gaps in our understanding of membrane trafficking, including how Rab11 links to Rab4, how PDZ ligands link to the recycling machinery, and how PKA regulates trafficking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_47_32869__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" xlink:href="supp_M109.022582_jbc.M109.022582-3.mov"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_M109.022582_jbc.M109.022582-1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="supp_M109.022582_jbc.M109.022582-2.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" xlink:href="supp_M109.022582_jbc.M109.022582-4.mov"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant DK054441.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.022582/DC1">supplemental Figs.
