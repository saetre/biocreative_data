In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, antimicrobial peptides are key contributors to host defense. Antimicrobial peptide gene expression is regulated by the IMD and Toll pathways. Bacterial peptidoglycans trigger these pathways, through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). DAP-type peptidoglycan triggers the IMD pathway via PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, while lysine-type peptidoglycan is an agonist for the Toll pathway through PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD. Recent work has shown that the intensity and duration of the immune responses initiating with these receptors is tightly regulated at multiple levels, by a series of negative regulators. Through two-hybrid screening with PGRP-LC, we identified Rudra, a new regulator of the IMD pathway, and demonstrate that it is a critical feedback inhibitor of peptidoglycan receptor signaling. Following stimulation of the IMD pathway, <italic>rudra</italic> expression was rapidly induced. In cells, RNAi targeting of <italic>rudra</italic> caused a marked up-regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. <italic>rudra</italic> mutant flies also hyper-activated antimicrobial peptide genes and were more resistant to infection with the insect pathogen <italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovora</italic>. Molecularly, Rudra was found to bind and interfere with both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, disrupting their signaling complex. These results show that Rudra is a critical component in a negative feedback loop, whereby immune-induced gene expression rapidly produces a potent inhibitor that binds and inhibits pattern recognition receptors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The innate immune system controls the immediate response to infection. Innate immunity relies on germline encoded receptors, receptors that are present at birth, to recognize germs and trigger a protective response. Invertebrates (i.e., insects) rely on innate immunity to survive in microbial-rich environments, such as rotting fruit. However, uncontrolled innate immune responses are dangerous, leading to severe pathologies like sepsis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and lupus. Therefore, the intensity and duration of the innate immune response is kept in-check by multiple regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have identified a new feedback regulator of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> (the fruit fly) immune response, which we call Rudra. Using various approaches, we show that in the absence of Rudra the innate immune system is hyper-activated. This elevated immune response leads to better protection against bacterial infection. On the other hand, when present in excess, Rudra prevents the activation of the immune response. Furthermore, we show that Rudra turns off the immune response by binding to the receptors that are responsible for detecting bacteria, thereby preventing downstream responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects rely primarily on innate immune responses to fight pathogens.

Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data, which indicated involvement of the RHIM-like domain for interaction, a mutant form of PGRP-LE lacking the RHIM motif (&#x00394;98-113) showed little interaction with Rudra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000120-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Using a set of large deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000120-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PGRP-LC was found to be essential for association with Rudra. Removal of the first 144 amino acids decreased Rudra interaction, while removal of nearly the entire cytoplasmic (&#x00394;1-253) domain abolished interaction. The PGRP-LC extracellular domain was not involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000120-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We then attempted to map the PGRP-LC interaction more finely with a set of mutants that span the entire cytoplasmic domain with sequential 50 amino acid deletions. However, Rudra co-immunoprecipitated with all of these deletion mutants, suggesting some redundancy in the interaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000120.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The yeast two-hybrid data suggest that some of the interacting activity involves the PGRP-LC RHIM domain, while the larger deletions suggest another interaction motif likely lies in the first 144 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000120-g001">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Overall, we conclude that Rudra directly interacts with the signaling domains of PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE.

To keep the immune response properly modulated, the Toll and IMD pathways are controlled at multiple levels by multiple negative regulators. In this study, we have characterized a new negative feedback regulator of the IMD pathway. <italic>rudra</italic> transcript is rapidly induced following septic infection, and <italic>rudra</italic> mutant flies or <italic>rudra</italic> knockdown cells over-express antimicrobial peptides. In the case of <italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovora</italic> infection, this elevated level of AMP production leads to increased survival. A similar phenotype was reported for mutants lacking Caspar, which is thought to inhibit downstream signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000120-Kim1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The results presented here, in cells and flies, demonstrate that <italic>rudra</italic> is a key component in a negative feedback loop that keeps the IMD pathway in check.</p><p>In addition to these loss-of-function results, over-expression of <italic>rudra</italic> potently blocked signaling through the IMD pathway, both in cells and in flies. Moreover, we exploited this activity to analyze which steps in the IMD pathway are inhibited by Rudra. Using various molecular assays to monitor different PGN-induced events in the IMD pathway, we found that Rudra interfered with cleavage of IMD. Signaling mediated by receptor over-expression was also inhibited by Rudra, but this was not the case for signaling induced by over-expression of downstream components. Together, these data strongly support the notion that Rudra interferes with receptor function and is consistent with the association between Rudra and the receptors PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE.</p><p>Using assays in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, human cells and <italic>in vitro</italic>, Rudra was shown to interact directly with PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE. The interaction between PGRP-LE and Rudra required the RHIM-like domain of PGRP-LE, which is also critical for signaling by this receptor. However, the region through which PGRP-LC interacts with Rudra is less clear and likely involves multiple, partly redundant interfaces. Rudra also interacted with the <italic>imd</italic> protein. Moreover, Rudra interfered with the interaction between the receptor PGRP-LC and IMD, destabilizing the receptor signaling complex. From these results, we propose that Rudra is a negative feedback regulator that down modulates the IMD pathway by binding the receptors and interrupting the associations with their cognate signaling adaptor IMD. This regulatory loop is critical to properly regulate the immune response.</p><p>In agreement with the data presented here, Kleino et al. (2008) recently reported that <italic>rudra</italic>/CG15678 is a negative regulator of the IMD pathway, although they refer to this gene as <italic>poor Imd response upon knock-in</italic> (<italic>pirk</italic>). They showed that <italic>rudra/pirk</italic> is rapidly induced following infection, similar to the data presented here, and further demonstrated that <italic>rudra</italic> induction is dependent on Relish, both in cells and in flies. Using reporter assays in S2 cells, they found that Pirk inhibits IMD signaling but not the Toll pathway. With transgenic RNAi fly lines, they also found that knockdown of <italic>pirk</italic> caused the hyper-expression of the antimicrobial peptide genes. Also, flies over-expressing Pirk blocked the activation of the IMD pathway and were more susceptible infection. These results are consistent with the data presented here, although we have characterized a mutant allele of <italic>rudra</italic> and additionally show that this mutant exhibits enhanced protection against <italic>Erwinia</italic> infection. The data presented here also expand on the findings of Kleino et al. (2008) by showing that Rudra not only interacts with both PGRP-LC and IMD, but also that these interactions with Rudra disrupt the direct association between PGRP-LC and IMD. Kleino et al. (2008) reported that central portion of Rudra consists of two repetitive amino acid elements of unknown function and structure, which they named the Pirk domain. The Pirk domain is required for the interaction with IMD, but not with PGRP-LC. Rudra does not contain obvious homology to any other protein motifs, and no mammalian homologs are readily detected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000120-Kleino1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, multiple mechanisms involved in regulating the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response have come to light.
