The mechanism of PmpD post-translational processing and the role of its protein products in the pathogenesis of chlamydial infection have not been very well elucidated to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we examined the expression and post-translational processing of the protein product of the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene during the life cycle of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars A, D, and L2. Each of these three serovars targets different human organs and tissues and encodes a different <italic>pmpD</italic> gene nucleotide sequence. Our quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results demonstrate that the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene is up-regulated at 12&#x02013;24 hours after infection regardless of the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> serovar. This up-regulation is coincidental with the period of exponential growth and replication of reticulate bodies (RB) of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and indicates a probable similarity in function of <italic>pmpD</italic> in serovars A, D, and L2 of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified the protein products of post-translational processing of PmpD of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 and propose a double pathway model for PmpD processing, with one cleavage site between the passenger and autotransporter domains and the other site in the middle of the passenger domain. Notably, when <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infected culture cells were subjected to low (28&#x000b0;C) temperature, PmpD post-translational processing and secretion was found to be uninhibited in the resulting persistent infection. In addition, confocal microscopy of cells infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> confirms our earlier hypothesis that PmpD is secreted outside <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and its secretion increases with growth of the chlamydial inclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The results of this current study involving multiple <italic>Chlamydia</italic> serovars support the general consensus that the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene is maximally expressed at mid infection and provide new information about PmpD as an autotransporter protein which is post-translationally processed and secreted outside <italic>Chlamydia</italic> during normal and low temperature induced persistent chlamydial infection.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is an important human pathogen causing a variety of infections.

The <italic>pmpD</italic> gene transcriptional pattern with up-regulation at 12&#x02013;24 h p.i. described in this study suggests that the PmpD protein may be involved in growth and division of chlamydial RBs. These results are in agreement with our earlier results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and those of Belland <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Belland1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, Nicholson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and Maurer <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Murer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have no explanation for why our results differ from those of Nunes <italic>et al</italic>, but different infection conditions, dissimilar primer designs, and distinctive qRT-PCR parameters may have led to those discrepancies. Between all three serovars, <italic>pmpD</italic> expression was highest in serovar A and lowest in serovar D which might be explained by differential timing of the developmental phases during the life cycle of these serovars. Notably, the pattern of <italic>pmpD</italic> gene temporal transcription in both a clinical isolate and the prototype strain of serovar D was nearly identical, but in serovar L2 it was not. In addition, the <italic>pmpD</italic> relative expression in prototype strains was significantly higher than in clinical isolates during the period of exponential growth and replication of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We believe that the differences in <italic>pmpD</italic> expression patterns may be due to the divergence in the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene sequence in prototype and clinical strains or mRNA amounts which may vary from strain to strain based specific needs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Nunes2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results of MS analysis indicated that the creation of the &#x02248;120 kDa protein represents classical autotransporter pathway of processing of PmpD with a cleavage site between the PD and TD (aa 1242 and 1243) recognized by outer membrane proteases. However, the peptide composition of the &#x02248;65 and 80 kDa proteins led us to the speculation that an additional/alternative cleavage site located in the middle of the PD (between aa 698 and 699) is recognized in order to allow its secretion outside bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Henderson2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Dautin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

The IMF microscopy with pAb against different PmpD fragments demonstrated that the PD is linked to the surface of RBs prior to its secretion into the inclusion lumen and the TD which is a part of the &#x02248;80 kDa protein, remains inside the cell wall of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Interestingly, the &#x02248;30 kDa protein band correlating to the cleaved TD of PmpD was never found in our experiments suggesting its quick degradation due to potential high toxicity of the beta-barrel to bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Vandahl1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Turner1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The PmpD post-translational products identified in this work (&#x02248;120, 65, and 80 kDa fragments) are very similar to those described by Swanson <italic>et al</italic> (111, 73, and 82 kDa fragments) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Swanson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Swanson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Swanson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> proposed the cleavage of PmpD with the primary formation of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-associated 73 and 82 kDa fragments starting at mid (24 h p.i.) infection and secondary formation of a soluble 111 kDa fragment followed by its cleavage and subsequent production of 73 and 30 kDa proteins occurring at late (30&#x02013;48 h p.i.) infection. Contrary to their findings, we found the PD of PmpD (the &#x02248;120 kDa protein) secreted as early as 24 h p.i. Two additional PmpD post-translational products which resulted from non-conventional processing, the &#x02248;65 kDa and 80 kDa fragments, appear at later time points after infection (30&#x02013;48 h p.i.). Notably, the soluble 30 kDa segment of PmpD first described by Swanson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Swanson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, never reacted in an immunoblot with antibodies employed in our studies which could be due to recognition of different epitopes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> by antibodies generated in our study. The mode of PmpD processing suggested in our work is supported by that of Wehrl <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Wehrl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, who also proposed the earlier cleavage of the PD of PmpD during the life cycle of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>. Notably, confocal microscopy demonstrated staining of the protein material outside of chlamydial organisms in the inclusion lumen with the anti-PmpD pAb starting at 24 h after infection, thus confirming the timing of PmpD secretion in an immunoblot.</p><p>To investigate the mode of action of penicillin in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, PmpD post-translational processing was examined at low (28&#x000b0;C) temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing expression of a Pmp during persistent infection. We demonstrated that the incomplete chlamydial developmental cycle which occurs during low temperature induced persistent infection does not prevent PmpD post-translational processing. Thus, it appears that penicillin specifically inhibits membrane proteases including signal peptidase I and other serine proteases which cleave an autotransporter protein during its multistep processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Wilmouth1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Kuo1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> resulting in blockage of PmpD processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings that the PmpD processing and secretion outside <italic>Chlamydia</italic> are not inhibited during low temperature induced persistent infection indicate that PmpD and its post-translational products may play an important role in survival of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in harsh environmental conditions contributing to mediation between the host cell and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. However, the PmpD expression pattern during persistent infection could be different depending on the factors inducing this infection. For instance, Klos <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Klos1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and Goellner <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Goellner1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that persistent infection induced by variety of factors resulted in dissimilar transcription pattern of a range of genes in <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. psittaci</italic> respectively. In addition, it was shown that another important component of the chlamydial outer membrane, the MOMP protein, was so greatly reduced during IFN-&#x003b3; induced infection that anti-MOMP mAb did not stain chlamydial inclusions in culture cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005191-Beatty1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, though in our study, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> organisms were clearly stained with anti-MOMP antibodies. More experiments need to be carried out to explain the role of chlamydial Pmps in the pathogenesis of persistent chlamydial infection.</p><p>In summary, the variability in the nucleotide sequence of the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene of C. trachomatis serovars A, D, and L2, which have different tissue tropisms, did not lead to significant dissimilarities in the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene transcription profiling and the PmpD protein post-translational processing pattern, thus indicating that the <italic>pmpD</italic> gene may have similar functions in all three <italic>Chlamydia</italic> serovars. In addition, the peptide profile of the PmpD post-translational products, the mechanism of their formation, and their localization during the chlamydial life cycle are in agreement with the general theory that PmpD is an autotransporter protein.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Oleg Denisenko for critical review and for editing this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005191-Stephens1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stephens</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lammel</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Marathe</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Genome sequence of an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans: <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.</article-title><source>Science.</source><volume>282(5389)</volume><fpage>754</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9784136</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0005191-Carlson1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Porcella</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><name><surname>McClarty</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Caldwell</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Comparative genomic analysis of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> oculotropic and genitotropic strains.</article-title><source>Infect Immun.</source><volume>73(10)</volume><fpage>6407</fpage><lpage>18</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16177312</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0005191-Thomson1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name><name><surname>Holden</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Carder</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lennard</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Lockey</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2008</year><article-title><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>: genome sequence analysis of lymphogranuloma venereum isolates.</article-title><source>Genome Res.</source><volume>18(1)</volume><fpage>161</fpage><lpage>71.
