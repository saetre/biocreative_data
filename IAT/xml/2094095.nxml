Although their success in escaping neutralization by pre-formed antibody is indisputable, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Glycoprotein B (gB) is the most conserved component of the herpesvirus entry machinery and its N terminus (gB-NT) is a common neutralization target. We used murid herpesvirus-4 to determine how gB-NT contributes to the virus&#x02013;antibody interaction. Deleting gB-NT had no obvious impact on virus replication, but paradoxically increased virion neutralization by immune sera. This reflected greater antibody access to neutralization epitopes on gH/gL, with which gB was associated. gB-NT itself was variably protected against antibody by O-linked glycans; on virions from epithelial cells it was protected almost completely. gB-NT therefore provides a protective and largely protected cover for a vulnerable part of gH/gL. The conservation of predicted glycosylation sites in other mammalian herpesvirus gB-NTs suggests that this evasion mechanism is widespread. Interestingly, the gB-NT glycans that blocked antibody binding could be targeted for neutralization instead by a lectin, suggesting a means of therapeutic counterattack.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutralizing antibody is the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of anti-viral vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 2006</xref>). Persistent viruses present a major challenge to vaccine development because they have evolved to coexist with antibody. Developing new strategies to control their spread means understanding why neutralization normally fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Burton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Herpesviruses are among the most sophisticated of all persistent viruses and provide a template for understanding some of the limits viruses impose on antibody function. Once a herpesvirus has entered its host, latency and cell&#x02013;cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Peeters <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dingwell <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>) offer few opportunities for neutralization; antibody must act instead through mechanisms such as cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sissons and Oldstone, 1980</xref>). &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-Herpesviruses counteract this with viral IgG Fc receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Johnson and Feenstra, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Nagashunmugam <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Atalay <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). &#x003b3;-Herpesviruses may not need to because their host colonization depends more on latency-associated lymphoproliferation than on lytic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stevenson <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Coleman <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In contrast to cell&#x02013;cell spread within hosts, herpesviruses transmit between hosts as cell-free virions. These are potentially vulnerable to neutralization. However, herpesviruses enter and exit immune hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sitki-Green <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) without even much selection of antigenic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). It is difficult to know exactly how much antibody each virion encounters, but antibody is abundant in the mucosal sites from where &#x003b3;-herpesviruses are shed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Yao <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>), and any antigen excess would presumably just elicit more antibody. An antibody excess therefore seems likely. Other mucosal infections make it clear that even quite low antibody amounts can significantly reduce infectivity if neutralization is efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mozdzanowska <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). &#x003b3;-Herpes virions must therefore resist neutralization.</p><p>Reconciling reports of <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x003b3;-herpesvirus neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Thorley-Lawson and Poodry, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Stevenson and Doherty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dialyna <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) with the evident lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization raises two important issues. First, neutralization aimed at cell binding may be cell type-specific. Thus, the Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus gp350 is a neutralization target for B-cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Thorley-Lawson and Poodry, 1982</xref>) but not for epithelial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Janz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), which gp350-specific antibodies even promote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Turk <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Similarly, immune sera block fibroblast binding by murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gill <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), but fail to block and even enhance its infection of IgG Fc receptor-bearing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Second, neutralization often reflects reduced rather than ablated infectivity. The requirements for each may be qualitatively distinct, for example if not all the copies of a virion glycoprotein are equally susceptible to antibody binding.</p><p>MuHV-4 provides a means to identify key, common themes in &#x003b3;-herpesvirus antibody evasion. Robust neutralization generally targets essential virion proteins, and MuHV-4 is no exception: its only mAb-defined neutralization targets are glycoprotein B (gB) and gH/gL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gill <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Both are conserved in all mammalian herpesviruses and essential for infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Forrester <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Heldwein <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The gB N terminus (gB-NT) is a neutralization target for many herpesviruses, including MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ohlin <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Holloway <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Akula <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Okazaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The basis for this neutralization is not clear. The herpes simplex virus gB-NT has a non-essential heparin-binding function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Laquerre <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus gB-NT binds to integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Akula <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), but gB-NT-directed MuHV-4 neutralization blocks infection at a post-binding step close to membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To understand how gB-NT contributes to the virus&#x02013;antibody interaction, we have deleted it from MuHV-4.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>gB-NT is non-essential for MuHV-4 infection</title><p>To establish the functional importance of gB-NT, we introduced one of three deletions, removing amino-acid residues 2&#x02013;6, 2&#x02013;14 or 2&#x02013;30 after the predicted MuHV-4 gB signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). (Its first conserved cysteine is residue 39.) All these mutants retained infectivity. Southern blots confirmed their predicted genomic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunofluorescence showed no obvious effect of gB-NT deletion on gB expression in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>) and immunoblots established that the gB content of each mutant was comparable to that of wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>Growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) established that gB-NT was not required for MuHV-4 lytic propagation. Nor did any of the mutants show reduced cell binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). gB is a cell-binding protein of MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>), but gB-NT deletions did not affect cell binding by the N-terminal half of gB fused to IgG Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Nor did a gB-NT-specific neutralizing mAb block cell binding by gB-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the idea that these mAbs do not act by blocking binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We considered that gB-NT might instead be important for B-cell infection. However, the gB-NT deletion mutants infected NS0 myeloma cells much like wild-type MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). The 2&#x02013;14 and 2&#x02013;30 deletion mutants (the 2&#x02013;6 mutant was not tested) also showed no deficit in colonizing the lungs and spleens of mice after intranasal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F&#x02013;H</xref>). gB-NT was therefore not important for entry.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Altered antigenicity of MuHV-4 lacking gB-NT</title><p>Our subsequent analysis focused on the largest gB-NT deletion (gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30). The virions found on infected cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">de Lima <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) provide a means of probing antigenic differences between MuHV-4 glycoprotein mutants. As expected, gB-NT-specific neutralizing mAbs&#x02014;previously mapped to gB residues 1&#x02013;40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>)&#x02014;did not recognize cells infected with gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). gB recognition by several other mAbs was also affected. Thus, mAb MG-1A12 recognized the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant slightly better than wild type (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 352 versus 192), whereas mAb BN-2A4 recognized the mutant noticeably less well (MFI 63 versus 495). These epitopes may be close to gB-NT. For example, the BN-2A4 epitope could partly incorporate gB-NT and the MG-1A12 epitope could be partly obscured by it. The normal infectivity of the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant made it unlikely that gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 was substantially misfolded.</p><p>A second and more surprising effect of gB-NT deletion was greater accessibility of gH/gL-neutralizing epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, while mAbs LT-6E8 (anti-gp70), 3F7 (anti-gN) and BN-3A4 (anti-gp150) stained the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant no more than wild type, the gH/gL-specific mAbs 7E5, T4C5 and 230-5H6 all stained the mutant slightly better (MFI 334 versus 233, 334 versus 209 and 225 versus 109, respectively for BHK-21 cells). 7E5 and T4C5 define two gH/gL neutralization epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gill <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). MAb 230-5H6 always showed the greatest difference, but all the differences were highly reproducible and statistically significant. They did not reflect greater gH/gL expression, since the gH-specific mAb 8C1 and another gH/gL-specific mAb, 230-4A2, showed equivalent expression between the mutant and wild type. Instead it appeared that neutralization epitopes on gH/gL were selectively exposed by gB-NT deletion. Increased gH/gL accessibility on gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virions was confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Here, we bound virions to cells rather than using infected cells, so as to present a more defined antigen. Both wild-type and gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virions were readily visualized by staining for gN, but the 230-5H6 epitope of gH/gL was poorly displayed unless gB-NT was deleted.</p><p>An effect of gB on gH seemed plausible because these proteins are associated in MuHV-4 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). This association was independent of gB-NT, but provided a physical basis for gB-NT contacting gH/gL.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Increased susceptibility of gB<italic>&#x00394;</italic>2&#x02013;30 MuHV-4 to gH/gL-directed neutralization</title><p>As expected, the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant was no longer susceptible to gB-NT-specific neutralizing mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, despite the removal of this neutralization epitope, immune sera neutralized the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant better than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). There was no obvious difference in neutralization titer between wild-type-immune and gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30-immune sera, arguing that neutralization did not depend on a new epitope created by the gB-NT deletion, but rather on an epitope that could also be presented by wild-type MuHV-4.</p><p>We then selected mAbs from wild-type MuHV-4-immune mice by their capacity to neutralize the gB-NT mutant. All (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;10) recognized gH/gL. Previously established gH/gL-specific mAbs also neutralized the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant better than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was consistent with the greater accessibility of gH/gL epitopes observed for gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, mAb 230-5H6 showed the greatest difference between the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant and wild type in both staining and neutralization. In contrast to the improved gH/gL-specific neutralization, a gB-specific neutralizing mAb (BH-6B5) that recognizes a region of gB outside gB-NT showed no difference between the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant and wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). We tested further the gH/gL dependence of gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virus neutralization by comparing sera from mice infected with gL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). The latter make no gH/gL-specific antibody response, since gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MuHV-4 does not display gH/gL epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2007c</xref>). While wild-type-immune sera showed better neutralization of the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant, gL knockout-immune sera did not. gB-NT deletion therefore conferred a greater susceptibility to neutralization by exposing gH/gL.</p><p>This neutralization also operated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Thus, immune sera blocked the entry of gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 MuHV-4 into new hosts much more effectively than that of the wild type. Immune sera normally block intranasal MuHV-4 infection poorly because they poorly inhibit membrane fusion; this can be remedied by boosting anti-gH/gL immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2007d</xref>). Thus, the increased susceptibility of the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant to <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization was consistent with its greater vulnerability to gH/gL-specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell type-specific susceptibility to gB-NT-directed neutralization</title><p>Since gB-NT itself can be a neutralization target, why should exchanging a gB-NT target for one on gH/gL affect overall virion susceptibility to neutralization? The obvious explanation would be that these targets are not equivalent. We have noted before that mAbs specific for gB-NT neutralize MuHV-4 only to a threshold minimum, not to zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Moreover, while plaque formation on BHK-21 fibroblasts is blocked quite well, plaque formation on NMuMG epithelial cells is blocked hardly at all. These data suggested that gB-NT-directed neutralization might be less effective than it appeared from assays using fibroblasts, and so might be less important to MuHV-4 than gH/gL-directed neutralization. We therefore sought to define how gB-NT might itself evade antibody.</p><p>One question raised by the difference in gB-NT-directed neutralization between NMuMG epithelial cells and BHK-21 fibroblasts was whether this reflected different entry requirements or differences in the virions produced, once an initial infection had occurred. To answer this, we compared NMuMG-derived and BHK-derived virions for their susceptibility to neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Each was similarly susceptible to gH/gL-directed neutralization, but NMuMG cell-derived virions were much less susceptible to gB-NT-directed neutralization for both BHK-21 and NMuMG cell infections. Thus, the difference in neutralization reflected mainly a difference between the virions each cell type produced.</p><p>As before, we examined gB antigenicity by flow cytometry of virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). MuHV-4-infected NMuMG cells showed more total gB-specific staining than infected BHK-21 cells (MFI 135 versus 32 for mAb MG-4A1 and 161 versus 40 for MG-4D11), probably reflecting greater virion accumulation on the plasma membrane. But they displayed relatively less of the gB-NT neutralization epitope (MFI 77 versus 51 for mAbs MG-10C11 and 79 versus 46 for MG-15G9). Immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>) showed a similar gB content for NMuMG- and BHK-derived virions based on staining with the gB-C-specific mAb MG-4D11, but gB-NT of NMuMG-derived virions was recognized substantially less well. The 65 kDa band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref> is cleaved N-terminal gB, which is abundant in mature virions. The less abundant 120 kDa band is uncleaved gB. The different bands around 120 kDa probably correspond to different N-linked gB glycoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lopes <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The poor recognition of these bands of NMuMG-derived virions by mAb MG-2C10 indicated that gB-NT was antigenically different.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>O-linked glycans protect gB against neutralization</title><p>The MuHV-4 gB-NT contains nine potential O-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Despite considerable sequence diversity between the gB-NTs of different herpesviruses, multiple predicted O-glycosylation sites are preserved. Human cytomegalovirus and bovine herpesvirus-4 provide particularly striking examples. Our gB-NT-specific neutralizing mAbs do not require <italic>O</italic>-glycans for recognition, since they recognize bacterially expressed gB fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), but <italic>O</italic>-glycans could potentially inhibit their recognition. We tested this by digesting NMuMG cell-derived virion lysates with sialidase A plus <italic>O</italic>-glycanase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). This gave a marked improvement in gB detection. In contrast, removing N-linked glycans had no effect.</p><p>We then removed <italic>O</italic>-glycans from intact, NMuMG cell-derived virions. This conferred susceptibility to gB-directed neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). The neutralization of BHK-21 cell-derived virions also improved, consistent with the previously noted failure of gB-NT-specific mAbs to eliminate their infectivity completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Thus, gB-NT on NMuMG cell-derived virions was strongly protected against neutralization by <italic>O</italic>-glycans, and the greater susceptibility of BHK-21 cell-derived virions to gB-NT-directed neutralization correlated with less <italic>O</italic>-glycan-dependent protection. gB-NT O-glycosylation also explained why deleting just a few amino-acid residues noticeably reduced the gB apparent molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>O-glycans protect <italic>ex vivo</italic> virions against neutralization</title><p>The &#x003b3;-herpes virions shed by infected hosts are probably derived from epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). These characteristically produce extensively O-glycosylated mucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Patton <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). They may therefore produce extensively O-glycosylated virions. Virions recovered from lung homogenates of MuHV-4-infected mice showed substantial <italic>O</italic>-glycan-dependent resistance to gB-directed neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar results were obtained with virions recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (data not shown). Thus, the resistance of NMuMG cell-derived virions to neutralization was consistent with the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, the susceptibility of BHK-21 cell-derived virions to gB-NT-directed neutralization probably underestimates the obstacles that antibody normally faces.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>gB-NT O-glycans can be a target for lectin-mediated neutralization</title><p>Since gB-NT was non-essential for MuHV-4 replication, gB-NT-directed neutralization probably operates by steric hindrance, for example by keeping fusion loops away from host membranes. This suggested that any bulky molecule in the same site might inhibit infection equally well. We therefore tested the capacity of jacalin, an <italic>O</italic>-glycan-specific lectin, to inhibit MuHV-4 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). Inhibition was evident for NMuMG cell-derived but not for BHK-21 cell-derived virions, the converse of antibody-mediated neutralization. We used biotinylated jacalin so as to also attach streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin (molecular weight 300 kDa), but biotinylated jacalin alone (60 kDa) was also effective. Removing <italic>O</italic>-glycans from MuHV-4 propagated in NMuMG cells, the same treatment that conferred susceptibility to neutralization by mAbs, abolished the inhibition by jacalin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>). Probably multiple virion glycoproteins are differentially glycosylated between NMuMG and BHK-21 cells. However, the gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 mutant escaped inhibition by jacalin when propagated in NMuMG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). Lectin-mediated neutralization was therefore specific to gB-NT.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epidemiology tells us that herpesviruses evade neutralization by antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). There is no evidence for weak immunogenicity, indeed persistent infection potently elicits both serum and mucosal antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Gyselink <italic>et al</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Tamura <italic>et al</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Yao <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). But while most viruses cannot transmit from immune hosts without antigenic variation, herpes virions readily do so. Most neutralizing antibodies block receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Knossow and Skehel, 2006</xref>). A key part of herpesvirus antibody evasion may therefore be a capacity to infect via alternative uptake pathways such as IgG Fc receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Inada <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Maidji <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>). But even if virions evade a block to cell binding, they remain potentially susceptible to a block to membrane fusion. The data presented here provide the first insights into how &#x003b3;-herpesviruses can protect their fusion machinery against antibody.</p><p>MAbs directed against the MuHV-4 fusion complex are strikingly inefficient at neutralization: those binding to gB cannot ablate infectivity completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gillet <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and those binding to gH/gL require a very large antibody excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gill <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). gB-NT played a central role in both aspects of antibody resistance: it protected a critical region of gH/gL, and was itself protected by O-linked glycans. Removing gB-NT made a subset of gH/gL epitopes more accessible, implying that gB-NT covers a crucial part of gH/gL. The redundancy of gB-NT for the gB/gH/gL interaction suggested that its interaction with gH/gL was weak; the partial availability of the 230-5H6 epitope on wild-type virions suggested that it might even be reversible. gB-NT is presumably displaced from gH/gL after virions engage the cell surface. This may stop antibodies binding to neutralization epitopes on gH/gL unless they are co-endocytosed, which would explain why gH/gL-directed neutralization requires a large antibody excess.</p><p>The protection of gB-NT itself by O-linked glycans illustrates two important points: susceptibility to neutralization may depend on the cell type producing the virus; and infectivity reduction rather than ablation may overestimate the ease of infection control. Although gB-NT-specific mAbs could largely neutralize fibroblast-derived virions, they almost completely failed to neutralize epithelial cell-derived virions. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> virions also showed substantial resistance. The conservation of predicted O-glycosylation sites in other herpesvirus gB-NTs suggests that this evasion mechanism is widespread; indeed, much as N-linked glycans protect conformational epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Burton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Knossow and Skehel, 2006</xref>), <italic>O</italic>-glycans could protect linear epitopes on many viral glycoprotein N termini. Despite O-glycosylation, gB-NTs may eventually be targeted well enough to reduce viral transmission. This could explain what appears to be weak selection for herpesvirus gB-NT amino-acid diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Basgoz <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Auerbach <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The recorded amino-acid diversity by itself would seem insufficient for antibody evasion&#x02014;HIV and influenza vary much more&#x02014;but could act by modulating O-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mardberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Bovine herpesvirus-4, which is particularly rich in potential O-linked glycan attachment sites, encodes a mucin-type &#x003b2;-1,6-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Vanderplasschen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), which could modify gB-NT further. Thus, while herpesviruses generally pursue a faithful replication strategy, more subtle forms of antigenic variation may not be beyond them.</p><p>Although <italic>O</italic>-glycan binding mAbs can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Burton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), T-cell tolerance makes them rare. In essence, <italic>O</italic>-glycans like <italic>N</italic>-glycans provide an antibody-proof shield. However, glycans provide potential binding sites for lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Rudiger and Gabius, 2001</xref>). The extensive N-glycosylation of the HIV gp120 makes it a target for <italic>N</italic>-glycan-binding lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Balzarini, 2006</xref>). Our data show that an <italic>O</italic>-glycan-binding lectin can reduce herpesvirus infectivity. A combination of lectins and antibody could be particularly effective, since the evasion of one predisposed to recognition by the other. A possible application might be reducing perinatal infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>Female BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan UK Ltd (Bicester, UK), housed in the Cambridge University Department of Pathology, and infected intranasally with MuHV-4 (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> p.f.u.) when 6&#x02013;8 weeks old (Home Office Project Licence 80/1992).

Unlike wild-type virions, the cell type of origin had no significant effect on jacalin-mediated neutralization for gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virions.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="7601925f7"/></fig><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>gB-NT protects against neutralization <italic>in vivo</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Challenge</th><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Neutralization</th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Mice infected</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Wild type</th><th align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">100 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Nil</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">100 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">BALB/c immune serum</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">4/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">100 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">C57BL/6 immune serum</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">2/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">1000 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Nil</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">1000 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">BALB/c immune serum</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">1000 p.f.u.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">C57BL/6 immune serum</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">10/10</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">0/10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Wild-type and gB&#x00394;2&#x02013;30 virions were incubated (2 h, 37&#x000b0;C) with or without immune sera (5 &#x003bc;l) pooled from mice 3-6 months post-infection with wild-type MuHV-4.
