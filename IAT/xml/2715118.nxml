The variable regions of antigen receptor genes are assembled from numerous V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) coding segments, which are cut and pasted together in a multitude of combinations via the programmed DNA rearrangement V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This process occurs during early lymphocyte development and is required for progenitors to mature into functional B and T lymphocytes. V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and 2 proteins, which comprise an endonuclease that recognizes specific recombination signal sequences (RSSs) adjacent to each V, D, and J segment. The RAG1/2 endonuclease induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) between the RSSs and coding segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and generates ends with two distinct structures: 5&#x02032; phosphorylated blunt RS ends and covalently closed hairpin coding ends. Joining of the RAG1/2-generated DNA breaks requires the ubiquitously expressed nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair factors, which include Ku70, Ku80, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), XRCC4, DNA ligase IV (Lig4), Cernunnos/XLF, and Artemis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The NHEJ factors also play critical roles in general DSB repair and maintaining genome stability.</p><p>Artemis possesses intrinsic 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; single-strand exonuclease activity and becomes activated as an endonuclease when complexed with DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Artemis&#x02013;DNA-PKcs nicks the covalently closed coding ends, and hairpin opening at variable positions away from the apex, followed by fill-in synthesis, leads to addition of palindromic &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; nucleotides. Together, these end-processing steps further diversify the antigen receptor genes that are generated upon ligation of modified coding ends. In contrast, the majority of RS ends are precisely joined with no loss or gain of nucleotides; however, the blunt ends can also undergo deletions and N insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>Artemis</italic> was initially discovered as the gene mutated in human radiosensitive T<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B<sup>&#x02212;</sup> severe combined immunodeficiency (RS-SCID), a disorder characterized by a lack of T and B lymphocytes and increased cellular radiosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The majority of <italic>Artemis</italic> mutations that cause RS-SCID are located within a highly conserved metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase/&#x003b2;-CASP catalytic domain (residues 1&#x02013;385 of 692 aa), which distinguishes this family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). These mutations include genomic exon deletions, nucleotide deletions, and nonsense mutations and are presumed to inactivate protein function. Inherited hypomorphic <italic>Artemis</italic> alleles have also been identified in patients and cause combined immunodeficiency syndromes of varying severity, including Omenn syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Intriguingly, premature translation termination mutations that result in loss of coding sequence within the nonconserved C terminus (aa 386&#x02013;692) can lead to either RS-SCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) or partial immunodeficiency, in which patients have low but detectable B and T lymphocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In this regard, patients harboring a truncating Artemis mutation (D451fsX10, referred to as P70 herein) are characterized by a syndrome of partial immunodeficiency and aggressive EBV-associated lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>The predicted protein encoded by the Artemis-P70 allele retains the metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase/&#x003b2;-CASP catalytic core of Artemis yet lacks the majority of the nonconserved C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The C-terminal domain interacts with and is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>); however, although Artemis and DNA-PKcs form a stable complex in cells, the functional importance of complex formation or Artemis phosphorylation in vivo is not well understood. In this regard, although first proposed to be required for regulation of intrinsic nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), biochemical studies of mutant Artemis proteins have provided evidence that phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs is not necessary for activation of endonucleolytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In addition, in vitro cellular assays examining the V(D)J recombination and DNA repair activities of exogenously expressed C-terminally truncated Artemis proteins that lack DNA-PKcs phosphorylation sites, or mutant forms that cannot bind DNA-PKcs, have led to differing results regarding the functional importance of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Thus, the in vivo relevance of DNA-PKcs interaction with and/or phosphorylation of the Artemis C terminus remains an open question.</p><p>To gain better understanding of the in vivo consequences of the Artemis-P70 hypomorphic allele and to elucidate the functional importance of the C-terminal domain, we generated a mutant mouse strain that models this mutation in the germline via gene targeting. We find that Artemis-P70 homozygous mice exhibit impairment but not a complete block in T and B lymphocyte development, thereby recapitulating the partial immunodeficiency phenotype observed in the patients. We further characterize the impact of this mutation on DNA end processing and V(D)J recombination using combined molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches. The results of our studies provide insights into the mechanisms that underlie partial immunodeficiency in patients that harbor this hypomorphic allele. In addition, our findings reveal important in vivo functions of the Artemis C terminus in general DNA DSB repair and maintenance of genomic stability.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Development of a mouse model of human partial immunodeficiency</title><p>We generated a mouse model harboring the hypomorphic Artemis-P70 allele within the endogenous locus via targeted mutation.

To model the P70 mutation within the mouse genomic locus, we introduced a nonsense mutation to substitute a stop codon for the aspartate at position 449 (of 603 aa) via site-directed mutagenesis (details in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">supplemental text</ext-link>). The human and mouse Artemis complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences share &#x0223c;73% sequence identity and 81% sequence similarity, and the amino acid sequence of mouse Artemis at the site of the mutation is nearly identical to that of the human protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of Artemis-P70 knock-in mice.</bold> (A) Hypomorphic Artemis-P70 mutation.

The presence of the nucleotide substitutions (G1388T/C1390G within the coding sequence) and integrity of both homology arms were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Homologously targeted recombinants were identified by Southern blotting, and two independently derived subclones of successfully targeted embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Germline Art<sup>+/P70-Neo</sup> mice were subsequently bred to transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase from the EIIA promoter to delete the LoxP-flanked Neomycin resistance (Neo<sup>r</sup>) gene during early embryogenesis.

Homozygous Artemis-P70 mice were born in Mendelian numbers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>) and survived into adulthood with no obvious developmental defects.</p><p>Expression of the P70 mutant allele was verified by Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from WT, heterozygous, and homozygous Artemis-P70 embryonic fibroblasts with a probe that hybridizes near the 3&#x02032; end of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In addition, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of Artemis-P70 expression in spleen and liver using gene-specific primers that detect transcripts containing exons 13&#x02013;14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The levels of Artemis messenger RNA (mRNA) expressed in the Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> tissues and cells were equivalent to controls as measured by both assays. Thus, the nonsense mutation did not significantly affect the stability of the Artemis mRNA. The RT-PCR products were subcloned and sequenced to verify that the translation stop had been introduced into the proper position (D449X) within the Artemis coding region (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Partial combined immunodeficiency caused by the hypomorphic Artemis-P70 mutation</title><p>Patients harboring the hypomorphic Artemis-P70 allele exhibited lymphocytopenia and died of either recurrent infections or lymphoma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).

The homozygous Artemis-P70 mice exhibited a defect in the ability of progenitors to transition from the pro&#x02013;B to pre&#x02013;B stage of development and, thus, we observed a substantial decrease in the percentage and number of pre&#x02013;B cells compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This impairment in B cell development resulted in significantly lower numbers of surface IgM-expressing cells in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> bone marrow as well as peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). In contrast, B cell development was completely blocked at the pro&#x02013;B stage, and IgM-positive cells were not detected in the bone marrow or periphery in Artemis-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). No measurable lymphocyte development phenotypes were detected in Artemis-P70 heterozygous mice compared with controls. Thus, the immune system phenotypes observed in the Artemis-P70 mutant mice closely parallel the partial immunodeficiency syndrome observed in human patients and are distinct from Artemis nullizygosity.</p></sec><sec><title>Defective V(D)J rearrangements in Artemis-P70 homozygous mice</title><p>We next examined the impact of the P70 mutation on levels of D to J and V to DJ rearrangements within the IgH and TCR-&#x003b2; loci. To this end, we performed semiquantitative PCR amplification of the rearranging loci followed by Southern blotting in progenitor lymphocyte populations. Within the TCR-&#x003b2; locus, we observed a significant retention of the PCR product corresponding to unrearranged alleles in sorted DN thymocytes isolated from Artemis-P70 homozygous mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, GL). We also observed decreased, but readily detectable, levels of PCR products representing D&#x003b2;1 to J&#x003b2;1 and D&#x003b2;2 to J&#x003b2;2 rearrangements in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> DN thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The levels of V&#x003b2; to DJ&#x003b2;1 rearrangements using V&#x003b2;10- and V&#x003b2;12-specific PCR primers were significantly reduced in the homozygous mutant thymocytes compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the Artemis-P70 hypomorphic mutation decreases the frequency of both D to J and V to DJ rearrangements within the TCR-&#x003b2; locus, yet substantial levels of recombination do occur.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Lymphocyte development defects are caused by impaired V(D)J rearrangements.</bold> (A) TCR-&#x003b2; rearrangements.

(B) Endogenous TCR-&#x003b4; signal joints. Levels of extrachromosomal signal joints formed between TCR-D&#x003b4;2 and -J&#x003b4;1 RSSs were detected by PCR amplification of genomic thymocyte DNA isolated from Art<sup>+/+</sup>, Art<sup>P70/P70</sup>, Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Representative results are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082396_GS_Fig3"/></fig><p>We also analyzed D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements in sorted pro- and pre&#x02013;B cells from Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> and control mice using the same PCR amplification approach. We used primers 5&#x02032; of D<sub>H</sub>Q52, the D segment located most proximal to J<sub>H</sub>1, or a degenerate D<sub>H</sub> primer that amplifies most D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements, paired with a primer 3&#x02032; of J<sub>H</sub>4. We observed a modest but reproducible decrease in levels of most D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements in Artemis-P70 pro- and pre&#x02013;B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>); however, significant levels of D<sub>H</sub>-J<sub>H</sub> rearrangements were detected. V<sub>H</sub> to DJ<sub>H</sub> rearrangements involving two frequently used V<sub>H</sub> families, V<sub>H</sub>Q52 and V<sub>H</sub>7183, were substantially reduced, but not abrogated, in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> developing B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These results indicate that the partial B and T immunodeficiency caused by Artemis-P70 is the result of an impairment, but not complete block, in endogenous V(D)J recombination. Thus, despite loss of approximately one third of the C-terminal region of the protein, the mutant Artemis nuclease possesses the necessary activities required to support in vivo V(D)J recombination, but it is less efficient compared with the WT protein.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA end processing during endogenous V(D)J rearrangements in Artemis-P70 mice</title><p>To gain a more mechanistic understanding of the V(D)J recombination defects caused by the Artemis-P70 hypomorphic mutation, we analyzed the junctional sequences of unselected endogenous D to J rearrangements. Rearrangements within the IgH and TCR-&#x003b2; loci were PCR amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. The D-J<sub>H</sub> and D-J&#x003b2;1 coding joints from Artemis-null lymphocytes exhibited large deletions, with &#x0003e;400 nt deleted from some coding flanks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In addition, several unusually long P-nucleotide additions in D-J<sub>H</sub> and D-J&#x003b2;1 junctional sequences were observed (up to 6 nt). Deletions and P nucleotides within D-J<sub>H</sub> and D-J&#x003b2;1 coding joints were also found in WT lymphocytes; however, the largest deletion observed was 12 nt, and none of the P nucleotide additions was longer than 2 bases (Fig. S1).</p><p>The majority of coding joints recovered from Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice exhibited characteristics of WT junctions (Fig. S1). Most nucleotide deletions at Artemis-P70 coding flanks were &#x0003c;12 nt, and the majority of the P nucleotide additions were 1 or 2 nt long (Fig. S1). We did observe a small proportion of Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> coding joints with features found in Artemis-null junctions, including larger deletions (4 of 51 unique sequences with deletions ranging from 13 to 391 bases) and P nucleotide additions between 3 and 6 bases (6 of 23 coding flanks with P nucleotides). N nucleotide additions were observed in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> and Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> coding joints at a comparable frequency to that in WT joints. However, we noted that both Artemis mutations led to a higher proportion of D-J<sub>H</sub> and D-J&#x003b2;1 junctional sequences containing N nucleotide additions of &#x0003e;5 bases. We observed that of the WT coding joints with N insertions, 6% contained 6 or more nontemplated bases, a proportion which is similar to that in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In comparison, 21% of Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact two-tailed test) and 24% of Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (P = 0.02) junctions with N nucleotides contained insertions of &#x0003e;5 bases (Fig. S1) (this study and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>In patients harboring the P70 mutation, the junctional sequences of eight expressed TCR-&#x003b2; cDNAs exhibited an absence of N nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The precise molecular bases for the differing observations in our mouse model are unclear; however, one potential influencing factor is that the human subjects experienced multiple recurrent infections. Thus, aberrant immune responses in the context of lymphopenia may have had an impact on the selected TCR repertoire of the low-level mature peripheral T cells observed in the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In our analyses, we have examined junctional sequences of &#x0003e;70 unique D to J rearrangements in immature lymphocyte populations from Artemis mutant mice housed in a specific pathogen-free environment; thus, the mouse sequences may allow for a more unbiased analysis of junctional diversity. In this regard, a recent study reported the sequences of D<sub>H</sub>-J<sub>H</sub> coding joints recovered from immature B cells isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cultures of Artemis mutant patients, including one patient harboring a distinct premature translation termination mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The majority of D<sub>H</sub>-J<sub>H</sub> junctional sequences analyzed contained N nucleotides, and one third of the coding joints with N additions contained insertions of &#x0003e;5 bases.</p><p>We also examined the levels and fidelity of RS end joining in the Artemis-P70 homozygous mice. RS joints formed upon precise ligation of heptamers can generate the recognition sequence for ApaLI by virtue of the conserved CAC triplet flanking the majority of RAG1/2 cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). A proportion of blunt RS ends undergoes modification in WT lymphocytes and, thus, is resistant to digestion by ApaLI because of N nucleotide additions and/or deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Artemis does not play a direct role in RS end joining; however, it has been implicated in processing the blunt ends before ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In this regard, levels of RS joint formation are unaffected in Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; however, the proportion of ApaLI-resistant junctions at certain loci have been found to be decreased, in part as the result of an absence of nucleotide deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We assessed the impact of the Artemis-P70 mutation on RS end processing and joining within the TCR-&#x003b4; locus using a PCR strategy. We amplified the joints formed between the D&#x003b4;2 and J&#x003b4;1 RSSs and observed that the levels were similar in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> thymocytes compared with Art<sup>+/+</sup> and Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These results indicate that Artemis-P70 does not significantly impact the frequency of RS joining.</p><p>We next subcloned the PCR products, and individual clones were digested with ApaLI to determine the proportion of precise and imprecise joints. The majority of D&#x003b4;2-J&#x003b4;1 RS junctions from WT thymocytes were precisely joined (80%, corrected for redundancy; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>), and a comparable proportion (70%) of Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> RS joints were sensitive to ApaLI digestion. We found that a significantly lower percentage of Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> RS joints (64%; P = 0.03, Fisher's exact two-tailed test) were precise in comparison with WT junctions (Table S2). Sequence analysis of the imperfect RS joints from WT, Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice revealed that nearly all of the junctions analyzed contained N nucleotide additions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). We also observed deletions from D&#x003b4;2 or J&#x003b4;1 RS ends in a small subset of RS joints analyzed from WT (1 of 15 unique imprecise junctions) as well as Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (2 of 18) and Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> (2 of 28) thymocytes. Together, these results indicate that the Artemis-P70 mutation has a modest impact on the level of fidelity of D&#x003b4;2-J&#x003b4;1 RS joining. As the frequency of deleted ends was similar in all genotypes examined, our findings suggest that the decreased levels of precise RS joining in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice is the result of an increase in N nucleotide&#x02013;modified ends.</p><p>The observed nucleotide loss within two Artemis-null D&#x003b4;2-J&#x003b4;1 RS joints differs from a previous study that found an absence of deletions from D&#x003b4;1-D&#x003b4;2 and V&#x003b1;&#x003b4;-D&#x003b4;2 RS junctions in Artemis deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). These incongruent results may be caused by distinct mechanisms of end processing at the different recombining V, D, and J segments. In this regard, the extent of N nucleotide addition and deletion of RS ends varies according to the sequences of flanking coding segments and the particular loci undergoing rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, involvement of Artemis nuclease activities in RS end modification may differ depending on the specific rearranging gene segments. Nonetheless, these findings support the notion that Artemis is not only required for processing hairpin coding ends during V(D)J recombination but also participates in modification of blunt RS ends. Furthermore, our results indicate that the C-terminal portion of the nuclease that is absent in the Artemis-P70 protein plays an important role during these activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of V(D)J recombination intermediates in Artemis-P70 mutant lymphocytes</title><p>In WT developing lymphocytes, RAG1/2-generated hairpin coding ends are rapidly processed and joined and, thus, do not accumulate to detectable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In contrast, blunt RS ends persist within the context of a stable postcleavage complex before being ligated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Covalently closed coding ends accumulate in Artemis-null lymphocytes as a result of the inability to endonucleolytically cleave the hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). To assess the impact of Artemis-P70 on end processing, we examined the levels and structures of hairpin coding and RS ends in developing lymphocytes. Genomic DNA isolated from Art<sup>+/+</sup>, Art<sup>P70/P70</sup>, and Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes was treated with mung bean nuclease (MBN) and/or T4 DNA polymerase. MBN nicks hairpins and can endonucleolytically cleave overhanging sequences, and T4 DNA polymerase can act upon 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; overhanging ends via its intrinsic exonuclease and polymerase activities, thereby rendering them blunt. Thus, enzymatic treatment of DNA ends with either or both enzymes followed by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) can reveal distinct structures of coding ends.</p><p>We ligated linkers to untreated genomic thymocyte DNA or DNA treated with T4 DNA polymerase and then PCR amplified products corresponding to 3&#x02032; D&#x003b2;1 RS ends within the rearranging TCR-&#x003b2; locus. The LM-PCR products were detected via Southern blot analyses using an oligonucleotide probe. We readily detected RS ends in untreated genomic DNA isolated from Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). To assess the presence of modified nonblunt RS ends, we treated the DNA with T4 polymerase before the linker ligation. We did not observe a significant increase in band intensity or the appearance of additional bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>); thus, the majority of D&#x003b2;1 3&#x02032; RS ends in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> thymocytes are blunt, as observed in WT and Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Modified RS ends are likely to be present in developing thymocytes, as indicated by the presence of imprecise RS joints containing N nucleotides and deletions; however, accurate assessment of the levels is beyond the sensitivity of the LM-PCR assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>V(D)J recombination intermediates in Artemis-P70 thymocytes.</bold> (A) Levels of RS ends in Artemis-P70 DN thymocytes.

We generated three C-terminal truncations, including D451X, which models the human P70 mutation, T432X, and S385X via site-directed mutagenesis. The T432X protein mimics a distinct human Artemis hypomorphic frameshift mutation that is associated with partial immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).

that coding joint sequences recovered from Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells expressing the mutant Artemis constructs were similar to those from WT ES cells or mutant cells complemented with WT Artemis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082396/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Overall, the coding joint sequences exhibited similar numbers of P and N nucleotide additions and deletions. The rare recombinants isolated from Artemis-null cells exhibited the hallmark large deletions and longer than average P nucleotide additions. These results demonstrate that the hypomorphic Artemis mutations that lead to partial immunodeficiency in patients, D451X and T432X, retain the necessary catalytic activities to properly process the hairpin coding ends during V(D)J recombination when overexpressed. These findings are in agreement with previous studies, which reported that the DNA-PKcs interaction domain of Artemis was largely dispensable for V(D)J recombination in cells using model substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).

These results in cells expressing endogenous levels of the Artemis-P70 protein are in sharp contrast to the complementation assay described in the previous section and emphasize the potential limitations of heterologous overexpression of mutant proteins in characterizing physiological activity.

Initially, we examined the activity of full-length D451X and S385X proteins on a <sup>32</sup>P 5&#x02032; end-labeled single-strand oligonucleotide substrate and observed that the truncated enzymes retained robust 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease activity, as indicated by release of the single labeled nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). We next assayed hairpin opening activity in the presence or absence of DNA-PKcs. In the presence of DNA-PKcs, the full-length protein was activated to cleave the <sup>32</sup>P 5&#x02032; end-labeled 20-bp hairpin substrate to yield major products of 22 and 23 bases at positions 2 and 3 nt 3&#x02032; of the apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). We observed that the D451X protein exhibited significant, although reduced, DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent hairpin opening activity, yielding products of the same length as WT Artemis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). We also examined the levels of DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent cleavage activity on a 15-nt 3&#x02032; overhang substrate comprised of a <sup>32</sup>P 5&#x02032; end-labeled 36-mer annealed to a 21-mer. The D451X protein exhibited endonucleolytic activity that was dependent on DNA-PKcs and primarily cleaved the substrate at positions 4 and 5 bases 3&#x02032; of the double-to-single strand transition, as observed for WT Artemis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>, left). Thus, Artemis-D451X possesses DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent endonucleolytic activities on hairpin and 3&#x02032; overhang structures; however, we consistently observed lower levels of cleavage products compared with the WT enzyme. The S385X protein exhibited DNA-PKcs&#x02013;independent endonucleolytic activity on the hairpin and 3&#x02032; overhang substrates that was slightly stimulated upon addition of the protein kinase, which is consistent with previous analyses of a similar truncated form of Artemis (aa 1&#x02013;382) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). To further evaluate the endonuclease activities intrinsic to the mutant Artemis proteins, we assayed hairpin and 3&#x02032; overhang cleavage in the presence of manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), rather than magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), as the divalent metal cofactor. We found that WT Artemis, as well as the D451X and S385X proteins, possesses hairpin nicking activity in Mn<sup>2+</sup> which is independent of DNA-PKcs and that this activity is not further stimulated upon addition of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>, left). In fact, we observed that in reaction mixtures containing Mn<sup>2+</sup>, the levels of hairpin cleavage were consistently higher for D451X and S385X than for the full-length protein. The WT, D451X, and S385X proteins also exhibited significant DNA-PKcs independent 3&#x02032; overhang cleavage activity in Mn<sup>2+</sup> that was not enhanced by the presence of DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>, right). We noted that Mn<sup>2+</sup> led to the appearance of a range of products corresponding to additional cleavage sites within the 3&#x02032; single-strand flap. Thus, the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> abrogates the requirement for DNA-PKcs in activating endonucleolytic activities of Artemis and circumvents the need for remodeling of the overhang substrate and/or conformation of protein complexes by the protein kinase, as has been proposed for DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent overhang cleavage in Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the C-terminally truncated proteins possess robust endonucleolytic activity in the absence of phosphorylation and, in the case of S385X, without stable interaction with DNA-PKcs under certain reaction conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>A mouse model of partial immunodeficiency caused by a hypomorphic Artemis mutation</title><p>In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying a syndrome of partial B and T immunodeficiency associated with lymphoma in patients harboring a hypomorphic <italic>Artemis</italic> allele, P70. The Artemis-P70 mutation results in loss of coding sequence for over one third of the polypeptide, including the region of the C terminus that contains the majority of phosphorylation sites for DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). We demonstrate that lymphocyte development in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice is impaired at the stages during which TCR and Ig gene rearrangements occur, thereby resulting in a marked decrease in numbers of mature B and T lymphocytes compared with Art<sup>+/P70</sup> and WT controls. However, the phenotype is less severe compared with Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In this regard, Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice have substantial populations of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DP thymocytes and detectable levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> single-positive peripheral T cells as well as B220<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> bone marrow and peripheral B cells. In contrast, Artemis-null mice are characterized by a block in B cell development and only a subset of mice exhibit &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; T cell development (this study and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Thus, the phenotypes of homozygous Artemis-P70 mice are clearly distinct from those observed in Artemis nullizygosity and confirm that the mutation represents a partial loss&#x02013;of-function allele.</p><p>We found that the lymphocyte development defects observed in Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice are a result of reduced efficiency of coding end processing during endogenous V(D)J recombination, as indicated by an accumulation of hairpin ends and lower levels of both D to J and V to DJ rearrangements within TCR and Ig loci. We observed a similar defect in V(D)J recombination using a cellular transient transfection V(D)J recombination assay in Artemis-P70 homozygous mutant MEFs. Therefore, although previous in vitro cellular transfection studies examining the functional consequences of <italic>Artemis</italic> mutations concluded that neither the C terminus nor DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent phosphorylation is required for V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), our findings clearly establish that the C-terminal region of the protein is indeed required for efficient in vivo V(D)J rearrangements.</p></sec><sec><title>Consequences of deletion of the Artemis C terminus on DNA end processing</title><p>We found that the majority of coding joint sequences from the Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mutant mice and cells exhibit similarity to WT junctions. The Artemis-P70 junctions harbored small deletions and P nucleotide additions of normal length, and only a small subset of sequences contained the hallmark long P insertions or large deletions characteristic of Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> junctions. These results indicate that the Artemis-P70 mutant protein can be targeted to coding ends and nick the hairpins once recruited, although with reduced efficiency compared with the WT enzyme. We also observed aberrant N nucleotide additions within both coding and RS joints in the Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> mice. In this regard, significantly higher frequencies of D<sub>H</sub>-J<sub>H</sub> and D&#x003b2;1-J&#x003b2;1 coding joints containing N insertions of longer than 5 bases and imprecise RS joints containing N nucleotides were observed. These findings suggest that, in addition to hairpin nicking, Artemis may function to nucleolytically trim TdT-synthesized nontemplated bases added to both coding and RS ends and that loss of the Artemis C terminus has an impact on these activities. Alternatively, Artemis may modulate TdT interactions with and/or accessibility to DNA ends, thereby altering TdT-dependent end processing in the mutant lymphocytes.</p><p>Our studies revealed that primary homozygous Artemis-P70 MEFs are hypersensitive to the DNA DSB-inducing agents IR and bleomycin but less sensitive than Art<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs. Truncation of the Artemis C terminus also results in increased genomic instability, as we observed significantly higher levels of chromosomal anomalies in irradiated Art<sup>P70/P70</sup> MEFs. Therefore, the impact of the P70 mutation on Artemis function is not restricted to end processing during the specialized process of V(D)J recombination but also impacts its roles in general DSB repair and maintenance of genome stability.</p><p>What are the consequences of C-terminal truncation on Artemis activities? We found that the D451X protein, which was modeled after the P70 mutant allele, retains robust 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; single-strand exonuclease activity. The truncated protein interacts stably with DNA-PKcs and exhibits significant, although reduced, DNA-PKcs&#x02013;dependent endonucleolytic activity despite the inability to be phosphorylated. These results are consistent with previous studies indicating that phosphorylation within the Artemis C terminus is dispensable for activation of endonucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Our in vitro observations that the V(D)J recombination defect in Artemis-null cells can be fully complemented by exogenous expression of the D451X protein support the notion that the C terminus is not essential for Artemis end processing activities per se. However, we did observe consistently lower levels of endonucleolytic activities intrinsic to the D451X protein, indicating that the C terminus plays a role in modulating Artemis nuclease activities independent of DNA-PKcs interaction. In this regard, the reduced 3&#x02032; overhang cleavage activity observed in vitro may result in the distinct N nucleotide additions observed within coding and RS joints in vivo.</p><p>One additional in vivo impact of C-terminal truncation and resultant loss of Artemis phosphorylation may be mislocalization or inefficient recruitment of the mutant protein to DNA ends. The phosphorylated form of Artemis forms discrete nuclear foci in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and preferentially associates with chromatin in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), suggesting that phospho-Artemis may have a distinct function within the context of chromatin. Although the precise nature of this function is unclear, cofractionation of phospho-Artemis with DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and Ku in response to DNA damage suggests that localization to chromatin facilitates repair of DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Likewise, in vitro and cellular studies indicate that an autophosphorylated form of DNA-PKcs has a higher affinity for the phosphorylated form of Artemis (unpublished data and references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The truncated Artemis-P70 protein lacking the major phosphorylation sites may not properly interact with chromatin or other DNA repair factors. Thus, the hypomorphic mutation would impair the ability of Artemis to be stably targeted to DSBs and have an impact on its ability to efficiently act upon DNA ends.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of aberrant Artemis nucleolytic activities</title><p>As aberrant repair of DNA DSBs can lead to oncogenic chromosomal aberrations and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), our findings raise the possibility that the hypomorphic Artemis-P70 allele may predispose to tumorigenesis. In support of this notion, patients harboring the Artemis-P70 mutation developed aggressive B lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The molecular basis for tumorigenesis in these patients was not clear, as the lymphomas were associated with EBV yet also exhibited characteristics that are not generally associated with EBV-driven B cell proliferation, including a clonal cellular origin, increased genome instability, and clonal chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Our observations that the Artemis-P70 allele results in defective DNA DSB repair and increased genome instability provide evidence that this hypomorphic mutation could contribute to tumorigenesis, as observed in mouse models harboring null alleles in NHEJ genes in the context of p53 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). In further support of this hypothesis, two relatives of a patient harboring a similar hypomorphic Artemis allele, which leads to a frameshift at codon 393 followed by a stop mutation after 8 codons, were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; however, the patient died of pneumonia at 3 mo of age, before developing overt lymphoid malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In future studies, it will be of interest to examine the impact of the Artemis-P70 mutation on lymphoid neoplasia alone and in the context of p53 mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Together, our current findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie partial combined immunodeficiency in patients caused by a hypomorphic Artemis allele. We provide evidence that the mutant Artemis-P70 nuclease is defective for DNA end processing during endogenous V(D)J recombination and exhibits reduced endonucleolytic activities despite retaining stable interaction with DNA-PKcs. Loss of the C terminus abrogates the ability of the Artemis-P70 protein to be phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs. Thus, although dispensable for activating endonucleolytic activities, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the Artemis C terminus may play an important role in modulating in vivo functions. Importantly, we find that the Artemis-P70 mutation not only impairs end processing during V(D)J recombination but also leads to general DNA DSB repair defects that result in aberrant chromosomal rearrangements and genomic instability. Thus, partial loss of Artemis function may predispose to lymphoid or other malignancies in addition to causing combined immunodeficiencies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Generation of Artemis-P70 knock-in mice.</title><p>The targeting construct was generated using the pLNTK plasmid (pSalI&#x02013;loxP-Neo<sup>r</sup>-loxP&#x02013;XhoI-TK cassette) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).
