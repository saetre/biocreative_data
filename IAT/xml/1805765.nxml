The presence of a novel isoform of HBZ, termed HBZ-SP1, has recently been characterized in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells and has been found to be associated with intense nuclear spots. In this study, we investigated the role of these nuclear bodies in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of JunB.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that the HBZ-SP1 protein localizes to intense dots corresponding to HBZ-NBs and to nucleoli. We analyzed the relative mobility of the EGFP-HBZ-SP1 fusion protein using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis and found that the deletion of the ZIP domain perturbs the association of the HBZ-SP1 protein to the HBZ-NBs. These data suggested that HBZ needs cellular partners, including bZIP factors, to form HBZ-NBs. Indeed, by cotransfection experiments in COS cells, we have found that the bZIP factor JunB is able to target delocalized form of HBZ (deleted in its nuclear localization subdomains) into the HBZ-NBs. We also show that the viral protein is able to entail a redistribution of JunB into the HBZ-NBs. Moreover, by transfecting HeLa cells (known to express high level of JunB) with a vector expressing HBZ-SP1, the sequestration of JunB to the HBZ-NBs inhibited its transcriptional activity. Lastly, we analyzed the nuclear distribution of HBZ-SP1 in the presence of JunD, a Jun family member known to be activated by HBZ. In this case, no NBs were detected and the HBZ-SP1 protein was diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that HBZ-mediated sequestration of JunB to the HBZ-NBs may be causing the repression of JunB activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus etiologically associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms behind leukemogenesis are not yet fully understood but it seems that several events in HTLV-I-infected cells are required for the development of the full malignant phenotype. Among them, the expression of the viral Tax protein plays a crucial role in the first steps of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tax has the ability to deregulate the transcription of genes and signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, cell cycle control and apoptosis, including deregulation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B, and E2F pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>AP-1 represents a dimeric protein, consisting of homodimers and heterodimers composed of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. AP-1 can be formed through either homodimerization of Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) or heterodimerization of Jun and Fos proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) via their respective ZIP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, Jun proteins can heterodimerize with different members of the bZIP protein family including the dimerization partners JDP1 and JDP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], activating transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and Maf proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In unstimulated T cells, the basal protein level of AP-1 is low but there is a rapid induction of AP-1 activity after T-cell stimulation. The IL-2 gene was one of the first T-cell-specific genes shown to have an AP-1 site within its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The AP-1 transcription complex has been shown to be involved in the regulation of IL-2 gene expression in combination with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The production of IL-2 by activated T cells is critical for T-cell proliferation and differentiation, and the development of T-cell-dependent immune responses. Over the recent years, a large quantity of data has accumulated demonstrating the contribution of AP-1 to the regulation of numerous cellular genes involved in lymphocyte activation.</p><p>AP-1 is also involved in the dysregulated phenotypes of T cells infected with HTLV-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that T-cell lines infected by HTLV-I express high levels of AP-1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] with increased levels of mRNAs coding for c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, and Fra-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, Tax can induce the expression of the genes encoding c-Fos, Fra-1, c-Jun, and JunD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that Tax enhances AP-1 activity at the post-transcriptional level by activating protein kinase B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, AP-1-binding sites have been shown to be responsive elements targeted by Tax in different cellular genes such as <italic>fra-1 </italic>and <italic>IL-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, most of ATL cells do not express significant level of Tax <italic>in vivo </italic>suggesting that constitutive activation of AP-1 in leukemic cells is likely Tax independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], although it cannot be completely excluded that a trace amount of Tax may be sufficient for AP-1 activation. However, recent data have suggested the involvement of another viral protein in the regulation of AP-1 activity, <italic>i.e</italic>. the HTLV-I bZIP factor (HBZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Unlike Tax, HBZ is encoded by the complementary strand of the HTLV-I genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Various transcripts initiate from the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) of the proviral DNA allowing the production of different isoforms of HBZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These isoforms share about 95% amino acid sequence identity and differ only at their N termini. However, the most abundant HBZ form detected in ATL cell lines corresponds to the 206 amino acid-long isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] produced from the alternative spliced variant, which we have termed HBZ-SP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This messenger RNA can be detected in numerous infected cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and directly in cells isolated from infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The HBZ protein has been described to enhance infectivity and persistence in HTLV-I-inoculated rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], an observation which might be consequential to the down-regulating ability of HBZ on Tax-dependent viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. HBZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) is a prototypical bZIP transcriptional factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] with an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a central domain involved in nuclear localization, and a C-terminal bZIP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. HBZ interacts with c-Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], JunB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and JunD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] through its bZIP domain. On the other hand, HBZ is unable to interact with c-Fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or to form stable homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The interaction of HBZ with c-Jun leads to a reduction in c-Jun DNA-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and prevents this protein from activating transcription of AP-1-dependent promoters and the HTLV-I promoter (at the basal level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that the HBZ-SP1 isoform was also able to down-regulate viral expression and to inhibit c-Jun-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] as already described for the original HBZ isoform.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of HBZ-SP1</bold>.

Moreover, we have studied the <italic>in vivo </italic>nuclear dynamics of the HBZ-NBs through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on cells transfected with the expression vector encoding HBZ-SP1 fused to the enhanced-green-fluorescent protein (EGFP). We have observed that the rate of nuclear flux of the HBZ-SP1 protein is altered by the deletion of its leucine zipper domain, suggesting that its heterodimerization partners are involved in controlling its own nuclear trafficking. Indeed, by cotransfection experiments in COS cells, we have found that JunB targets a mutated and delocalized form of HBZ into the HBZ-NBs. In addition, we show that HBZ-SP1 also modifies the localization of exogenous JunB in cotransfected COS cells and targets JunB to the HBZ-NBs. Moreover, we demonstrate in HeLa cells (known to have high expression level of JunB) that the relocalization of endogenous JunB by HBZ-SP1 into HBZ-NBs inhibits its transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that HBZ-mediated sequestration of JunB to these particular subnuclear structures may result in repression of JunB activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The HBZ-SP1 isoform shows a characteristic nuclear distribution</title><p>It has recently been shown that the HBZ-SP1 isoform was preferentially expressed in ATL cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For this reason, it was of high interest to investigate the subnuclear distribution of this protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. COS cells were transfected with vectors expressing the original HBZ and HBZ-SP1 isoforms tagged with the Myc epitope fused to its C-terminal end. As shown in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, b</xref>), the subnuclear distribution of the HBZ-SP1 isoform exhibits a NB-associated granular distribution as already described for the original HBZ isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We had also shown that this particular nuclear distribution did not correspond to the splicing factor compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To determine whether it was also the case for the HBZ-SP1 protein, we next checked the staining pattern of HBZ-SP1 (tagged with EGFP fused to its N-terminus) with that seen in the same cell stained with anti-SC35, an antibody that recognizes one component of an active spliceosome. We found that the HBZ-SP1 isoform did not colocalize with the endogenous SC35 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, in the majority of transfected cells, the HBZ-SP1 protein showed a distinct staining pattern when compared to the specific nuclear staining by the original HBZ isoform. Indeed, in addition to the HBZ-NBs, we observed intense spots in the nuclei in structures resembling nucleolus organizing regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, c</xref>). Colocalization experiments carried out with an anti-nucleolin antibody effectively confirmed that the HBZ-SP1 protein was partly localized to the nucleoli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular structures and nuclear localizations of HBZ-SP1 and its deletion mutants fused to EGFP</bold>.

COS cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-HBZ-SP1 and a defined area in the nucleoplasm of cells expressing the protein was photobleached. Recovery of the fluorescent signal in the entire bleached area was determined by capturing sequential images following photobleaching (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The estimated half-time for signal recovery of EGFP-HBZ-SP1 was 11.5 &#x000b1; 1.5 s (<italic>n </italic>= 10) and the mean percentage of mobile fraction was 34.0 &#x000b1; 3.1%. We also observed that the nuclear foci containing EGFP-HBZ-SP1, when recovered after photobleaching, retained the morphology and the nuclear location observed before photobleaching (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These findings were reproduced in three independent experiments. On the other hand, when a defined area in nucleoli containing EGFP-HBZ-SP1 protein was photobleached, the mean percentage of mobile fraction of EGFP-HBZ-SP1 was 90.0 &#x000b1; 10.0% (data not shown). Moreover, the EGFP control (corresponding to EGFP alone) was observed to be completely mobile (data not shown), confirming that EGFP mobility was modified by its fusion with HBZ-SP1.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The HBZ-SP1 protein dynamically associates with subnuclear foci in living cells in a C-terminus-dependent mechanism</bold>.

Interestingly, compared with the wild type, the mutant showed a different pattern of staining since HBZ-SP1&#x00394;ZIP-associated structures were more diffuse. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, colocalization experiments carried out with an anti-nucleolin antibody demonstrated that these nuclear structures corresponded to nucleoli displaying a branching structure. These data suggest that the integrity of the viral protein is required for the formation of the HBZ-NBs. Moreover, while the estimated half-time for signal recovery was the same for EGFP-HBZ-SP1 and EGFP-HBZ-SP1&#x00394;ZIP, the mean percentage of mobile fraction of EGFP-HBZ-SP1&#x00394;ZIP only was 16.4 &#x000b1; 1.5% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The decreased mobility of the HBZ-SP1&#x00394;ZIP protein compared with the full-length protein also suggested that deletion of the ZIP domain perturbs the intracellular mobility of HBZ-SP1 protein. In conclusion, one plausible interpretation for these observations is that HBZ needs cellular partners, including bZIP factors, to form HBZ-NBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Association of HBZ-SP1 with JunB is involved in the formation of HBZ-NBs</title><p>To confirm that cellular proteins might be involved in HBZ-NBs formation, we studied the subcellular localization of an HBZ mutant deleted in its N-terminal region while retaining the amino acid sequence from residues 120 to 206 (still containing the C-terminal domain able to interact with bZIP factors). This mutant fused to EGFP (EGFP-HBZ bZIP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) exhibited a staining pattern identical to that of EGFP (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), with a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This observation was expected since we have previously shown that HBZ possesses two basic regions BR1 and BR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) involved in its nuclear transport located upstream from the bZIP domain but absent in HBZ bZIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The localization of this mutant was then analyzed in the presence of JunB. This cellular factor was specifically chosen for these analyses since the effect of HBZ on JunB activity still remains unclear. In fact, while HBZ decreases JunB DNA-binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, HBZ surprisingly stimulates the collagenase promoter activity in the presence of JunB in CEM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, this activation is very weak and dose-independent suggesting that it could be due to an HBZ-dependent stimulation of an endogenous cellular factor, which binds to the collagenase promoter, <italic>i.e</italic>. JunD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, JunB showed a diffuse pattern in the nuclei of transfected COS cells, which was easy to discriminate from the HBZ-NB pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Interestingly, when COS cells were co-transfected with HBZ bZIP and JunB expression vectors, both proteins were modified in their cellular distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d&#x02013;f</xref>). Indeed, they colocalized in nuclear spots, which are similar to that observed in the nuclei after cotransfection of COS cells with JunB and the wild type HBZ-SP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g&#x02013;i</xref>). It is worth noting that we have previously described such a staining pattern for JunB in the presence of the original HBZ isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, while JunB did not modify the staining pattern of the EGFP control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4j&#x02013;l</xref>), the EGFP-HBZ bZIP staining was reduced in the cytoplasm in the presence of JunB (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Altogether, these results show that the presence of JunB leads to the nuclear accumulation of HBZ bZIP and that the association of both proteins is involved their targeting into NBs. They also confirm that cellular partners of HBZ are involved in its nuclear trafficking.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Stimulation of HBZ-NBs formation by JunB</bold>.

For this reason, HeLa represented an ideal cell line to study the <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of the HBZ-SP1 protein on JunB transcriptional activity. We first tested the effects of the HBZ-SP1 protein on HPV-18 transcription in the presence of exogenous JunB. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid pLCR-Luc containing the LCR upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, pcDNA-JunB and increasing amounts of pcDNA-HBZ-SP1-Myc. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, the stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene by exogenous JunB was weak although this modest induction was likely related to the previously reported high expression level of endogenous JunB in HeLa cells due to a 3-fold amplification of the Jun-B gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the presence of the HBZ-SP1 protein, the stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene was inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

In light of these data, we next investigated whether the HBZ-SP1 protein could affect cell cycle progression of HeLa cells.

The HBZ-SP1 mRNA has been described to be the most abundant HBZ spliced variant detected in different HTLV-I-infected cell lines and importantly in cellular clones isolated from HTLV-I-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition, by immunoblot analyses and immunochemistry, Murata et al. have recently demonstrated that the ATL cell lines predominantly express HBZ-SP1 isoform at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They have also observed that the HBZ-SP1 protein can be located in the nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in addition to its association with particular NBs, which have been already described for the original HBZ isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our data here confirm their observations since, in transfected COS cells, the EGFP-HBZ-SP1 fusion protein is effectively located in the nucleoli. Moreover, although we have previously demonstrated that the original HBZ could be associated with heterochromatin distributed around the nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we found no association of the HBZ-SP1 protein with heterochromatin markers (data not shown). The location of the HBZ-SP1 protein in the nucleoli is not unexpected since we have previously demonstrated that HBZ possesses two basic regions, BR1 and BR2, positioned upstream of its bZIP domain, which are similar in sequence to the consensus nucleolar localization signal and are able to target EGFP to nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The functional role for this particular subcellular targeting remains however unclear. The nucleolus has been described to be involved in the sequestration of transcription factors, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1;, as well as of proteins that modulate transcription factor activity, such as Mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that nucleolar proteins can regulate the function of the HBZ-SP1 protein. Conversely, it could be suggested that the HBZ-SP1 protein might act on nucleolar proteins, especially knowing that this viral protein has been shown to be located in nucleoli of ATL cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In addition to BR1 and BR2, a third NLS region corresponding to the basic domain of the HBZ bZIP has been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the presence of at least two of the three NLSs is necessary for the translocation of this protein to the nucleus. In this study, we confirm these previous observations since the EGFP-HBZ bZIP fusion protein exhibits a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus. On the other hand, in the presence of JunB, nuclear accumulation of HBZ bZIP is stimulated. Moreover, our results indicate that HBZ bZIP is efficiently targeted into HBZ-NBs by interaction with JunB. On the other hand, this interaction causes targeting of both proteins into NBs and not into the nucleoli, confirming that BR1 and BR2 are likely to be involved in the transport of the viral protein into the nucleoli. In addition, we find that HBZ-NBs do not colocalize with nuclear proteins known to be associated with active transcriptional sites. Effectively, in HeLa cells transfected with EGFP-HBZ-SP1 fusion protein, we have demonstrated that the relocalization of endogenous JunB into HBZ-NBs is associated with repression of its activity. It is worth noting that we have previously demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity of JunB on AP-1 site is inhibited in the presence of HBZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Taken together, our results suggest that the HBZ-SP1 protein could inhibit JunB activity by forming a heterodimer unable to bind to viral or cellular promoters and by targeting JunB to HBZ-NBs. This hypothesis is confirmed by the data obtained with JunD. Indeed, HBZ stimulates JunD transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], does not modify its DNA-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus in the presence of JunD. The latter result differs from a previous study performed in our laboratory. We had found that HBZ entailed an intracellular redistribution of JunD into NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We speculate that this difference may be related to the fact that JunD was tagged with RFP, which has impaired the JunD transcriptional activity <italic>in vivo </italic>(our unpublished data). Henceforth, it would be of high interest to determine whether other nuclear proteins could be associated with the HBZ-NBs. For the moment, we have tested different proteins including PML, SC35, HP1&#x003b1;, HP1&#x003b2;, HP1&#x003b3;, and HMGA1a (data not shown), and none of these proteins demonstrated colocalization with the HBZ-SP1 protein. These particular nuclear structures could also correspond to sites promoting protein degradation as suggested by Matsumoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or protein modification as already described for members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

In this study, we further extend these observations with our results on JunB. From our studies, it is apparent that HBZ is capable of inhibiting both c-Jun and JunB transcriptional activities while it stimulates JunD activity. Thus, HBZ provides an interesting model to better understand the consequences of a dysfunction of the AP-1 pathway in T cells. Future experiments focussed on the regulation of HBZ expression and activity will also be of great interest. Moreover, the identification of putative cellular genes controlled by this novel AP-1 factor should elucidate the diverse regulatory properties of HBZ and its exact function in the development of ATL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The vectors pcDNA-HBZ-SP1-Myc, pEGFP-HBZ-bZIP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), pcDNA-JunB, pCMV-JunD-Flag have already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

For analyses of S-phase entry, the cells were arrested by using a double thymidine block. The HeLa cells were blocked for 12h with 2,5 mM thymidine, washed with DMEM without serum, transfected with the indicated vector and, at 12 h posttransfection, cells were again blocked with 2,5 mM thymidine for another 12 h to arrest all cells at the beginning of S phase. The cells were released from the thymidine block by three washes in fresh medium and allowed to progress through G<sub>1 </sub>and into S phase by stimulation with 10% FCS. The cell cycle positioning of serum-stimulated cells was determined at different time points by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AP-1: activator protein-1</p><p>ATL: adult T-cell leukemia</p><p>bZIP: basic region-leucine zipper</p><p>EGFP: enhanced-green-fluorescent protein</p><p>FRAP: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</p><p>HBZ: HTLV-I bZIP</p><p>HTLV-I: human T-cell leukaemia virus type I</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PH performed the FRAP analyses and most of the fluorescence microscopy analyses, and helped in drafting and finalizing the manuscript.
