A3G contains two canonical cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), of which only the C-terminal one is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By exploiting the crystal structure of the related tetrameric APOBEC2 (A2) protein, we identified residues within A3G that have the potential to mediate oligomerization of the protein. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical crosslinking, we show that tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 within the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA domain mediate A3G oligomerization, and this coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. In addition to the importance of specific residues in A3G, oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology modelling of A3G onto the A2 template structure indicates an accumulation of positive charge in a pocket formed by a putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. Consistent with RNA serving a central role in all these activities, the oligomerization-deficient A3G proteins associated less efficiently with several cellular RNA molecules. Accordingly, we propose that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging into virions and antiviral function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>APOBEC3G is a human protein that inhibits the replication of HIV-1 in CD4&#x0002b; T cells. It gains entry to the virus particles that are released from infected cells and subsequently interferes with viral genome replication, which in the case of HIV-1 is reverse transcription. APOBEC3G is a cytidine deaminase, and it catalyses the deamination of cytidines to uridines in viral single-stranded DNA replication intermediates, resulting in the generation of defective progeny viruses. In addition, APOBEC3G can inhibit reverse transcription by a poorly characterized deamination-independent mechanism. HIV-1 has evolved the viral Vif protein to counteract the antiviral properties of APOBEC3G. Vif associates with APOBEC3G and targets it for proteasomal degradation, such that intracellular levels of APOBEC3G are reduced and packaging into virions is averted. Based on the structure of a human homolog of APOBEC3G, APOBEC2, we performed a mutational analysis of amino acids that have the potential to mediate the assembly of APOBEC3G into multi-component complexes. We report that these amino acids affect the association of APOBEC3G with itself and cellular RNA, and that the same attributes are also required for packaging into virions and antiviral function. Thus, the processes of APOBEC3G self-association, RNA binding, and virion packaging are functionally linked and essential for virus inhibition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human protein APOBEC3G (A3G) belongs to a family of cellular polynucleotide cytidine deaminases and is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 in the absence of the viral protein Vif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

This reduction of intracellular levels in A3G results in a substantial decrease in the packaging of A3G into virus particles and, therefore, suppresses its antiviral properties.</p><p>The recent reports of the crystal structure of APOBEC2 (A2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Prochnow1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and the NMR and crystal structures of the C-terminal cytidine deaminase (CDA) domain of A3G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> offer opportunities to investigate the structure-function organization of APOBEC proteins with greater incisiveness. Although the physiological function of A2 is as yet unknown, its structure shows all the hallmarks of a cytidine deaminase, being a five-stranded mixed &#x003b2;-sheet which presents on one face two &#x003b1;-helices containing the H/C-X-E-X<sub>23&#x02013;28</sub>-P-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C catalytic centre that coordinates a zinc ion. Surprisingly, A2 associates into tetramers in a manner unprecedented among cytidine deaminases.

An A2 monomer contains a single CDA domain and two of these form a dimer by joining the &#x003b2;-sheets present in each monomer in a side-by-side fashion such that one wide &#x003b2;-sheet is formed. The tetramer is assembled from two such dimers through head-to head interactions at one edge of the extended &#x003b2;-sheets.</p><p>In contrast to A2, A3G contains two CDA domains in a single polypeptide chain, which are termed the N- and C-terminal CDA domains (N-CDA and C-CDA, respectively). Indeed, the CDA fold observed in the A2 crystal structure closely matches the structure of the truncated A3G C-CDA domain as observed by NMR and crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Differences arise mainly at the peripheral loops, which are generally longer in A3G than in A2. The A3G C-CDA fragment is exclusively monomeric, both in solution and in crystalline form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore asked whether the tetrameric structure of A2 may hold clues not only into how A3G oligomerizes, but also into its participation in other interactions. Here, we show that hydrophobic residues in A3G that are equivalent to those that mediate A2 oligomerization are required for RNA-dependent oligomerization, packaging into HIV-1 virions and the inhibition of HIV-1 infection. In addition, we present a homology model of an A3G dimer that reveals a positively charged pocket at the predicted dimer interface. Mutation of basic residues within this pocket also affects oligomerization, RNA interactions, virion packaging and virus inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Differential contributions of A3G N- and C-CDA domains to packaging, DNA editing, and oligomerization</title><p>The tetramer interface of A2 is formed of extensive hydrophobic, polar and electrostatic interactions, many of which are clustered in a loop termed L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Prochnow1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, residues F155, M156 and W157 mediate key hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas R153, E158 and E159 are involved in salt-bridges as well as in hydrogen bonding. Upon alignment of the A2 amino acid sequence with the N- or C-terminal CDA sequences of A3G, we identified a highly similar loop sequence in both CDA domains of A3G in which both charged and hydrophobic residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Arginines equivalent to R153 in A2 are present at positions 122 and 313 in A3G, whereas the tyrosines at positions 124 and 315 in A3G are at the equivalent position of F155 in A2. Although F155 does not make any direct interactions across the tetramer interface of the A2 crystal, it is involved in a cluster of hydrophobic packing interactions that sandwich M156 between Y61 and F155 at the tetramer interface. A tryptophan equivalent to W157 in A2 is present only in the N-CDA of A3G at position 127. W157 of A2 makes extensive hydrophobic interactions across the tetramer interface, notably with Y214 and W157 of the adjacent subunit.</p><fig id="ppat-1000330-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000330.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The tetramer interface of A2 and sequence alignment with A3G.</title><p>(A) Detail of the A2 tetramer interface, highlighting residues that mediate oligomerization interactions.

That analysis also revealed that substitutions at positions Y124 and W127 yield A3G proteins that are inefficiently packaged into virus particles and therefore lose their antiviral properties. Given the involvement of the conserved counterparts of these residues in A2 oligomerization, we sought to establish whether this region would have an analogous activity in A3G. To investigate this possibility, and to compare the contribution that the N- or C-CDAs of A3G may make to oligomerization, we introduced identical mutations (alanine, leucine and phenylalanine) at residues Y124 and Y315; these residues were chosen because they are present at equivalent positions in both the N- and C-CDA of A3G, and because the mutant proteins are expressed well. In contrast, the introduction of substitutions at the conserved arginine at position 122 resulted in poor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and mutants of R122 were therefore not examined further. The construction of mutations at position W127 has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We first tested these mutant A3G proteins for their ability to inhibit HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The substitution of Y124 or Y315 to alanine or leucine caused marked losses of antiviral function, whereas substitutions to the chemically more similar phenylalanine resulted in less marked disruption. Determination of the A3G content of virus particles revealed that all mutations at position Y124 result in poor packaging, whereas packaging was maintained with mutations at position Y315 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the Y124F mutation yielded low but clearly detectable levels of A3G in virions in comparison to mutants Y124A and Y124L, which likely explains why this protein showed a less severe loss of antiviral activity. We next determined the extent to which wild type or mutant A3G can act as a mutagen in a bacterial DNA editing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In this analysis, we included two mutants of W127 (W127A and W127Y), which have previously been shown to have substantial packaging defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Editing activity was maintained following substitutions at positions Y124 and W127, but mutations at position Y315 caused a loss of editing. Together, these results indicate that the loss of antiviral activity imparted by mutations at residues Y124 and W127 corresponds to reduced packaging, whereas DNA editing activity is unaffected. Conversely, mutations at residue Y315 ablate DNA editing but not packaging into virions, which is consistent with the critical involvement of Y315 in substrate DNA binding at the catalytically active C-CDA domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1000330-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000330.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Characterization of A3G proteins with mutations at Y124, W127, and Y315.</title><p>(A) Single-cycle infectivity of HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> viruses produced in the presence of wild type or mutant A3G, indicated on the x-axis, as measured in relative luciferase units and presented as percent infectivity relative to the wild type A3G (RLU, y-axis).

This result indicates that the species migrating at &#x0223c;80 kD is indeed formed by intermolecular crosslinking between A3G-HA and A3G-myc.</p><p>To assess in greater detail the oligomerization characteristics of some of our mutant A3G proteins, we next performed a crosslinking experiment with untagged wild type A3G or A3G harbouring the Y124A, Y315A or W127A mutations. The &#x0223c;80 kD crosslinked species appeared at a low level with the Y124A mutant and was barely detectable with the W127A mutant, whereas it was efficiently generated with the Y315A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Crosslinking and co-immunopreciptitaton of A3G with the Y124F or W127Y mutations resulted in increased levels oligomerization in comparison to the respective alanine mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000330.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which correlates with the less disruptive effects on virus packaging of these substitutions relative to the alanine mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>).

We were unable to detect any intermolecular crosslinks between A3G and Mov10 (results not shown), further suggesting that the &#x0223c;80 kD crosslinked species forms as a consequence of A3G intermolecular contacts. Together, these results indicate that residues Y124 and W127 play central roles in the N-CDA mediated oligomerization of A3G, and that this interaction is also dependent on the presence of RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Modelling of an A3G dimer</title><p>In a complementary approach for addressing the mode of A3G oligomerization, we constructed homology models of A3G dimers using the A2 crystal structure as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In these models, the N- and C-CDA domains of one A3G polypeptide together form the extended &#x003b2;-sheet that is the equivalent of an A2 dimer. Models with either the N-CDA or C-CDA at the oligomer interface, which corresponds to the tetramer interface of A2, were then assembled and subjected to energy minimization. In convergence with the results of the experiments described above, models with N-CDA at the oligomer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) proved energetically more favourable than models with the C-CDA at the dimer interface by &#x0223c;2000 to &#x0223c;3000 kJ/mol, depending on interactions with the solvent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000330.s004">Table S1</xref>).

Upon modelling of an A3G dimer onto the template A2 crystal structure, we identified a positively charged pocket at the oligomer interface formed between two N-CDAs that bore the hallmarks of a nucleic acid binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Thus, our findings demonstrate further segregation of functions between the N- and C-CDA domains of A3G.</p><p>Throughout our chemical crosslinking experiments, we consistently observed the generation of oligomeric A3G migrating at &#x0223c;80 kD, which is twice the relative molecular mass of untreated A3G, which migrates at &#x0223c;40 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g006">6</xref>). This result suggests that A3G oligomerizes as a discrete dimer, an assertion that is further supported by the fact that we did not detect slower migrating species at &#x0223c;120 (trimer) or &#x0223c;160 kD (tetramer). We note, however, that we have not formally demonstrated dimerization of A3G, as attempts to perform analytical ultracentrifugation were unsuccessful owing to the poor solubility of purified full-length A3G at high concentrations (results not shown). Nonetheless, dimerization of A3G via the N-terminal CDA domain remains the simplest model to explain our current results. Although this conclusion is at odds with a recent study proposing oligomerization of A3G via the C-CDA domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Bennett1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, that study is also contradicted by the observations that the C-CDA of A3G appears as a monomer by both ultracentrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Chen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Holden1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, we have furthermore demonstrated that the oligomerizaton of A3G is dependent on the presence of RNA, as evidenced by the disruption of oligomers upon treatment with RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These observations are explained by our combined modelling and structure-function analyses, which predict that the oligomer interface between the A3G N-terminal CDA domains produces a positively charged pocket that requires occupation by RNA to allow effective oligomerization. Thus, we propose that the formation of A3G oligomers requires hydrophopic and basic residues that mediate protein-protein interactions between the A3G subunits and/or protein-RNA interactions, in a manner similar to that proposed for PKR and RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Wu1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Cui1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We acknowledge, however, that the precise contribution of these residues to RNA-dependent oligomerization of A3G must await advances in the biochemical characterization of this protein.</p><p>An additional piece of evidence supporting the interdependence between the oligomerization of A3G and the association with RNA comes from the analysis of Y1, Y4 and 7SL RNA in A3G RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In general terms, we observed that oligomerization-impaired mutants of A3G exhibited much reduced co-immunoprecipitation of these RNA molecules. Indeed, correlations between oligomer formation and RNA interaction were excellent in that the R30A and Y124A mutants displayed partial A3G-A3G interactions as well as intermediate levels of RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000330-g007">7</xref>). An additional instructive observation was made upon velocity sedimentation of cell lysates with oligomerization-impaired A3G, which demonstrated that assembly into RNase-sensitive high molecular weight RNP complexes was not noticeably affected by these mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000330.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This demonstrates that A3G's assembly into at least two intermolecular complexes is RNA-dependent: the oligomerization of A3G and its recruitment into RNP complexes. Importantly, our mutational analysis shows that oligomerization can be disrupted selectively without grossly preventing RNP association. This suggests either that (1) there is a certain degree of specificity to the identity of RNAs that are required for A3G oligomerization, but not to the RNAs that promote RNP association, or that (2) recruitment of A3G to RNase-sensitive RNP complexes is driven predominantly by protein-protein interactions. Specifically, RNA-dependent A3G RNP formation through protein-protein interactions could be mediated by proteins that bind A3G directly and additionally bind RNA.</p><p>Throughout these studies, we have highlighted a tight correlation between the packaging into HIV-1 virions and the RNA-dependent oligomerization of wild type and mutant A3G proteins.

A structure model of an A3G dimer based on the A2 crystal structure readily rationalizes the RNA-dependency of oligomerization as it revealed a clustering of positive charge near the predicted dimer interface. Furthermore, the model proved consistent with the contribution of basic residues at the interface to RNA-dependent oligomerization and packaging of A3G into virus particles. We thus propose that this model can serve as a guide for the further dissection of the structure-function relationships of domains and motifs within A3G. Ultimately, this may help endeavours aimed at therapeutic intervention with the interaction between the HIV-1 Vif protein and A3G. In particular, such efforts should strive to preserve the antiviral functions of A3G by interrupting the interaction with Vif, while maintaining the interactions that mediate association with RNA, oligomerization and virion packaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>Wild type and mutant A3G expression plasmids for infectivity studies, immunoprecitation, crosslinking and the bacterial editing assay were generated as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000330-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.
