Although 53BP1 and MDC1 have been recently identified as critical upstream mediators in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, their relative hierarchy in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling cascade remains controversial. To investigate the divergent and potentially overlapping functions of MDC1 and 53BP1 in the ATM response pathway, we generated mice deficient for both genes. Unexpectedly, the loss of both MDC1 and 53BP1 neither significantly increases the severity of defects in DDR nor increases tumor incidence compared with the loss of MDC1 alone. We additionally show that MDC1 regulates 53BP1 foci formation and phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. These results suggest that MDC1 functions as an upstream regulator of 53BP1 in the DDR pathway and in tumor suppression.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; BRCT, BRCA1 C terminal; CSR, class-switch recombination; DDR, DNA damage response; DKO, double KO; HR, homologous recombination; IR, ionizing radiation; KO, knockout; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MMC, mitomycin C; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>To ensure the meticulous transmission of genetic information, there exists a series of checkpoints that are activated when DNA damage is detected. At the apex of the signaling cascade initiated after the detection of DNA double-strand breaks is the serine/threonine protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2001</xref>). ATM has been shown to phosphorylate a broad range of substrates upon activation, including NBS1, BRCA1, and Chk2. ATM patients show symptoms including neural degeneration, immunodeficiency, growth retardation, premature aging, cancer predisposition, and severe sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shiloh, 2003</xref>), with ATM-deficient mice displaying many of these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu and Baltimore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, understanding the ATM signaling cascade has been pivotal to discovering the mechanisms underlying genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Recently, 53BP1 and MDC1 have been recognized as critical upstream mediators in the cellular response to double-strand breaks, although the extent and nature of their interaction is not known.</p><p>53BP1 has been suggested to be the mammalian orthologue of scRad9/spCrb2, a protein critical for DNA damage response (DDR) in yeast. Like many proteins of the DDR pathways, 53BP1 contains tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains. In addition, 53BP1 contains a tudor domain that binds methylated K79 of histone H3 or K20 of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huyen et al., 2004</xref>). 53BP1 is phosphorylated after IR in an ATM-dependent fashion and localizes to IR-induced foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rappold et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, moderate checkpoint defects have been reported in cells depleted of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Analysis of 53BP1 knockout (KO) mice confirmed an important role for 53BP1 in genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morales et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>), with null mice recapitulating some of the ATM-deficient phenotypes, although they were less severe (notably growth retardation, mild checkpoint defect, genomic instability, and mild tumor incidence). These moderate phenotypes challenge the notion that 53BP1 is the only orthologue of the original scRad9.</p><p>Subsequently, MDC1 was identified and described by several groups as being a critical mediator of DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stucki and Jackson, 2004</xref>). MDC1 contains tandem BRCT domains as well as a forkhead-associated domain and a repeat region, which also mediate protein interactions. Through its BRCT domains, MDC1 binds &#x003b3;H2AX and recruits activated ATM to the sites of DNA damage, thus amplifying DNA damage signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stucki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). siRNA against MDC1 were used to demonstrate MDC1's role in G2/M checkpoint response, IR-induced foci formation, and Chk2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stucki and Jackson, 2004</xref>). A role of MDC1 in DNA repair has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). However, it was not until MDC1 KO mice were generated that the importance of MDC1's function in ATM signaling and genomic stability became apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). MDC1-null mice displayed many of the phenotypes associated with ATM deficiency: growth retardation, IR sensitivity, male infertility, gross genomic instability, and S-phase and G2/M checkpoint defects. Although it remains to be determined whether MDC1 has tumor suppressor functions in vivo, so far the phenotypes observed in MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are milder than those of ATM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that MDC1, like 53BP1, only regulates a subset of ATM signaling.</p><p>The data regarding the interactions between MDC1 and 53BP1 in the ATM signaling cascade have often been conflicting; although both 53BP1 and MDC1 are required for correct and robust DDR, there are some differences between the two proteins. Notably, 53BP1 does not seem to play a major role in checkpoint activation but is crucial in a subset of DNA repair functions, especially class-switch recombination (CSR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Manis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ward et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, MDC1 seems to have major role in checkpoint activation but a moderate role in DNA repair. Thus, it appears that MDC1 and 53BP1 may regulate separate branches of the DDR downstream of ATM. To clarify these points, we generated mice deficient of both MDC1 and 53BP1 and investigated how the loss of both MDC1 and 53BP1 affects DDR and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>MDC1/53BP1 deficiency and radiosensitivity</title><p>One of the hallmarks of defective DDR is hypersensitivity to IR. ATM-, MDC1-, and 53BP1-deficient mice have been shown to be hypersensitive to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu and Baltimore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). Mice deficient for both MDC1 and 53BP1 (double KO [DKO]) demonstrated similar overall levels of morbidity to the MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice 12 d after 7 Gy whole body irradiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), all of whose survival were significantly lower than the survival of wild-type (WT) mice (53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, P &#x0003d; 0.0164; MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, P &#x0003d; 0.0494; DKO, P &#x0003d; 0.0455). DKO survival after IR was distinct from that of the single KOs, as the DKO onset of morbidity was earlier than that of the single KOs, although this did not correspond with a significant decrease in survival (P &#x0003d; 0.4672 for MDC1 KO and P &#x0003d; 0.7968 for 53BP1 KO). Correlating with the whole body IR results, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show sensitivity to IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). MEFs from DKO mice are only slightly more sensitive to IR than those from MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although not statistically more so (P &#x0003d; 0.668 for MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and P &#x0003d; 0.439 for 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Radiosensitivity of DKO mice and MEFs.</bold> (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curve of WT (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9), 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8), MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10), and DKO (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8) mice after 7 Gy of whole body IR.

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, 53BP1 KO MEFs showed a mild, insignificant resistance to MMC when compared with WT (P &#x0003d; 0.167). MMC-induced DNA damage is believed to be mainly repaired by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brugmans et al., 2007</xref>), and loss of 53BP1 has been shown to enhance HR as a result of its suppressive role in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2007</xref>), which could contribute to this mild resistance to MMC in 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Inversely, the loss of MDC1, which has been reported to be involved in HR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2007</xref>), resulted in mild decreased survival in comparison to WT (P &#x0003d; 0.071). However, the DKO line displayed a significantly higher sensitivity to MMC than WT and 53BP1 lines (P &#x0003d; 0.0031 and P &#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively) but was not significantly more sensitive to MMC than the MDC1 KO line (P &#x0003d; 0.2267). This result suggests that although MDC1 and 53BP1 may have distinct repair functions, the loss of MDC1 is a dominant effect in the context of DKO.</p></sec><sec><title>MDC1/53BP1 deficiency and genomic instability</title><p>As MEFs from both MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been shown to have higher rates of genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>), we next examined how the loss of both MDC1 and 53BP1 affects chromosome stability before and after IR. Mitotic spreads prepared from single and DKO passage 1 MEFs were examined by light microscopy. Although unirradiated WT MEFs had relatively few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations (14% of MEFs examined), including chromatid breaks, chromosome fusions, and fragments from chromosome breaks, 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs had a significantly higher incidence with 40% and 60% of spreads containing chromosome aberrations, respectively (P &#x0003d; 0.00019 and P &#x0003d; 3.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, respectively; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Cells were treated with 1 Gy IR and were allowed to recover for 1 h, and spreads were made and examined for chromosome aberrations. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, WT MEFs had zero to four breaks per spread, with zero being the highest frequency at 40% followed by one-break frequencies of 38%. 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells had between zero and eight breaks per spread, with two and then one break per spread being the most prevalent. MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs again appear more sensitive to chromosomal aberrations than WT or 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and had &#x0003e;90% of spreads containing two or more breaks.

MDC1 and 53BP1 have previously been shown to regulate Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peng and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>). MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs showed weak activation of Chk1 and Chk2. However, the loss of both MDC1 and 53BP1 did not further decrease Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S1 B). Although we did observe a reproducible defect in Chk2 phosphorylation, the decreased level of Chk2 seen in MDC1 KO cells was observed in some, but not all, experiments. Finally, we examined checkpoint activation in MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and DKO MEFs. Both MDC1 and 53BP1 have been shown to regulate the G2/M checkpoint. As has been previously reported, the loss of MDC1 resulted in a defective G2/M checkpoint, with more cells able to enter mitosis after IR than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Similarly, the loss of 53BP1 also resulted in some inappropriate progression into mitosis. However, in DKO cells, the observed G2/M checkpoint defect is comparable to that seen in MDC1-null cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of both 53BP1 and MDC1 does not cause more severe checkpoint defects than the loss of MDC1 alone.</p></sec><sec><title>MDC1 regulates 53BP1 phosphorylation and localization at the sites of DNA damage</title><p>Our results with 53BP1/MDC1 DKO mice and cells suggest that MDC1 and 53BP1 likely function on the same molecular pathway downstream of ATM. Conflicting results have been reported as to whether 53BP1 foci formation requires MDC1, possibly as a result of the different siRNA used and the extent of MDC1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peng and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005</xref>). We found that 53BP1 failed to form foci in MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). On the other hand, MDC1 foci formation is normal in 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. These results suggest that MDC1 is an upstream regulator of 53BP1 localization after DNA damage.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>MDC1 regulates 53BP1 foci formation and phosphorylation.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) MEFs of the indicated genotypes were irradiated (10 Gy), and foci formation of MDC1, 53BP1, RNF8, and &#x003b3;H2AX was determined by immunofluorescence.

To confirm these studies, we generated RNF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and isolated MEFs from RNF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Loss of RNF8 resulted in the failure of 53BP1 foci formation, whereas MDC1 foci formation remained intact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). On the other hand, RNF8 foci formation is dependent on MDC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), suggesting the existence of an MDC1&#x02013;RNF8&#x02013;53BP1 pathway for the accumulation of 53BP1 at or near the sites of DNA damage.</p><p>We further investigated whether MDC1 regulates 53BP1 phosphorylation. 53BP1 is phosphorylated at S25/29 by ATM after DNA damage, and the phosphorylation of S25 has been shown to be important for the binding of Pax transactivation domain&#x02013;interacting protein and proper DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Munoz et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>, 53BP1 phosphorylation at S25/29 is defective in MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, suggesting that MDC1 also regulates 53BP1 phosphorylation after DNA damage. Collectively, our results suggest that MDC1 and 53BP1 act in the same molecular pathway of the DDR, and MDC1 is an upstream regulator of 53BP1 by regulating 53BP1 phosphorylation and foci formation after DNA damage.</p><p>MDC1 and 53BP1 are two important mediator proteins of the DDR pathway. Our observations indicate that the phenotypes of MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and DKO mice are substantially milder than that of ATM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that it is unlikely that MDC1 and 53BP1 are critical for ATM activation. Concurrently, our studies of DDR (radiosensitivity, DNA repair, and genomic stability) indicate that the phenotypes of DKO mice and cells mostly resemble those of MDC1 KO mice; this is in contrast to <italic>scid</italic>/Rad54<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that showed a drastic increase in radiosensitivity compared with <italic>scid</italic> or Rad54<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Essers et al., 2000</xref>). Although a role in nonhomologous end joining and HR by 53BP1 and MDC1, respectively, has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2007</xref>), it is possible that 53BP1 and MDC1 only play a supporting role in these processes, which were not obvious in our in vivo studies.</p><p>We have shown that MDC1 regulates 53BP1 localization to the sites of DNA damage and 53BP1 phosphorylation at S25/29, which is necessary for the correct phosphorylation of both Chk2 and BRCA1 and subsequent checkpoint activation. Therefore, MDC1 might regulate these signaling events partially through its ability to control 53BP1 phosphorylation. Using MEFs from MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and RNF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we show that 53BP1 localization to the sites of DNA damage requires RNF8, which, in turn, requires MDC1. These results support several recent studies demonstrating that MDC1 recruits RNF8 to the sites of DNA damage and RNF8, in turn, ubiquitinates H2AX, H2A, and probably other substrates at the sites of DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang and Elledge, 2007</xref>). Ubiquitinated H2AX, H2A, or other RNF8 substrates would then recruit BRCA1 and 53BP1. BRCA1 is proposed to bind ubiquitinated RNF8 substrates indirectly through a mediator protein, Rap80, which has an ubiquitin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sobhian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). However, Rap80 is not required for 53BP1 foci formation, suggesting that an unidentified factor mediates the binding of ubiquitinated protein and 53BP1. Therefore, we propose an H2AX&#x02013;MDC1&#x02013;RNF8 pathway, which is distinct from methylated H3/H4 that also regulates 53BP1 foci formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). It is not clear why cells use two different mechanisms to regulate the localization of 53BP1 and whether these two mechanisms relate to each other. The fact that 53BP1 but not MDC1 is essential for CSR and that 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells respond differently from MDC1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells to MMC suggest that 53BP1 does have functions independent of MDC1. It is possible that the mode of 53BP1 recruitment is specific to the functions of 53BP1. These issues need to be further clarified in the future.</p><p>Our studies on organism development and tumorigenesis further highlight the fact that genomic instability is a driving force of tumorigenesis, supporting the data that many DDR factors function as potent tumor suppressors. 53BP1 has been show to function as a tumor suppressor in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morales et al., 2006</xref>), whereas our data are the first to suggest a role for MDC1 in tumor suppression. A recent study showed the loss of MDC1 expression in breast and lung cancer samples, supporting a potential role of MDC1 in tumor suppression in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartkova et al., 2007</xref>). However, MDC1 mutations have not yet been identified in human cancer samples. We did not find that loss of both MDC1 and 53BP1 significantly increased tumor incidence compared with MDC1 KO mice. Interestingly, the loss of MDC1 and 53BP1 is mostly mutually exclusive in human cancer samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartkova et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of either MDC1 or 53BP1 is sufficient for tumorigenesis, and the loss of both does not provide an overt additional advantage for tumor formation. Collectively, our studies clearly establish MDC1 as a tumor suppressor and an upstream regulator of 53BP1 in the DDR pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of 53BP1/MDC1 DKO mice, RNF8-deficient mice, and MEFs</title><p>MDC1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lou et al., 2006</xref>) were bred with 53BP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ward et al., 2003</xref>) to generate 53BP1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> MDC1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> offspring.
