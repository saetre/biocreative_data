Epistasis analyses involving many of these mutants established three distinct epistasis groups (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c1">1</xref>). Most members of the so-called <italic>RAD3</italic> epistasis group were subsequently shown to encode polypeptides directly involved in the biochemical mechanism of NER in yeast (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c1">1</xref>). Among the multiple genes assigned to this epistasis group is one designated <italic>MMS19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c2">2</xref>). In contrast to other yeast mutants defective in NER, <italic>mms19</italic> mutants are not only hypersensitive to UV radiation, but are additionally abnormally sensitive to the alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c3">3</xref>). The <italic>mms19</italic> mutation has been shown to compromise the incision step of NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c6">6</xref>).</p><p> The yeast <italic>MMS19</italic> (y<italic>MMS19</italic>) gene has been cloned and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c6">6</xref>). Mms19 protein apparently does not participate in NER directly, since it is not required for this process in a reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c7">7</xref>). However, a strain deleted of the gene acquires a thermolabile defect in RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription. This phenotype can be corrected <italic>in vitro</italic> by supplementing extracts with the basal transcription factor TFIIH, but not with Mms19 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c5">5</xref>). It is well established that TFIIH is not only essential for RNAP II transcription, but is also indispensable for NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c8">8</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the y<italic>MMS19</italic> gene has an influence on both RNAP II transcription and NER through an effect(s) on TFIIH. However, the nature of this effect is not understood nor is it clear why <italic>mms19</italic> mutants are abnormally sensitive to alkylating agents such as MMS.</p><p> The majority of the proteins involved in NER in yeast are conserved in higher eukaryotes. Indeed, with the exception of the proteins encoded by the <italic>RAD7</italic>, <italic>RAD16</italic> and <italic>MMS19</italic> genes, human or mouse orthologs have been identified for every other known yeast NER gene (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c1">1</xref>). In the present studies we have cloned and sequenced human, mouse and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> orthologs of the y<italic>MMS19</italic> gene and have mapped the human gene to chromosome 10q24. All the eukaryotic orthologs sequenced, as well as the orthologous <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> translated sequences obtained from public databases, have a conserved HEAT repeat domain in the C-terminal region. We have also observed substantial correction of the phenotypes of UV radiation sensitivity and thermosensitivity for growth of a yeast <italic>mms19</italic> deletion mutant following transfection of cells with plasmids that express the human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNAs. Hence, our findings provide evidence for functional conservation of Mms19 protein between lower and higher eukaryotes. Finally, we provide evidence for complex processing of the human and mouse <italic>MMS19</italic> primary transcripts, suggestive of complex regulation of expression of these genes. While these studies were in progress cloning of the human <italic>MMS19</italic> (h<italic>MMS19</italic>) gene was independently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>). We have observed differences in the translated amino acid sequence of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene from that previously reported. Additionally, the previously reported study failed to observe functional complementation of the UV radiation sensitivity and thermosensitivity of a yeast <italic>mms19</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning the mouse and human <italic>MMS19</italic> genes</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Mms19 protein was used to screen public databases using the TBLASTN algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c10">10</xref>). Two partially sequenced IMAGE clones &#x0005b;expressed sequence tag (EST) R89623 (clone 166947) derived from human adult brain and EST AA939567 (clone 1329989) derived from mouse thymus&#x0005d; were identified with homology to the 100&#x02013;200 C-terminal amino acids of yeast Mms19 protein. These clones provided sequences for the design of primers. To obtain full-length human and mouse cDNAs a similar approach was followed. A human pEBS7 directional cDNA library derived from HeLa cells was screened by hybridization with a 702 bp PCR fragment amplified with primers 5&#x02032;-CAGGACTCCTCAACAAGCAC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CCTGTGGTTTGTACGGCAGC-3&#x02032;.

Two ESTs derived from human adult brain (R89623) and from mouse thymus (AA939567) were identified with significant homology to the C-terminus of the y<italic>MMS19</italic> ORF. To obtain full-length <italic>MMS19</italic> cDNAs we screened human and mouse cDNA libraries with RT&#x02013;PCR probes. The largest clone obtained from a human HeLa cell cDNA library was 3772 bp in length. This cDNA contains an ORF of 2616 bp which can encode a protein of 872 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 96 kDa. Alignment with the yeast Mms19 protein indicated amino acid sequence homology extending at least 100 amino acids upstream of the methionine start codon in this human transcript (data not shown), suggesting that this cDNA corresponds to an alternatively spliced form of the primary transcript. We therefore performed 5&#x02032;-RACE from human testis total RNA using primers that map immediately 5&#x02032; to the first methionine codon in the cDNA. This confirmed the presence of alternatively spliced forms of the <italic>MMS19</italic> gene (see below) and provided a full-length transcript. To verify these results we amplified the full-length ORF of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene from human testis total RNA. A cDNA identical to the contiguous sequences previously aligned was obtained. The complete cDNA identified for the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene (GenBank accession no. AF319947) contains an ORF of 3090 nt which can encode a protein of 1030 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>) with a predicted molecular mass of 113 kDa.</p><p> A mouse testis cDNA library yielded a single 977 bp clone in the <italic>Mms19</italic> coding region. A full-length cDNA was obtained by multiple rounds of 5&#x02032;-RACE from mouse testis total RNA. The longest mouse <italic>Mms19</italic> cDNA identified (designated m<italic>Mms19</italic>) is 3491 bp in length (GenBank accession no. AF319949) and predicts a polypeptide of 1031 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>) with a molecular mass of 113 kDa. The d<italic>MMS19</italic> gene was cloned from whole fly total RNA by RT&#x02013;PCR. The gene comprises 2880 bp (GenBank accession no. AF319948) and can encode a protein of 958 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>) with a calculated molecular mass of 107 kDa.</p><p> y<italic>MMS19</italic> homologs from other eukaryotes, including <italic>S.pombe</italic> (CAB59878), <italic>Caenorhabitis elegans</italic> (AF067936) and <italic>A.thaliana</italic> (AB023039) were translated from genomic and partial cDNA clones obtained from public databases. Protein alignments including all the identified <italic>MMS19</italic> orthologs confirmed extensive conservation of amino acid sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>). The predicted amino acid sequences of the human and mouse Mms19 proteins are 90&#x00025; identical and share 93&#x00025; similarity. Both the human and mouse polypeptides are essentially the same size as that encoded by the yeast gene (1030, 1031 and 1032 amino acids, respectively). They also share a similar frequency of acidic (10.3&#x00025; for human and mouse and 12.2&#x00025; for yeast) and basic (11.5&#x00025; for human and mouse and 12.1&#x00025; for yeast) amino acids and a similar estimated pI of 5.92 (5.72 for yeast Mms19 protein). Overall the human and mouse polypeptides share 25&#x00025; amino acid identity and 50&#x00025; similarity with the orthologous yeast Mms19 protein. The predicted amino acid sequence for the human protein differs from that previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>) over a stretch of 39 amino acids located between amino acid residues 373 and 412 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>).</p><p> The Mms19 proteins are confidently predicted to possess predominantly &#x003b1;-helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c16">16</xref>), with a small &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-domain potentially present in the middle part of the protein. Sequence analysis using the SEG program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c15">15</xref>) suggests that the Mms19 sequences can be partitioned into two predicted globular regions. The longer N-terminal globular region spans amino acid positions 1&#x02013;770, which includes a highly conserved region of &#x0223c;120 amino acids located between residues 167 and 285 of the yeast Mms19 protein. This region shares 42&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity and 62&#x00025; similarity with the mouse and human proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>). A shorter C-terminal globular region spans amino acid positions &#x0223c;880&#x02013;1032, whereas the intervening region is predicted to be non-globular. When the sequence of the C-terminal globular region was independently compared to the protein sequence database using the iterative PSI-BLAST program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c12">12</xref>), moderate but statistically significant similarity was detected to a variety of proteins containing so-called HEAT repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c20">20</xref>). Using an expect value of 0.05 as the cut-off for including sequences in the search profile the sequences of &#x0223c;500 HEAT repeat proteins were retrieved from the database in 10 search iterations without any obvious false positives. A more detailed analysis performed by searching the Mms19 sequences with a generic HEAT repeat profile (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f2">2</xref>) showed the presence of four repeats (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f2">2</xref>). These comprise a tightly spaced cluster, an arrangement characteristic of HEAT repeat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c20">20</xref>). The four repeats are conserved in all available sequences of eukaryotic Mms19 orthologs, with the exception of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> sequence in which the HEAT repeat region is highly diverged and only the distal repeat is clearly conserved (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f2">2</xref>). Of particular note is the motif KRx&#x0005b;IV&#x0005d;R (alternative amino acids in brackets), which is conserved in the most distal repeat of the Mms19 orthologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f1">1</xref>). This motif may function as a specific binding determinant.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative splicing of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene</title><p>During cloning of the human and mouse cDNAs we identified different clones, presumably reflecting multiple transcripts. To determine whether these correspond to alternatively spliced products we established the exon&#x0002f;intron boundaries of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>A). The gene comprises at least 32 exons spanning &#x0003e;40 kb. The two highly conserved domains described above are encoded by exons 8&#x02013;11 and exons 27&#x02013;32, respectively. The most abundant h<italic>MMS19</italic> cDNA (3530 bp) corresponds to &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of all transcripts identified and includes all coding exons (2b-32) plus exon 1 in the 5&#x02032;-UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>B, transcript A). This cDNA can potentially encode a polypeptide of 1030 amino acids and utilizes the first polyadenylation signal in the 3&#x02032;-UTR. Transcript B differs only in the 5&#x02032;-UTR by the presence of exon 2a instead of exon 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>B). The remaining cDNAs identified can encode polypeptides that are 43, 158 or 201 amino acids shorter than that encoded by transcripts A or B (1030 amino acids) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>). Alternative splicing of exon 8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>B, transcripts E and F) is expected to delete part of the N-terminal conserved region in the human Mms19 protein. At least one of these transcripts (transcript D, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>B) uses the second polyadenylation site (pA2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>A). Studies are in progress to evaluate the biological significance of these alternative transcripts. All detected transcripts include the region coding for the C-terminal HEAT repeats.</p></sec><sec><title>Human and mouse <italic>MMS19</italic> gene expression patterns</title><p>Northern blot analysis of human and mouse adult and fetal tissues revealed the presence of moderate to high steady-state levels of <italic>MMS19</italic> mRNA in all tissues analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f4">4</xref>A and B and data not shown). The most abundant transcript has an estimated size of 3.9 kb in human tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f4">4</xref>A) and 3.8 kb in mouse tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f4">4</xref>B). These presumably correspond to the most abundant cDNAs described above (3530 and 3491 bp for human and mouse, respectively). Both the human and mouse transcripts have consensus AAUAAA polyadenylation signals at positions 3514 and 3441, respectively, followed immediately by a poly(A) tail. Additional bands with estimated sizes of 4.8 and 5.8 kb in human and mouse tissues, respectively, were detected by northern blot analysis in most tissues examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f4">4</xref>). Significant differences in the ratio of the two transcripts were observed in different tissues. For example, the 4.8 kb transcript is relatively abundant in human pancreas, but is almost undetectable in skeletal muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f4">4</xref>A). The 4.8 kb band presumably reflects transcripts with a 3&#x02032;-UTR extending beyond the first polyadenylation signal, as represented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f3">3</xref>A. This region of the gene is very rich in <italic>Alu</italic> repeat sequences, hence it was not possible to design a probe to confirm this presumption by northern blot analysis.</p><p> In an effort to correlate the transcripts detected by northern blot analysis with the putative alternative splice products at exons 3 and 8 we hybridized the human northern blots with probes derived from both exons. In all cases the results were indistinguishable from those obtained with a 3&#x02032;-end probe (data not shown). We therefore conclude that both bands detected by northern blotting comprise a heterogeneous collection of alternatively spliced forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosomal mapping of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene</title><p>FISH with a BAC clone containing the entire h<italic>MMS19</italic> ORF yielded a single site of hybridization at chromosomal band 10q24. This localization is consistent with hybrid mapping results for two STSs (A002G19 and Cda19h12) in the NCBI public database, which align with the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the cloned h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of the yeast <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutant by hMMS19 and d<italic>MMS19</italic> cDNA</title><p>In view of the amino acid conservation between yeast Mms19 protein and that from higher eukaryotes, especially in the C- and N-terminal regions, we asked whether the <italic>MMS19</italic> genes from higher organisms can functionally complement mutant phenotypes of the yeast <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; strain, deleted of the entire <italic>MMS19</italic> gene. We overexpressed both h<italic>MMS19</italic> and d<italic>MMS19</italic> cDNAs under control of the yeast <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter in the yeast <italic>mms19</italic> deletion mutant. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f5">5</xref>, both cDNAs corrected thermosensitivity for growth of the <italic>mms19</italic> deletion mutant. Furthermore, whereas the doubling time of the yeast mutant is &#x0223c;19 h in liquid culture, at 37&#x000b0;C this doubling time was reduced to &#x0223c;3.5 h when the mutant strain was transformed with the human, <italic>Drosophila</italic> or yeast wild-type <italic>MMS19</italic> genes. The full-length h<italic>MMS19</italic> and d<italic>MMS19</italic> genes also complemented the UV radiation sensitivity of the <italic>mms19</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke307f6">6</xref>). However, these genes failed to complement the methionine auxotrophy of the yeast <italic>mms19</italic> mutant (data not shown). As expected, the y<italic>MMS19</italic> gene fully complemented the latter phenotype (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report here the identification of human, mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic><italic>MMS19</italic> gene. Alignments of these as well as several other apparent orthologs with the yeast Mms19 protein show extensive amino acid sequence conservation as well as similarity in size. In particular, we have identified highly conserved HEAT repeat domains in the C-terminus of this family of proteins. HEAT repeats have been identified in a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear eukaryotic proteins. The typical repeat unit consists of 30&#x02013;34 amino acid residues and forms two &#x003b1;-helices separated by a short loop, as inferred from the crystal structure of human &#x003b2;-importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c21">21</xref>). Arrays of HEAT repeats form tandemly arranged bi-helical structures that appear to function as scaffolds for assembly of other subunits of the corresponding complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c23">23</xref>). A common denominator for many of these proteins is their association with and involvement in the assembly of large, multisubunit protein complexes such as coated vesicles and microtubules. The recent demonstration of the presence of HEAT repeats in several chromatin-associated proteins, including subunits of cohesins and condensins and several transcription regulators, is particularly interesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c20">20</xref>).</p><p> Functional complementation of mutant phenotypes by NER proteins across species is the exception rather than the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c25">25</xref>), presumably reflecting specific structural requirements for efficient assembly of multiprotein complexes. Hence, the observed complementation of thermosensitive growth and UV radiation sensitivity of the yeast <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutant with the <italic>MMS19</italic> genes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans provides suggestive evidence for both structural and functional conservation of Mms19 protein.</p><p> While this manuscript was in preparation cloning and characterization of the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene was independently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>). However, while the putative human polypeptide protein identified in our study is precisely the same size, it differs from the previously published sequence over a stretch of 39 amino acids in the central part of the protein. This difference does not appear to result from alternative splicing since we have characterized the genomic structure corresponding to the coding region. Furthermore, the mouse cDNA is 90&#x00025; identical to our human cDNA clone and this identity includes the 39 amino acids that differ from the previously published translated sequence. We suggest that the previously published sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>) may have one or more mutations in the ORF and that the failure to observe correction of the yeast <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; mutant phenotype may derive from such mutations. No GenBank accession number was provided to verify this. Alternatively, the gene previously reported might represent a slightly altered duplication of the y<italic>MMS19</italic> gene. There is a precedent for duplication of a gene with an essential role in NER and RNAP II transcription. Specifically, p44 protein is a subunit of TFIIH that regulates the activity of XPD DNA helicase, another TFIIH subunit. In humans two closely linked <italic>p44</italic> genes have been identified (<italic>p44t</italic> and <italic>p44c</italic>), which can encode proteins that differ by just three amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c26">26</xref>).</p><p> Using RT&#x02013;PCR, molecular cloning and DNA sequencing we have demonstrated that the h<italic>MMS19</italic> primary transcript undergoes extensive processing and uses two different polyadenylation sites. Extensive alternative splicing is not uncommon in genes that encode transcription factors and may play a critical role(s) in the regulation of developmental pathways and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c28">28</xref>). Differences in the 5&#x02032;-UTR have been implicated in regulating transcription efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c29">29</xref>) and different 3&#x02032;-UTRs may be associated with differential stability or translatability of various mRNA products (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c30">30</xref>). Furthermore, different protein isoforms may regulate or interact with distinct sets of targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c32">32</xref>). For example, it was recently reported that splice variants of the Wilms&#x02019; tumor 1 gene (<italic>WT1</italic>) encode proteins that have opposite effects on tumorigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c33">33</xref>). It is possible that the h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene evolved different protein isoforms with different functions.</p><p> The functional significance of the different <italic>MMS19</italic> cDNAs cloned is supported by the identification of two major mRNAs in both human and mouse northern blots. We suggest that the larger transcript results from use of the second polyadenylation site and that this choice correlates with a different promoter. However, we were unable to precisely correlate the splice variants of <italic>MMS19</italic> detected by RT&#x02013;PCR and cloning with the transcripts detected by northern analysis. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>) detected a single transcript at &#x0223c;4 kb in a mouse northern blot. It is likely that this corresponds to our transcript of &#x0223c;3.8 kb.</p><p> The h<italic>MMS19</italic> gene maps to region 10q24 of the human genome, a region frequently rearranged in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c34">34</xref>). However, no genetic disorders obviously associated with NER or transcription defects have been mapped to this region of the human genome. The precise function(s) of Mms19 protein remains elusive. It was recently demonstrated that cells from the hereditary human disease trichothiodystrophy (TTD), belonging to genetic complementation group A (TTD-A), have reduced levels of TFIIH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c35">35</xref>). This observation led to the suggestion that the putative TTD-A protein normally determines the stability of the TFIIH complex. <italic>MMS19</italic> is an attractive candidate for such a function. As mentioned earlier, RNAP II transcription in yeast <italic>mms19</italic>&#x00394; extracts is inactivated by heat treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c5">5</xref>). This thermolabile defect can be fully complemented by purified TFIIH, but not by purified yeast Mms19 protein, suggesting that Mms19 protein indeed influences the functional integrity of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c5">5</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the previously published form of human Mms19 protein was shown to physically interact with TFIIH through its XPD and XPB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c9">9</xref>). The observation of conserved HEAT repeats in the Mms19 proteins is consistent with a role of this protein in the assembly of TFIIH-containing complexes for NER and RNAP II transcription.</p><p> The genetic complementation group TTD-A is presently represented by a single patient (TTD1BR) which complemented the phenotypes of TTD cells with defects in TFIIH subunit XPB or XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c36">36</xref>). We were unable to correct the NER defect of TTD1BR cells following microinjection of a construct containing full-length h<italic>MMS19</italic> cDNA. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a mutation in a regulatory region of <italic>MMS19</italic> in TTD-A cells. Likewise, we cannot exclude differences in the relative abundance of specific <italic>MMS19</italic> splice variants in the TTD-A disorder or in the several TTD-like syndromes previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke307c37">37</xref> and references therein). Experiments are in progress to evaluate these hypotheses.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke307f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Amino acid alignment of the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, <italic>A.thaliana</italic>, <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Mms19 proteins.
