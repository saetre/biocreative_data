A survey of 31 leukemia cell lines of the myeloid, lymphoid and erythroid lineages revealed that Hox-2.4 was expressed only in WEHI3B and the pre-B lymphoid line 70Z/3, in which no DNA rearrangement was observed. To clarify the WEHI3B alteration and normal Hox-2.4 structure, we have sequenced near full length cDNA clones from WEHI3B and 70Z/3, and the 5' portion of the normal Hox-2.4 gene. A WEHI3B cDNA clone demonstrates that an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) provirus has inserted within the first exon of the gene and generated a Hox-2.4 mRNA with a 5' sequence derived from the IAP long terminal repeat. A remarkable degree of similarity found between the amino acid sequences of Hox-2.4 and Hox-3.1, which reside on different chromosomes, supports the notion that an ancient homeobox gene cluster has been duplicated and dispersed early in vertebrate evolution.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0095-a" xlink:role="1883"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1882"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1883"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1884"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1885"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1886"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1888"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1889"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1890"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1891"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00122-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1892"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
