However, their basic oncogenic roles have not yet been established in mouse epithelial ocular cancer.

Decreased levels of these proteins may be considered as late-stage markers of the disease but also as markers of the invasive stage of this cancerous process.

Moreover, loss of epithelial polarity and architecture is one of the hallmarks of aggressive and invasive cancers. Polarity is mediated by the presence of different cell junctions and dependent on the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell membrane. Most of our understanding about the link between cell polarity and the control of proliferation comes from studies on the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes, discs large (<italic>dlg</italic>), scribble (<italic>scrib</italic>), and lethal giant larvae (<italic>lgl</italic>), and their protein products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Mutation analysis of these three genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has revealed a link between the regulation of cell polarity and the control of cell proliferation. Indeed, mutations in any one of these genes cause loss of apico-basal cell polarity, loss of the columnar monolayered organization, and hyperproliferation, forming large neoplastic cell masses in the larval brain and imaginal epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. These findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models have led to the classification of these three genes as tumor suppressor genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>].</p><p>There are four closely related homologs of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> dlg in mammals (Dlg1&#x02013;4), two distinct lgl homologs (Lgl1 and Lgl2), and only one scrib in higher vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The Dlg, Scrib, and Lgl tumor suppressor proteins are conserved between species in terms of both sequence and function. Indeed, the mammalian homologs of these proteins can rescue their respective <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants. Thus, the genetic pathways involved and their roles in the regulation of cell polarity and mammalian cell proliferation seem to be evolutionarily conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Dlg1 and Scrib are mouse orthologs of discs large and Scrib in the <italic>Drosophila</italic>, respectively. Two Lgl homologs, Lgl1 and Lgl2, have been described in the mouse. Lgl1 is ubiquitous whereas Lgl2 has a tissue-specific distribution. Therefore, Lgl1 is considered to be the mouse ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> lgl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Dlg and Scrib are both PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) proteins. PDZ proteins contain a common PDZ domain that is a protein recognition domain of approximately 80&#x02013;90 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Dlg belongs to the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) protein family. It is composed of several domains including three PDZ domains, a SH3 (Src homlogy domain 3) domain, a protein 4.1 binding motif, and a guanylate kinase (GUK) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].</p><p>Scribble is a membrane-associated scaffolding protein belonging to the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domain) protein family. It contains 16 LRRs (leucine-rich repeats) and four PDZ domains. In situ hybridization experiments on fetal mice have revealed that the mouse ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> scrib, Scrb1, is expressed in several tissues including the thymus, testis, kidney, esophagus, stomach, and eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>Lgl proteins contain several conserved functional domains including homo-oligomerization domains, a cluster of phosphorylation sites, and four WD42 repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Lgl is localized at the basolateral membrane domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. However, it is not yet known whether mammnalian Lgl interacts directly with either Scrib or Dlg. Although the functions of these proteins seem to be conserved in mammalian polarized cells (epithelial cells and neurons), it has been suggested that these proteins function cooperatively during the establishment of basolateral membrane identity and during apico-basal polarization.</p><p>Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the human proteins, hDlg, hScrib, and hLg1, play a role in human epithelial cancers and that decreased expression of the genes encoding these proteins is correlated with tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, although the roles of these three proteins have been thoroughly investigated in several cancers, a potential link among the possible dysregulation of these genes&#x02019; expressions, their corresponding protein distributions, and levels with the emergence, and the progression of ocular tumors has not been established. A transgenic mouse model has been produced, leading to the development of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. This model was generated by inserting a 1.4 kb fragment of Trp1 (tyrosinase-related protein 1) promoter fused to the large T antigen of SV40, which is a transforming sequence, into the Y chromosome. All transgenic mice were thus male. The Trp1 enzyme is expressed in melanocytes/melanoblasts and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) during development. Expression of the large T SV40 antigen was first detected at embryonic stage (E) 10.5, and the first RPE abnormalities were observed at E15.5. Several preneoplasic foci are observed at this stage in the RPE. Proliferation of tumor cells occurs in the optic nerve region and near the anterior chamber where they expand into a large mass of neoplasic tissue. The tumor consists of epithelioid cells arranged in a tubular fashion resembling human RPE adenocarcinomas. At one month of age, transgenic mice exhibit visible enlargement of the eye, leading to the complete degeneration of the eye after two months of age. Tumor cells invade the optic nerve, and the mice die at three months of age. Metastatic invasion of the brain and lymph nodes are seen in all mice, and the invasion of the spleen occurs in about 30% of these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. The Trp1/Tag mouse model appears to be a very convenient model to study the involvement of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 proteins in ocular carcinogenesis including tumoral invasion.</p><p>Here, we investigated the deregulation of their mRNA and their corresponding protein levels as well as their localization in tumor-affected eyes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR), western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. We tried to establish the contribution of each protein to tumor progression in the Trp1/Tag mouse model. We found that the three proteins were mislocalized in retinal layers during ocular carcinogenesis, which could be correlated to the early dysplastic stages of ocular tumorigenesis whereas levels of mRNA and protein levels for these proteins were reduced in tumoral eyes but only at later stages. Our study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 proteins in a mouse of ocular adenocarcinoma and the simultaneous involvement of these proteins in a same cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissues</title><p>All animals were handled in compliance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.

At P20 and P25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F-H</xref>), the neuroretina of transgenic mice was highly disorganized at the posterior pole. This disorganization of the retina was associated with retinal dysplasia and the appearance of a tumor cell mass. Dlg1 labeling in the central retina remained unchanged compared to control mice whereas we observed a lower intensity of Dlg1 immunolabeling in the OPL than in control eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). Immunolabeling in the INL appeared to be more diffuse in the transgenic mice than in control mice, possibly reflecting a more intense labeling at cortical regions than at membranous regions.

At these stages, tumor cells invading the neural retina from the transformed RPE stained positive for Dlg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1H</xref>).

In addition, Dlg1 immunolabeling appeared to be more diffuse in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1I</xref>). Dlg1 immunolabeling was also reduced in the retina due to both the loss of photoreceptor outer and inner segments and the loss of a non negligible number of whole photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1I</xref>). In the posterior pole, the RPE and choroid layers were still positive for Dlg1 as determined by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1J</xref>).

A transgenic mouse model was previously developed in which the SV40 T antigen is produced under the control of the Trp1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. This model is characterized by tumor formation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The mice develop primary ocular tumors, which start to develop from the RPE before birth and progressively invade the optic nerve and metastasize in the brain, lymph nodes, and spleen. The Trp1/Tag model is relevant in carcinogenesis, mimicking the development of the equivalent human cancer (adenocarcinomas), and allowing the study of the dissemination process. The aim of our study was to investigate the gene expressions and protein distribution and levels for mouse Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 during mouse tumorigenesis in this transgenic model of ocular cancer and to establish their potential involvement in the malignancy process. Specifically, we determined whether Dlg1, Scrib, or Lgl1 levels and distributions were altered during tumor progression.</p><p>We first found that Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 are widely distributed in adult mouse retina. More specifically, these three proteins were detected in mouse retinal neurons. Furthermore, strong staining for Dlg1 and Scrib was observed in the same layers of the retina, the OPL, and photoreceptors inner segments (IS) from postnatal developmental stages to adulthood. These results complement those of Nguyen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] who found that Dlg1 and Scrib were colocalized in certain regions of the mouse retina. These findings suggest that Dlg1 and Scrib proteins act cooperatively. Importantly, we also detected strong staining for the Lgl1 protein in these same retinal layers. Our results seem to confirm that these three proteins may act altogether cooperatively in the same retinal layers. We demonstrated that each of the three proteins studied has a distinct distribution in the neural retina. Dlg1 was particularly abundant in the INL and OPL, and Scrib protein was predominant in the GCL and INL whereas staining for Lgl1 was strongest in the ONL. These different localization patterns suggest that these three proteins as well as cooperative functions in the regions where they are colocalized might also display distinct functions. These results also suggest that each of these proteins might be associated with distinct, specific subpopulations of neurons in the adult mouse retina. Further experiments using double immunolabeling experiments may help to confirm these hypotheses. Data collected from both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals suggest that the role of the Dlg protein in clustering and trafficking receptors involved in neurotransmission have been strongly conserved in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Our observations in normal adult mouse retinas support the notion that Dlg1 may share the same functions of clustering and trafficking of synaptic proteins and may be required for normal retinal function. This is supported by previous studies showing that Dlg1 is essential for retinal response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Mouse Scrib in retinal neurons may also retain some of the properties that they display in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in synaptic organization and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Previous reports suggest that the Lgl protein may also have important functions in the retina related to its regulation of exocytosis through its interaction with target soluble N-ethylmalemide&#x02013;sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (t-SNARE), a function that seems to be conserved between different species and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Indeed, mouse Lgl1 may act to restrict protein localization at particular membrane sites by regulating a major exocytosis pathway in retinal neurons. However, additional experiments will be required to determine whether all the potential functions of these proteins are related to synaptic functions.</p><p>We also examined these proteins in the ocular tissues of Trp1/Tag mice. We showed that immunoreactive staining for Dlg1, Lgl1, and Scrib in the retinal outer plexiform layer was lower in these mice than in controls. We also found reduced levels of Scrib and Lgl1 in the external limiting membrane. Consistent with these observations, we found reduced levels of the Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 proteins in western blots at the P30 stage in Trp1/Tag mice. At this stage, tumor cells invade the optic nerve. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between decreased levels of these proteins and the invasion of adjacent tissues. These proteins display several crucial properties likely to be involved in major retinal neuronal functions such as synaptic formation, functioning, and plasticity. Thus, the effects of their downregulation should be assessed through examination of synaptic and spine structure morphology using specific immunohistochemical markers and combined with functional exploration of retinal functions based on electrophysiological analyses of Trp1/Tag mice.</p><p>Whereas the downregulation of Dlg1 and Lgl1 observed at P30 was no longer obvious at later stages in the progression of mouse ocular adenocarcinoma, the downregulation of Scrib mRNA and protein persisted. Consistent with our results obtained by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR and western blots of total RNA and protein from whole eyes of transgenic mice, we observed a greater reduction in the intensity of the Scrib specific immunostaining in ocular tumor-derived tissue than for Dlg1 or Lgl1 in the same ocular tissue. The reasons for the differences observed in the regulation of these proteins remain unclear. Previous studies suggest that the roles of Lgl1 in controlling cell proliferation and apico-basal polarity in the developing eye of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are separable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Indeed, the results exposed suggest that high levels of Lg1l are required to reduce proliferation whereas lower Lgl1 levels are needed for the maintenance of apico-basal cell polarity. Previous studies on Dlg1 mutants have also suggested that a specific threshold level of protein is required for cell polarity regulation whereas a higher level of protein is required for the control of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. However, the analysis of Scrib did not suggest that the two functions were independent. However, it should be noticed that the deletion of PDZ domains leads to only mild polarity defects and to moderate overproliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. The hypothesis proposed for explaining these facts is that Scrib acts primarily to regulate apico-basal polarity and that loss of polarity itself disrupts proliferation control. Thus, these two distinct processes seem to be coordinated and cannot be separated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Further experiments will be required to determine whether this is the case in mammals.</p><p>In addition to the reduced protein levels observed in western blots, we showed that immunostaining for Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 in the inner nuclear layer was more diffuse for Trp1/Tag retinas during tumor development than for wild-type mouse retinas. We also showed diffuse staining for Scrib in the outer nuclear layer. Dlg1, Lgl1, and Scrib proteins detected in the immunolabeled cells of the ONL and INL of control mouse retinas seemed to be normally localized close to the cytoplasmic membranes. Staining appeared to be more predominant in intracellular cytoplasmic regions in the ocular tumor mouse model. This abnormal mislocalization of Dlg1, Lgl1, and Scrib was also found in epithelial cells, the corneal epithelium, lens epithelium, and the RPE of the transgenic mouse model (data not shown). Only Dlg1 and Scrib proteins displayed an increased cytoplasmic distribution in tumor cells. Several previous studies have reported that Lgl1 protein follows this pattern of translocation in human malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. A similar process of translocation of the Dlg1 protein occurs in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Additionally, the Scrib protein also changes its cellular location during the progression of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Our results support the importance of intracellular mislocalization of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 during cancer development as suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. The mechanism(s) contributing to these changes remain(s) to be determined. However, the potential involvement of atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) in a mechanism underlying Lgl1 mislocalization could be explored in our model. Under normal conditions, aPKC is localized at the apical domain and is able to phosphorylate Lgl1. This Lgl1 phosphorylation induces its detachment from the plasma membrane due to a conformational change. The displacement of phosphorylated Lgl1 results in the inhibition of Lgl1 function at the apical cellular domain and subsequently the inhibition of aPKC function by Lgl1 at the basolateral domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. This regulation by aPKC was observed in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>] and mouse brain fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Additionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>], showed that the presence of aPKC in the cortex leads to the cytoplasmic release of Lgl1 and massive overgrowth in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In ovarian carcinomas, the aPKC &#x003be; isoform displays an apical cortical distribution and Hugl1 is released from the membrane into the cytoplasm, reminiscent of events observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. It appears likely that this mechanism also regulates Lgl1 intracellular localization in the mouse retina. This hypothesis could be tested in experiments determining whether the Lgl1 mislocalization observed in the tumor cells of our transgenic mouse model is linked to abnormal aPKC cellular localization. Similarly, given that the Dlg1/GUK complex is required for proper synaptic localization of Scrib in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>], it follows that Dlg1 mislocalization could trigger the concomitant mislocalization of Scrib. Future studies investigating this hypothesis would be of interest. The mechanism underlying Dlg1 mislocalization remains to be determined. In summary, we showed that in a mouse model of ocular adenocarcinoma, Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 are present in the retina and tumor cells, albeit displaying different patterns of intracellular distribution in comparisons with normal mouse eyes of the same age. These alterations are found in the neural retina and RPE tumor cells as early as at the P15 stage of tumor progression.</p><p>We also found a reduction in Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 mRNA and protein levels at the later P30 stage. Consistent with our results, the altered localization of Dlg1, Lgl1, and Scrib appeared to be associated with dysplasic stages whereas their downregulation could be considered as a late stage marker in the progression of ocular tumor development. The downregulation of these proteins and/or changes in their intracellular localization may contribute to the transformation and development of ocular tumors in our mouse model. The mislocalization and downregulation of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 in our model may alter their normal functions in controlling cell proliferation and cell migration. Further studies are needed to clearly elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the different expression patterns and downregulation observed in the RPE adenocarcinoma of our mouse model.</p><p>The downregulation of <italic>Dlg1</italic>, <italic>Lgl1</italic> and <italic>Scrib</italic> gene expression observed in Trp1/Tag mice was only detected at P30, a stage corresponding to the beginning of the invasion process. Our results suggest an involvement of these proteins in the dissemination and occurrence of metastases. This could be confirmed by studying the phenotypes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants. Loss of Scribble, Dlg or Lgl leads to the tumorous overgrowth of epithelial tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs. The transplantation of these mutated tissues into new <italic>Drosophila</italic> hosts appears to be sufficient to confer migratory properties to the transplanted mutated epithelial cells and result in tumor formation at distant sites in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated the role of Dlg, Lgl and Scrib in the control of cell migration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Consistent with the potential role of these proteins in the migration of tumor cells in our ocular tumor model, we also showed that E-cadherin mRNA is reduced at the P30 and three month stages in our ocular tumoral mouse model. This suggests that Scrib and Lgl1 mouse homologs may regulate cell migration by alterating E-cadherin gene expression. This is consistent with previous findings. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a <italic>Scrib</italic> mutation in Ras-transformed eye disc cells suppresses E-cadherin expression, inducing invasion of the basement membrane and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. However, the role of Scrib in controlling E-cadherin expression remains unclear. Indeed, unlike in <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic>, the reduction of Scrib levels in MDCK cells had no effect on E-cadherin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. In human melanoma, a loss of Hugl1 is associated with E-cadherin downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Although the possibility of E-cadherin regulation by Scrib or Lgl remains undetermined, our results are consistent with a previous study in transgenic mice that strongly suggests that the loss of E-cadherin directly promotes the transition of benign adenoma into carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. We also found that the loss of E-cadherin gene expression was correlated with the upregulation of <italic>N-cadherin</italic> gene expression in our mouse model. Interestingly, the switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin is a marker of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This abnormal switch leads to the loss of intercellular junctions, provoking the detachment of tumor epithelial clusters. This property is typically displayed by metastasizing cells and is a feature of aggressive tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. These findings also suggest that Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl contribute to EMT in our ocular tumor mouse model, a process relevant to human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed by additional appropriate experiments.</p><p>To conclude, this is the first study demonstrating the simultaneous deregulation of expression of the three major suppressor genes conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. We also demonstrated changes in the behavior of these proteins during ocular carcinogenesis including their mislocalization and downregulation. Both the mislocalization and downregulation of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 proteins seemed to be correlated to tumor progression, which was determined by the acquisition of new properties in cancer cells, in our mouse model of adenocarcinoma. Our results suggest that alterations of Dlg1, Scrib, and Lgl1 functions could promote tumorigenesis by first promoting hyperplasia and second resulting in a loss of cell polarity, thereby reducing cell adhesion and facilitating aggressive overgrowth and invasive behavior. Studies of biopsies and samples from human ocular adenocarcinomas are now required to confirm the relevance of our findings. Nevertheless, our findings together with previous studies provide increasing evidence that Dlg, Scrib, and Lgl <italic>Drosophil</italic>a homologs are involved in pathways that play a major role in cancer development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the RETINA-France Association and by a doctoral fellowship from the Ministry of Research of France to V&#x000e9;ronique Vieira.
