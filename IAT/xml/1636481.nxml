Although the other domains of DNA gyrase are better understood, the mechanism of DNA binding by the C-terminal domain of the DNA gyrase A subunit (GyrA-CTD) is less clear. Here, we investigated the DNA-binding sites in the GyrA-CTD of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> gyrase through site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that Y577, R691 and R745 are among the key DNA-binding residues in <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD, and that the third blade of the GyrA-CTD is the main DNA-binding region in <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase. The substitutions of Y577A, D669A, R691A, R745A and G729W led to the loss of supercoiling and relaxation activities, although they had a little effect on the drug-dependent DNA cleavage and decatenation activities, and had no effect on the ATPase activity. Taken together, these results showed that the GyrA-CTD is essential to DNA gyrase of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>, and promote the idea that the <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD is a new potential target for drug design. It is the first time that the DNA-binding sites in GyrA-CTD have been identified.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA gyrase (EC 5.99.1.3) is a predominantly prokaryotic enzyme which has enzymatic properties distinct from other type II topoisomerases, and has diverged significantly during evolution. It is an A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> tetramer that catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, catenation and decatenation of DNA rings, and knotting and unknotting of duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). It is also the only topoisomerase capable of introducing negative supercoiling into closed-circular DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). As an essential enzyme, DNA gyrase is involved in crucial cellular processes such as replication, transcription and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), and is the target of the quinolone drugs and aminocoumarin antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). These discoveries about gyrase have led to the expansion of interest in its basic and clinical research.</p><p>The reaction mechanism of DNA gyrase is relatively well understood and the crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of GyrB (GyrB-NTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the N- and C-terminal domains of GyrA (GyrA-NTD and GyrA-CTD) have alreadt been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The functions of different domains of the enzyme have also been identified. It is known that the GyrB-NTD harbors the ATPase activity and binds to coumarins; the C-terminal domain of GyrB (GyrB-CTD) is the domain that interacts with GyrA and forms a complex capable of catalyzing DNA breakage and reunion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). GyrA-NTD is the catalytic center of gyrase, which harbors the DNA cleavage&#x02013;reunion activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), and GyrA-CTD is involved in binding and wrapping the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Furthermore, the active sites for the ATPase activity, the coumarin-binding site in GyrB-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and the sites of interaction of the quinolones with GyrA and GyrB-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), have also been identified. However, the active sites of DNA-binding in GyrA-CTD and the mechanisms of DNA binding are largely unknown.</p><p>It is known that GyrA-CTD is a non-specific DNA-binding protein and has a unique role in DNA-wrapping and T-segment presentation by gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The GyrA-CTD is catalytically inactive on its own, but can complement the supercoiling activity of GyrA-NTD upon mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). GyrA-CTD has been shown to bind DNA independently and constrain positive supercoils, and is necessary for gyrase-mediated supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). DNA wraps around gyrase in a manner dependent upon the presence of the GyrA-CTD, producing superhelicity, and that wrapping plays a crucial role in controlling the directionality of supercoil induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Removal of the C-terminal domain abolishes the wrapping of DNA around gyrase, eliminates the introduction of supercoiling and converts gyrase into a conventional topoisomerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). On the contrary, the addition of GyrA-CTD results in restoration of the capacity to introduce negative supercoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The binding of gyrase to DNA can be shownto involve the positive wrapping of DNA, and GyrA-CTD is also capable of bending DNA by &#x02265;180&#x000b0; over a 40 bp region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The GyrA-CTD was predicted previously to have a six-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure and it was believed that the opposite side of the propeller is involved in interaction with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). However, the first published structure of GyrA-CTD derived from the spirochete <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> reveals an intriguing new fold designated a &#x003b2;-pinwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Recently, the X-ray structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GyrA-CTD was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD adopts a circular-shaped &#x003b2;-pinwheel fold, similar to the <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD; however, the <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD is flat, whereas the <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD is a spiral.</p><p>How does GyrA-CTD affect supercoiling activity in the catalytic cycle? Which residues are involved in interacting with DNA in the bending proposed to occur with GyrA-CTD? Are there other roles for the GyrA-CTD in the activities of gyrase? We have investigated the active DNA-binding sites in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD using site-directed mutagenesis, in an attempt to understand the role of GyrA-CTD in the function of gyrase. The results showed that the mutations of Y577A, D669A, R691A, R745A and G729W led to loss of supercoiling, relaxation activities, but had a little effect on drug cleavage and decatenation activities and had no effect on ATPase activity, and showed that the GyrA-CTD is essential to DNA gyrase of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>.

However, the number of conserved residues chosen in this step is large because gyrase itself is rather conserved in this region. Therefore, we selected the residues that are likely to participate in DNA binding and DNA bending that are on the surface of the structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD and are polar (especially positively charged) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Based on these criteria, 10 residues were chosen for further study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Residue R581 was not considered as it is absent from the three-dimensional structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD. Based on the structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD, the ten conserved residues can be broadly divided into two highly conserved groups, according to their locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>): the first one is mostly located in the first blade, including E506, K519, H556 and Y574, and the other is mostly located at the third blade, including D647, D660, R681 and R735. Y569 is located at the second blade and K534 is located at the sixth blade. Considering that the first blade of GyrA-CTD is connecting and interacting with GyrA-NTD, and the conserved residues of the third blade could potentially contribute to a DNA-binding and DNA-bending site in GyrA/ParC/RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), our studies are focused on the four conserved residues in the second conserved domain, as they are all located in loops likely to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In the first conserved domain, only the E506 was chosen for mutation as a comparison. Ala was introduced into full-length GyrA by site-directed mutagenesis. E514A, Y577A, D669A, R691A and R745A in <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD were constructed successfully and verified by sequencing. G729W was introduced accidentally in the cloning process and used as a comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of the GyrA protein and GyrB protein</title><p>The expression levels of the mutated GyrA proteins were similar to that of the wild-type GyrA protein (data not shown). All the GyrA proteins and GyrB protein were in the soluble fraction of the cell extract and were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. These proteins were assessed for purity by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and were kept in storing buffer at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C or &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots.</p></sec><sec><title>Substitutions of Y577A, D669A, R691A and R745A lead to total loss of DNA-binding activity of GyrA in the absence of GyrB</title><p>The GyrA subunit is known to have DNA-binding activity in the absence of GyrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Six GyrA mutants were tested for DNA binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, GyrA with the substitutions G729W and E514A could bind DNA, whereas Y577A, D669A, R691A and R745A did not have such activity. Both the wild-type and the mutant G729W had about the same binding activity, and the binding activity of E514A was slightly less than that of the wild-type. These results suggest that residues Y577, D669, R691 and R745 may participate in DNA binding. Conversely, the E514 and G729 may not be involved in DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants Y577A, D669A, R691A and R745A also lose DNA-binding activity in the presence of GyrB</title><p>Gyrase is composed of GyrA and GyrB subunits; only when GyrA is combined with GyrB the enzyme is able to carry out supercoiling and relaxation reactions. DNA binding of the GyrA mutants in combination with GyrB was tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Y577A, R691A and R745A still had no DNA-binding activity, but E514A and G729W had. The results confirmed that residues Y577, R691 and R745 not only participate in DNA binding, but also have a key role in this process; whereas residues E514 and G729 are not key DNA-binding residues. D669A, in the presence of GyrB, had weak DNA-binding activity, although alone it had no DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that D669 may have some role in DNA binding, although it is not vital. These results imply that, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), GyrB cooperates with GyrA in DNA binding. We found that the DNA-binding activity of wild-type <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA is nearly equal to that of the holoenzyme (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants Y577A, D669A, R691A, G729W and R745A have no supercoiling activity in the presence of GyrB</title><p>The supercoiling activity of the GyrA mutants was tested in the presence of GyrB. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, no mutants showed supercoiling activities, except for E514A. The latter had supercoiling activity but lower than that of the wild-type, reflecting the results of the DNA-binding assays. Interestingly, in the presence of GyrB, G729W could bind DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but had no supercoiling activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants Y577A, D669A, R691A and R745A, in the presence of GyrB, show no relaxation activity</title><p>In the presence of GyrB, all mutants showed nearly no relaxation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with the exception of E514A and G729W, but the relaxation activity of E514A was less than that of the wild-type and that of G729W was weak. The results show that residues Y577, D669, R691 and R745 are also involved in the process of relaxing supercoiled DNA, whereas E514 had some role in relaxing DNA. G729W retains DNA-binding activity, but shows very little relaxation activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants D669A, R691A and R745A show less cleavage activity than the wild type in the presence of GyrB</title><p>The drug dependent DNA cleavage activity of the GyrA mutants was tested by incubating the GyrA mutants with norfloxacin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the drug cleavage activity of E514A was similar to the wild-type A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, those of Y577A and G729A were nearly similar to that of the wild-type, and those of D669A, R691A and R745A are less than that of the wild-type. In the presence of GyrB, mutants D669A, R691A and R745A could still cleave DNA completely by increasing reaction time. This suggests that the GyrA-CTD is less important for drug-dependent cleavage activity.</p></sec><sec><title>All mutants except for E514A, in the presence of GyrB, showed less decatenation activity than the wild type</title><p>The decatenation activity of the GyrA mutants was tested in the presence of GyrB. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, all mutants remained decatenation activity when the gyrase concentrations was 1 &#x003bc;M or 0.1 &#x003bc;M. However, lowering gyrase concentration to 0.01 &#x003bc;M, mutants of D669A, R691A, G729A and R745A showed no decatenation activity, whereas the wild-type enzyme and E514A still had (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The data suggests some facts that decatenation activity of E514A is similar to that of the wild-type, TB gyrase is a strong decatenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and GyrA-CTD is less important for decatenation reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Six mutants have ATPase activity</title><p>It is known that GyrB alone or the gyrase holoenzyme (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>) have ATPase activity, and that the activity of A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> can be stimulated greatly by adding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Such DNA-dependent ATPase activity is likely to involve DNA wrapping. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) showed that all six mutants have ATPase activity, nearly equal to that of the wild-type A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, even in the existence of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutants Y577A, R691A and R745A lose the capability of interaction with DNA in the absence or presence of GyrB</title><p>Although the DNA-binding activity of the six mutants was measured by gel-retardation assay, it was not clear whether the mutants were impaired just in wrapping or whether they are unable to bind DNA at all. SPR technology, a sensitive means to measure the molecular interactions, was employed to study interaction between DNA and the GyrA mutants either in the absence or presence of GyrB. The SPR 3000 system contains a dual-channel measuring cell. Both reference and sample channels have the same streptavidin-modified sensor chip, but the chip in the sample channel was modified with a 290 bp dsDNA through streptavidin&#x02013;biotin interaction. GyrA samples were repeatedly injected in the flow-through carrying buffer. Response signal (response unit, RU) represents the binding of GyrA proteins to the bound DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, no response was observed for the mutants Y577A, D691A and R745A with or without GyrB, indicating that these mutants have completely lost the capability of DNA binding. D669A did not bind DNA in the absence of GyrB, but had a weak response signal when GyrB was present, which agrees with the results of the gel-retardation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Both E514A and G729W could interact with DNA in the absence or presence of GyrB with significantly lowered binding signal, comparing with the wild-type GyrA or A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>. The sensorgram shows that the binding mode of the G729W had changed from rapid to slow association and dissociation kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As far as we know, gyrase is essential in all bacteria and has not been found in humans or more generally in eukaryotes, except recently in plant organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). So gyrase is a good therapeutic target and effective antibiotics have been developed. However, increasing drug resistance is now a serious problem and new agents against such resistance are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). To date, most drugs act on GyrA-NTD and GyrB-NTD, and quinolones probably act on GyrB-CTD as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>); mutations in these domains are found in clinical isolates of different types of bacteria leading to high resistance to existing antibiotics, including <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>. There are huge number of people with tuberculosis in the world and it is urgent to get more effective drugs for treating this disease.</p><p>Since the 3D structure of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA is not yet available, the homologous structures of GyrA-CTD from both <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> were taken as references in this study. There is a positively charged region around the surface of the first, fourth, fifth and sixth blades in the structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD, apparent from the electrostatic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), and a positively charged strip also extending along the midriff of the structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). So their midriff is the obvious locus for interaction with a contiguous stretch of duplex DNA, and the arginines and lysines on the long loops could contact DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD can bind and bend DNA over four of its six blades, and <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD can bind DNA containing complementary superhelicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, there are two highly conserved regions in GyrA-CTD based on homology mapping and the structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD. The substitutions of D669A, R691A, R745A in the second conserved region caused loss of DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), so the third blade of GyrA-CTD should be the main DNA-binding domain, which is consistent with the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Except for these sites, other sites in other blades such as Y577, are also involved in DNA binding. According to the structure of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD, it can be expected that R691 and R745 are the DNA-binding sites as they are positively charged, lying on the loop and in the midriff. However, Y577 and D669 are not lying in the midriff region but still participate in DNA binding. At the same time, previous work showed that there are two main DNA-binding domains in DNA gyrase. The first is the region of the catalytic center, lying in the GyrA-NTD, and the other is in the GyrA-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, GyrA-NTD alone has no DNA-binding activity, but GyrA-CTD alone can still bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Our data show that mutations of some residues in GyrA-CTD can lead to complete loss of the DNA-binding activity of the GyrA subunit or the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). There must be some relation between the two main DNA-binding domains, and maybe it is related to the substrate preference of gyrase. Furthermore, the results of gel-retardation assays were confirmed by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). It was also confirmed that mutants of D669A, R691A, R745A can not bind DNA at all by SPR. Thus, it seems that the third blade is the main DNA-binding region in the GyrA-CTD, and the GyrA-CTD is the main DNA-binding domain in <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> gyrase. These results are helpful to explain the DNA-binding mechanism of gyrase.</p><p>GyrA-CTD was speculated to be involved in stabilizing the DNA&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Previous work proved that the removal of GyrA-CTD from <italic>E.coli</italic> gyrase results in loss of the ability to supercoil DNA, a gain of the ability to relax DNA, and a 30-fold increase in decatenation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). This suggests that GyrA-CTD is required for supercoiling and has no role in relaxation and decatenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). However, in our experiments, mutations of the proposed DNA-binding sites in GyrA-CTD not only caused loss of supercoiling activity, but also led to the loss of relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This suggested that, in <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic>, GyrA-CTD has also a role in the process of relaxing supercoiled DNA. But mutations of the proposed DNA-binding sites in GyrA-CTD only have little effect on drug-dependent cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and decatenation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which indicates that GyrA-CTD is less important to these activities. This is consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). It is known that the supercoiling DNA activities of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis BCG</italic> is also much less than that of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> gyrase exhibits a stronger decatenase activity than <italic>E.coli</italic> gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>)<italic>.</italic> What is the cause of the difference? The protein sequences of GyrA-CTD are not as highly conserved as those of GyrA-NTD, and the percent sequence similarities of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD compared with <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD and <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD only are 25.9 and 37.8%, respectively. The &#x003b2;-pinwheel of <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD is flat, whereas that of <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD is a spiral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrA-CTD wraps DNA inducing substantial positive superhelicity, whereas <italic>B.burgdorferi</italic> GyrA-CTD introduces a more modest positive superhelicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In other words, the diversity of GyrA-CTD may cause the differences in structure and function. It also indicates that the GyrA-CTD is essential to enzyme activities of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase and the precise catalytic mechanism of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> gyrase may be different from that of other bacterial gyrases. It is very interesting to find that, although G729W still kept high-DNA-binding activity, its supercoiling activity was almost lost completely and its relaxation activity was much weak. From the association and dissociation responses in SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), G729W has a different kinetic performance from other mutants: G729W showed slowed association and dissociation modes in the absence or presence of GyrB, whereas the other two (the wild type and E514A) showed fast association and dissociation process. This suggests that binding DNA by G729W largely reduces enzyme activities.</p><p>It has been shown that GyrB has no DNA-binding activity on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), and consistent results were seen in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, a double mutation of S759R and R760C in the C-terminal region of <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrB significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), and the deletion of additional 165 residues in <italic>E.coli</italic> GyrB also caused the almost complete loss of DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Thus GyrB also has an important role in binding DNA by gyrase, despite its incapability of binding DNA by itself in gel-retardation assays. GyrB should have effects on the conformation of active sites of GyrA by interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), for GyrA only when combined with GyrB, has enzyme activities. In our study, the D669A mutant of GyrA combined with GyrB turned out to have weak DNA-binding activity, compared with the D669A mutant alone, which had no DNA-binding activity at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). However, the mutants of Y577A, R691A and R745A can not interact with DNA at all, even combined with GyrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Despite this, GyrB has the same effect on the constants, although it is much weaker: the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> holoenzyme of WT, E514A and G729W has a lower association constant and a higher dissociation constant than those alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In other words, GyrB retards the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> holoenzyme to bind DNA, and accelerates the bound DNA to deviate from A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, which may have an important role in the catalytic mechanism of gyrase.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the mutations have no obvious effect on the ATPase activity. Either in the presence or absence of DNA, all mutations exhibited ATPase activities similar to that of the wild-type A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, implying that the DNA-dependent ATPase is not dependent on DNA binding by the GyrA-CTD. Data reveal the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity is &#x0223c;2-fold as high as the activity without stimulating by DNA. This increase is much lower than that observed with <italic>E.coli</italic> gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). The reason remains unknown.</p><p>GyrA-CTD is conserved among gyrases and exhibits significant sequence diversity from the other type II topoisomerases. Eukaryotic topo IIs possess a CTD, but it appears to be completely different in structure and function from that of the prokaryotic CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Substitutions in GyrA-CTD can lead to the loss of DNA-binding activity, supercoiling activity and relaxation activities of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase, which stop crucial cellular processes in cells and lead to cell death. It shows that the GyrA-CTD is essential to <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> gyrase, and that drugs could be devised more specifically to act on <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD more selectively, based on the divergence of different bacterial GyrA-CTD. Thus, <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> GyrA-CTD is a potential new target for drug design. It also is the first time that the DNA-binding sites in GyrA-CTD have been identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Hiroshi Hiasa, V. Nagaraja and James M.
