AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers regulate genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics or fatty acids and various genes important for growth and differentiation. In this report several potent methods, such as the limited protease digestion, gel shift and gel shift clipping assays, allowed the investigation of ligand-stabilized conformations of AhR monomers in comparison to that of AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers. Interestingly, the ligand sensitivity of monomeric AhR was found to be very low at 25 nM, whereas DNA-dependent methods consistently provided EC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.12 and 0.6 nM for AhR in a heterodimeric complex, i.e. an approximate 100-fold higher ligand sensitivity. This indicates that complex formation of AhR with Arnt on DNA is an important and critical step in transforming AhR into a high affinity receptor for TCDD. A comparison of wild-type AhR with different C-terminal receptor truncations suggests that the PAS-B subregion of its PAS domain is of central importance for stabilization of a functional, i.e. ligand-sensitive, AhR<bold>&#x02013;</bold>Arnt conformation, whereas the PAS-A subregion appears to be critical for dimerization of AhR and Arnt. In conclusion, the results of this study provide important information on the ligand sensitivity of AhR and AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimer conformations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates a broad range of toxic and biochemical responses to the ubiquitous environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD). These responses include, but are not limited to, immunosuppression, tumor promotion, teratogenicity and cachexia. Animals lacking AhR die prematurely and display a number of fibrotic responses and changes in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c1">1</xref>). The AhR is expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c2">2</xref>). Prior to ligand binding, AhR is located in the cytoplasm and is associated with two 90 kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) molecules. After ligand binding, AhR dissociates from this complex, translocates into the nucleus and subsequently dimerizes with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c3">3</xref>). Although Arnt was designated as a translocator, it now appears that Arnt is not involved in transport of AhR into the nucleus but rather forms a complex with ligand-bound AhR that has already gained access to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c4">4</xref>). The ligand-bound heterodimeric AhR&#x02013;Arnt complex acts as a transcription factor complex and binds to specific xenobiotic response elements (XREs), with the core sequence TNGCGTG, which are located in the promoters of dioxin responsive genes, i.e. DNA-complexed AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers can be considered as the molecular switches for dioxin signaling. Although many genes that are inducible by TCDD contain XREs in their promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c5">5</xref>), the mechanism of transcriptional activation by the AhR&#x02013;Arnt&#x02013;TCDD complex has been studied primarily on the paradigm of the responsive gene CYP1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c6">6</xref>). Other TCDD-inducible genes have been found to be involved in fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c7">7</xref>), cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c8">8</xref>) and the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c5">5</xref>).</p><p>AhR and Arnt are members of the PAS (<underline>P</underline>er&#x02013;<underline>A</underline>rnt&#x02013;<underline>S</underline>im) domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c9">9</xref>) that contains proteins of similar modular structure, such as mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> regulatory proteins period (Per) and single-minded (Sim). PAS domain family members have a centrally located PAS domain containing two 51 amino acid imperfect repeats (PAS-A and PAS-B) separated by a variable spacer region, which at least for AhR is important for ligand and hsp90 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c10">10</xref>). Moreover, they also contain a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) DNA-binding domain close to their N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c11">11</xref>), which is also critical for dimerization. Finally, PAS family members contain one or more transactivation domains in their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c3">3</xref>). Arnt appears to be the common heterodimerization partner for all PAS domain family members, whereas AhR is presently the only family member that has a known ligand. However, the structural similarity of the PAS domain family members suggests that ligands for the presently known orphan members could exist.</p><p>Although ligand binding takes place in the cytoplasm, AhR acts as a nuclear receptor for TCDD, which is comparable to the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the steroid, retinoic acid, 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and thyroid hormone receptors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c12">12</xref>). This analogy suggests that AhR also undergoes a conformational change through ligand binding, as X-ray crystallography has shown for retinoid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c13">13</xref>). Biochemical methods, such as the limited protease digestion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c14">14</xref>), in which a ligand-bound nuclear receptor is incubated with an endoprotease such as trypsin, are able to document conformational changes in nuclear receptors. It is assumed that due to a conformational change in the receptor, trypsin cutting sites lose their accessibility and therefore the resulting receptor fragments can be interpreted as representatives of different ligand-induced receptor conformations. Recently, a second method was reported, referred to as the gel shift clipping assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c16">16</xref>), in which the ligand-dependent gel shift assay, as a well-established detection method for protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, was combined with the limited protease digestion assay. This novel method allows the visualization of nuclear receptor heterodimer conformations.</p><p>In this study, DNA-independent and DNA-dependent limited protease digestion, gel shift and gel shift clipping assays were used for the analysis of conformational changes in the AhR in solution or as a DNA-complexed heterodimer with Arnt. Moreover, C-terminally truncated AhR proteins have defined the subdomains of the AhR that are essential to undergo a ligand-dependent conformational change. Characterization of the ligand sensitivity of the AhR in the context of AhR&#x02013;Arnt&#x02013;XRE conformations confirms and extends previous studies on functional AhR domains and is essential to understand the molecular switch of nuclear dioxin signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated wild-type and truncated AhR protein</title><p>The cDNAs for mouse AhR (AhR<sub>1&#x02013;805</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c17">17</xref>) and Arnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c18">18</xref>) were subcloned into the vector pRc&#x0002f;CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c19">19</xref>).

In the presence of graded concentrations of TCDD an AhR fragment of a molecular mass of ~35 kDa was found to be most prominent and was interpreted as being representative of the ligand-induced AhR conformation (c<sub>LPD</sub>). TCDD was found to stabilize the c<sub>LPD</sub> of monomeric AhR with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) value of 25 nM. In this reference experimental series 14&#x00025; of the AhR input was stabilized in c<sub>LPD</sub>, which, when compared with the solvent control, represents a ligand inducibility factor of approximately 8.</p><p>The ligand sensitivity of the AhR was then tested within a heterodimeric complex with Arnt. Gel shift assays were performed for this purpose with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers on the mouse CYP1A1 XRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c20">20</xref>). A specific AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimer complex was obtained on this XRE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f2">2</xref>), whereas AhR or Arnt homodimer formation was not observed (data not shown). Graded concentrations of TCDD increased the amount of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex by a factor of approximately 5 and provided an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.4 nM. This suggested that the ligand sensitivity of the AhR is increased more than 60-fold through complex formation with Arnt and DNA.</p><p>In order to challenge the observation of an increased ligand sensitivity through complex formation on DNA, limited protease digestion assays were performed with DNA-complexed AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers and graded concentrations of TCDD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f3">3</xref>). In these DNA-dependent assays the same 35 kDa AhR fragment, c<sub>LPD</sub>, was observed as in the DNA-independent assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f1">1</xref>), but in the DNA-dependent assay lower amounts of intermediary AhR fragments were obtained. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the AhR conformation, c<sub>LPD</sub>, for TCDD (EC<sub>50</sub> value 0.12 nM) was found to be 200-fold higher than that of monomeric AhR (EC<sub>50</sub> value 25 nM; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f1">1</xref>). In parallel, at saturating concentrations of TCDD the percentage of AhR molecules that were stabilized in c<sub>LPD</sub> was increased to 27&#x00025; of AhR input.</p><p>In order to merge the results from the DNA-independent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f1">1</xref>) and the DNA-dependent limited protease digestion assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f3">3</xref>) with those from the gel shift assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f2">2</xref>), a novel method, referred to as the gel shift clipping assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c16">16</xref>), was applied to AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f4">4</xref>A). In this assay AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers were formed in the presence of a saturating concentration of TCDD (10 nM) on the mouse CYP1A1 XRE, as in the gel shift assays, and then trypsin was added, as in the limited protease digestion assay. Two protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were obtained that were interpreted as the representatives of two different AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimer conformations (c1<sub>GSC</sub> and c2<sub>GSC</sub>). The amounts of both conformations decreased with increasing incubation time, but only c1<sub>GSC</sub> appeared to be stabilized in a ligand-dependent fashion, whereas c2<sub>GSC</sub> showed no significant ligand sensitivity. The quantification of c1<sub>GSC</sub> indicated that even after a 60 min incubation with trypsin a reasonable amount of AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers (~30&#x00025; of input) remained resistant. However, a 10 min incubation time appeared to show the best signal to noise ratio and was therefore taken as standard for the following assays. Gel shift clipping assays were then performed with graded concentrations of TCDD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f4">4</xref>B). The amount of stabilized AhR&#x02013;Arnt conformation c1<sub>GSC</sub> was found to be enhanced with increasing TCDD concentration and provided an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.6 nM, i.e. a value that appeared to be similar to those observed in other DNA-dependent assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f3">3</xref>).</p><p>A more detailed investigation of AhR&#x02013;Arnt conformations utilized the C-terminally truncated AhR proteins AhR<sub>1&#x02013;491</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;418</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;410</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;320</sub> and AhR<sub>1&#x02013;167</sub>. These truncated proteins were produced by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation of AhR cDNA digested with the restriction enzymes <italic>Not</italic>I, <italic>Bam</italic>HI, <italic>Bgl</italic>II, <italic>Pst</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI, respectively. Gel shift and gel shift clipping assays were performed with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers, which were formed by wild-type AhR (AhR<sub>1&#x02013;805</sub>) protein or the indicated truncated AhR proteins and wild-type Arnt proteins on the mouse CYP1A1 XRE in the presence of a saturating concentration of TCDD (10 nM) or solvent (DMSO) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd372f5">5</xref>). The proteins AhR<sub>1&#x02013;491</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;418</sub> and AhR<sub>1&#x02013;410</sub> (C-terminal truncations of the PAS domain) were found to react similarly to wild-type AhR, as they showed comparable ligand-dependent effects in the gel shift and gel shift clipping assays. The respective non-digested heterodimeric complexes migrated faster than wild-type AhR&#x02013;Arnt complexes due to a lower molecular mass of the truncated proteins, but the AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimer conformations c1<sub>GSC</sub> and c2<sub>GSC</sub> of AhR<sub>1&#x02013;805</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;491</sub>, AhR<sub>1&#x02013;418</sub> and AhR<sub>1&#x02013;410</sub> appeared to be identical. Interestingly, the AhR protein AhR<sub>1&#x02013;320</sub> demonstrated heterodimer formation with Arnt (even stronger than wild-type AhR) and stabilized the conformation c2<sub>GSC</sub> (but not c1<sub>GSC</sub>); however, this C-terminal truncation of the PAS-B domain had completely lost ligand sensitivity. Finally, the AhR protein AhR<sub>1&#x02013;167</sub> (C-terminal truncation of the bHLH domain) appeared to have additionally lost the ability to form heterodimers with Arnt.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The AhR is the nuclear receptor for TCDD and most probably the only target of the toxic xenobiotic compound within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c3">3</xref>). AhR knockout mice have been demonstrated to be resistant to TCDD effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c22">22</xref>), which suggests that TCDD toxicity largely depends on the ligand&#x02013;receptor interaction of TCDD and AhR, thus making studies directed towards defining the ligand sensitivity of the AhR very important. In this study several potent methods, such as limited protease digestion and the gel shift and gel shift clipping assays, have been used to describe the response of AhR monomers and of AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers to TCDD. The assays differ in their perspectives on ligand-induced AhR conformations. The DNA-independent limited protease digestion assay studies monomeric AhR in solution, whereas the gel shift and the gel shift clipping assays analyse DNA-bound AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers. Moreover, in this study limited protease digestion was also performed with DNA-bound AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers, i.e. in an Arnt- and DNA-dependent fashion.</p><p>The ligand sensitivity of monomeric AhR was found to be very low at 25 nM, whereas the three DNA-dependent methods consistently provided EC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.12 and 0.6 nM, i.e. an ~100-fold higher ligand sensitivity of AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers. This is in good agreement with earlier results where apparent dissociation constants for the TCDD&#x02013;AhR interaction were determined by competition assays and photoaffinity labeling to be 1&#x02013;2 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c23">23</xref>). It has to be noted that the assays used in this study do not measure ligand binding <italic>per se</italic>, as known from traditional ligand binding assays that use radiolabeled ligand, but detect the effect of the ligand on stabilization of AhR conformations and heterodimeric AhR&#x02013;Arnt complexes. Moreover, a comparable observation was made for HIF-1&#x003b1;&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers, where HIF-1&#x003b1; was found to be stabilized through heterodimerization with Arnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Approximately 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated receptors within AhR&#x02013;Arnt complexes or other heterodimeric nuclear receptor complexes were shown to be able to bind to DNA, i.e.&#x000a0;to participate in the gel shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c25">25</xref>). Up to 80&#x00025; of this heterodimer pool, i.e. more than 32&#x00025; of the AhR input, has been shown to bind ligand by producing a protease-resistant AhR&#x02013;Arnt&#x02013;XRE complex in the gel shift clipping assay. In contrast, in DNA-independent limited protease digestion assays only ~15&#x00025; of the AhR input was protease resistant, which increased in DNA-dependent limited protease digestion assays to 30&#x00025; and fits well with the results from the gel shift clipping experiment. This indicates that interaction with TCDD not only increases the ligand sensitivity of the AhR, but also the proportion of AhR molecules that respond to ligand, and suggests that complex formation with Arnt on DNA is an important and critical step in transforming the AhR to a high affinity receptor for TCDD. Therefore, for a more accurate analysis of the binding affinity of a AhR agonist for the receptor, the respective assays should preferably be performed with DNA-complexed AhR. Due to the fact that Arnt is located in the nucleus, the commitment of AhR as a high affinity receptor takes places after translocation into the nucleus. However, a role of TCDD in conformational changes in the AhR has recently been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c27">27</xref>).</p><p>TCDD exposure leads to a variety of outcomes at different levels: thymus atrophy and immunosuppression are effects common in all animal species analyzed so far and require only low doses, whereas other effects become apparent only at higher doses. Risks assessment therefore needs to take into account the pharmacological characteristics of the AhR ligand and the endogenous conditions, like AhR abundance and its tissue distribution. The results of this study suggest that TCDD will have effects on gene activation only at concentrations that are sufficient to activate the AhR within a AhR&#x02013;Arnt&#x02013;DNA complex. In the vitamin D endocrine system the same set of assays provided a value (~0.1 nM) for the ligand sensitivity of VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers (the molecular switches of 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> signaling) which fits with the critical concentration that was effective in activating primary 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c16">16</xref>). For an AhR signaling system this would mean that at a concentration of 0.1 nM or higher, primary TCDD responsive genes, such as CYP1A1, will be activated, which in part results in toxic effects. This conclusion correlates with previous reports on the activation of CYP1A1 gene activity by TCDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c6">6</xref>). However, it is obvious that the xenobiotic compound TCDD is not the physiological ligand of AhR. Such a ligand remains elusive, although a number of possible candidates, such as dietary components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c28">28</xref>), tryptophan derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c29">29</xref>) and products of heme metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c30">30</xref>), have been suggested. These and other putative AhR agonists can be tested in the limited protease digestion and gel shift clipping assays for their potential in stabilizing AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimers in the same way as TCDD has been analyzed in this study. The <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of AhR ligands will provide fast and accurate information, both on the mechanism of action and on the critical concentration of various xenobiotic compounds.</p><p>The results of the comparison of wild-type AhR with different C-terminal receptor truncations suggest that the PAS-B subregion of the PAS domain is of central importance for stabilization of a functional, i.e. ligand-sensitive, AhR&#x02013;Arnt conformation, whereas the PAS-A subregion appears to be critical for dimerization of AhR and Arnt. The latter finding correlates with a previous report on the subdomains of the AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd372c31">31</xref>) and, in general, demonstrates the potency of the gel shift clipping assay to determine the functionality of ligand-induced nuclear receptor complexes.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study have provided important information on the ligand sensitivity of AhR and AhR&#x02013;Arnt heterodimer conformations. One application of this more detailed understanding of the molecular switches of dioxin signaling could be to establish a fast <italic>in vitro</italic> screening system for putative toxic effects of xenobiotic and natural compounds.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd372f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Ligand-dependent stabilization of AhR conformations in solution.
