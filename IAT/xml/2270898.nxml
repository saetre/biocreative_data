The pro-oncogenic activity is attributed to its well characterized anti-apoptotic function while the anti-oncogenic function has been attributed to its inhibition of cellular proliferation. Recent studies demonstrate that p27 may mediate the effects of Bcl-2 on cellular proliferation. We hypothesized that p27 may suppress tumor formation by Bcl-2 family members. To test this hypothesis, cell cycle inhibition and lymphoma development were examined in Lck-Bcl-2 and Lck-Bax38/1 transgenic mice deficient in p27. Strikingly, p27 deficiency synergistically cooperates with Bcl-2 to increase T cell hyperplasia and development of spontaneous T cell lymphomas. Within 1 year, &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of these mice had developed thymic T cell lymphomas. This high penetrance contrasts with a one year incidence of &#x0003c;5&#x00025; of thymic lymphoma in Lck-Bcl-2 or p27 &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice alone. In contrast, p27 deficiency had no effect on tumor formation in Lck-Bax38/1 transgenic mice, another model of T cell lymphoma. Histologically the lymphomas in p27 &#x02212;/&#x02212; Lck-Bcl-2 mice are lymphoblastic and frequently involve multiple organs suggesting an aggressive phenotype. Interestingly, in mature splenic T cells, Bcl-2 largely retains its anti-proliferative function even in the absence of p27. T cells from p27 &#x02212;/&#x02212; Lck-Bcl-2 mice show delayed kinetics of CDK2 Thr-160 phosphorylation. This delay is associated with a delay in the up regulation of both Cyclin D2 and D3. These data demonstrate a complex relationship between the Bcl-2 family, cellular proliferation, and oncogenesis and demonstrate that p27 up-regulation is not singularly important in the proliferative delay observed in T cells expressing Bcl-2 family members. Nonetheless, the results indicate that p27 is a critical tumor suppressor in the context of Bcl-2 expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Bcl-2 oncogene was discovered at the t(14;18) translocation breakpoint in human B cell follicular lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Cleary1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Tsujimoto1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-2 is a member of a large family of proteins that are critical regulators of cell death.

Bcl-2 predominantly resides at the outer mitochondrial membrane and is able to block a number of mitochondrial changes that occur with apoptosis such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m), release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome C and Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF), and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Kuwana1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Breckenridge1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-2 also functions by preventing the formation of a complex that involves pro-apoptotic family members such as Bak and Bax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Harris1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to its anti-apoptotic function, Bcl-2 is thought to enhance oncogenesis by prolonging the survival of cells with pre-tumorigenic lesions and therefore increase the likelihood of malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-MacCarthyMorrogh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Paradoxically, Bcl-2 expression is not always correlated with accelerated oncogenesis and a poor clinical outcome.

Moreover, we recently demonstrated that Bcl-2 suppressed lymphoma formation and chromosomal instability in transgenic mice expressing Bax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Luke1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-vandeWetering1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In many of these studies, the tumor-suppressive effect of Bcl-2 correlated with decreased cellular proliferation.</p><p>A variety of studies have shown Bcl-2 has a significant anti-proliferative effect on different cell types. In BAF3 cells following IL-3 withdrawal, Bcl-2 expressing cells rapidly arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and were refractory to re-stimulation when IL-3 was added back <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Marvel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, in both fibroblasts and IL-3 dependent cells arrested in G0, Bcl-2 expression increased the time to reach S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Huang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-2 was also shown to accelerate cell cycle withdrawal into G0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Vairo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these findings demonstrate that Bcl-2 regulates cellular proliferation by controlling the G0 to G1 transition. Several studies on the effect of Bcl-2 on resting lymphocytes are consistent with this interpretation. B-lymphocytes isolated from Bcl-2 transgenic mice were resistant to activation and proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-OReilly1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-OReilly3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

In one study using cell lines, a single point mutation at tyrosine 28 (to Ala, Ser, and Phe) in the BH4 domain was able to ablate the anti-proliferative effect without affecting the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Huang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to this finding, other reports using this same mutation in cell lines and in transgenic mice demonstrated a tight correlation between the anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions of Bcl-2 and demonstrated these two functions could not be separated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Janumyan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Cheng1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings demonstrate a complex relationship between p27 and Bcl-2 with regards to cellular proliferation, and oncogenesis.

These studies prompted us to determine if p27 is an important tumor suppressor downstream of Bcl-2. In this study, we hypothesized that p27 deficiency would cooperate with Bcl-2 in tumor formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, lymphoma formation was dramatically accelerated by combining the loss of p27 with the expression of Bcl-2.</p><p>CKI's inhibitors include both the Cip/Kip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Nakayama2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and INK4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Roussel1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> families.

For the members of the Cip/Kip family, their roles as bonafide tumor suppressors are not as well established. P21 was one of the first known targets of p53 and as such was proposed to act as a tumor suppressor. Surprisingly, p21 deficient mice failed to develop tumors at a significant rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Brugarolas1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Deng1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Though some of the mice develop pituitary adenomas, spontaneous aggressive malignancies are rare. However, p27 deficient mice are prone to develop aggressive malignancies when combined with a deletion in tumor suppressor genes such as p53 or INK4a/ARF, or when challenged with mutagens such as X-irradiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Fero1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-PhilippStaheli1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together, these findings demonstrate that the absence of p27 by itself is not predominantly oncogenic; however, p27 deficiency can sensitize mice to other oncogenic insults. The study described here extends these studies and demonstrates that p27 is an important tumor suppressor in the context of Bcl-2 expression.</p><p>In contrast to the result with Bcl-2, the absence of p27 had no impact on lymphoma formation in mice expressing pro-apoptotic Bax. The data clearly show that complete elimination of p27 had no additive effect on tumor formation and only a modest increase in thymic cellularity in young Lck-Bax38/1 mice. These results support the idea that Bax and Bcl-2 mediate tumor formation by distinct pathways, consistent with their opposing function in regulating cell death. Previous studies have shown that Bcl-2 expression maintains genome stability by abrogating the selective pressure(s) needed to lose p53 in experimental tumor models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Schmitt1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Gurova1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data demonstrate the paradoxical effects of the Bcl-2 family are in some cases independent of p53 and suggest that the effects of Bcl-2 on tumor formation are not singularly dependent on whether the tumors retain or lose p53. These studies in mice are consistent with a recent study of human breast cancer that showed Bcl-2 expression provides a favorable prognosis independent of several risk factors including the Nottingham Prognostic Index and was a more important prognostic factor than p53 status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Callagy1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ability of Bcl-2 to retain its cell cycle inhibitory affect on splenic T cells in the absence of p27 was surprising. A previous report had found that Bcl-2 expression in T cells was unable to inhibit <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake in p27 deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Vairo2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in contrast to our findings that Bcl-2 effectively inhibits splenic T cell proliferation as measured by cell cycle analysis of PI stained nuclei or <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake in p27 deficient cells. While the explanation for this discrepancy is not clear, one possibility may be that the studies employed different transgenic mouse models. Our study utilized the Lck promoter and the study by Vairo et. al. used a E&#x003bc;-promoter. It is possible that Bcl-2 expression is higher in the Lck model and the singularly important role of p27 is apparent at lower levels of Bcl-2 expression. In any case, we did find a role for p27 in a developmentally dependent manner. We demonstrated that Bcl-2 more effectively inhibited thymocyte proliferation in p27 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice compared to p27 &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice in mice between 4 and 6 weeks of age. These differences between mice with and without p27 were not observed in older mice between 7 and 12 weeks of age. These results suggest that the effects of p27 in this model are age dependent and as the animal ages, the extent of T cell hyperplasia becomes more pronounced. The cells are then reduced in size and p27 independent pathways are able to inhibit T cell proliferation. Our studies suggest that delayed up regulation of Cyclin D2 and Cyclin D3 may mediate the p27 independent cell cycle inhibition by Bcl-2.</p><p>The results described confirm and extend our previous report in which inhibition of T cell proliferation by Bcl-2 was dependent upon the age of the mouse, the extent of T cell hyperplasia and the reduction in T cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Cheng1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In our working model, we propose that a decrease in a survival/proliferative signal results in a reduction in T cell size and a delay in cell proliferation. For T cells, the <italic>in vivo</italic> survival/proliferative signal may involve interactions between the T Cell Receptor (TCR) on the T cells with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on antigen presenting cells (APCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Rathmell1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. When Bcl-2 is expressed, the selective reduction of T cell death leads to an increase in the ratio of T Cells to APC's in an age dependent manner. This altered ratio decreases the TCR/MHC interactions, results in the reduction in T cell size and delayed proliferation. Our studies show the primary function of p27 is to regulate the extent of T cell hyperplasia while inhibition of T cell size and cell cycle remains intact even in p27 deficient mice.</p><p>The studies here demonstrate that Bcl-2 significantly delays the increase in expression of both Cyclin D2 and Cyclin D3 in a manner that is independent of p27. This delay correlates with a delay in Cdk2 phosphorylation which has been tightly linked to exit from G1. This data provide yet another mechanism by which Bcl-2 may inhibit cell cycle in addition to the p27 and p130 pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Vairo2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The studies here have not addressed the mechanism by which Bcl-2 delays the up-regulation of Cyclin D2 and D3. However, other studies show the levels of the Cyclin D family are controlled by either protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Alao1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> or mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Engedal1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In summary, these data demonstrate a complex relationship between the Bcl-2 family, cellular proliferation, and oncogenesis and demonstrate that p27 up-regulation is not singularly important in the Bcl-2 mediated proliferative delay observed in T cells. Nonetheless, the results indicate that p27 plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis and in tumor development in the context of Bcl-2 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>Lck-Bcl-2 and Lck-Bax38/1 were previously described and were genotyped by PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Knudson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001911-Knudson2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.
