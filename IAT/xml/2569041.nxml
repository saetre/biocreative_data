However, some neuropeptide genes are expressed in larger numbers of neurons of diverse types suggesting that they are involved in a greater diversity of functions. One of these widely expressed genes, <italic>snpf</italic>, encodes the precursor of short neuropeptide F (sNPF). To unravel possible functional diversity we have mapped the distribution of transcript of the <italic>snpf </italic>gene and its peptide products in the central nervous system (CNS) of <italic>Drosophila </italic>in relation to other neuronal markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There are several hundreds of neurons in the larval CNS and several thousands in the adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>brain expressing <italic>snpf </italic>transcript and sNPF peptide. Most of these neurons are intrinsic interneurons of the mushroom bodies. Additionally, sNPF is expressed in numerous small interneurons of the CNS, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the antennae, and in a small set of possibly neurosecretory cells innervating the corpora cardiaca and aorta. A sNPF-Gal4 line confirms most of the expression pattern. None of the sNPF immunoreactive neurons co-express a marker for the transcription factor DIMMED, suggesting that the majority are not neurosecretory cells or large interneurons involved in episodic bulk transmission. Instead a portion of the sNPF producing neurons co-express markers for classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate, suggesting that sNPF is a co-transmitter or local neuromodulator in ORNs and many interneurons. Interestingly, sNPF is coexpressed both with presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. A few sNPF expressing neurons in the brain colocalize the peptide corazonin and a pair of dorsal neurons in the first abdominal neuromere coexpresses sNPF and insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is likely that sNPF has multiple functions as neurohormone as well as local neuromodulator/co-transmitter in various CNS circuits, including olfactory circuits both at the level of the first synapse and at the mushroom body output level. Some of the sNPF immunoreactive axons terminate in close proximity to neurosecretory cells producing ILPs and adipokinetic hormone, indicating that sNPF also might regulate hormone production or release.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Insect neuropeptides are commonly expressed in discrete stereotypic populations of neurons in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These populations vary in size for different neuropeptides. Thus, some <italic>Drosophila </italic>neuropeptides such as SIFamide and eclosion hormone are found in very small numbers of uniform neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], whereas others like tachykinin-related peptides (TKRPs), proctolin, and myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) are expressed in large populations of diverse neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A closer look at the expression of different insect neuropeptides has revealed that some peptides are prominent in neurosecretory cells and other endocrine cells and play roles as circulating hormones (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). Many peptides are found both in endocrine systems and in interneurons and thus they are likely to have several functions, including modulatory actions in central circuits (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). A few peptides can additionally be seen in skeletal or visceral motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally, some <italic>Drosophila </italic>neuropeptides appear to be exclusively expressed in interneurons, for example the TKRPs, SIFamide and A-type allatostatins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but there are so far no clear demonstrations of identified insect neuropeptides in sensory neurons (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Taken together the available data suggest that neuropeptides can act in diverse ways as neuromodulators or cotransmitters in the CNS, as circulating hormones and as neuromediators released by neurons at peripheral targets. Thus, one may ask to what extent a neuropeptide that is widely distributed in many types of neurons is multifunctional. Or, differently phrased, does a given peptide expressed in a diverse set of neuronal circuits and neuron types (including neurosecretory cells) subserve a global unified function or a multitude of separate distributed functions? To address this question we analyzed a <italic>Drosophila </italic>peptide gene with very wide distribution.</p><p>Recently it was demonstrated that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene, <italic>snpf</italic>, that encodes the predicted peptides short neuropeptide F 1 &#x02013; 4 (sNPF 1 &#x02013; 4), is expressed by numerous neurons of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The study by Johard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] focused on the presence of <italic>snpf </italic>in Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, known to be the intrinsic components of this brain center subserving, among other things, higher olfactory processing and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. During the analysis of the mushroom body circuits it was noted that <italic>snpf </italic>transcript and peptide products are distributed in a large population of different types of neurons throughout the <italic>Drosophila </italic>CNS. Thus we decided to map the distribution of sNPFs in relation to other neurotransmitters, neuronal circuits and compartmental boundaries (segments/neuromeres) of the CNS to allow analysis of substrates for possible diversity of functional roles.</p><p>We made a detailed mapping of sNPFs, especially in interneurons of various brain centers in larvae and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For immunocytochemical charting we used specific antisera to two of the peptide products of the <italic>snpf </italic>gene as well as a sequence of the precursor protein. This was compared with <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with a ribonucleotide probe to the <italic>snpf </italic>transcript. A sNPF-Gal4 line was used for driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the labeling pattern compared to sNPF immunolabeling. To screen for colocalized neurotransmitters and to analyze relations to identified structures we mapped sNPF expression in relation to specific neurons identified by Gal4 driven GFP. This analysis included the relation between sNPF expression and that of the transcription factor DIMMED (DIMM), known to be present in secretory peptidergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A fasciclin-2 (Fas2) marker was utilized to relate neurons to axon tracts and segmental compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. One of the major findings is that <italic>snpf </italic>products are expressed in a very large number of neurons of diverse types (some of which co-express markers for various small molecule neurotransmitters) suggesting multiple functions of these peptides. No overlap was seen between sNPF and DIMM expression. A novel and exciting finding was the presence of sNPF in a subpopulation of the olfactory receptor neurons of the antennae and in a pair of abdominal projection neurons co-expressing insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Distribution of sNPF in the larval CNS</title><sec><title>In situ hybridization in larval CNS</title><p>A general description of the distribution of <italic>snpf </italic>transcript in the embryonic and larval CNS has been provided earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Here we provide a more detailed localization of transcript by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in the brain and ventral cord of the third instar larva. Six larval CNS were used for analysis of hybridization pattern.</p><p>In the larval brain and subesophageal ganglion there are about 35 neurons in each hemisphere expressing <italic>in situ </italic>signals, in addition to numerous Kenyon cells (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). These neurons are located dorsally and ventrally in the protocerebrum and in the subesophageal ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Three strongly in situ labeled neurons in each protocerebrum have larger cell bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>, see also 1E) and are likely to be neurosecretory cells (see next section). In the ventral nerve cord there are segmentally distributed neurons both in thoracic and abdominal neuromeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). In each side of the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres there are three to four lateral cell bodies and one dorso-median cell body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). In abdominal neuromeres A7 and A8 there are additional labeled cell bodies with larger diameters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). A characteristic pair of larger cell bodies (DP) can be seen dorsally and medially in A1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). The segmental distribution and numbers of in situ labeled neurons match the pattern displayed by sNPF immunolabeling (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cell bodies of <italic>snpf</italic>/sNPF expressing neurons in the larval CNS.</bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization reveals <italic>snpf </italic>transcript in A-D and immunocytochemistry displays cell bodies in E. <bold>A</bold>. <italic>In situ </italic>signal in neurons of the protocerebrum (Pro) of the brain and subesophageal ganglion (SEG).

This antiserum recognizes a peptide sequence not shared with other known neuropeptides and thus presumably only labels neurons producing the sNPF precursor. Also the antiserum to the RLRWamide sequence is likely to only bind to sequences present on the sNPF precursor (the predicted sNPF-3 and 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the other hand the antiserum to sNPF-1<sub>4&#x02013;11 </sub>(with a RLRFamide C-terminus) is likely to cross react also with neurons expressing peptides with RFamide in the C-terminus such as: long NPF (dNPF), extended FMRFamides (dFMRFa), myosuppressin (DMS) and sulfakinins (DSKs). Thus after confirming that the antisera to sNPFp and RLRWamide labeled what appears to be the same neuron populations and that the antiserum to RLRFamide labels these neurons plus additional ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we decided to use the sNPFp antiserum throughout the present investigation. This antiserum was characterized for specificity by Johard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It can be mentioned that in the investigation by Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] an antiserum to a full-length sNPF-2 was used. That antiserum is likely to cross react with other RFamide-containing neuropeptides, and indeed these authors describe neurons additional to those shown here.</p><p>The number of neuronal cell bodies given below refers to both hemispheres (unless specified). One characteristic of the sNPFp immunolabeling is a variability in labeling intensity, especially in smaller neurons. Furthermore the labeling of neuronal processes is punctate and thus it is hard to resolve the axonal projections and therefore individual neurons could not be fully reconstructed morphologically. We examined sNPFp immunolabeling patterns in at least 10 specimens of each stage. It can be noted that the sNPFp immunlabeling pattern of cell bodies, closely resembles that seen after snpf in situ hybridization.</p><p>There are up to 600 Kenyon cells per larval hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As shown earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] most of these appear to be sNPFp-immunoreactive (sNPFp-IR). In addition there are about 190 &#x02013; 200 sNPFp-IR neuronal cell bodies in the larval CNS (as summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Of these about 70 are in the brain, including the subesophageal ganglion, and a minimum of 120 consistently labeled neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). There is some variability in the number of small neurons labeled with the sNPFp antiserum, both in the brain and the ventral ganglia. Thus, in well-labeled specimens we can observe additional small cell bodies, especially in the abdominal ganglia.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Immunolabeling with antiserum to sNPFp in the larval CNS.

Three pairs of intensely immunolabeled cells dorsally in the protocerebrum are likely to be neurosecretory cells (LNCs) of the pars lateralis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These LNCs have axons terminating in the ring gland (corpora cardiaca portion) and in the anterior aorta. We will describe these neurosecretory cells and their neurohemal release sites in more detail below.</p><p>In the larval brain branching sNPFp-IR processes were seen in neuropils of the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and subesophageal ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). The most dense immunolabeling is in the lobes of the mushroom bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C, D</xref>). Further sNPFp immunolabeling of processes is seen in the larval optic center (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and in non-glomerular neuropils surrounding mushroom body lobes and in pars intercerebralis and lateralis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). A movie with a rotating view of the brain is shown in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><p>The general distribution of sNPFp-IR neuronal cell bodies in thoracic and abdominal neuromeres is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. These cell bodies are of three general size classes: small, intermediate and larger. There are only six larger and 12 intermediate sized cell bodies, the remaining ones are small. As mentioned, the variable labeling is only seen for the small cell bodies.</p><p>The cell bodies in thoracic and abdominal neuromeres are located dorsally, ventrally and laterally; the former two either along the midline or more laterally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). By double labeling with antisera to sNPFp and fasciclin 2 (fas2), that labels major axonal tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we could relate the cell bodies to the different neuromeres of the ventral ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). From this we could reveal that in each of the three thoracic neuromeres there is only one pair of neurons with intermediate sized cell bodies. However, there are up to four additional pairs of neurons with small lateral cell bodies in each of the thoracic neuromeres. Also medially there are at least two small ventral neurons per neuromere.</p><p>The abdominal neuromeres display sNPFp immunoreactivity in many small neurons laterally and ventrally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>). In A1 &#x02013; 4 there are at least 4 &#x02013; 6 lateral small neurons and 2 &#x02013; 4 median/ventral ones per neuromere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A5 &#x02013; A8 have 2 &#x02013; 6 lateral and 2 median small cell bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In some specimens these posterior neuromeres appear to lack lateral small neurons (or display weak label). Finally, in each of A6 &#x02013; 8 there is a pair of intermediate size cell bodies laterally. Two groups of large sized abdominal neurons stand out as individually identifiable: one pair dorsally in A1 (DP) and two pairs posteriorly in A8 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>).</p><p>Two pairs of major bundles of sNPR-IR axons were found in the ventral ganglia. These are located ventrally and medially in the ganglia, and are associated with the dorso-median (DM) and ventro-median (VM) tracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The axons in the VM tracts form numerous varicosities and dorso-ventral branches along their course (see movie in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Additionally two pairs of thin lateral tracts near the CI tracts contain sNPFp-IR axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C2</xref>). sNPFp-IR punctates are seen in several neuropil areas both dorsally and ventrally in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>). The delineated neuropil posteriorly in A8/9 (designated terminal plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]) is densely supplied with sNPFp-IR punctates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). We detected no clear cases of sNPFp-IR axons in commissural tracts of thoracic and abdominal neuromeres, but immunoreactive punctae could be seen in transverse bands in each neuromere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>). None of the neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres seem to send axons through peripheral nerve roots, suggesting that they are all interneurons.

Using this sNPF-Gal4 in third instar larvae we found a GFP expression pattern similar to the distribution of sNPFp-IR neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Double labeling with sNPFp antiserum indeed indicated that most if not all neurons in the thoracic and abdominal ganglia expressed both markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>). A set of segmental dorsal median cell bodies in abdominal neuromeres display sNPF-Gal4, but not sNPF-IR material (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In the brain the match was not complete, probably due to low expression levels of GFP in some neurons (not shown). There were also some neurons where GFP was seen, but not immunolabeling; probably caused by the variable immunolabeling seen in some of the smaller neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of sNPF-Gal4 driven GFP in the larval CNS.

It is obvious that sNPF expressing neurons supply processes to several neuropil areas in the thoracic and abdominal ganglia, as already indicated with less clarity by immunolabeling. We detected no efferent or afferent axons in the ventral nerve cord suggesting that all sNPF expressing neurons in this region are interneurons.</p><p>In the larval brain the most prominent sNPF-Gal4 expression was seen in Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The entire neuronal morphology of these Kenyon cells was revealed and it was clear that some neurons in the core of the calyx and lobes do not express GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F, G</xref>), similar to the sNPFp antiserum labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This Gal4 line also enabled us to see the neurosecretory cells supplying axons to the ring gland (corpora cardiaca), as will be described below. Sets of Gal4 expressing axons were seen in the nerves entering the larval olfactory centers in the brain. These may be subsets of axons from ORNs of the dorsal organs as also suggested from in situ labeling in the late embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Supply of sNPF expressing axons to the ring gland and aorta</title><p>The neurohemal organ of the larval brain, the ring gland, is situated around the anterior aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). A variety of brain neurosecretory cells are known to innervate different parts of the ring gland and aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We detected varicose axons displaying strong sNPF immunolabel that supply the ring gland and aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;D</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that the sNPF-IR axons entering the ring gland extend only into the glandular lobes where the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) producing cells reside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C &#x02013; E</xref>). As seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;E</xref> it appears that the sNPF-IR axons terminate onto the AKH producing cells visualized with the c929-Gal4 line that displays DIMM expression, characteristic of neurosecretory cells {Park, 2008 #92}. Another supply of sNPF-IR axons terminate on the wall of the anterior aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). It was not possible to clearly identify the cell bodies of the neurons (neurosecretory cells) that supply the axons to the ring gland and aorta by ordinary immunolabeling. However, using the sNPF-Gal4 to drive GFP we could show axonal projections to the ring gland and aorta from a set of three LNCs in each hemisphere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>). We also used the sNPF-Gal4 driven GFP for double labeling with antiserum to corazonin since this peptide is known to be expressed in three pairs of LNCs in the larva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We found that the three pairs of LNCs with projections to the ring gland coexpress sNPF and corazonin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Curiously the sNPF-Gal4 expression was also seen in the AKH producing cells of the ring gland, but this is likely to be ectopic expression since we could not detect sNPFp immunoreactivity or <italic>snpf </italic>in situ signal in these glandular cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Distribution of sNPF precursor immunoreactivity (sNPFp-IR) in relation to the ring gland and anterior aorta of the larva (anterior is up).</bold><bold>A</bold>. sNPFp-IR (red) in brain and the corpora cardiaca (CC) portion of the ring gland and aorta (Ao).

In summary, the Gal4 expression is not likely to reflect the sNPF expression faithfully, but is good enough to give an overall view of the diversity of sNPF neurons.

The identity of the peptides behind these masses were, however, not confirmed with fragmentation analysis. Here we used single microdissected portions of the larval and adult brain for mass spectral analysis by direct peptide profiling. These portions included the mushroom bodies, but neither the subesophageal ganglion, optic lobes (or the optic lobe anlagen in larvae), nor the larval ring gland or adult neurohemal organs.

A large population of diverse neurons types was revealed with the different sNPF/<italic>snpf </italic>markers: a few neurosecretory cells, numerous interneurons of many kinds as well as olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the antennae. This wide expression of sNPFs in diverse neuron types, many of which may colocalize different neurotransmitters, suggests a diversity of functions beyond that of any insect neuropeptide studied so far. Especially the finding of numerous small neurons such as Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies and olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the antennae and small neurons of the optic lobe suggest that sNPFs play important roles in local cotransmission and/or neuromodulation.</p><p>Since the intensity of immunolabeling with the sNPFp antiserum was variable, especially for the smaller neuronal cell bodies, it was hard to provide definite numbers of smaller sNPF expressing neurons, in spite of analyzing many specimens. Possibly part of this variability in immunolabeling reflects <italic>bona fide </italic>fluctuations in sNPF levels related to activity levels of neurons. Another drawback with the immunolabeling was that it was mostly punctate within neuronal processes and thus did not allow resolution of neuronal morphology beyond location of cell bodies, major tracts and axon terminations. Therefore, the majority of the sNPF expressing neuron types remain anonymous cell bodies that cannot be connected to their release sites. Apart from ORNs, a prominent exception to the anonymity is seen for sNPF expression in the numerous Kenyon cells that send sNPF-IR processes into the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; lobes, but not the &#x003b1;' and &#x003b2;' lobes and &#x003b1;<sub>c</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>c </sub>portions of these lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Generally neuropeptides are diverse and multifunctional signal substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In insects more than 30 genes encode precursors of neuropeptides that are known to regulate many aspects of development, growth, reproduction, metabolism, homeostasis and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Most of these regulatory roles are played by neuropeptides released as hormones into the circulation and some may act after episodic bulk release within the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In addition, neuropeptides in interneurons are likely to act as local cotransmitters or neuromodulators in central neural circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Peptidergic neurons thus are of several different major types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]: (1) large neurosecretory cells with peripheral release sites that produce hormonal peptides, (2) a variety of circuit interneurons, some of which are relatively small, produce peptidergic cotransmitters (or local neuromodulators), (3) a separate type of peptidergic interneurons of intermediate to large size are likely to be responsible for episodic bulk transmission within the CNS and (4) subsets of motoneurons are known to express the peptide proctolin as cotransmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To these types of peptide expressing neuron types we can now add sNPF expressing chemosensory neurons (ORNs) of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>antennae and maxillary palps.</p><p>A recent paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] addressed the role of the transcription factor DIMM in determining functional phenotypes of peptidergic neurons. Expression of DIMM was seen only in a portion of the known peptidergic neurons of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, namely a set referred to as Large cells that Episodically release Amidated Peptides (LEAP cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These LEAP neurons express both DIMM and PHM, an enzyme required for alpha-amidation of neuropeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and have large cell bodies and/or extensive arborizations and axonal processes. Many peptide-expressing neurons were found not to co-express DIMM (non-LEAP cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and we indicate that the sNPF producing neurons in the larva are of this kind. Using the c929-GAL4 as a marker for <italic>dimm </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and antiserum to the sNPF precursor we found no neurons displaying coexpression in the larval CNS. We hade expected a set of 3 pairs of LNCs displaying sNPF and corazonin immunoreactivity to co-express DIMM, but this was not the case. In the paper by Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] a set of five pairs of neurons were shown to co-express DIMM and sNPF (antiserum to sNPF-2) in the larval brain. Four of these have cell bodies medially and colocalize dromyosuppressin (DMS) an FLRFamide-like peptide and another set of six are located among the LNCs and coexpress the neuropeptide corazonin. Since these authors used an antiserum to the full peptide sNPF-2 from Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] it is likely that the DMS expressing neurons cross react with the sNPF-2 antiserum (due to the shared RFamide). The corazonin-containing LNCs on the other hand may indeed colocalize sNPF and DIMM. It could be that we missed this colocalization in our preps while the c929-driven GFP was too weak in the cells of interest. As mentioned, we did reveal sNPFp and corazonin colocalization in three pairs of LNCs in the position described for the DIMM coexpressing ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and if these neurons are true neurosecretory cells they would qualify as LEAP cells (however, see discussion below on relation to AKH cells).</p><p>The finding of sNPF exclusively (maybe with exception above) in small neurons that do not express DIMM suggest that the sNPF expressing neurons might be signaling locally and primarily in capacity of cotransmitter or local neuromodulator. Another neuropeptide gene, <italic>dtk </italic>and its DTK products, are also expressed mainly in small interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found that in the larva only one pair of <italic>dtk </italic>expressing neurons co-expressed DIMM. This pair of neurons also expresses allatostatin B (myoinhibitory peptide; MIP) and have extensive axonal projections all along the ventral nerve cord. Thus it is likely that both sNPF and DTKs are primarily cotransmitters and/or local neuromodulators.</p></sec><sec><title>Colocalization of sNPF and other neurotransmitters</title><p>To seek support for a role of sNPFs in cotransmission we screened for colocalized neurotransmitters in the large population of sNPF immunoreactive neurons. In the mammalian nervous system neuropeptides colocalize extensively with classical neurotransmitters in interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], but in insects systematic screens of such colocalizations have not been performed (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Here, for simplicity, we used Gal4 expression for marking possible neurotransmitter phenotypes. This choice was partly forced by the fact the available antisera to small molecule neurotransmitters or their biosynthetic enzymes require fixation protocols incompatible with sNPF detection, or do not label neuronal cell bodies and thus precludes definite localization to the same neuron. Immunolabeling with sNPFp was made on Gal4-lines likely to reveal neurons expressing GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine and octopamine/tyrosine. In this screen we did detect some patterns of colocalization between sNPF and GABA, glutamate and acetylcholine, but the majority on the sNPFp-IR interneurons did not colocalize the markers tested so far. The main findings on colocalized markers are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><p>The antennal ORNs are likely to be cholinergic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and can thus be displayed by a <italic>Cha</italic>-Gal4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We found that all sNPF expressing ORNs in the antennae indeed coexpressed <italic>Cha</italic>-Gal4-driven GFP. The presence of an identified neuropeptide in arthropod chemosensory neurons is a novel finding, although antisera to FMRFamide-like peptides have been reported to label sensory axons in blowflies, locusts and lobsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Especially intriguing is the finding that only a subpopulation of the ORNs in the antenna and their axon terminations in the glomeruli in the antennal lobe express sNPF. Thus, most, if not all, ORNs are cholinergic, but only a subpopulation employ a putative peptidergic cotransmitter. It will be of interest to identify the complete set of glomeruli receiving sNPF-IR axons of ORNs to determine for which odors additional peptidergic signaling is utilized.</p><p>We detected a number of further <italic>Cha</italic>-Gal4 expressing neurons that colocalized sNPF in the larval and adult brain, but very few in the ventral nerve cord. Both in the brain and the ganglia these were primarily small interneurons that could not be individually identified, except for a pair of dorsal median neurons (DP) in A1 of the ventral nerve cord. When analyzing sNPF in relation to <italic>Cha </italic>expression in neuronal processes in brain neuropils we could not detect colocalization of markers in central body neuropils, mushroom bodies, optic lobe (with one exception in the lobula; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10H</xref>), whereas in the antennal lobes the ORN terminations coexpressed the two. Thus cholinergic interneurons that express sNPF appear to arborize primarily in non-glomerular neuropils.</p><p>Fewer sNPF expressing neurons displayed markers for glutamate (vGluT-Gal4) and GABA (Gad1-Gal4). These neurons were in both cases located in the brain and no colocalization was detected in the larval ventral ganglia. Again the neurons were not possible to identify as individuals and we did not see any specific patterns of colocalization in processes in major neuropils. We detected no colocalization between sNPF and markers for dopamine and octopamine/tyramine. However, we did not investigate the possible colocalization of sNPF and the biogenic amines serotonin and histamine, known to be expressed in distinct sets of neurons in the larval and adult CNS of <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>In summary, except for the ORNs of the antennae and abdominal DP neurons, it is not clear what specific types of interneurons that coexpress the sNPF and the markers for small molecule neurotransmitters. By screening labeling in different neuropil regions of the adult brain we could exclude peptide/transmitter coexpression in the neurons of the central body, antennal lobes (except ORNs), optic lobe and intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) of mushroom bodies. The Kenyon cells are likely to express a small molecule transmitter in addition to sNPF. A screen for such a transmitter was made in a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] but no marker employed so far provided a lead to the Kenyon cell transmitter. Several putative small molecule transmitters remain to be investigated in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and other insects (e. g. nucleotides/nucleosides, glycine, and aspartate). It cannot be excluded that the small proportion of sNPF neurons where we could see colocalized markers was caused by deficiencies in the Gal4 lines utilized: the gene expressions may be incomplete and thus not reveal the entire populations of neurons expressing the neurotransmitters intended.</p></sec><sec><title>Relation between sNPF and other neuropeptides, including ILPs</title><p>Since we were mainly interested in the colocalization of sNPF and small molecule transmitters we did not make an extensive screen for colocalization with other neuropeptides.</p><p>One exciting finding was that the two unique DP neurons of A1 of larvae co-express the relaxin-like ILP7, as well as <italic>Cha</italic>. These neurons were described first as ILP7 producing neurons with ascending axons terminating close to the dendrites of the ILP producing MNCs in the larval brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Here we showed that the ascending ILP7 immunoreactive processes indeed colocalize sNPF and are part of a slightly more extensive supply of sNPF-IR processes impinging on Dilp2-Gal4 expressing MNCs. It was shown that sNPF overexpression causes increased production of ILPs in these MNCs and that the MNCs express the sNPF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that sNPF together with ILP7 (and maybe acetylcholine) regulate production of other ILPs. It should be noted that we also could show that sNPF immunolabeled varicose axons (from the three pairs of LNCs) terminate close to AKH-producing cells in the corpora cardiaca of the ring gland. This might suggest that these sNPF producing cells could have a role in regulation of the AKH cells, but it cannot be excluded that sNPF is released as a circulating hormone. The same LNCs have additional axons terminating in the anterior aorta suggesting a hormonal release site.</p><p>Apart from the above findings we revealed one pair of neurons in the dorsal protocerebrum (in DLN1 group) co-expressing sNPF and NPF (long NPF) and noted an extensive superposition of neuronal processes containing he two peptides in the dorsal protocerebrum. Another set of about six sNPF-IR neurons in the dorso-median brain (pars intercerebralis) co-express Mai-179-Gal4. These particular neurons with axons in the median bundle and possible terminations in tritocerebrum were not described among the neurosecretory cells innervating the ring gland in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but similar neurons were seen with an antiserum to Ion transport peptide (ITP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Thus, it might be that these PI neurons coexpress ITP and sNPF.</p></sec><sec><title>How many peptides are produced by the <italic>snpf </italic>gene?</title><p>Mass spectrometry identified SPSLRLRFa, which corresponds to both sNPF-1<sup>4&#x02013;11 </sup>and sNPF-2<sup>12&#x02013;19</sup>, as the major product of the predicted sNPF-1 to 4. A small peak representing full length sNPF-1 was also detected. Thus, it appears that sNPF-2 is processed to sNPF-2<sup>12&#x02013;19</sup>, and sNPF-3 and 4 are not liberated from the precursor (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). An antiserum to sNPF-3 used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] labeled the same neurons as the one to the sNPF precursor used here. Possibly that antiserum recognizes the sNPF-3 and 4 sequences (with RLRWamide) within the precursor, or too little peptide is produced to be detected by mass spectrometry. The <italic>snpf </italic>genes of the mosquitoes <italic>Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti</italic>, and <italic>Culex pipiens </italic>also predict RLRWamides like sNPF-3 and 4, but not the ones in the honey bee or the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

An earlier study has addressed the general distribution and role of sNPFs and its receptor sNPFR1 in feeding and growth in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These authors showed that sNPF signaling appears to be involved in regulation of food intake and growth, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and also in the regulation of <italic>Drosophila </italic>ILP expression via the sNPF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The experiments were conducted by rather widespread over-expression and knock-down of sNPF products and did not address sNPF action in specific circuits. Thus, it is not clear at what level the sNPF regulation of ILP producing cells occurs. However, the sNPFR1 is expressed on Dilp2-gal4 expressing MNCs in brain and sNPF immunoreactive processes were detected close to these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], as also shown here. Whatever the exact circuitry utilizing sNPF to regulate ILP production, the effect of sNPF on growth via ERK (extracellular signal-related kinases) signaling is likely to be only a part of a spectrum of sNPF functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This function may be limited to a small subset of the sNPF-expressing neurons.</p><p>Peptides likely to be orthologs of <italic>Drosophila </italic>sNPF have been identified in other insects.

Some actions of sNPF have been analyzed by peptide administration: sNPFs are myostimulatory on various visceral muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] induce host seeking behavior in female mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], they may be important for diapause in a beetle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] and in locusts they stimulate ovarian growth and induce increases in vitellogenin levels in the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. This spectrum of actions, except the host seeking behavior, may represent hormonal functions of sNPF. Thus, probably a host of functions based on local actions of sNPF in circuits of the CNS remain to be demonstrated.</p><p>Only a single <italic>Drosophila </italic>sNPF receptor (NPFR76F; CG7395; sNPFR1) has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].

Colocalized putative neurotransmitters as well as neuropeptides have been indicated in several subsets of sNPF expressing neurons and a more complete screen is likely to detect further examples. The colocalized substances may be both excitatory (e. g. acetylcholine) and inhibitory (GABA) or neuropeptides with various modulatory or hormonal actions.

The primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) all used at 1:1500 or 1:1000. Some specimens were processed for peroxidase based detection using the biotin-streptavidine method (with peroxidase histochemistry) employing a commercial ABC kit (Vectastain) from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturers.</p><p>For cryostat sections fixed heads were put in 20% sucrose over night and subsequently frozen at -23&#x000b0;C and cut at 20 &#x003bc;m on a cryostat (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany). Sectioned tissues were subjected to the same immunocytochemical procedure as above. Preincubations of antisera with their respective antigens and other specificity tests for immunocytochemistry were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis</title><p>Specimens were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or a Leica TCS SP2 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope. Confocal images were obtained at an optical section thickness of 0.4 &#x02013; 0.5 &#x003bc;m and were processed with Zeiss LSM or Leica Confocal Software and edited for contrast and brightness in Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.</p><p>To obtain 3D reconstructions, confocal stacks were subjected to either texture-based volume rendering using the voltex tool, or to threshold-based surface generation with the LabelVoxel and Threshold Segmentation tool of AMIRA 4.1 software (Mercury Computer Systems GmbH, Berlin, Germany).</p><p>Wholemounted specimens treated for in situ hybridization or peroxidase-based immunocytochemistry were used for tracings of neuronal cell bodies with a drawing tube attached to a compound microscope. Images of in situ hybdridization were generated on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam HRM CCD camera.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>The brain of either larvae or adults was dissected free from all surrounding tissue in standard <italic>Drosophila </italic>saline. Optic anlagen or lobes and the ring gland/aorta were removed with fine scissors. The remaining brain was cut transversally in the middle. The dorsal part, which roughly corresponded to the protocerebrum, was then slightly trimmed dorsally and laterally, and cut medially. The resulting tissue fragments each contained a mushroom body, as checked under a phase contrast microscope. The fragments were transferred to a stainless steel MALDI target and attached saline was aspirated off, and the preparation was left to dry. Afterwards, nanoliter volumes of matrix (saturated solution of recrystallized &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, Sigma-Aldrich) in 30% MeOH/30% EtOH) were added to the samples using a manual oocyte injector (Drummond Digital).</p><p>MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode on a Applied Biosystems 4800 <italic>plus </italic>mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were analyzed in reflectron mode after calibration with synthetic peptides. To suppress matrix signals, the low mass gate was set to 800 Da. Laser power was adjusted to provide optimal signal-to-noise ratios. Data were analyzed using Data Explorer 4.3 software (Applied Biosystems), with a mass tolerance of 0.1 Da.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DRN and HADJ designed the experiments, LE and HADJ carried out the bulk of the antibody, Gal4-GFP and in situ labeling, JGS and CW performed some of the immunolabeling and all Amira reconstructions, CW performed mass spectrometry analysis and produced the movies, DRN provided reagents, and all authors analyzed various portions of the data, and read, discussed and approved the paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p>Rotating view of sNPFp-IR neurons in the ventral nerve cord of a third instar larva.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2202-9-90-S1.mpg" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title>Additional file 2</title><p>Rotating view of sNPFp-IR neurons in the brain of a third instar larva.
