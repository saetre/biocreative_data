Binding predictions based solely on consensus predictions are limited, because a single factor can use degenerate sequence motifs and because related transcription factors often prefer identical sequences. The ETS family transcription factor, ETS1, exemplifies these challenges. Unexpected, redundant occupancy of ETS1 and other ETS proteins is observed at promoters of housekeeping genes in T cells due to common sequence preferences and the presence of strong consensus motifs. However, ETS1 exhibits a specific function in T cell activation; thus, unique transcriptional targets are predicted. To uncover the sequence motifs that mediate specific functions of ETS1, a genome-wide approach, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), identified both promoter and enhancer binding events in Jurkat T cells. A comparison with DNase I sensitivity both validated the dataset and also improved accuracy. Redundant occupancy of ETS1 with the ETS protein GABPA occurred primarily in promoters of housekeeping genes, whereas ETS1 specific occupancy occurred in the enhancers of T cell&#x02013;specific genes. Two routes to ETS1 specificity were identified: an intrinsic preference of ETS1 for a variant of the ETS family consensus sequence and the presence of a composite sequence that can support cooperative binding with a RUNX transcription factor. Genome-wide occupancy of RUNX factors corroborated the importance of this partnership. Furthermore, genome-wide occupancy of co-activator CBP indicated tight co-localization with ETS1 at specific enhancers, but not redundant promoters. The distinct sequences associated with redundant versus specific ETS1 occupancy were predictive of promoter or enhancer location and the ontology of nearby genes. These findings demonstrate that diversity of DNA binding motifs may enable variable transcription factor function at different genomic sites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genomes contain sequences that encode both gene products and the instructions for where and when each gene is expressed. This gene expression code is critical for normal development and goes awry in disease processes such as cancer. The gene expression code is interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to particular DNA sequences and carry instructions for gene activation or repression. This recognition code is challenged by the presence of highly-similar transcription factors that prefer almost identical DNA sequences. In addition, studies in living cells indicate that individual transcription factors have significant flexibility in sequence recognition. Here, we identify thousands of positions in the genome of human T cells that are bound by the transcription factor ETS1. These data, along with comparisons to other genomic datasets, allow us to identify DNA sequences that specify ETS1 binding while excluding binding of other related transcription factors. Furthermore, we discover that ETS1 binds more than one sequence and that these sequence variants can predict distinct biological functions of ETS1. Thus, this work contributes to our understanding of the gene expression code by addressing both how a transcription factor can bind unique genomic locations and why a transcription factor binds multiple DNA sequences.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is programmed through DNA sequence elements, termed promoters and enhancers.

The emerging picture is that no single sequence motif fully explains all <italic>in vivo</italic> binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Massie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Rabinovich1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> derived consensus motifs are often present in only a minority of bound regions. These findings bring into question the purpose of binding site sequence variations. Possibilities are illustrated by experimental analysis of subsets of sites gathered from genomic data.

The challenge of genomic databases is how to take full advantage of the vast number of binding sites, yet parse out functional consequences of variation. To realize their full potential, genomic approaches to transcriptional networks must go beyond a description of factor occupancy to include correlates of functionality.</p><p>We focus on the transcription factor ETS1 that provides a variety of contexts to address these central questions. ETS1 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that display similar DNA binding properties, including the recognition of a core GGA(A/T) motif. ETS family members are extensively co-expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Galang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Hollenhorst1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example mRNA of 17 <italic>ets</italic> genes, including <italic>ETS1</italic>, is present in Jurkat T cells. Despite overlapping expression and sequence preferences, experimental data indicate that individual ETS proteins have unique biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Sharrocks1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. For ETS1, mouse deletion studies indicate a critical role in T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Muthusamy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This specific genetic function implies that ETS1 has a unique mechanism that allows it, but not other ETS proteins, to bind the promoters or enhancers of genes important for T cell activation. Finally, ETS1 functions, in part, by recruitment of the co-activator CBP to transcriptional control regions, presumably functioning to activate genes at which it binds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Yang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Foulds1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We utilize this in depth understanding of ETS1 at both a biochemical and biological level to inform our genomic approach and facilitate functional analysis.</p><p>Initial genomic occupancy studies with ETS1 have provided insight into the genomic dilemma and led to unexpected observations. We previously identified two modes of ETS protein targeting to promoters in Jurkat T cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter microarrays (ChIP-chip). The surprising mode is redundant occupancy in which a sequence with the consensus <named-content content-type="gene">CCGGAAGT</named-content> is associated with occupancy of three different ETS transcription factors: ETS1, GABPA (GABP&#x003b1;), and ELF1. Because this sequence is consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> derived consensus sequences derived from multiple ETS family members, we concluded that it can alternately recruit various ETS transcription factors. This redundant mode of binding generally occurs in the promoters of housekeeping genes and may represent shared function of the ETS family in the maintenance of constitutive expression. The second ETS binding mode is specific occupancy (e.g. ETS1, but not GABPA or ELF1), which requires a GGA core motif, but is not associated with a close match to the consensus ETS sequence. We proposed that specific targets would mediate the specific biological functions of each ETS transcription factor. However, the promoter-limited approach did not identify a significant correlation between the specific targets of ETS1 and genes important for the role of ETS1 in T cell activation. Full investigation of this provocative dual role of the ETS family required an expansion to full genome analysis.</p><p>In this study we identified regions across the entire human genome occupied by ETS1, a DNA binding partner RUNX, and co-activator CBP in Jurkat T cells to decipher sequence determinants and investigate the biological significance of sequence diversity. We discovered a previously undescribed role for ETS1 at a large number of enhancers. Enhancer occupancy of ETS1 was associated with a unique variant of the ETS binding site and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding assays illustrated how this variant sequence functions as an ETS1 specificity determinant. Enhancers co-occupied by ETS1 and RUNX contained a variant ETS sequence closely juxtaposed to a RUNX binding site &#x02013; a composite sequence identical to that found in the T cell receptor enhancers. These distinct enhancer sequences contrasted with prior observations of sequences at ETS1 bound promoters. Importantly, ETS1 bound regions that contained the ETS/RUNX composite sequence were near genes important for T cell activation, thus establishing a tissue-specific, genomic dataset for a factor partnership. Furthermore, ETS1 was closely associated with CBP occupancy at ETS1 specific enhancers, but not at redundantly occupied promoters. By using genomic datasets for DNA binding factors, in addition to correlates of DNase I sensitive regions, histone marks, and co-factor binding, we decoded the functionality of <italic>in vivo</italic> binding sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ETS1 and GABPA co-occupy active promoters, but ETS1 specifically occupies T cell enhancers</title><p>High-throughput sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) facilitates genome-wide searches for transcription factor binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Massie1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We detected 19,420 bound regions at an empirical false discovery rate of &#x0003c;0.01 for ETS1 in Jurkat T cells using this approach. This included almost all (94&#x00025;) of the 1086 ETS1 bound promoters previously identified by ChIP-chip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Hollenhorst2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> plus an additional 6116 promoters, indicating a potential for higher sensitivity.

A large number of regions, 12,283, were not in promoters. We sought to establish the validity of these potential enhancer regions by comparison to other types of genome-wide datasets.

Based on the long history of linkage of DNase I sensitivity to enhancers, we screened ETS1 bound regions for overlap. 76&#x00025; of ETS1 occupied regions overlapped with DNase I sensitivity. (Overlap was 98&#x00025; for sites proximal to a TSS and 64&#x00025; for distal sites.) This represents a significant enrichment over the mean 4&#x00025; overlap with datasets randomly derived from control sequences (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

This strong correlation not only helped validate the ETS1 data, but also suggested that DNase I sensitivity is a strong correlate of robust ChIP signals. We proposed that the 14,824 ETS1 bound regions that overlap DNase I sensitive regions represent functional regions, and only these were considered in further analysis.</p><fig id="pgen-1000778-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000778.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Genomic occupancy of ETS1 overlaps with DNase I sensitivity and GABPA occupancy.</title><p>(A) Overlap of genomic regions bound by ETS1 in Jurkat T cells and regions found to be DNase I sensitive in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Boyle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test whether ETS1 bound enhancers were co-occupied by RUNX factors, genome-wide occupancy of RUNX1/3 (RUNX) was determined. Again, only regions that co-localized with DNase I sensitivity were considered bound. Strikingly, 64&#x00025; of the 1075 RUNX bound regions were co-occupied by ETS1. In contrast, only 14&#x00025; of RUNX bound regions were co-occupied by GABPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). 77&#x00025; of the ETS1/RUNX co-occupied regions were ETS1 specific and distal to a TSS (compared to 37&#x00025; of ETS1 bound regions lacking RUNX), suggesting a role in T cell enhancer function. An unbiased search with MEME for overrepresented sequence motifs in regions co-occupied by ETS1 and RUNX identified a motif (Motif 4) similar to Motif 3, but with the RUNX binding site more strongly represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Like many sequence identification algorithms, MEME is biased towards strongly preferred spacing distances between two binding sites.

This analysis indicated that only the spacing found by MEME was over-represented in these regions. Therefore, ETS1 and RUNX co-occupy enhancer regions in T cells through a composite ETS/RUNX binding site similar to those found in the T cell receptor enhancers.

Thus, we proposed that ETS1 would recruit CBP/p300 to T cell&#x02013;specific enhancers, but not promoters. Genome-wide occupancy for CBP detected 14,374 CBP bound/DNase I sensitive regions in Jurkat T cells. CBP bound regions showed a surprisingly high overlap with ETS1 bound regions at both redundant promoters (75&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and ETS1 occupied enhancers (68&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) compared to regions not bound by ETS1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t001">Table 1</xref>).

At redundantly occupied promoters, the location of ETS1, CBP, GABPA, H3K4 tri-methylation, and Motif 1 were plotted relative to the TSS. At ETS1 occupied enhancers the location of CBP, RUNX, H3K4 mono-methylation, and Motif 4 were plotted relative to the center of the ETS1 bound region. At promoters ETS1 and GABPA binding were coincident with the consensus ETS binding site at a position 25&#x02013;30 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This extremely TSS proximal location and the location of histone H3K4 tri-methylation on either side of the ETS1 bound region indicated that redundant ETS binding occurs in the nucleosome-free region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Jiang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. CBP occupancy was co-incident with the downstream H3K4 tri-methyl, but not ETS1 and GABPA binding, suggesting that CBP is not directly bound by ETS factors at promoters. In contrast, at enhancers, CBP, ETS1, and RUNX binding overlapped, suggesting that ETS1 and/or RUNX may directly bind CBP. Again, ETS1 occupied a region between histone marks, in this case H3K4 mono-methyl, indicating that ETS1 binds between nucleosomes.</p><fig id="pgen-1000778-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000778.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Distinct properties of promoters and enhancers occupied by ETS1.</title><p>(A) Factor or histone modification positions were plotted as a class average across redundant promoters (left) or ETS1 occupied enhancers (right).

At ETS1-occupied enhancers, the occupancy profiles of RUNX1, CBP, H3K4 mono-methyl, and Motif 4 were plotted with respect to the center of the ETS1 bound region. For each factor, histone modification, or motif, a histogram of 30 bp bins was generated to represent the frequency of occupancy for each distance. The number of occurrences at each distance was normalized to the total number of regions with an occurrence of each factor, histone modification, or motif. A vertical line indicates the zero position of each chart (TSS or center of ETS1 bound region). (B) Protein immunoblot of Jurkat whole cell extracts with the ETS1 antibody.

Decreased ETS1 protein levels correlated with a loss of ETS1, CBP, and RUNX ChIP enrichment at the <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> enhancer (containing Motif 4). We concluded that ETS1 is critical for recruitment or stable binding of CBP in enhancers important for T cell activation. In contrast, reduction of ETS1 occupancy in a redundantly occupied promoter (containing Motif 1) did not affect CBP enrichment. Thus, distinct sequence motifs at ETS1 binding sites correlate with not only different types of regulatory elements, but also distinct histone marks and co-activator binding. We conclude that these sequences mediate unique functions of ETS1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Comprehensive identification of ETS1 binding sites in Jurkat T cells revealed that ETS1 was present at a large number of enhancers in a context distinct from that previously observed at promoters. Enhancers differed from promoters in the sequence elements that bind ETS1, in the compliment of neighboring proteins and histone marks, and in the ontology of nearby genes. Specifically, the tissue specific function of ETS1 correlated with enhancer binding via an ETS/RUNX composite sequence. Furthermore, our data indicated that this T cell&#x02013;specific enhancer function, but not the housekeeping promoter function of ETS1, is associated with co-localization of the co-activator CBP. Therefore, the sequences motifs identified here are associated with specific enhancer occupancy of ETS1 and define a different function than the sequence associated with redundant ETS1 occupancy at promoters.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Overlap with DNase I sensitivity improves the accuracy of a ChIP-seq dataset</title><p>Selecting regions at which ChIP-seq enrichment coincided with DNase I sensitivity improved the accuracy of a dataset of transcription factor bound regions. The fraction of regions removed (24&#x00025; of ETS1 bound regions, 39&#x00025; of CBP bound regions and 70&#x00025; of RUNX regions) may reflect the quality of the antibodies used for ChIP-seq. Removed regions had ETS1 binding properties (presence of binding motifs, correlations with other factors and histone marks), but at markedly lower levels than retained regions. Thus, we propose that the use of DNase I sensitivity screening improves the quality of a ChIP-seq dataset and may be particularly useful for the interpretation of data generated with suboptimal antibody reagents.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>ETS1 binding determinants vary at specific enhancers and redundant promoters</title><p>The genome-wide set of ETS1 binding sites showed sequence variants that distinguish enhancer versus promoter binding events. Specific ETS1 occupancy of enhancers was associated with a sequence that varies by two nucleotides from the ETS consensus sequence used for redundant binding at promoters. Our bioinformatics analysis indicated that these two nucleotide changes are not equivalent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t002">Table 2</xref>). The C to A change at the second position appeared to be required for specific ETS1 binding to enhancers, but also occurs at redundant promoters. In contrast, the A to T change at the sixth position appeared to restrict occupancy of redundant promoters, but not specific enhancers. The A to T change has previously been shown to provide specificity for ETS1 versus the ETS protein ELF1 <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Bosselut1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> comparison confirmed the role of this single nucleotide change and identified a dramatic specificity difference between ETS1 and ELF1 when both nucleotides were changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, the <italic>in vitro</italic> data did not explain why the C to A change alone appeared necessary for genomic enrichment in ETS1 specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t002">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the nucleotide preferences at these ETS binding sequences are likely due to a combination of the intrinsic differences in DNA binding attributes of ETS proteins and other <italic>in vivo</italic> factors.</p><p>A striking difference between the ETS consensus sequence, <named-content content-type="gene">CCGGAAGT</named-content>, and the C to A variant, <named-content content-type="gene">CaGGAAGT</named-content>, is the susceptibility to DNA methylation. Indeed, methylation of this CpG dinucleotide within the consensus has been shown to block the binding of ETS proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Yokomori1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Gaston1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously observed a very strong correlation between redundant ETS occupancy of promoters, the sequence CCGGAAGT and CpG islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Hollenhorst2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The CpG islands at housekeeping promoters are generally hypomethylated, whereas CpG dinucleotides distributed in lower density throughout the genome are likely to be methylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Bird1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Meissner1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, ETS sites may be shielded from methylation at CpG island-containing promoters, but not at enhancers. Therefore, the C to A change in the ETS binding sequences at enhancers may have evolved to protect these sites from the repressive effects of DNA methylation. Because other transcription factors whose binding sites bear a CpG dinucleotide (NRF-1, BoxA, SP1, CRE, and E-box) are also enriched in housekeeping promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Rozenberg1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, the use of an alternate sequence in tissue-specific enhancers may also extend to these transcription factor families.</p><p>Another factor that might influence the ETS1 binding sequence observed <italic>in vivo</italic> is the presence of closely juxtaposed binding sites for other transcription factors. A subset of the ETS1 specific enhancers were co-occupied by RUNX and had a composite ETS/RUNX binding sequence (Motif 4). In the context of this sequence, the A to T change at the sixth position of the ETS sequence allows the RUNX sequence to be a closer match to the RUNX consensus (<underline>Y</underline>GYGGT, sixth position underlined). This factor could contribute to the enrichment of the A to T change in specific enhancers. However, a T at the sixth position was no more likely in regions co-occupied by ETS1 and RUNX (Motif 4) than at ETS1 specific enhancers in general (Motif 3). This indicates that either an A or a T at this position can support ETS1 and RUNX co-occupancy. Furthermore, only 55&#x00025; of the ETS1 bound regions that had the sequence CAGGATGT, had the full ETS/RUNX composite <named-content content-type="gene">CAGGATGTGG</named-content>. We propose that the remaining 45&#x00025; of regions recruit ETS1 either only through the ETS binding site, or in cooperation with other unidentified transcription factors. In conclusion, the sequences associated with ETS1 specific occupancy of enhancers reflect intrinsic differences in DNA binding or interactions with other factors and may be influenced by susceptibility to DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>ETS1 and RUNX co-occupancy predict tissue-specific enhancers</title><p>Mice with an <italic>ETS1</italic> gene disruption have reduced numbers of NK and NKT cells and show defects in T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Muthusamy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Bories1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Barton1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the role of ETS1 and RUNX in these immune functions has not been fully understood on the level of individual target genes. Our data suggest that ETS1 and RUNX regulate genes important for T cell activation pathways by direct occupancy of nearby enhancers via a particular ETS/RUNX binding site. The gene categories presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t003">Table 3</xref> suggest that the primary role of these transcription factors is not the direct activation of genes downstream of T cell receptor signaling, but rather the control of expression of the signaling machinery. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that <italic>ETS1</italic> null T cells are defective in activation upon receptor stimulation, but respond normally to pharmacological stimulation, which bypasses membrane proximal signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Barton1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The strongest determinant of ETS1 specificity, Motif 4, fixed the sequence of both ETS1 and RUNX binding sites as well as spacing and relative orientation of the two sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This strict conservation was somewhat surprising because ETS1 and RUNX1 bind to DNA cooperatively <italic>in vitro</italic> at a variety of other spacings and orientations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Goetz1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Wotton1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternate spacing can also function in transcription activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, the MMLV enhancer is activated by ETS1 and RUNX1 at a sequence in which the ETS and RUNX sites are four nucleotides further apart than in Motif 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Sun1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Motif 2 can also support ETS1 and RUNX1 cooperativity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Hollenhorst2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Motif 2 utilizes much more divergent ETS and RUNX sequences set two nucleotides further apart than in Motif 4. (Our analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g005">Figure 5</xref> does not identify this spacing because these sequences are too divergent from the Transfac ETS1 and RUNX motifs.) However, only Motif 4, not Motif 2 or the MMLV enhancer motif, was associated with ontologies aligned with T cell&#x02013;specific functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t003">Table 3</xref>, and data not shown). We speculate that this spacing could have a function in addition to the simple recruitment of ETS1 and RUNX. This may reflect a requirement for a specific conformation of ETS1 and RUNX for the transcriptional activation function of these enhancers. For example, because both ETS1 and RUNX can bind the co-activator CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Yang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Jayaraman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Kitabayashi1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and CBP occupies the same position as ETS1 and RUNX at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), cooperative CBP recruitment may require this particular configuration of ETS1 and RUNX.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>A differential pattern of CBP enrichment at enhancers and promoters</title><p>This first picture of genome-wide occupancy of a transcription factor in combination with the co-factor CBP presented surprising diversity. In spite of the general picture that CBP occupancy was strongly correlated with ETS1 binding at both tissue specific enhancers and at active promoters in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000778-t001">Table 1</xref>), fine mapping uncovered a more complex picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The coincident binding observed at enhancers and the sensitivity of CBP occupancy at the <italic>TCR&#x003b2;</italic> enhancer to an ETS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000778-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) is consistent with direct recruitment of CBP by ETS1 and/or RUNX.

This not only supports the functionality of ETS1 bound distal enhancers, but also strongly demonstrates the role of DNA factors in CBP recruitment. In contrast, the lack of concordance of ETS1 and CBP binding events at promoters suggests that CBP is associated with other factors at these sites. Potential CBP recruitment mechanisms include interaction with general transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Black1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and enhancer-promoter looping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Resendes1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Teferedegne1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Either of these mechanisms could contribute to the location of CBP at ETS1 bound promoters. We note, however, that the CpG island-containing promoters of housekeeping genes, at which we observe redundant ETS occupancy, are thought to lack enhancers. Thus, we suggest that CBP is brought to these promoters by enhancer-independent interactions with the transcriptional machinery. One possibility is that ETS1 participates in recruitment, but maintenance at these constitutively active sites relies on cooperation with basal machinery or modified histones.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Binding site sequence variation guides diverse roles for transcription factors</title><p>Like many cellular proteins, transcription factors can have multiple roles that vary based on cell type and condition. Transcription factor function can also vary based on the context of other proteins present at each genomic locus. Here we show that the type of genes that are near ETS1 binding events, and the location of the co-activator CBP differ based on the sequence that recruits ETS1 to DNA. Thus, two different roles of ETS1 in T cells &#x02013; a role at housekeeping promoters, and one at tissue specific enhancers &#x02013; can be defined by distinct sequence motifs. The sequence variation for different functions of a transcription factor provides an explanation for the lack of a single binding sequence in many genome-wide occupancy studies. Our investigation provides a route to sort genome-wide binding data by the presence of such sequence motifs and other correlative data to define the distinct functions of a transcription factor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ChIP</title><p>ChIP from Jurkat T cells was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000778-Hollenhorst2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This screening reduced the number of ETS1 bound regions from 19,420 to 14,824, the number of GABPA bound regions from 9214 to 7724, the number of CBP bound regions from 23,757 to 14,374, and the number of RUNX bound regions from 3632 to 1075. The <italic>P</italic> value for the overlap between ETS1 and DNase I sensitive sites was determined using IntersectRegions and comparing the ETS1 overlap to the overlap of 1000 iterations of a random regions of equivalent size derived from input point data.
