Amyloid deposits also universally contain sulfated glycosaminoglycans and the normal plasma glycoprotein serum amyloid P component (SAP),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">3</xref> which may contribute to fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), and persistence of amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). A striking feature of natural amyloid fibrils and amyloid-like fibrils generated <italic>in vitro</italic> is their shared global structural and morphological properties, suggesting a common underlying core conformation despite the differences in structure and function of the many unrelated precursor proteins from which they are derived. Thus, amyloid fibrils are characteristically proteinase-resistant, elongated unbranched fibrils (&#x0223c;10 nm in diameter and of indefinite length), and composed of two or more twisted protofilaments as visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). They exhibit birefringence, which when stained by the dye Congo red under appropriate conditions and examined by cross-polarized light microscopy gives rise to transmission of a characteristic bright green color and an x-ray fiber diffraction pattern consistent with a cross-&#x003b2; conformation in which the polypeptide chain forms &#x003b2;-sheets parallel to the fibril long axis with their constituent &#x003b2;-strands perpendicular to this axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Furthermore, all amyloid fibrils display a generic protein conformational epitope recognized by antifibril antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and are bound with high affinity by SAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Nonetheless, it is clear that heterogeneity of the assembly, structure, and other properties of amyloid fibrils exists, which depends on the identity of the fibril precursor protein and the conditions under which fibrillogenesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>Use of amyloid-like fibrils as tools to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding and aggregation has enabled significant insights to be made into the ways by which soluble proteins assemble into insoluble amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Such studies have prompted development of different therapeutic strategies to inhibit fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Although such efforts are hampered by the lack of high resolution structures of amyloid fibrils and their oligomeric intermediates, advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography are now beginning to provide a molecular description of the specific and well-ordered packing of the &#x003b2;-strands within small crystallizable fragments of peptides or proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated the apparent ubiquitous ability of polypeptides to form amyloid-like fibrils under appropriate conditions, commencing from different precursor states dependent on the solution conditions employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). For example, amyloid-like fibrils with similar morphological and dye binding properties are formed from lysozyme at low pH and high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), after proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) and disulfide bond reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), or in the presence of denaturants such as guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) or ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). However, the detailed architecture of these fibrils remains unknown. Studies on protein fragments of apolipoprotein A1 have indicated large structural differences between amyloid-like aggregates formed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> amyloid fibrils formed from the full-length precursor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Thus, while amyloid-like fibrils are useful tools for biophysical investigations of amyloid formation, how closely the fibrils that are induced to form rapidly under denaturing conditions resemble fibrils formed from natively folded proteins under physiological conditions remains an open question. Furthermore, how closely fibrils generated under artificial conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> resemble genuine amyloid fibrils formed <italic>in vivo</italic> also remains unresolved.</p><p>Here we have used &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with a &#x003b2;-sandwich structure, as a model system with which to address these questions. Deposition of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils <italic>in vivo</italic>, predominantly in osteoarticular sites, is associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), a complication of long-term dialysis for end stage renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Amyloid-like fibrils generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from pure recombinant &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m in seeded or unseeded reactions, commencing from denatured or natively folded protein, were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and compared with spectra of natural &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils isolated from a patient with DRA. FTIR provides a powerful means of comparing the structural properties of protein aggregates, because it is not only sensitive to the secondary structural composition of proteins, but the length and twist of the constituent &#x003b2;-strands also influence the resulting absorbance bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Our results indicate that amyloid-like fibrils formed <italic>in vitro</italic> from distinct precursor conformations of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m and under different assembly conditions adopt an indistinguishable &#x003b2;-sheet architecture that is closely similar to that found in <italic>ex vivo</italic> amyloid fibrils, highlighting a common amyloid fold, at least for fibrils formed from this protein.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Recombinant Proteins</italic>&#x02014;Full-length wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m and a double mutant containing the amino acid substitutions P32G and I7A (P32G/I7A), were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).

Control experiments demonstrated that altering the type or speed of agitation affected the rate, but not the morphology, of the fibrils formed. For selected experiments, seeds were prepared from fibrils grown for 14 days at pH 2.5 from wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m that were stabilized against depolymerization at pH 7.0 by addition of the sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin (porcine, average mass 5 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), after which they were fragmented by freeze-thaw cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) and stored at -20 &#x000b0;C. For seeded growth experiments, seeds were added to a final concentration of 5% (w/w) of total &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m. Fibril formation was monitored by the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Thioflavin-T (ThT) that occurs upon interaction of the dye with amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Aliquots (10 &#x003bc;l) of the suspensions were withdrawn at specific times after initiation of fibrillogenesis, diluted 100-fold into freshly prepared 0.5 <sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 containing 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ThT, and the fluorescence emission at 480 nm (4-nm slit width) was measured using a PTI C-61 spectrofluorimeter after excitation at 444 nm (4-nm slit width). Data were highly reproducible (within &#x000b1; 10%) and the average of triplicate readings for each sample was normalized to that of ThT in the starting buffer alone.

Aliquots (&#x0223c;150 &#x003bc;l) of monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m or fibrils were spread onto the surface of a germanium crystal ATR plate, and excess water was evaporated using a current of N<sub>2</sub> gas to form a hydrated thin protein film ideal for the analysis of such samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). The presence of residual solvent in the film was apparent from the absorbance band of D<sub>2</sub>Oat &#x0223c;1210 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Control experiments demonstrated that the spectra obtained were not affected by the extent of solvent evaporation. After purging the system with dry air for 15 min to remove water vapor, FTIR absorbance spectra were recorded at room temperature 2 h after suspension in D<sub>2</sub>O using a Thermo-Nicolet 560 FTIR spectrometer. For each sample, 1024 scans were accumulated at a spectral resolution of 2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Spectra acquired of the background (ATR plate without protein sample) were subtracted from those of the samples before curve fitting the amide I&#x02032; region (1700-1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>). Second derivative and Fourier self-deconvoluted spectra (employing a resolution enhancement factor of &#x0223c;1.6 and a bandwidth of &#x0223c;16 cm<sup>-1</sup>) were used to identify peak maxima. Using this information, the raw spectra were then fitted to a series of Gaussian peaks with the identified absorbance maxima using an iterative curve-fitting procedure performed in SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.). The position of individual peaks was held fixed while the bandwidth (assumed to be identical for all peaks) was allowed to globally vary between 10 and 20 cm<sup>-1</sup> during the fit. The band assignments as well as the resulting calculated FTIR spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) upon solution convergence to a minimum are shown. The amide I&#x02032; band with the highest intensity is defined as the amide I&#x02032; maximum throughout this report.

It has been shown previously that under these conditions, monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m is highly unfolded; the protein no longer retains &#x003b2;-sheet structure, and specific side-chain contacts are also absent in this highly dynamic ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Accordingly as shown here by one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR, the spectrum of acid-unfolded &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m contains sharp resonances with little chemical shift dispersion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), consistent with an unfolded state. Under these conditions the protein does not display a cooperative unfolding transition when incubated with increasing concentrations of GuHCl, a feature also characteristic of a highly unfolded state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). At pH 2.5, fibril formation proceeds with nucleation-dependent polymerization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), typified by an initial lag-phase during which small oligomeric species are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) prior to rapid fibril growth reflected by a substantial (&#x0223c;120-fold) increase in ThT fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). At the end point of incubation, amorphous aggregates are not visible by TEM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>), and the suspension consists predominantly of fibrils (more than 95% yield) that are &#x0223c;12 nm in diameter and have a long, straight morphology with a characteristic helical twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><p>By contrast with the behavior of acid-unfolded &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m, incubation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m in its native state in low ionic strength buffer at neutral pH does not result in an increase in ThT fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref><italic>, gray circles</italic>), and fibrils are not observed even after incubation for months at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Instead, the protein retains its native structure as demonstrated by the well-dispersed resonances in the one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of this state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and its cooperative unfolding transition when incubated with GuHCl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To generate fibrils from native &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at neutral pH, a procedure was employed in which fibrils formed by spontaneous (unseeded) growth at pH 2.5 were first stabilized by the addition of low molecular weight heparin (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). These fibrils were subsequently fragmented and used to seed fibril growth from the native wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), the addition of these so-called heparin-stabilized seeds to monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at pH 7.0 abolished the lag phase and resulted in a small, but significant (&#x0223c;18-fold) increase in ThT fluorescence after incubation for 14 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). At the endpoint of this incubation, fibrils that are morphologically indistinguishable from those produced spontaneously from the acid-unfolded protein were formed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref>).</p><p>To form amyloid-like fibrils from native &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at neutral pH in the absence of additives or seeds, new variants of the protein were created, building on our previous observations that single amino acid substitutions in the N- or C-terminal regions of the polypeptide chain confer enhanced amyloidogenic potential at neutral pH, as does the variant in which the single <italic>cis</italic> Pro-32 is replaced with <italic>trans</italic> Gly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). Accordingly, the double mutant P32G/I7A was selected for further analysis. At 37 &#x000b0;C at neutral pH, P32G/I7A &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m is natively folded as judged by the linewidth and chemical shift dispersion of its one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, but is significantly destabilized compared with wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m(&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>un</sub> = 14 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Importantly, P32G/I7A is able to self-assemble in a nucleation-dependent manner to produce amyloid-like fibrils without the need for denaturant, heparin, other additives, or seeds, which give rise to a moderately (&#x0223c;30-fold) enhanced ThT fluorescence signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). TEM reveals abundant fibrils &#x0223c;12 nm in diameter that morphologically resemble those generated <italic>de novo</italic> from acid-unfolded wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m and by seeded growth of native &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at pH 7.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>).</p><p>The amyloid-like nature of the fibrils produced <italic>in vitro</italic> using each of these conditions was confirmed by their ability to bind Congo red under selective staining conditions and produce green birefringence when viewed in cross-polarized light microscopy. In addition, the wild-type fibrils displayed specific, concentration-dependent binding by <sup>125</sup>I-SAP and gave rise to a classical cross-&#x003b2; diffraction pattern after examination by x-ray fiber diffraction (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> and results not shown), confirming their identity as genuine amyloid. Using these protein variants and incubation conditions, therefore, amyloid-like fibrils can be produced from acid-unfolded &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m, as well as from the native protein in seeded and unseeded reactions at pH 7.0, allowing a direct comparison of the fibrils formed by different mechanisms, under different assembly conditions, and from highly distinct initial precursor conformations.</p><p><italic>The</italic> &#x003b2;<italic><sub>2</sub>m Amyloid Fold Is Precursor-independent</italic>&#x02014;To determine the similarity in the content and organization of secondary structure in each of the fibril samples formed from &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m under different conditions, the fibrils and their precursors were examined by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This technique can distinguish between the ordered &#x003b2;-sheet conformations in native proteins and insoluble ones such as amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). The amide I&#x02032; band that absorbs between the wavelengths 1600 and 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> is a widely used and sensitive probe for characterizing the secondary structure components of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). The FTIR spectra of acid-unfolded and native &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m are highly distinct (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). The spectrum of the acid-unfolded protein at pH 2.5 contains a broad amide I&#x02032; peak with an absorbance maximum determined by second derivative and Fourier self-deconvoluted spectra (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;), of 1648 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). These data are consistent with an unordered polypeptide chain, in accord with results obtained by one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR and equilibrium denaturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). The spectrum of wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>minits native conformation at pH 7.0 differs markedly from that of the unfolded state, showing a relatively narrow amide I&#x02032; absorbance maximum at 1634 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), characteristic of a folded immunoglobulin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). The spectrum of P32G/I7A &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m is indistinguishable from that of native wild-type&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), indicating that despite being significantly destabilized, this variant also adopts a native immunoglobulin fold at neutral pH, consistent with the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of this protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>FTIR spectra of the amyloid-like fibrils of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m formed under the three different conditions studied are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>D&#x02013;F</italic></xref>. Strikingly, and by contrast with the very different FTIR spectra of their native and denatured monomeric precursors, the FTIR spectra of all three amyloid-like fibrils are identical, each showing a distinct absorbance maximum at 1632 cm<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that they possess a common &#x003b2;-sheet architecture. Analysis of the difference spectra between each monomeric precursor and its corresponding fibrillar species reveals distinct structural transitions upon fibril formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>G&#x02013;I</italic></xref>). A large shift in the absorbance maximum is observed upon fibril formation at pH 2.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>), consistent with the generation of &#x003b2;-sheet structure from the highly unfolded monomeric precursor. By contrast, only a small shift in the absorbance maximum (from 1634 to 1632 cm<sup>-1</sup>) occurs when fibrils are formed from the native protein at neutral pH using either seeded or unseeded growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref>). The identity of the FTIR spectra of the fibrils formed <italic>in vitro</italic> from different precursors is remarkable given the high sensitivity of FTIR spectroscopy to the length and twist of &#x003b2;-strands, as well as the number of &#x003b2;-strands per sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), and considering the very different growth conditions, assembly mechanisms (nucleated and templated growth), and timescales of fibril formation (hours to weeks) of each sample.</p><p>As a further demonstration of the sensitivity of FTIR spectroscopy to the conformational state of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m, different aggregated states of the wild-type protein were generated, and the resulting spectra compared with those obtained for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid-like fibrils. Thus, worm-like fibrils formed by the assembly of partially folded monomers at pH 3.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and amorphous aggregates formed by heating the protein to 60 &#x000b0;C close to its pI (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;) were generated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although the worm-like fibrils have been shown previously to bind ThT and give rise to an x-ray fiber diffraction pattern consistent with a cross-&#x003b2; structure, they do not exhibit clear green birefringence after staining by Congo red and display reactivity to anti-amyloid antibodies distinct from the long straight amyloid-like fibrils analyzed here, suggesting that their structure is distinct from that typical of amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Importantly, the worm-like fibrils and amorphous aggregates give rise to FTIR spectra with amide I&#x02032; absorbance maxima at different frequencies from those of the amyloid-like fibrils of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>), confirming that the amide I&#x02032; maximum at 1632 cm<sup>-1</sup> is specific and characteristic of the cross-&#x003b2; structure of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the secondary structure of monomeric and fibrillar&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.</bold> FTIR spectra of the amide I&#x02032; region of deuterated monomeric (<italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>) and fibrillar (<italic>D&#x02013;F</italic>) &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m(<italic>solid black lines</italic>) showing the component bands (<italic>gray lines</italic>). <italic>G&#x02013;I</italic>, difference spectra illustrating the structural changes between monomeric and fibrillar species for each growth condition. <italic>A, D, G</italic>, wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at pH 2.5 (unseeded growth); <italic>B, E, H</italic>, wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at pH 7.0 (seeded growth); and <italic>C, F, I</italic>, P32G/I7A &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m at pH 7.0 (unseeded growth).

Although the <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparation consists predominantly of amyloid fibrils, it may also contain traces of co-isolated lipids, glycans, non-fibrillar extracellular matrix proteins, and possibly also unfolded proteins resulting from the extraction procedure, the latter of which may give rise to the increased intensity of the 1648 cm<sup>-1</sup> band observed in its FTIR spectrum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

While subtle differences in the fibril architecture (for example in the precise stacking of the &#x003b2;-strands, the organization of non-&#x003b2;-sheet components, and the arrangement of the side chains) cannot be discerned by FTIR spectroscopy and would require more detailed elucidation, for example, by solid state NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>), the ability of FTIR spectroscopy to distinguish the structures of long straight <italic>versus</italic> worm-like &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils and different types of aggregates (amyloid-like fibrils <italic>versus</italic> amorphous aggregates) supports the concept of a common &#x003b2;-sheet organization for the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils studied here.

First, the FTIR amide I&#x02032; absorbance maximum of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid fibrils at 1632 cm<sup>-1</sup> is highly distinct compared with the FTIR absorbance maxima of amyloid-like fibrils generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from other proteins and peptides that typically yield a maximum below 1625 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and supplemental data). As noted by F&#x000e4;ndrich and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) and shown here in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, a clear difference is observed in the frequency distribution of the amide I&#x02032; absorbance maxima of native &#x003b2;-sheet proteins and that of amyloid-like fibrils, consistent with significant differences in the twist and/or length of their constituent &#x003b2;-sheets. Interestingly, while the FTIR absorbance maximum of native &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m monomers lies within the expected range for native &#x003b2;-sheet proteins, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid-like fibrils exhibit an amide I&#x02032; maximum at the edge of the range reported to date for amyloid-like fibrils formed <italic>in vitro</italic> from many other different proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). While a higher frequency at 1632 cm<sup>-1</sup>, obtained by synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy of A&#x003b2; amyloid deposits <italic>in situ</italic> in sections of brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer disease, was previously attributed to the non-fibrillar components of amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>), such an explanation can be ruled out for the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils examined here based on their purity, high yield, and the fact that the amide I&#x02032; absorbance maximum does not change upon limited proteolysis.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">4</xref> Our results here indicate, therefore, an amide I&#x02032; absorbance maximum for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m amyloid that is highly distinct from that (1618 cm<sup>-1</sup>) suggested to be typical for other amyloid-like fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>).</p><p>The finding that an amyloid fold with a common &#x003b2;-sheet architecture results from the incubation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m under a wide range of conditions: including different growth rates, in seeded and unseeded reactions, from precursors with very different initial conformations, and in the absence or presence of additional biological factors suggests that the aggregation free energy landscape of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m possesses a distinct global minimum that can be accessed readily irrespective of the conditions employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>).
