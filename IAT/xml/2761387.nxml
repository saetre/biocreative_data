Egr-EF, an expression vector pCIneo containing Egr-1 promoter cloned upstream of the cDNA for Flt3 ligand, was used to treat hematopoietic damage. 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, cause tumor cell death by producing DNA damage and generating ROIs. We therefore hypothesized that clinically employed chemotherapeutic agents that increase ROIs could also be employed to activate Egr-EF in a chemoinducible gene therapy strategy.

The vector was transfected into the HFCL human bone marrow stromal cell line, and these cells were exposed to 5-FU, a chemotherapeutic drug. Expression of FL by HFCL/EF cells after 5-FU treatment was determined with ELISA, western blot and RT-PCR assays. In addition, the effect of FL from HFCL/EF cell culture supernatants on growth of CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells from cord blood was also studied. HFCL/EF cells were injected into CB-17 combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with B16 melanoma. 5-FU was given three days after injection of the HFCL/EF cells.

Therapeutic gene delivery systems include vectors, lipofection, naked DNA and cellular vehicles. Poor specificity of hematopoietic tissue targeting and limited control of hematopoiesis-specific gene expression have limited the clinical utility of gene therapy for hematological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One approach to control gene expression is through the use of tissue-selective promoters to activate transcription of transgenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Another more interesting approach is the eukaryotic inducible expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is important to determine whether spatial and temporal control of hematopoietic gene expression following chemotherapy increases the efficiency and safety of radio/chemoinducible gene therapy. Recently, ionizing radiation (IR) has been used to activate target genes for therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cells exposed to IR generate reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) that activate radio-inducible CArG [CC (A/T)6GG] DNA elements of the early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Egr-1 expression induces expression of downstream target genes. Therefore, therapeutic genes can be inserted downstream of Egr-1 and their expression can be induced by IR. This approach is known as radiation-gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This strategy has been used with cDNA encoding human recombinant Flt3 Ligand (FL) that has been ligated into a eukaryotic expression vector. Using this vector system, FL has been preferentially activated in the hematopoietic microenvironment by IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. FL is a cytokine that has been shown to induce early hematopoietic activity in animal studies and is secreted by bone marrow stromal cells and other hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The combination of FL with chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA, such as 5-FU and adriamycin, has resulted in synergistic anticancer effects and reduced hematopoietic cytotoxicity in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Similar to IR, chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU cause ROI generation and DNA damage. Therefore, chemotherapy can also be used to activate the Egr-1 promoter and induce expression of downstream therapeutic genes. This approach is known as chemo-inducible gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although cytokines that stimulate hematopoiesis often result in hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy, no correlation has been established between expression of chemo-inducible genes and hematopoietic protective effects. A common feature of chemotherapeutic agents is the production of oxygen and other free radical species that lead to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein modification and cellular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ROIs are generated by a number of widely used anticancer drugs including doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], cyclophosphamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], gemcitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], temozolomide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and resveratrol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We hypothesized that ROI generating chemotherapeutic agents could induce production of hematopoietic growth factor in bone marrow stromal cells transfected with a vector encoding the CArG elements of the Egr-1 promoter ligated upstream of cDNA encoding Flt3 Ligand. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) ligand (FL) is a novel hematopoietic cytokine that is involved in regulation of early hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Either alone or in combination with other growth factors, FL stimulates the proliferation of highly enriched human and murine hematopoietic stem cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and leads to the proliferation and mobilization of hematopoietic and lymphoid progenitor cells <italic>in vivo </italic>in animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, FL may enhance dendritic cell (DC)-driven homeostatic T cell expansion and may also improve thymopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Locally expressed FL may also show anti-tumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Daily subcutaneous administration of FL is associated with dose-limiting systemic side effects. As an alternative to daily systemic subcutaneous injections, localized FL expression restricted to stromal cells within bone marrow may facilitate hematopoietic effects without the systemic toxicity associated with gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. FLT3 gene mutations have been identified as prognostic factors in myeloid malignancies, even though no evidence for constitutive activation of FLT3/FLT3L has been found in such malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is important to determine whether spatial and temporal control of hematopoietic gene expression following chemotherapy increases the efficiency and safety of gene therapy. For example, 5-FU has been replaced in an established 5-Fu combination chemotherapy with the gene therapy/chemotherapy system, Ad-LpCDIRESE1A/5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), in order to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy. This approach is known as "genetic combination therapy" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The goal of using this vector is to decrease the toxic effects of chemotherapy on normal cells and to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer cells. Using this approach, the concentration of 5-FU administered can be sufficiently high to kill even nondividing cancer cells.</p><p>In this study, to decrease systemic toxicity and increase safety of FL, regional delivery approaches were developed to restrict FL to bone marrow stromal cells in the hematopoietic microenvironment. Based on our previous study on Egr-1 promoter regulated Flt3 ligand (FL) or GM-CSF expression induced by ionizing radiation (IR) or chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we report here that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent that stimulates ROIs generation, induces the production of FL in human bone stromal cells transfected with Egr-EF containing CArG elements cloned upstream of the cDNA for human recombinant FL. 5-FU was used to recover hematopoiesis from chemotherapy- induced marrow failures and CFU-GM in culture and as xenografts in tumor-bearing SCID mice. These data support the use of chemoinducible gene therapy to reduce toxicity of 5-FU and facilitate the effect of the 5-FU-induced FL on hematopoietic recovery after exposure to 5-FU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recombinant vector construction</title><p>The Egr-EF vector was constructed as follows.

The pCI-F vector (containing FL cDNA without Egr-1 cDNA) and pCI-neo vector (without FL cDNA or Egr-1 cDNA) were used as control vectors.

Transcriptional activation of Egr-1 requires the CArG DNA sequence element in the promoter region of this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Radiation-gene therapy using TNFerade, a second-generation E1-, partial E3- and E4-deleted adenoviral vector carrying the transgene encoding human TNF-a downstream of the Egr-1 promoter, has been used in two phase I trials for patients with various solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. IR has been used to produce ROIs that activate the highly conserved sequence CArG of the Egr-1 promoter, thereby regulating the expression of downstream therapeutic target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>We have previously constructed a pCI-neo expression vector containing the <italic>Egr-1 </italic>regulatory sequence including the CArG element upstream from FL cDNA to promote FL expression. IR was used to activate the Egr-1 promoter to regulate FL gene expression in human bone marrow stromal cells injected into SCID mice.</p><p>Hematopoietic recovery was promoted by IR activation of FL expression. Chemotherapy-induced and target-regulated gene therapy is a new approach for tumor chemotherapy and gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Chemotherapeuticdrugs significantly injure hematopoietic tissues. Therefore, combining chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factors in gene therapy is one approach to reduce the damage caused by chemotherapy. 5-FU is a commonly used, broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug that causes tumor cell death by producing ROIs that result in DNA damage. The half-life of 5-FU in mice and humans is only 0.5 h, and 5-FU affects proliferative cells, especially those in S phase. Its principal restrictive toxicity is marrow hematopoietic depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Iko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] found that reactive oxygen species limit the productive lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells. Flt3 Ligand (FL) is a cytokine that regulates early hematopoiesis by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of early hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, as well as enhancing hematopoietic and immunological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Bone marrow stromal cells are the ideal cell type targets for gene therapy, as these cells determine the speed of hematopoietic function recovery after chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We hypothesized that ROS produced by 5-FU treatment could be used activate the Egr-1 promoter and thereby regulate downstream FL gene expression. Promotion of FL gene expression should reduce hematopoietic injury caused by chemotherapy. In this study, EGFP and FL cDNA were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pCI-neo containing the Egr-1 promoter. The vector was transfected into bone marrow stromal cells (HFCL/EF). The integration and expression of the exogenous EGFP gene was confirmed by expression of green fluorescent protein in HFCL/EF cells detected by FACS. FL expression was confirmed by RT-PCR detection of FL mRNA and detection of FL protein by western blot and ELISA assays.</p><p>Chemo-inducible FL gene therapy was demonstrated by hemotherapy-induced activation of the Egr-1 promoter resulting in enhanced recovery from hematopoietic injury. However, the proper dose of 5-FU for this hematopoietic factor gene therapy approach still needs to be determined.</p><p>The oxygen free radical inhibitor NAC was used to block ROI formation in order to verify whether 5-FU induces FL expression through ROI generation. FL expression was significantly decreased in the presence of NAC, indicating that oxygen free radical production is involved in activation of the Egr-1 promoter. Oxygen free radicals are produced by a number of chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consequently, other chemotherapeutic drugs could also be used for gene therapy using the Egr-1 promoter.</p><p>In our study, 5-FU was employed to activate the Egr-1 promoter in human bone marrow stromal cells injected into tumor-bearing mice, resulting in exogenous FL expression. EGFP positive cells were observed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, indicating that the transplanted human HFCL/EF cells were viable. EGFP expression increased in the HFCL/EF group after 5-FU treatment, indicating that 5-FU activated the Egr-1 promoter, which resulted in downstream gene expression.</p><p>These results are similar to those observed by Lopez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, RT-PCR and western blot assays demonstrated that human FL mRNA and protein are expressed in bone marrow cells after 5-FU treatment. FL mRNA and protein levels were not significantly different between the HFCL/EF + 5-FU, HFCL/EF and HFCL/F groups. This may be due to hematopoietic function recovery that occurred over the 25 days after chemotherapy.</p><p>Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] Combined FL gene therapy with 5-FU treatment and observed a synergistic effect on tumor therapy. In our study, 5-FU-induced FL gene therapy showed no effect on the growth of transplantation tumors. The tumor inhibitory rate was only related to the chemotherapy group, indicating that FL expression does not directly affect the efficacy of chemotherapy on tumor reduction. The decline of peripheral white blood cells in the HFCL/EF + 5-FU group was less than that in the control group. The hematopoietic absence in the agranulocytosis stage was also shortened in the HFCL + 5-FU group versus the control group.</p><p>Recent research has indicated that targeted gene therapy mediated by activation of the Egr-1 promoter with chemotherapeutic drugs is a promising treatment option for solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In this study, chemotherapy was used to activate the Egr-1 promoter, resulting in expression of a hematopoietic growth factor that reduced hematopoietic injury. The hematopoietic growth factor did not affect tumor growth, but it reduced the hematopoietic injury associated with chemotherapy. Since the Egr-1 promoter is activated by ROIs, it can be used to induce expression of downstream hematopoietic growth factors during chemotherapy, thereby improving hematopoietic recovery. Gene therapy using expression of the tumor necrosis factor regulated by the Egr-1 promoter has already been used in humans for tumor therapy. Hematopoietic factor gene therapy regulated by chemotherapy-induced activation of the Egr-1promoter shows great promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the future, other genes could be used in chemotherapy-induced gene therapy for various diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ND carried out the molecular genetic studies, drafted the manuscript.
