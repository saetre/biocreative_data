Here we show that with approximately 200-fold higher affinity than for the mu opioid receptor, naloxone binds a pentapeptide segment of the scaffolding protein filamin A, known to interact with the mu opioid receptor, to disrupt its chronic opioid-induced Gs coupling. Naloxone binding to filamin A is demonstrated by the absence of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-and FITC-naloxone binding in the melanoma M2 cell line that does not contain filamin or MOR, contrasting with strong &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;naloxone binding to its filamin A-transfected subclone A7 or to immunopurified filamin A. Naloxone binding to A7 cells was displaced by naltrexone but not by morphine, indicating a target distinct from opioid receptors and perhaps unique to naloxone and its analogs. The intracellular location of this binding site was confirmed by FITC-NLX binding in intact A7 cells. Overlapping peptide fragments from c-terminal filamin A revealed filamin A<sub>2561-2565</sub> as the binding site, and an alanine scan of this pentapeptide revealed an essential mid-point lysine. Finally, in organotypic striatal slice cultures, peptide fragments containing filamin A<sub>2561-2565</sub> abolished the prevention by 10 pM naloxone of both the chronic morphine-induced mu opioid receptor&#x02013;Gs coupling and the downstream cAMP excitatory signal. These results establish filamin A as the target for ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists previously shown to enhance opioid analgesia and to prevent opioid tolerance and dependence.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists have been shown to enhance opioid analgesia and attenuate tolerance and dependence, with a mechanism long hypothesized as a blockade of excitatory signaling opioid receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Crain1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although Chakrabarti et al (2005) also demonstrated some MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling in the opioid na&#x000ef;ve state while we did not, we believe this difference may be due to their use of non-immobilized anti-G&#x003b1; antibodies producing some background binding by Fc receptors.

While it is difficult to estimate the relative proportion of MORs signaling via Gs versus Gi/o during tolerance, it seemed unlikely that the ultra-low doses of NLX or naltrexone influencing opioid agonist effects would be sufficient to selectively antagonize such a subpopulation. Based on saturation binding studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Lewanowitsch1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, which incorporate NLX's affinity to MOR, we estimate receptor occupancy of 10 ng/kg NLX as no more than 1&#x00025;. More importantly, our co-immunoprecipitation data showed that ultra-low-dose NLX co-treatment reduces MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling while <italic>restoring</italic> levels of coupling to MOR's native Gi/o proteins; further, in spinal cord of co-treated rats, MOR&#x02013;Gi/o coupling levels greatly surpassed those of opioid-na&#x000ef;ve rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. If NLX were selectively antagonizing a subpopulation of &#x0201c;Gs-coupled&#x0201d; MORs, coupling to native G proteins would likely be unaffected.</p><p>Since NLX prevents MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling at concentrations well below its affinity for MOR and by influencing the coupling behavior of MORs, we considered proteins that interact with MOR and MOR-associated G proteins as the most likely targets, particularly those able to interact with multiple MORs. We first examined proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with MOR during activation. We identified a 300-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitating with MOR as FLNA and then demonstrated specific, high-affinity binding by NLX to FLNA. Best known for cross-linking cytoplasmic actin into dynamic scaffolds to control cell motility, filamins are large cytoplasmic proteins increasingly found to regulate cell signaling by interacting with over 30 different receptors and signaling molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Feng1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Stossel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, including MOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Onoprishvili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We deduced the precise binding site on FLNA by using overlapping peptides within the c-terminal, since c-terminal FLNA was shown to interact with MOR using a yeast-two hybrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Onoprishvili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess the functional significance of this high-affinity interaction, we used peptide fragments containing the binding site to prevent NLX from binding full-length FLNA in organotypic striatal slice cultures. Our findings suggest that FLNA interacts with ultra-low-dose NLX and naltrexone to prevent chronic morphine-induced MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling, possibly by preventing a critical MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction. This high-affinity binding site in c-terminal FLNA therefore appears to underlie the paradoxical enhancement of opioid analgesia and prevention of analgesic tolerance and dependence by ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists. In identifying the binding site though which ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists prevent MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling, our data also reveal an important regulation of MOR&#x02013;G protein coupling by filamin A.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of NLX-binding protein in MOR immunoprecipitates</title><p>In previous co-immunoprecipitation experiments of MOR and G proteins, we noted a protein with molecular weight at approximately 300-KDa in G&#x003b1;i/o immunoprecipitates in an amount that closely paralleled the amount of MORs in these immunoprecipitates, suggesting a functional interaction. A battery of antibodies against various cytoskeletal proteins, preliminarily identified this protein that co-immunoprecipitated with MORs and their associated G proteins as FLNA. Using striatal tissue of rats treated chronically with vehicle, morphine, ultra-low-dose NLX or morphine&#x0002b;ultra-low-dose NLX, we performed a two-tiered co-immunoprecipitation with anti-G&#x003b1; followed by anti-MOR antibodies. The final probing with a specific anti-FLNA antibody showed that FLNA associates with Go-coupled MOR and not with Gs-coupled MOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001554-g001">Fig. 1</xref> A,B). These blots also demonstrate the morphine-induced G protein coupling switch by MOR and its attenuation by co-treatment with ultra-low-dose NLX.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of picomolar binding by a psychoactive compound that is not to a cell surface receptor. NLX binds FLNA tightly with critical involvement of a 5-amino acid segment that is intracellular but near its c-terminal transmembrane domain.</p><p>The presence of FLNA in MOR signalplex in native brain tissues demonstrated here by co-immunoprecipitation agrees with previous data using yeast-two hybrid and co-transfection methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Onoprishvili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The dependence of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;NLX binding on FLNA expression in cell lines, the absence of MOR in these cell lines, and the displacement by naltrexone but not morphine clarified FLNA as a novel target for NLX and naltrexone. The interaction was confirmed using immunopurified FLNA from A7 or SK-N-MC cells. Since FLNA<sub>2556&#x02013;2565</sub> and FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2570</sub> both markedly reduced &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;NLX binding to A7 membranes or to purified FLNA proteins, we assumed that FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub>, within the 24<sup>th</sup> repeat, is the NLX-binding site on FLNA. We confirmed FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565 </sub>as the binding site by showing NLX binding to this pentapeptide<sub>, </sub>and an alanine scan revealed that the lysine at FLNA<sub>2563</sub> is critical for binding. We cannot easily explain a modest enhancement in NLX binding caused by FLNA<sub>2575&#x02013;2583</sub>, but this could be the result of reducing steric constraints around the NLX binding site on FLNA. Our demonstration that FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub> (VAKGL) but not VAAGL abolished &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;- and FITC-NLX binding to intact A7 cells again confirmed that this pentapeptide is a NLX binding site and demonstrated that NLX can access this intracellular target. Finally, the blockade of NLX's protective effects on both Gs coupling and cAMP accumulation by peptides containing FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub> provides evidence that ultra-low-dose NLX may block MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling and associated opioid tolerance and dependence by binding to FLNA at approximately FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub>. Although MOR desensitization, i.e. the decrease in coupling to native G proteins, is more commonly thought to underlie opioid tolerance and dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-SimSelley1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Sim1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> than a switch to Gs coupling, our present data indicate that a decrease in MOR efficacy can not alone mediate chronic opioid effects. Specifically, the increase in cAMP accumulation caused by DAMGO without forskolin following chronic morphine treatment illustrates that MOR has not merely desensitized, losing its ability to inhibit cAMP production, but that its stimulation actually augments cAMP production.</p><p>The detection of FLNA in immunoprecipitates containing Go-coupled MOR and not Gs-coupled MOR appears counterintuitive since NLX prevents MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling via a tight binding to FLNA. We propose that repeated MOR stimulation may force a particular conformation of the MOR-FLNA complex that weakens the entire signalplex. MOR may subsequently release from both its native G protein and from FLNA itself leading to association with Gs without FLNA in the complex. By binding to FLNA, NLX could block this particular MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction and stabilize the MOR-FLNA-G protein complexes, thereby reducing the morphine-induced release of MORs and their subsequent coupling with Gs in response to receptor stimulation. MOR and FLNA might be forced into an altered conformation or interaction during opioid tolerance by proteins involved in MOR recycling and internalization such as &#x003b2;-arrestins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Whistler1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, although we observed FLNA in MOR signalplexes containing Go proteins in native brain tissue, the prior data in co-transfected cells indicates that FLNA is not required for the native coupling state of MOR; in fact, its absence actually enhances MOR function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Onoprishvili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This prior study by Onoprishvili et al., the first to show that FLNA interacts with the c-terminal of MOR, proposed a role for FLNA in receptor regulation and trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Onoprishvili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors reported that MOR functioned normally in cells lacking FLNA, but that the agonist DAMGO was unable to desensitize MOR, as measured by the decreased ability of DAMGO to inhibit forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation following prolonged DAMGO exposure. In agreement, our present slice culture data show that ultra-low-dose NLX, by binding to FLNA, prevents this morphine-induced desensitization measure, as well as the upstream MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling that we previously showed to underlie tolerance and dependence <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the enhancement of opioid analgesia and reduction of analgesic tolerance is &#x0201c;paradoxical,&#x0201d; and occurs only at &#x0201c;ultra-low&#x0201d; doses of NLX and naltrexone (since higher doses of these opioid antagonists also antagonize opioid receptors), the attenuation of rewarding or addictive properties of opioids by ultra-low-dose naltrexone is not paradoxical. Hence, one would expect a continuous suppression of reward as increasing doses of naltrexone are combined with the opioid. Yet, in the conditioned place preference paradigm, while both ultra-low (0.03 and 0.3 ng/kg) and higher (30 ng/kg) naltrexone doses blocked the acute rewarding effects of oxycodone, an interim dose (3 ng/kg) was without effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Olmstead1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, in a self-administration paradigm, while co-self-administering 10 or 1 pg/kg/infusion both attenuated measures of reinstatement when oxycodone was not available, only the lower dose altered oxycodone's rewarding potency during self-administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Leri1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The blunting of opioid rewarding effects by ultra-low-dose naltrexone first suggests that Gs coupling by MOR may contribute to the rewarding or addictive properties of opioids, possibly by cAMP activation of PKA and subsequent CREB phosphorylation. However, opioid inhibitory effects, such as the proposed disinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons via inhibition of GABA interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Spanagel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, may also contribute to opioid reward. The loss of effect at intermediate naltrexone doses may indicate such complexities of the neural mechanisms contributing to opioid reward and addiction. Alternatively, the fact that the attenuation of rewarding effects is diminished as the naltrexone dose increases could also suggest an upper limit of an effective ultra-low dose range for disrupting the FLNA&#x02013;MOR interaction and consequent MOR&#x02013;Gs signaling.</p><p>In summary, here we identify a specific c-terminal region of FLNA as the high-affinity binding site of NLX and naltrexone in their suppression of MOR signaling alterations that result from chronic opioid treatment. This work therefore provides a molecular target for ultra-low-dose NLX through which ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists enhance opioid analgesia and decrease opioid tolerance and dependence. We propose that repeated MOR stimulation leads to a particular conformation of MOR&#x02013;FLNA that weakens Gi/o&#x02013;MOR&#x02013;FLNA complexes and allows MORs to release to interact with Gs upon subsequent stimulation by morphine. By binding to FLNA, NLX and its analogs prevent this altered MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction, thereby preventing the release from the complexes and the resultant altered coupling. There are multiple signaling consequences of the switch to Gs coupling by MORs chronically exposed to opioids, and each may contribute differently to the various behavioral effects of long-term opioid administration such as analgesic tolerance, physical dependence and the possibility of addiction. This notion may explain the multiple beneficial effects of ultra-low-dose opioid antagonist co-treatment, shown to preserve the normal G protein coupling profile of MOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001554-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. By identifying the target and binding site of ultra-low-dose NLX and naltrexone, we further elucidate their mechanism of action when combined with opioids. Finally, these findings create an opportunity to formulate a new generation of pain therapeutics that may provide long-lasting analgesia with minimal tolerance, dependence and addictive properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g) purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY) were housed two per cage and maintained on a regular 12-hr light/dark cycle in a climate-controlled room with food and water available <italic>ad libitum.</italic> For identification of NLX-binding protein in MOR immunoprecipitates, four groups of 4 rats were treated twice daily for 7 days with vehicle, NLX (10 ng/kg, s.c.), morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.), or morphine&#x0002b;NLX.

A nonlinear curve-fit analysis was performed using competition equation that assumed two saturable sites for naltrexone curve comprising of 16 concentrations ranging from 0.1 pM to 1 &#x000b5;M. Six experiments each using a different set of A7 cells were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Determination of binding site using FLNA peptides</title><p>To determine the NLX binding site on FLNA, various overlapping peptides encoding the c-terminal section of FLNA were used to compete for &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;NLX binding to FLNA using either A7 cell membranes or purified FLNA from A7 or SK-N-MC cells. Peptides were generated by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX).

Striatal slices (200 &#x000b5;M thickness) were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co., Surrey, UK). Slices were carefully transferred to sterile, porous culture inserts (0.4 &#x000b5;m, Millicell-CM) using the rear end of a glass Pasteur pipette. Each culture insert unit contained 2 slices and was placed into one well of the 12-well culture tray. Each well contained 1.5 ml of culture medium composed of 50&#x00025; MEM with Earl's salts, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25&#x00025; Earl's balanced salt solution, 6.5 g/l D-glucose, 20&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, 5&#x00025; horse serum, 25 mM HEPES buffer, 50 mg/ml streptomycin and 50 mg/ml penicillin. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with HEPES buffer. Cultures were first incubated for 2 days to minimize the impact of injury from slice preparation. Incubator settings throughout the experiment were 36&#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To induce tolerance, culture medium was removed and the culture insert containing the slices was gently rinsed twice with warm (37&#x000b0;C) phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) before incubation in 0.1&#x00025; fetal bovine serum-containing culture medium with 100 &#x000b5;M morphine for 1 hr twice daily (at 9&#x02013;10 AM and 3&#x02013;4 PM) for 7 days. To assess the effect of ultra-low-dose of NLX on the chronic morphine-induced signaling switch, some slices were exposed to 100 &#x000b5;M morphine plus 10 pM NLX. To determine whether NLX's protective effect occurs by binding to FLNA at FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub>, slices were incubated with morphine plus NLX with the addition of 10 &#x000b5;M FLNA<sub>2550&#x02013;2560</sub>, FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2570</sub>, or FLNA<sub>2566&#x02013;2575</sub>.
