We compared the translational regulation and polyadenylation of the cyclin B1 mRNA during zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation. Polyadenylation and translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA is well characterized during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation. Specifically, <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNA is polyadenylated and translationally activated during oocyte maturation by proteins that recognize the conserved AAUAAA hexanucleotide and U-rich Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Elements (CPEs) within cyclin B1 mRNA's 3'<bold>U</bold>n<bold>T</bold>ranslated <bold>R</bold>egion (3'<bold>UTR</bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA was polyadenylated during zebrafish oocyte maturation. Furthermore, the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA's 3'UTR was sufficient to stimulate translation of a reporter mRNA during zebrafish oocyte maturation. This stimulation required both AAUAAA and U-rich CPE-like sequences. However, in contrast to AAUAAA, the positions and sequences of the functionally defined CPEs were poorly conserved between <italic>Xenopus </italic>and zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs. To determine whether these differences were relevant to translation efficiency, we analyzed the translational activity of reporter mRNAs containing either the zebrafish or <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs during both zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation.

During this period of development translational mechanisms dictate when and how efficiently each maternal mRNA is translated into protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Many insights into these mechanisms come from studies of oocytes and eggs from the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. For example, mechanisms that control maternal mRNA translation during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation are well studied and involve the regulated addition of 3' poly (A) to stored mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is unclear, however, how conserved these mechanisms are at the level of individual mRNAs. An understanding of such conservation should provide insights into how differences in target mRNA sequences could affect translational regulation during maternally controlled development.</p><p>The specificity of maturation-specific polyadenylation of maternal mRNAs during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation is controlled by sequences within the 3'UTRs of these mRNAs called <bold>c</bold>ytoplasmic <bold>p</bold>olyadenylation <bold>e</bold>lements (CPEs). CPEs are binding sites for CPEB (<bold>CPE </bold><bold>b</bold>inding protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes CPEB binds other proteins, such as maskin that repress the translation of CPE-containing mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. During oocyte maturation CPEB phosphorylation stimulates its association with proteins that promote mRNA polyadenylation and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CPEB is highly conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that CPE-regulated polyadenylation and translational activation during development is a highly conserved mechanism. In addition, recent studies have reported that some <italic>Xenopus </italic>maternal mRNAs contain polyadenylation response elements (PRE) that direct CPEB independent polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but it is unclear whether PRE type polyadenylation occurs in organisms other than <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, aside from studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the mechanisms that control mRNA polyadenylation and translation during development in other vertebrate organisms have not been explored.</p><p>In this report we examine translational regulation of the maternal cyclin B1 mRNA during zebrafish oocyte maturation. Zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos offer many advantages for studying the maternal stages of vertebrate development. For example, maternal genes that regulate development have been identified in genetic screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the proteins encoded by these genes have provided insights into early vertebrate embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the mechanisms that govern maternal gene expression in zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos have not been explored. We chose to focus on cyclin B1 mRNA because its regulated polyadenylation and translation have been studied extensively during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation, and CPE-regulated translation is best characterized during this process. Using microinjection of reporter mRNAs into both zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes, we found that although translational regulation of both species' cyclin B1 mRNA was qualitatively similar, it differed quantitatively in terms of efficiency of both polyadenylation and translation. These quantitative differences were likely due distinctions between the 3'UTRs of zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNAs. These findings suggest that CPE-sequences and/or other aspects of 3'UTR sequence architecture evolved between species to modulate translational efficiency of maternal mRNAs, even those mRNAs that encode highly conserved proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA was polyadenylated during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis</title><p>Translation of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA is activated during oocyte maturation but the underlying mechanisms have not been examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, extensive analysis of <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNA has demonstrated that poly (A) addition regulates the translation of this mRNA during oocyte maturation. Therefore, we analyzed the polyadenylation state of the endogenous zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA during zebrafish oocyte maturation. For this analysis RNaseH treatment of purified RNA samples was used to sever the 3'UTR from the cyclin B1 mRNA and facilitate the direct detection of a 3' poly (A) tail by RNA blot hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. RNA isolated from oocytes, matured oocytes and two-cell embryos was hybridized to a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the cyclin B1 ORF (372 nucleotides 5' of the poly (A) addition site) and half of each sample was also hybridized to oligo-dT to remove poly (A) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Each sample was treated with RNaseH and analyzed subsequently by high resolution RNA blot hybridization with a radiolabeled probe complementary to the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR. The zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA from oocytes either lacked or possessed only an extremely short poly (A) tail as the size of the 3'UTR was by unaffected by the addition of oligo dT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <bold>lanes 1 and 2</bold>). In contrast, the cyclin B1 mRNA from matured oocytes and 2-cell embryos possessed a poly (A) tail that ranged from 50 to 150 nucleotides in length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. <bold>lanes 3 to 6</bold>). Similar results were obtained using RNA-ligated RT-PCR to measure poly (A) tails (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the endogenous zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA was polyadenylated during oocyte maturation coincident with its translational activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The endogenous zebrafish cyclinB1 mRNA is polyadenylated during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis</bold>.

A subset of <italic>Xenopus </italic>mRNAs are polyadenylated due to the presence of PRE (polyadenylation response elements) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs contain the highly conserved AAUAAA hexanucleotide within their 3' UTRs. AAUAAA is required for formation of the primary mRNA transcript's mature 3' end, which involves both the cleavage and polyadenylation of the newly synthesized transcript in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. AAUAAA is also required for the cytoplasmic polyadenylation that occurs on only a subset of maternal mRNAs during vertebrate development. This subset of mRNAs also contains CPEs. In contrast to AAUAAA, CPEs vary in terms of numbers, exact sequence and position within the 3'UTR. The canonical CPE sequence is UUUUAU, but the non-canonical sequences UUUUUCAU, UUUUAAU and UUUUACU can also direct cytoplasmic polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR contains four CPEs close to the AAUAAA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Mutations affecting either the AAUAAA sequence or all four CPEs abolish maturation specific polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mutation of any single CPE is not sufficient to abolish polyadenylation, suggesting some redundancy among these elements.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Polyadenylation of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTR depended upon U-rich CPE sequences</bold>.

M: RNA from mature oocytes. As controls, half of the total RNAs extracted from WT 3'UTR RNA injected matured oocytes were subjected to oligo dT/RNaseH treatment prior to denaturing PAGE (lane 4). The size reduction after oligo dT/RNaseH treatment indicated that the 3'UTR RNA was polyadenylated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-7-2"/></fig><p>To help define putative CPEs in the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR, we compared the cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs from zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Although cyclin B1 protein is highly conserved, the cyclin B1 mRNA's 3'UTRs exhibit very limited sequence identity (data not shown). Nevertheless, the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR contains two sequences of four contiguous U nucleotides positioned immediately 3' to AAUAAA. These characteristics, U-rich sequences close to AAUAAA are hallmarks of CPEs found in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). There is another U-rich sequence (UUUUAAU, position -66/-60), but since CPE function decreases significantly as the distance from the AAUAAA sequence increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] we focused on potential U-rich sequences closest to the hexanucleotide. To test whether the U-rich sequences in the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR functioned as CPEs, two radiolabeled 3'UTR RNAs (referred to as WT and CPE-MUT) were generated. The WT RNA contained the wild type 3'UTR and the CPE-Mut RNA contained UU to CG substitutions within each of the two putative CPEs in the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Both radiolabeled RNAs were injected into zebrafish oocytes and a fraction of injected oocytes were exposed to 7&#x003b1;, 20&#x003b2;-dihydroxyprogesterone to induce maturation, while the remaining fraction was left untreated. Oocyte maturation was monitored based on translucence, a defining characteristic of mature zebrafish oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). After maturation was complete, RNA was isolated from injected oocytes and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. A portion of the injected WT cyclin B1 3'UTR RNA increased in size during oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, <bold>lanes 2 and 3</bold>) due to the addition of a poly (A) as treatment with oligo-dT/RNaseH converted the high molecular weight species to the size of the injected RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, <bold>lane 4</bold>). In contrast, the CPE-MUT cyclin B1 3'UTR RNA was not polyadenylated during oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, <bold>lane 5&#x02013;7</bold>). These results suggested that the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR contained U-rich CPEs required for polyadenylation during oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>The zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTR was sufficient to activate translation during oocyte maturation in a CPE- and AAUAAA-dependent manner</title><p>To analyze the role of the cyclin B1 3'UTR on translational activation, a luciferase reporter mRNA fused to the 3'UTR of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA was generated (Luc-ZF cyclin B1-3'UTR-WT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The wild type reporter mRNA (Luc-ZF-cyclin B1-3'UTR-WT) was injected into zebrafish oocytes that were subsequently treated as described above for Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Extracts from the injected cells were assayed for luciferase activity. Changes in translational activity during oocyte maturation were expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity from matured oocytes to that from non-matured oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Translation of the wild type reporter mRNA (luc-ZF-cyclin B1-3'UTR-WT) was stimulated almost 9 fold during zebrafish oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This stimulation was specific for the cyclin B1 3'UTR as translation of other reporter mRNAs that contained no 3'UTR (Luc), or the cytoskeletal b-actin 3'UTR were not stimulated significantly during oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Thus, the 3'UTR of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA contained sequences that could activate translation during oocyte maturation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The 3'UTR of zebrafish cyclinB1 mRNA is sufficient to activate translation during zebrafish oocyte maturation and this activation requires the CPE and AAUAAA sequences</bold>.

This experiment was repeated twice and shown here are the absolute values of luciferase activity from one representative experiment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-7-3"/></fig><p>To test whether the same sequences required for zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA polyadenylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) were also required for translational activation, luciferase reporter mRNAs were generated that contained the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTRs in which the two CPE (luc-ZF-cyclin B1-CPE-Mut) or the AAUAAA (luc-ZF-cyclin B1-AAUAAA-Mut) sequences were mutated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> for specific mutations). Translational activity of these mutant reporter mRNAs was compared to the wild type reporter in zebrafish oocyte microinjection experiments as described above. Mutation of either the CPE sequences (luc-ZF-cyclin B1-CPE-Mut) or the AAUAAA (luc-ZF-cyclin B1-AAUAAA-Mut) that abolished zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA polyadenylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) significantly reduced the ability of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA's 3'UTR to stimulate translation of the luciferase reporter mRNA during oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the injected wild type, CPE-mutant and AAUAAA mutant reporter mRNAs were equally stable in mature and non-mature oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Therefore, the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR can activate mRNA translation during oocyte maturation and this activation depends upon the same CPE and AAUAAA sequences required for maturation-specific polyadenylation.</p><p>To directly assess the role of the poly (A) tail on translation in zebrafish oocytes, translation of two additional luciferase reporter mRNAs was measured in zebrafish oocytes. These reporters were identical except for the presence of a fifty-nucleotide 3' poly (A) tail. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Equal amounts of each mRNA were injected into separate groups of oocytes. The injected oocytes were cultured for six hours (these oocytes were not induced to mature) and then extracts prepared from these oocytes were assayed for luciferase activity. Translation of the reporter mRNA containing the poly (A) tail (LucA<sub>50</sub>) was significantly higher than that of the reporter mRNA lacking a poly (A) tail (Luc), indicating that presence of a poly (A) tail was sufficient to stimulate mRNA translation in zebrafish oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Therefore, 3' poly (A) is sufficient to enhance translation in zebrafish oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>The zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR was less efficiently polyadenylated and less effective at enhancing translation during either zebrafish or <italic>Xenopus oocyte </italic>maturation</title><p>The 3'UTRs of the zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNAs share little sequence similarity aside from the presence of CPEs and the AAUAAA hexanucleotide elements (data not shown and Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

For the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR-WT RNA, phosphoimager quantitation indicated that approximately 50% of the RNA is polyadenylated (data not shown) (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref><bold> lane 3 and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref><bold> lane 3</bold>). In addition, the same CPE sequences important for polyadenylation of cyclin B1 3'UTR during zebrafish oocyte maturation were also important during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref><bold> lanes 5&#x02013;7</bold>). In the converse experiment, we analyzed wild type and mutant versions of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR RNA during zebrafish oocyte maturation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR RNA was efficiently polyadenylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref><bold> lanes 1&#x02013;4</bold>, greater than 90% of the RNA is polyadenylated as determined by phosphoimager quantitation, data not shown) during zebrafish oocyte maturation, just as it is during <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Thus the differences in efficiency of cyclin B1 mRNA polyadenylation during <italic>Xenopus </italic>and zebrafish oocyte maturation resulted from differences between the <italic>Xenopus </italic>and zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Directing polyadenylation and activating translation during oocyte maturation are evolutionarily conserved functions of cyclin B1 3'UTRs</bold>.

Together these results indicate that differences in translational efficiency of cyclin B1 mRNA were due to sequence differences between the zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTRs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we examined the underlying mechanisms required for the translational activation of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA during zebrafish oocyte maturation. As expected based on extensive studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the zebrafish cyclin B1 was polyadenylated during maturation, coincident with its translational activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition the 3'UTR of this mRNA was sufficient to activate translation of a luciferase reporter mRNA microinjected into zebrafish oocytes induced to mature <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both polyadenylation and translational activation of relevant zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNAs required AAUAAA and CPE-like sequences. These data together with the analysis of cyclin B1 in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] revealed that the fundamental mechanisms underlying translational activation of the cyclin B1 mRNA in vertebrate organisms are conserved. However, despite this conservation, we found that the efficiency by which the highly conserved cyclin B1 mRNA was polyadenylated and translated during <italic>Xenopus </italic>and zebrafish oocyte maturation differed substantially between these two species. These differences were likely not due to differences in the polyadenylation and translational machinery between these two species oocytes, but rather to differences in the 3'UTRs of their respective cyclin B1 mRNAs. Thus, variations in 3'UTR sequences and architecture may contribute to controlling different species' needs for translational efficiency of individual mRNAs while relying on the same highly conserved protein components.</p><sec><title>CPE-recognition by CPEB and the zorba protein</title><p>The CPEB binds to CPE sequences in the 3'UTRs of <italic>Xenopus </italic>mRNAs to provide specificity for maturation-specific poly (A) addition for many maternal mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CPEB proteins bind CPEs via the RRM and zinc finger domains found at their C-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The zebrafish ortholog of CPEB is called zorba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The cyclin B1 3'UTRs from zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>activate mRNA translation during oocyte maturation in both their normal and heterologous contexts, suggesting that the <italic>Xenopus </italic>CPEB and zebrafish zorba proteins recognize the same RNA sequences to direct polyadenylation. The amino acid sequences of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>CPEB and zorba protein share 61% identity over the entire protein and 91% identity over the RRM and zinc finger domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This high degree of conservation is entirely consistent with the functional comparison of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>and zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTRs during both species' oocyte maturation processes reported here. The UUUUAAAG and UUUU sequences identified in the ZF cyclin B1 3' UTR suggest variant non-consensus CPEs, although we have not yet tested direct interaction with either CPEB or Zorba.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural and functional differences in the 3'UTRs of the cyclin B1 mRNAs</title><p>Our results indicate that structural differences between the zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs are responsible for the functional differences in each 3'UTR's ability to direct polyadenylation and activate translation of cyclin B1 mRNA. The sequences of the cyclin B1 mRNA 3'UTRs from zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>are quite different and exhibit little sequence identity (data not shown). And, even though both 3'UTRs contain CPEs the number and position of CPEs present in the two 3'UTRs differ (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR has two putative CPEs downstream of the AAUAAA hexanucleotide while the <italic>Xenopus </italic>3'UTR contains four CPEs, one downstream of the hexanucleotide and three upstream. In addition, pumilio binding elements (PBEs) present in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR direct translational repression in non-matured oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The 3'UTR of the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA lacks any obvious putative PBEs. Thus the number of CPEs present and their position relative to AAUAAA may dictate the efficiency of poly (A) addition and translation directed from a particular 3'UTR. This observation is consistent with the results of a recent mutational analysis of CPE function in <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similar differences in 3'UTR architecture are also observed comparing the 3'UTRs from other <italic>Xenopus </italic>mRNAs known to be polyadenylated during oocyte maturation to their zebrafish orthologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Putative CPEs are present in the zebrafish 3'UTRs as predicted, but the arrangement and number of putative CPEs and the presence of putative PBEs differ with each pair of 3'UTR orthologs. Based on our analysis of cyclin B1 mRNA, we predict that these differences will lead to differences in the efficiency of poly (A) addition and translation for each mRNA, potentially as predicted by Pique etal 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This regulatory strategy allows for individualized modes of translation to ensure that specific proteins are synthesized at the proper levels to meet the unique demands of each species of developing embryos. Interestingly, the zebrafish cyclin B1 mRNA is localized to the animal pole of oocytes and eggs. This localization confines the mRNA to the embryo blastodisc where synthesis of cyclin B1 protein directs cell division during development. In contrast, the cyclin B1 mRNA in <italic>Xenopus </italic>is not localized. The large size of <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs may require higher concentrations of cyclin B1 protein to drive early cell divisions. Such a need for producing higher concentrations of cyclin B1 protein could explain the observed differences in translational efficiency of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cyclin B1 3'UTR compared to the zebrafish cyclin B1 3'UTR.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>3'UTR orthologs from zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus </italic>contain similar sequence elements but different architectures</bold>.
