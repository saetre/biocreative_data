The Arg133Cys (R133C) mutation in the MBD, a Rett syndrome mutation that abolishes binding to methylated DNA, leads to only a slight reduction in the affinity of the MBD for four-way junctions, suggesting distinct but partially overlapping modes of binding to junction and methylated DNA. Binding to unmethylated DNA junctions is likely to involve a subset of the interactions that occur with methylated DNA. High-affinity, methylation-independent binding to four-way junctions is consistent with additional roles for MeCP2 in chromatin, beyond recognition of 5Me-CpG.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MeCP2 is an abundant vertebrate nuclear protein that binds preferentially to a symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotide site in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). It is abundant in pericentric heterochromatin, which has a high concentration of 5Me-CpG, but is also present throughout chromosomal arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Two functional domains have been identified within MeCP2 (human, 486 amino acid residues), each of &#x0223c;100 residues. A methyl binding domain (MBD) confers specificity for methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and has since been found in other members of the MBD family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>); the solution structures of the MBD of MeCP2 and of MBD1 have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and show a very similar fold. A transcriptional repression domain (TRD) in MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) functions by recruitment of the co-repressor Sin3A and a histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Other transcriptional co-repressors, such as Ski and N-CoR, can also be recruited by MeCP2 and function similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). MeCP2 can thus mediate repression of transcription through core histone deacetylation, which favours stable and transcriptionally inert chromatin, largely through effects at the level of higher-order structure (30 nm filament). This could provide a means of suppressing genome-wide transcriptional &#x02018;noise&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) but also performs a critical role in repression at specific loci such as imprinted genes [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>)], and pro-viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and other promoters, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A third, less well-defined, domain that specifies binding to Group II WW domain splicing factors was mapped to the C-terminal region (residues 325&#x02013;486) of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Mutations in all three domains have been found in Rett syndrome patients (InterRett-IRSA Phenotype Database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ichr.uwa.edu.au/rett/irsa/"/>).</p><p>Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A do not fully relieve the repressive effects of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) suggesting another, deacetylation-independent, pathway for MeCP2-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). One possibility is that MeCP2 sequesters transcription factors or occludes their access to the polymerase, but it is also clear that MeCP2 is able to bind to unmethylated DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, albeit with lower affinity than to methylated DNA [although only 2- to 3-fold fold lower in the case of mouse MeCP2 binding to oligonucleotides, measured by capillary electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>)]. Another possibility, therefore, is that MeCP2 plays a methylation-independent structural role in chromatin, e.g. in stabilizing a repressive structure such as the 30 nm filament formed by folding of the 10 nm nucleosome filament, or even more stable structures based on this. Several (unrelated) observations support an uncoupling of repression by MeCP2 from DNA methylation. First, the chicken protein ARBP (attachment region binding protein), believed to be the chicken MeCP2 homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), interacts preferentially <italic>in vitro</italic> with (unmethylated) nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) as well as with (unmethylated) chicken and mouse satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). A 25-residue sequence containing an &#x02018;AT-hook&#x02019; motif (-GRGRGRPK-) located between the MBD and the TRD appears to be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Second, MeCP2 has been shown recently to condense unmethylated, H1-deficient, reconstituted nucleosomal arrays, which then self-associate to form &#x02018;oligomeric chromatin suprastructures&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Third, the presence of MeCP2 and dimethylation of H3K9 at a promoter are sufficient to silence it, in the absence of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>Methylation-independent MeCP2-mediated repression of transcription from chromatin might occur by stabilization of nucleosomes and/or chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), in a functionally similar manner to stabilization by H1. The detailed mode of interaction of H1 and MeCP2 might be different, although there is circumstantial evidence that they may have overlapping binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). H1 binds asymmetrically to the nucleosome, close to the dyad axis, contacting two DNA duplexes through its globular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). It also binds in a structure-specific manner to four-way DNA junctions through its globular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), most probably because a pair of junction arms mimics two juxtaposed duplexes in the nucleosome. Here we investigate the binding of MeCP2 and its MBD to four-way junction DNA, and compare this with binding to methylated DNA, as one approach towards assessing the potential of MeCP2 to mediate effects through chromatin-dependent, structure-specific, methylation-independent interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of MeCP2 and its MBD</title><p>Plasmid pET17bMeCP2 (generated by D.

With MeCP2 a complex was first apparent at 5 nM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4); the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the interaction (in 150 mM NaCl) is 20&#x02013;40 nM (lanes 6 and 7). The MBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) behaved very similarly, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (in 125 mM NaCl) of 20&#x02013;40 nM (lanes 5 and 6). The lower mobility bands observed at the two highest protein concentrations in the absence of competitor are most probably owing to weaker, non-structure-specific binding of MBD and MeCP2 to additional sites on the junction arms. The H1 and H5 globular domains, and HMGB1, which bind to a pair of juxtaposed arms and the cross-over in the four-way junction, respectively, show similar secondary binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). A 75-fold molar excess of sheared <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA reduced binding of both MeCP2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) and the MBD (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 7 and 8, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) by roughly 50%, but even in the presence of a 225-fold molar excess of competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, lanes 9 and 10) binding was not abolished. The very similar behaviour of MeCP2 and its MBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A&#x02013;D</xref>) suggests that the interaction of MeCP2 with four-way junction DNA is mediated through high-affinity binding of the MBD, with little contribution from other regions of the protein.</p><p>In gel-shift assays with a 17 bp singly methylated duplex, there was a single complex; the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was 10&#x02013;20 nM in 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), similar to that of the MBD for four-way junctions under the same conditions (&#x0223c;20&#x02013;40 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No additional lower mobility bands were observed at the higher protein concentrations in this case, further suggesting that the additional bands with four-way junctions are due to protein&#x02013;DNA interactions with the junction arms, rather than protein&#x02013;protein interactions between added and bound MBD [which, like MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), is monomeric when free in solution (data not shown)]. MBD binds to the corresponding unmethylated 17 bp duplex under the same conditions with much lower affinity, as expected, and the complexes are much less stable (data not shown). The DNA-binding properties of the MBD were further investigated by comparing its ability to bind <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 17 bp DNA (both methylated and unmethylated) and four-way junction DNA in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of 17 bp competitor DNA that was either unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&#x02013;D</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7) or methylated (lanes 8&#x02013;13). Only the methylated competitor competed effectively for binding of the MBD to the radiolabelled methylated 17 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or to the four-way junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), but even in the presence of the competitor strong binding persisted at the higher concentrations of MBD (80 nM and above). The weaker binding to the unmethylated probe was completely abolished when the competitor was methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and largely abolished even by unmethylated competitor. Thus the MBD of MeCP2 interacts structure-specifically with (unmethylated) four-way junction DNA in conditions in which it does not bind to unmethylated linear DNA, and it binds four-way junction DNA with 15 bp arms and singly methylated DNA of 17 bp with similar affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>Overlapping binding sites for methylated and four-way junction DNA</title><p>The Rett syndrome mutation R133C in MeCP2 disrupts binding of the MBD to methylated DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). To test whether there was overlap between the interactions involved in methyl CpG-dependent binding of the MBD to linear DNA and structure-specific binding to four-way junctions, binding of the R133C MBD mutant to four-way junction DNA and methylated DNA was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The affinity of the R133C mutant was only slightly lower (&#x0223c;2-fold) than that of wild-type MBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, binding to singly methylated 17 bp DNA was severely impaired and in the presence of a 20-fold excess of 17 bp methylated DNA was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); there was no binding to unmethylated 17 bp DNA (data not shown). The binding site for interaction of the MBD with methylated duplex DNA must thus be largely distinct from the binding site(s) for four-way junctions, but there might be some overlap between the sites. Virtually identical near-UV CD spectra for the wild-type MBD and the R133C mutant (data not shown) indicate that the differences in methylated DNA binding are not a result of any significant conformational change introduced by the mutation, as indicated also by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main conclusion from the results reported here is that MeCP2, as well as its isolated MBD, binds to four-way junction DNA in a structure-specific, methyl-CpG-independent manner. The affinity for the junction is similar to that for methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Double-stranded competitor DNA, whether methylated or unmethylated, had only a small effect on junction binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but abolished binding to the unmethylated probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), showing that the interaction with four-way junction DNA is specific. Mutation of a methyl-CpG binding residue [R133C, a Rett syndrome mutation that essentially abolishes binding to methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>] reduces binding to four-way junction DNA by only &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting largely distinct, but possibly overlapping, binding sites for the two DNA substrates. Formation of MeCP2-dependent &#x02018;oligomeric chromatin suprastructures&#x02019; <italic>in vitro</italic> from reconstituted unmethylated nucleosomal arrays, like four-way junction binding, also appears not to be affected by the R133C mutation in MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In other words, MeCP2 has a methyl-CpG-dependent binding mode and a methylation-independent chromatin binding mode which, in an array of MeCP2-containing nucleosomes, leads to chromatin condensation. Certain features of chromatin binding may be reflected in binding of MeCP2 to four-way junctions.</p><p>MeCP2 forms &#x02018;tramline&#x02019; complexes with long DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Complexes of this type have been demonstrated previously for the linker histones H1 and H5 and their isolated globular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and in those cases, like binding of the proteins to the juxtaposed duplexes of four-way junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), are taken to reflect the existence of two DNA-binding sites on opposite faces of the globular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>); the existence of two sites was supported by mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). In the nucleosome the two binding sites engage with two duplexes in the general vicinity of the dyad axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Since MeCP2, like H1 and H5, assembles linear DNA into tramlines and binds selectively to four-way junctions, it seems possible that it, too, might bind two DNA duplexes, perhaps (but not necessarily) binding similarly to H1 and H5. However, if MeCP2 does contact two DNA strands, it remains to be determined whether the two binding sites are on the MBD, since the ability of the MBD to form tramlines was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The detailed mode of binding of MeCP2 to DNA and chromatin remains to be investigated. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that MeCP2 and H1 may have overlapping binding sites in chromatin. Addition of MeCP2 to methylated plasmid DNA that had been assembled into chromatin in a <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extract and reconstituted with H1 displaced some (40%) of the bound H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), although if the nucleosome occupancy of the DNA was not complete, it is possible that the displaced H1 was bound not to nucleosomes but to stretches of naked DNA. However, if MeCP2 does bind at, or in such a way that it overlaps, a linker histone binding site, in contrast to H1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) it does not lead to protection of chromatosomes (containing 166 bp DNA) <italic>in vitro</italic> during micrococcal nuclease digestion (A. Sanderson and J. O. Thomas, unpublished data). It does confer protection from DNase I digestion on a methylated CpG at the dyad axis of a nucleosome assembled on methylated 5S rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), but this is presumably due to methylation-dependent binding rather than structure-specific recognition, since there was no protection against DNase I digestion when the DNA was not methylated. Moreover, despite tramline formation by MeCP2 it remains possible that the feature in four-way junctions that is recognized by MeCP2 and its MBD is not a pair of juxtaposed duplexes <italic>per se</italic>, but the distortion at the cross-over of the duplexes where bases are unstacked, e.g. as is the case for HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><sec><title>What might be the basis of the interaction of the MBD of MeCP2 with unmethylated DNA?</title><p>Molecular details of the interaction of the highly homologous (46% identical) MBD of MBD1 with methylated DNA are known from an NMR structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>); similar interactions are inferred for the MBD of MeCP2, based on chemical shift changes in the protein on binding to methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The MBD in both MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and MBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) is a wedge-shaped &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; sandwich, with a C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix. In the complex of the MBD (of MBD1) with methylated DNA, the anti-parallel three-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet fits into the major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). The buried interface is relatively small (810 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), consistent with the ability of MeCP2 to bind to methylated nucleosomal DNA without nucleosomal disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Recognition of the two methyl CpGs takes place, asymmetrically, through hydrophobic and polar interactions in a pocket formed by six residues in &#x003b2;-strands 2 and 3 (&#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3) and loops 1 and 2 (L1 and L2). These residues are Val20 (in &#x003b2;2), Arg22 (L1), Asp32 (&#x003b2;3), Tyr34 (&#x003b2;3), Arg44 (L2) and Ser45 (L2). In addition there are extensive contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone, including phosphate contacts with arginine or lysine residues in loops L1 and L2 and with the N-terminus of helix &#x003b1;1. Most of the residues involved in MBD1 are conserved in MeCP2. A subset of the interactions, e.g. involving the phosphates and sugars but possibly also those involving residues in the pocket that normally binds 5Me-CpG, is likely to account for the binding of MeCP2 to non-methylated DNA. However, the higher-affinity preferential binding to four-way DNA junctions relative to unmethylated linear DNA implies additional, structure-specific interactions with junction DNA (and possibly the ability to satisfy two DNA-binding sites intramolecularly), the nature of which is not yet clear.</p><p>There are three unrelated &#x003b2;-sheet proteins/domains with a C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix that exhibit conserved features of DNA binding to the major groove of (unmethylated) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>): the I-PpoI homing endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), the DNA-binding domain of the Tn916 integrase [Tn916Int (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>)], and the DNA-binding domain of the GCC-box binding protein AtERF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). In these cases the &#x003b2;-sheet lies flat in the major groove, rather than being twisted as in the MBD of MBD1, as noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Although the proteins have no overall sequence homology there are striking similarities between the MBD1 contacts with methylated DNA and the Tn916Int contacts with unmethylated DNA. Key protein&#x02013;DNA contacts involve identical or similar amino acids at corresponding positions in the &#x003b2;-sheets and loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; see legend for details). We suggest that similar considerations are likely to apply to the binding of the MBD of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, top line) to unmethylated DNA. The similarities in key residues between the methylated-DNA-binding MBD1 and the other proteins, whose DNA-binding sites are not methylated, suggests that the MBD of MeCP2 (and presumably of MBD1) could interact with unmethylated DNA using a subset of the contacts used to bind to methylated DNA.</p><p>Whatever the details of the interaction of the MBD of MeCP2 with four-way junction DNA, it represents high-affinity, methylation-independent binding to a DNA structure that is accepted as mimicking certain features of DNA architecture around the dyad axis of the nucleosome. This mode of binding may be related to the ability of MeCP2 to condense extended arrays of unmethylated nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Further investigation of the interaction of MeCP2 with unmethylated DNA and chromatin is in progress in order to define any direct role it may play in chromatin structure and function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Adrian Bird for plasmids containing the rat MeCP2 and MBD cDNA inserts and David Pate for constructing p17bMeCP2.

Val20 and Leu26, shown in italics, make van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of a methyl cytosine (MBD1) or a thymine (Tn916), respectively. The MBDs of MeCP2 (top line) and MBD1 are highly homologous; Arg18, Arg22 and Tyr34 in MBD1 all correspond to similar or identical residues in MeCP2 (Lys107, Arg111 and Tyr123).
