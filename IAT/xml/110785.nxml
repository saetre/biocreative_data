Subsequent isolation and characterisation of the corresponding genes from fission yeast, <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mammals also support a replication role for the protein in these species. They further suggest that during the course of its function cdc45 interacts with a number of other replication proteins, including minichromosome maintenance proteins, the origin recognition complex and DNA polymerase <bold>&#x003b1;</bold>. We have cloned the gene coding for cdc45 protein from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We have analysed the expression pattern of the cdc45 protein throughout the cell cycle and the life cycle using a combination of indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. Our data show that cellular localisation and developmental regulation of the protein is consistent with a role in DNA replication. DmCdc45 is predominantly expressed in proliferating cells. In addition, its subcellular location is nuclear during interphase and the protein shows association with chromatin. The chromatin-associated form of the protein shows a post-translational modification, which may be involved in control of the action of the protein. DmCdc45 shows interactions with mcm proteins, however, the interactions detected show some specificity, perhaps suggesting a preferential association with particular mcm proteins. In addition we show that a stoichiometric mcm interaction may not be obligatory for the function of cdc45 in follicle cell replication, because, unlike the mcm proteins, DmCdc45 localises to the chorion amplification foci in the follicle cells of the ovary.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Initiation of DNA replication requires the temporally ordered interaction of a number of protein complexes at origins of replication. For higher eukaryotes the proposed pathway of&#x000a0;protein interactions is mainly based on data obtained from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In early G<sub>1</sub> a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) is found at origins of replication, components of which include: the origin recognition complex (ORC), the six member complex which specifically recognises the origin sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c2">2</xref>); cdc6 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c3">3</xref>); the minichromosome maintenance (mcm) protein family. As G<sub>1</sub> progresses, loading of additional proteins is required to initiate DNA replication. One of these proteins is cdc45, which binds after START but before the initiation of DNA synthesis and has been proposed to be necessary for loading of DNA polymerase &#x003b1;.</p><p>cdc45 was originally identified in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> as a cold-sensitive cell cycle mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c4">4</xref>). At the restrictive temperature the <italic>cdc45-1</italic> mutant arrests in interphase with unreplicated DNA. More precise mapping of the timing of the requirement for cdc45 suggests that it is not loaded at the same time as components of the pre-RC but is loaded onto the chromatin at a later stage, prior to the initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c5">5</xref>). cdc45 has also been shown to be needed at each replication fork individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c6">6</xref>). In addition to the replication defect, <italic>cdc45-1</italic> mutants display increased recombination and chromosome loss at the semi-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c7">7</xref>). The <italic>ScCdc45</italic> gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 74.2 kDa and a protein sequence containing no significant homology to any other protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Genetic interactions with other replication-related proteins have been identified. Allele-specific suppression of the <italic>cdc45-1</italic> mutant phenotype was observed with <italic>cdc46-1</italic> (<italic>mcm5</italic>) and <italic>cdc47-1</italic> (<italic>mcm7</italic>), but not <italic>cdc46-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c7">7</xref>), and synthetic lethality was observed with <italic>orc2-1</italic>, <italic>mcm2-1</italic> and <italic>mcm3-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c10">10</xref>). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed interactions with ScCdc46p and ScCdc47p, although it appears that ScCdc45p is a component of only a subset of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c11">11</xref>). Additional evidence for an interaction with ScCdc47p has come from two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c11">11</xref>). ScCdc45 has also been shown to interact with other replication-related proteins. Experiments with a <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> double mutant strain with a cold-sensitive cdc45 and a temperature-sensitive cdc7 allele show that each is dependent on the other to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c12">12</xref>). A cell cycle-dependent interaction between cdc45 and mcm2 has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c5">5</xref>). In addition, loading of cdc45 onto chromatin requires functional cdc28 and is reduced in <italic>cdc6</italic> and <italic>mcm2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Proteins with homology to cdc45 have been identified from several eukaryotic species, including Tsd-2 from <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c13">13</xref>), <italic>sna41</italic> in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c14">14</xref>), <italic>XCdc45</italic> in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c15">15</xref>), Cdc45l in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c16">16</xref>) and CDC45L in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c17">17</xref>). The behaviour of the cdc45 homologues from these species is also consistent with the protein having a role in replication. A mutant allele of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> homologue <italic>sna41</italic> suppresses the phenotype of the MCM mutant <italic>nda4-108</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c14">14</xref>). The human homologue, which maps to the critical region for Di George syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c17">17</xref>), is&#x000a0;maximally expressed at the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S transition and the protein co-immunoprecipitates with Orc2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c17">17</xref>). Finally, in <italic>X.laevis</italic> replication extracts, loading of XCdc45 onto chromatin is controlled by cdk2 and depletion of the protein reduces DNA synthesis by 90&#x00025; and prevents recruitment of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; onto the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c14">14</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a sequence from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> with homology to cdc45. Using antisera raised against the recombinant protein we have examined expression of the protein during development and its cellular distribution at different points in the cell cycle and in developing egg chambers. These observations suggest that, as in other species, DmCdc45 is involved in normal cellular replication. In addition, they suggest a role for the protein in DNA amplification. We further present our analysis of the physical interactions that DmCdc45 makes with various other proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequencing of DmCdc45</title><p>The translated GenBank EST database was screened with the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cdc45p sequence using BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c18">18</xref>).

Comparisons of the translated sequence to other cdc45-related sequences are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f1">1</xref>. The greatest similarities are with the predicted cdc45 sequences from human (39.5&#x00025;), mouse (38.3&#x00025;) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (39&#x00025;). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein is of a similar size to cdc45 in these species, in contrast to <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, where it is 74.5 kDa. Regions of strong conservation are apparent along the length of the protein, most notably between amino acids 18 and 58 and 212 and 248, as well as the C-terminal region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f1">1</xref>). Two features present in cdc45 from other species are also conserved in DmCdc45. Between amino acids 135 and 163 is an acidic domain with a poorly conserved primary sequence (unbroken line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f1">1</xref>). Following this region is a mostly basic domain, with similarity to a bipartite nuclear localisation signal (broken line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f1">1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate possible cell cycle regulation of DmCdc45 transcription, the region immediately upstream of the coding region was analysed for the presence of binding sites for cell cycle-related transcription factors. The FlyBase <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequence database was screened with the 5&#x02032;-end of the cDNA sequence. A single cosmid (ID no. 69D5) was identified and obtained from the HGMP Resource Centre. A 1.1 kb <italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment containing the presumed 5&#x02032;-UTR was identified within this cosmid by Southern blotting. A single recognition site for the transcription factor E2F was found, suggesting possible cell cycle regulation of transcription. However, no sites for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell cycle-related transcription factor DREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c22">22</xref>) were identified within 1 kb of the start of the coding region.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>Drosophila cdc45</italic> gene localises to the X chromosome</title><p>The gene encoding DmCdc45 was localised to a single location on the X chromosome, location 1E&#x02013;F, by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation of the cloned cDNA PCR product to polytene chromosomes (data not shown), confirming that <italic>DmCdc45</italic> is a single copy gene.</p></sec><sec><title>DmCdc45 is highly expressed in the early embryo</title><p>DNA replication occurs very rapidly and from frequently spaced origins in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c23">23</xref>). Therefore, replication-related proteins would be expected to be present in relatively large amounts at this stage, due to maternal input of protein or RNA. In order to test this, polyclonal antisera were raised against a cdc45&#x02013;hexahistidine fusion protein. Antiserum from one rabbit detected both the overexpressed protein and a single band of &#x0223c;65.5 kDa in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extracts (data not shown).</p><p>Using this antibody, expression of DmCdc45 protein was examined on immunoblots of extracts from embryos, larvae, pupae and adult flies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f2">2</xref>, upper), with anti-tubulin as a control for equal loading (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f2">2</xref>, lower). Highest levels of DmCdc45 were detected in 0&#x02013;4 h embryos, when DNA replication is occurring rapidly, and then decreased as the embryos aged. The protein was still detectable in embryos up to 16&#x02013;20 h old, but was below detectable levels in mixed stage larvae, in pupae and in adult males. Many replication proteins also show marked increases in adult females due to the production of proteins that are maternally input into the embryo. DmCdc45 levels were increased in females, however, the relative increase was lower for this protein than for other replication proteins since it could only be detected on overloaded gels or after long exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f2">2</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec><title>DmCdc45 shows physical interactions with a subset of DmMcm proteins</title><p>Genetic and physical interactions between cdc45 and mcm proteins, orc proteins and DNA polymerase have variously been reported in yeast, <italic>Xenopus</italic> and humans.

Approximately half of all the DmCdc45 was present in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f4">4</xref>). This could represent localisation of DmCdc45 into that subcellular compartment but may also be due to the remnants of maternal input of this protein. Half of the remaining DmCdc45 appeared to be nucleoplasmic, as it could be removed by lysing the nuclei with 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f4">4</xref>). Nearly all of the remaining chromatin-bound DmCdc45 could be washed off by the addition of 250 mM NaCl (lane 3) to the Triton X-100-washed chromatin pellet.</p><p>Three bands were detected in the 250 mM NaCl wash, the 65.5 kDa band, a band of equal intensity migrating &#x0223c;4 kDa higher and a much weaker band at 74 kDa. Binding to the upper bands could be competed by preincubating the antibody with overexpressed DmCdc45, suggesting that they may be related to DmCdc45. The relationship of these slower migrating bands to cdc45 is not yet clear, however, they were not removed by treatment of the fraction with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or &#x003bb; protein phosphatase, although both of these were able to remove the phosphate groups from cdc2 (data not shown). In addition, searching of EST databases failed to reveal alternatively spliced forms of the protein similar to those seen with mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The subcellular distribution of DmCdc45 changes during the cell cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos</title><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cdc45 is nuclear throughout the cell cycle.

In late prophase DmCdc45 was present in the nucleus but did not appear to be associated with chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f5">5</xref>B and B&#x02032;). DmCdc45 staining disappeared in metaphase and remained absent until late anaphase or telophase, when DmCdc45 was again seen in the nucleus, co-localising with the histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f5">5</xref>C and C&#x02032;). A similar pattern was observed in later embryos, in which cells were dividing asynchronously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f5">5</xref>D and D&#x02032;).</p><p>Incubation of fixed embryos with IgG depleted of anti-cdc45 antibodies by preincubation with immobilised bacterially expressed protein produced no signal (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The pattern of DmCdc45 staining in follicle cells is stage specific and consistent with an amplification role</title><p>It has been previously reported that the distribution of DmOrc1 and DmOrc2 in follicle cells changes during follicle cell development and its location partially coincides with foci of amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c25">25</xref>). The formation of orc staining foci occurs at stage 10A, prior to the detection of BrdU incorporation at sites of amplification. To determine if DmCdc45 behaves in a similar fashion, the cellular location of DmCdc45 in stage 9 and 10 follicle cells was examined. We observed a pattern of staining similar to that previously observed for DmOrc1 and DmOrc2. At stage 9 DmCdc45 staining was observed as a ring of uniform staining within the nucleus of all follicle cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f6">6</xref>A and A&#x02032;). In stage 10A follicle cells staining was confined to between one and three foci, with the majority of cells having two major foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f6">6</xref>B and B&#x02032;). By stage 10B a single, brighter focus was observed in nearly all cells, often in conjunction with a second, much weaker staining area (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f6">6</xref>C and C&#x02032;). This is similar to the pattern seen for DmOrc5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd570f6">6</xref>D) and suggests that cdc45 is also localised to amplification foci in ovaries.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified an ORF from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> with homology to the DNA replication protein cdc45. Analysis of the primary structure of the protein showed that it contains the two domains that are conserved in all known cdc45 homologues, confirming the validity of its assignment as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cdc45 homologue. Although the exact function of these regions is not known, mutation analysis of the corresponding region in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> has suggested that it contains a nuclear localisation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c9">9</xref>). Of the cdc45 homologues that are known, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein most closely resembles vertebrate cdc45, being of a similar length and having &#x0223c;40&#x00025; similarity. The presence in the 5&#x02032; upstream region of a putative binding site for the cell cycle-regulated transcription factor E2F also suggests that DmCdc45, like the vertebrate homologues, may be subject to cell cycle regulation of transcription.</p><p>Another feature of cdc45 homologues identified in other species is that they show physical and genetic interactions with other replication proteins. Human CDC45L can be co-immunoprecipitated with orc2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c17">17</xref>) and an interaction between DmCdc45 and DNA polymerase &#x003b1; has been observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> replication extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c14">14</xref>). We have not been able to detect an interaction of DmCdc45 with either of these proteins. Interestingly, the interaction with DNA polymerase &#x003b1; is also not observed in immunoprecipitations in yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c26">26</xref>). At this stage we are not sure whether these observations represent differences between species or simply reflect an intrinsic instability of cdc45 complexes in soluble extracts.</p><p>The interactions occurring with the mcm family of proteins do, however, seem to be conserved between species. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> genetic interactions between ScCdc45 and mcm3, 5 and 7 have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c8">8</xref>). In addition, ScCdc45 has been identified as a component of mcm complexes along with ScMcm5 and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c11">11</xref>). We have observed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cdc45 homologue also interacts with mcm proteins. However, some variations are seen in the degree of interaction detected with individual family members. This might reflect a hierarchy of interaction with different mcms or subcomplexes thereof. Alternatively, this could again be due to the instability of soluble DmCdc45 complexes. Instability of complexes would also explain why we do not see more than 5&#x00025; of each protein involved in interactions. However, similar results would also be obtained if frequent, stable interactions between cdc45 and the mcm proteins only occur when the proteins are bound to chromatin.</p><p>The interaction with the mcm proteins suggests that DmCdc45 is involved in replication of the cellular DNA. Further evidence that this is the case comes from our examination of the distribution of DmCdc45 in different stages of the cell cycle. DmCdc45 appears to enter the nucleus during anaphase&#x0002f;telophase and co-localise with chromatin during interphase, dissociating again prior to mitosis. Similar cell cycle-dependent distribution patterns have been observed for other <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins known to be involved in DNA replication, such as DmMcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c27">27</xref>) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c28">28</xref>). This pattern is also similar to that seen for human cdc45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c17">17</xref>) and is fully consistent with a role for cdc45 in DNA replication. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cdc45p apparently remains in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c11">11</xref>), however, data obtained from chromatin fractionation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c5">5</xref>) suggest that cdc45 only associates with chromatin in interphase, which is again consistent with the changes that we observed in cellular localisation. Our immunofluorescence data are also consistent with data that we have obtained on the location of DmCdc45 using subcellular fractionation. These studies indicate that a proportion of the DmCdc45 protein is chromatin bound. Interestingly they also suggest that the chromatin-bound fraction might be modified in some way. We have not found evidence for an alternatively spliced form of the protein. In addition, the modification cannot be removed by two different types of phosphatase. Therefore, the nature of the modification remains unclear, however, the observation that it only occurs in chromatin-bound cdc45 suggests that the modification may be important in controlling the action of the protein.</p><p>Perhaps even more suggestive of a role for cdc45 in replication is its behaviour in the follicle cells of the ovary during oogenesis. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, ovarian follicle cells undergo cycles of endoreduplication leading to polyploidy. Following these cycles, clusters of chorion genes encoding eggshell proteins are further replicated, becoming amplified up to 80-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c29">29</xref>). It has been previously shown that some proteins required for normal DNA replication are also required for chorion gene amplification. Mutations in orc2 and the transcription factor heterodimer E2F&#x0002f;DP affect chorion gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c30">30</xref>), as does overexpression or inhibition of cyclin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c31">31</xref>). In addition, DmOrc1 and 2 form foci in 10A and 10B follicle cells prior to and during the period when chorion gene amplification occurs. Foci of orc staining correspond to sites of BrdU incorporation during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c25">25</xref>). We observed similar foci of DmCdc45 staining in follicle cells. Like the DmOrc2 foci, DmCdc45 foci initially appear at stage 10A and in stage 10B they become further defined, thus suggesting a role for DmCdc45 in the DNA replication required for amplification. This is intriguing given that similar patterns are not observed with DmMcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c21">21</xref>), with which cdc45 interacts and which is required for efficient loading of cdc45 onto chromatin in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd570c10">10</xref>). This suggests a role of the cdc45 protein in follicle cell replication which may be independent of a stoichiometric interaction with the mcm proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd570f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Clustal X alignment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dm), human (Hs), <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Xl) and yeast (Sc) cdc45 amino acid sequences.
