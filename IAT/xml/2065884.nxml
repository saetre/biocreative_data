Dominant white (<italic>W</italic>) is one of several known depigmentation phenotypes in horses. It shows considerable phenotypic variation, ranging from &#x0223c;50&#x00025; depigmented areas up to a completely white coat. In the horse, the four depigmentation phenotypes roan, sabino, tobiano, and dominant white were independently mapped to a chromosomal region on ECA 3 harboring the <italic>KIT</italic> gene. KIT plays an important role in melanoblast survival during embryonic development. We determined the sequence and genomic organization of the &#x0223c;82 kb equine <italic>KIT</italic> gene. A mutation analysis of all 21 <italic>KIT</italic> exons in white Franches-Montagnes Horses revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 15 (c.2151C&#x0003e;G, p.Y717X). We analyzed the <italic>KIT</italic> exons in horses characterized as dominant white from other populations and found three additional candidate causative mutations. Three almost completely white Arabians carried a different nonsense mutation in exon 4 (c.706A&#x0003e;T, p.K236X). Six Camarillo White Horses had a missense mutation in exon 12 (c.1805C&#x0003e;T, p.A602V), and five white Thoroughbreds had yet another missense mutation in exon 13 (c.1960G&#x0003e;A, p.G654R). Our results indicate that the dominant white color in Franches-Montagnes Horses is caused by a nonsense mutation in the <italic>KIT</italic> gene and that multiple independent mutations within this gene appear to be responsible for dominant white in several other modern horse populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>White horses have always been highly valued by their human owners. Their important role in history is reflected by their widespread use as heraldic animals (e.g., on the flags of the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia). In the Swiss Franches-Montagnes Horse population, a completely white mare named Cigale was born out of solid brown parents in 1957. The white phenotype is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and all living white Franches-Montagnes Horses are descendants of Cigale. We sequenced the <italic>KIT</italic> gene in white and solid-colored Franches-Montagnes Horses and found a mutation that inactivates the gene product and thus leads to a lack of pigment-forming cells in the skin of white horses. We then analyzed white horses from other populations and found three additional independent candidate causative mutations in white Thoroughbreds, Arabians, and Camarillo White Horses. The research thus revealed independent mutation events leading to white coat color in different horse populations. Our findings will allow genetic testing and a more precise classification of horses with white coat color.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Haase B, Brooks SA, Schlumbaum A, Azor PJ, Bailey E, et al.

Caused by the absence of melanocytes from the depigmented skin areas, expressivity can range from &#x0223c;50&#x00025; depigmented areas up to a nearly completely white coat. In contrast to horses with grey coat color (<italic>G</italic>), which are characterized by progressive greying of the hair, white horses show the depigmentation at birth and have a depigmented skin. Eyes are normally pigmented in dominant white horses, probably due to the different origin of the retinal melanocytes, which develop from local neuroectoderm and not from the neural crest, as do the skin melanocytes. In various horse breeds, cases of white or almost white horses born out of solid-colored parents have been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Some breed registries have restrictions towards this phenotype, or do not allow the phenotype to be registered. In the Franches-Montagnes Horse population white horses are known and reported to trace back to the white founder mare Cigale, born in 1957 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. The Camarillo White Horses, which have a similar depigmentation phenotype, represent another famous line of horses that can be traced back to the white founder stallion Sultan, born in 1912 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. According to anecdotal reports from breeders, the dominant white phenotype appears to have originated independently on several occasions in Thoroughbreds. The white coat color phenotype is inherited as a monogenic autosomal dominant trait. In one study, white horses were shown to be obligate heterozygous (<italic>W/&#x0002b;</italic>), as the <italic>W/W</italic> genotype was hypothesized to cause early embryonal lethality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In horses, the four depigmentation phenotypes roan, sabino-1, tobiano, and dominant white were independently mapped to a region on equine Chromosome 3 (ECA 3) harboring the <italic>KIT</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

The tobiano spotting pattern is caused by a large chromosomal inversion that disrupts a potential regulatory element downstream of the <italic>KIT</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

KIT contains an extracellular domain composed of five immunoglobulin domains, a single transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular protein kinase domain that is interrupted by an insertion of about 80 amino acids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The KIT ligand (KITL), also called stem cell factor (SCF), binds to KIT via the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin domains. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, thereby activating the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain through transphosphorylation and further signal transduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. KIT has the potential to participate in multiple signaling pathways, which accounts for its important role in the control of cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and motility. A complete loss of function of KIT causes prenatal or perinatal lethality due to anemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. KIT signaling is crucial for the development and survival of melanoblasts, mast cells, spermatogonia, and the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Receptor-inactivating point mutations in the <italic>KIT</italic> gene often act dominantly or semidominantly and are associated with hypopigmentation, anemia, and/or sterility. The dominant or semidominant inheritance is either due to haploinsufficiency or to the fact that mutated KIT receptors may form heterodimers with wild-type KIT receptors and thus act fully or partially dominant negative. Inactivating KIT mutations cause piebaldism in humans and white or spotted <italic>W</italic> mutants in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Only one of the 15 polymorphisms showed perfect cosegregation of the genotypes with the dominant white phenotype in the initial family. The cosegregating polymorphism was a C-to-G transversion located in exon 15 (c.2151C&#x0003e;G), which introduced a premature stop codon in the open reading frame of the KIT protein (p.Y717X).

As the mutation represents a nonsense mutation, which leads to the truncation of the functionally important second half of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the KIT protein, it seems justified to assume that this mutation severely affects KIT function. Furthermore, the perfect association of this mutation with the dominant white phenotype in cohorts of 20 white and 112 solid-colored Franches-Montagnes Horses corroborates the causative role of the c.2151C&#x0003e;G mutation. The observed association would also be compatible with a scenario of a closely adjacent causative mutation, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the c.2151C&#x0003e;G mutation. However, we regard this as very unlikely, as we can rule out any mutations in the other exons of the <italic>KIT</italic> gene. Therefore, it would be difficult to postulate a different causative mutation with a more dramatic effect on the KIT protein than the c.2151C&#x0003e;G mutation, which causes the truncation of more than a quarter of the protein, including the entire second intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.</p><p>A similar argument holds true for the c.706A&#x0003e;T mutation, which segregated in a family of white Arabians. This mutation is predicted to truncate more than three quarters of the protein, including ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, and the entire intracellular part of the KIT protein.</p><p>The prediction of the functional impact of the two missense mutations found in Thoroughbreds and Camarillo White Horses is not quite as straightforward. However, both mutations affect the functionally important first intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and comparable mutations of this domain have been shown to cause piebaldism in humans and depigmentation phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030195-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>The c.2151C&#x0003e;G mutation was confirmed on the genomic and on the cDNA level. Apparently, only about half of the mutant <italic>KIT</italic> mRNA is cleared by NMD, although it does contain a premature stop codon. Investigation of the mutant protein expression in skin samples of a dominant white (<italic>W/&#x0002b;</italic>) and a solid-colored (<italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic>) horse by western blot showed a strong band of the expected size in the solid-colored (<italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic>) horse and weak bands corresponding to the sizes of the wild-type and the truncated protein in a dominant white (<italic>W/&#x0002b;</italic>) horse. Thus, the western blot indicated that the truncated protein is indeed expressed. It seems conceivable that a truncated KIT protein lacking the second half of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain forms inactive dimers with wild-type KIT proteins and acts as a dominant-negative protein. The observed variation in the coat color phenotypes of horses with the c.2151C&#x0003e;G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030195-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030195-g001">1</xref>C) could be explained by different efficacies of NMD in different individuals and in different body regions. If the mutant transcript is efficiently cleared by NMD, then the remaining wild-type allele could possibly produce enough functional KIT protein to facilitate pigmentation to some extent. However, the more that the truncated KIT protein is expressed, the less likely it is that enough functional dimers of wild-type KIT proteins can mediate proper KIT signaling.</p><p>Our data indicate allelic heterogeneity among dominant white horses from different breeds. Thus, our study represents another example where different mutations in a single gene have been described for a Mendelian trait in domestic animals similar to the situation in, e.g., brown coat color in dogs or syndactyly in cattle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. At this time, it is not known whether the depigmentation of the other reported white horses is caused by as-yet undescribed mutations at the <italic>KIT</italic> locus or whether mutations in other genes can also cause this phenotype. The striking phenotype and the autosomal dominant inheritance facilitate the identification of founder animals. In each of the four investigated families, the white founder animals born out of solid-colored parents are known: for the Franches-Montagnes Horses, it is the white mare Cigale, born in 1957. In the Arabian family, the presumed founder stallion was born in 1996. The white stallion Sultan, born in 1912, is the reported founder of the Camarillo White Horses. The white founder animal of the Thoroughbred family segregating the c.1960G&#x0003e;A mutation is most likely a stallion born in 1946. In line with the recent origin of these mutation events, the four proposed candidate causative mutations of this study segregate only within the four respective families. In contrast, all of the other 14 <italic>KIT</italic> polymorphisms that were discovered during the initial mutation analysis segregate in at least two distinct horse populations, indicating that they are much older and spread into different horse populations by the ongoing admixture, which is typical for many modern horse breeds.</p><p><italic>KIT</italic> gene mutations have been described in humans with piebaldism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, in <italic>W</italic> mouse mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, and in dominant white pigs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. White spotting or white coat color is a common trait in many breeds of domestic animals, but in many instances the molecular mechanisms for these depigmentation phenotypes are still unknown. In the horse, a mutation in the <italic>EDNRB</italic> gene encoding the endothelin receptor B causes the overo spotting pattern in the heterozygous state. When this mutation is present in the homozygous state, completely depigmented foals are born that usually die within the first few days of life, due to intestinal aganglionosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The equine <italic>KIT</italic> gene plays a central role in equine pigmentation, as at least four distinct depigmentation phenotypes are known to be associated with mutations at the equine <italic>KIT</italic> locus. Of the equine <italic>KIT</italic> mutations, so far, only the mutations for sabino-1 and tobiano have been elucidated at the molecular level. The mutations for the sabino-1 and tobiano spotting patterns do not change the <italic>KIT</italic> coding sequence, but rather reduce the expression of functional <italic>KIT</italic> transcripts. Tobiano (<italic>TO</italic>) acts strictly autosomal dominant, and <italic>TO/TO</italic> horses are viable, fertile, and phenotypically indistinguishable from <italic>TO/&#x0002b;</italic> horses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Sabino-1 (<italic>SB1</italic>) acts semidominant, and <italic>SB1/SB1</italic> horses are viable and almost completely white, whereas <italic>SB1/&#x0002b;</italic> horses show a characteristic sabino spotting pattern &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Dominant white (<italic>W</italic>) produces a variable but rather severe depigmentation phenotype in heterozygous horses (<italic>W/&#x0002b;</italic>). In the mouse, more than 90 different <italic>Kit</italic> alleles are known. Many of these mutations produce some degree of white spotting in the heterozygous state, which can range from tiny white belly spots to &#x0003e;99&#x00025; depigmentation. Many <italic>KIT</italic> regulatory mutations exist that produce severe pigmentation phenotypes in the heterozygous state. However, some of the murine structural mutations, such as the <italic>Kit<sup>W-42J</sup></italic> mutation, also lead to an almost complete depigmentation in the heterozygous state. In the mouse, mutations causing a pronounced dominant depigmentation phenotype typically also lead to mild anemia and reduced male fertility even in the heterozygous state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. We are not aware of any specific health problems in the studied white horses. At least two of the white Thoroughbreds with the c.1960G&#x0003e;A mutation successfully competed in horse races, indicating a very good general fitness. There are very little data on fertility in white horses; however, one white Franches-Montagnes stallion was successfully used for artificial insemination, and all routine sperm parameters from this stallion were normal. Therefore, from the limited available data, it appears that heterozygous <italic>KIT</italic> mutations may have less detrimental effects in horses on hematopoiesis and fertility than in mice. In horses, dominant white was reported to cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this report on the embryonic lethality was derived from the analysis of offspring phenotype ratios in a single herd segregating one or more unknown mutations. As there is now evidence for allelic heterogeneity, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state. While this is certainly likely for the two nonsense mutations found in Franches-Montagnes Horses and Arabians, it should not necessarily be assumed for the two reported missense mutations or for any of the other as-yet unknown <italic>W</italic> mutations.</p><p>White horses have always fascinated their human owners. The majority of &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; horses probably carry the greying-with-age mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, which means that they are born solid colored and become white at the age of four to six years. However, there are also a number of historical reports that explicitly mention white-born horses resembling the phenotype of dominant white horses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Two thousand years ago, the Romans already knew of the phenotypic differences of depigmented horses, which they described as candidus (white) or glaucus (grey) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The Roman historian Tacitus described the use of sacred white horses for auguries by German tribes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030195-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The so-called white horse of the Saxons is depicted on the flags of the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is thus of considerable historic interest to trace the origins of white horses, particularly because the nature of their white color can have different causes, some of which are <italic>KIT</italic> mutations such as those described here. We do not know whether the Roman terms candidus and glaucus actually correspond to our modern coat color designations of white and grey. Archaeogenetics on historic DNA samples may help to identify the genetic constitution of these horses.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the probable causative mutation for the dominant white phenotype in Franches-Montagnes Horses. We have also identified three additional candidate causative mutations in Arabians, Camarillo White Horses, and Thoroughbreds. The knowledge of these mutations will allow genetic testing and should help to assign more precise coat color descriptions for partially or completely depigmented horses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals.</title><p>All 21 KIT exons were analyzed in 138 horses of six different breeds.
