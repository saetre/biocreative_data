We show that the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> receptors CED-1 and C03F11.3, and their mammalian orthologues, the scavenger receptors SCARF1 and CD36, mediate host defense against two prototypic fungal pathogens, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans.</italic> CED-1 and C03F11.1 mediated antimicrobial peptide production and were necessary for nematode survival after <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection. SCARF1 and CD36 mediated cytokine production and were required for macrophage binding to <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and control of the infection in mice. Binding of these pathogens to SCARF1 and CD36 was &#x003b2;-glucan dependent. Thus, CED-1/SCARF1 and C03F11.3/CD36 are &#x003b2;-glucan binding receptors and define an evolutionarily conserved pathway for the innate sensing of fungal pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Yeasts such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> are an emerging group of infectious pathogens in patients with impaired T cell&#x02013;mediated immunity, such as those with AIDS, solid organ transplant recipients, and hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Although much work has been devoted in the past decade to uncovering the role of pattern recognition receptors in the innate response to bacteria and viruses, our understanding of how the innate immune system senses fungal pathogens is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The macrophage, a central component of the innate immune system, is essential to the effective immune response to pathogenic yeast. Macrophages have direct antimicrobial activity against these organisms; they promote antigen presentation, polysaccharide sequestration, and cytokine and chemokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). There is also evidence that persistent infection is associated with the intracellular residence of yeast cells in macrophages. Furthermore, infected circulating macrophages can transfer these pathogens and cause dissemination of these infections hematogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the C-type lectin-like receptor Dectin-1 was shown to be a macrophage receptor for &#x003b2;-glucans and to bind several fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). &#x003b2;-glucan is a major carbohydrate found in the fungal cell wall. Dectin-1 mediates both Toll-like receptor (TLR)&#x02013;dependent and TLR-independent responses to fungi in vitro. However, the role of Dectin-1 in the host response to fungal pathogens in vivo is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), suggesting that additional receptors contribute to the innate immune response to fungal pathogens.</p><p>Scavenger receptors constitute a diverse family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize both endogenous and pathogen-derived ligands. These receptors are expressed on cells patrolling potential portals of pathogen entry, including macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, and endothelial cells, and are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and in the host response to some bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). To date, a role for scavenger receptors in the recognition of fungal and yeast pathogens has not been described.</p><p>Using an shRNA screen in mouse macrophages, we found that two evolutionarily conserved members of the scavenger receptor family, SCARF1 and CD36, and their <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> orthologues, CED-1 and C03F11.3, are required for the induction of protective immune responses in worms and mice to pathogenic yeast. We show that these receptors recognize &#x003b2;-glucans and have an essential function in antifungal immunity and host defense by mediating yeast binding and subsequent macrophage activation.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CED-1 mediates <italic>C. neoformans</italic> recognition in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>To identify genes involved in the innate immune response to fungal pathogens, we used the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model host for infection and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> as a prototypical fungal pathogen, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Because of the established role of scavenger receptors in innate immunity to bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), we explored whether this family of pattern recognition receptors also plays a role in innate immunity to fungal pathogens. Using a BLAST screen of the Wormbase database WS196, we searched for <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues of the mammalian scavenger receptors <italic>SR-A1</italic>, <italic>SR-A2</italic>, <italic>MARCO</italic>, <italic>SCARF1</italic>, <italic>CD36</italic>, <italic>SCARB1</italic>, <italic>SCARB2</italic>, <italic>CD68</italic>, <italic>CXCL16</italic>, and <italic>Lox-1</italic>. Interestingly, we found that only four of these receptors, <italic>SCARF1</italic>, <italic>CD36</italic>, <italic>SCARB1</italic>, and <italic>SCARB2</italic>, have possible <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues. As previously described, we found that <italic>SCARF1</italic> is a <italic>CED-1</italic> orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). We also identified four potential <italic>CD36</italic> orthologues in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<italic>C03F11.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>F11C1.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>R07B1.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>F07A5.3</italic>; ranked by amino acid alignment score to mouse <italic>CD36</italic>), one potential <italic>SCARB1</italic> orthologue (<italic>Y49E10.20</italic>), and one potential <italic>SCARB2</italic> orthologue (<italic>Y76A2B.6</italic>; available from the Wormbase database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormbase.org">http://wormbase.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). We analyzed the role of each of these receptors in the pathogenesis of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> revealed that the <italic>SCARF1</italic> orthologue <italic>CED-1</italic>, a scavenger receptor that mediates engulfment of cell corpses by <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), is up-regulated approximately fourfold compared with uninfected worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). This finding raised the interesting possibility that <italic>CED-1</italic> may be involved in the innate immune response to fungal pathogens. To explore this possibility, we obtained CED-1 mutants that do not express the receptor on the cell surface (strains MT4930 and MT4933) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) and infected them with <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. We found that CED-1 mutants were significantly more susceptible to killing by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> than WT nematodes (MT4933 strain shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). By 144 h after infection, &#x0223c;80% of the CED-1 mutants exposed to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> died compared with just &#x0223c;28% of WT nematodes (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Similar results were obtained with a second CED-1 mutant (strain MT4930) and when CED-1 expression was down-regulated in WT nematodes using RNAi (Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1</ext-link>).

By 144 h, &#x0223c;56% of CED-1 mutants died in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection as compared with 25% of WT worms (Fig. S1 b), indicating that <italic>CED-1</italic> is also required, at least in part, for the innate immune response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to this Gram-negative bacterium. In contrast, both WT and CED-1 mutant worms died at the same rate in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection (Fig. S1 c and not depicted), indicating that <italic>CED-1</italic> is not required for host defense to these organisms.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> revealed the up-regulation of several antimicrobial peptides, including antibacterial factor (abf) 1 and abf-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1 c</xref>). These peptides have been shown to be up-regulated in response to bacterial pathogens and to have antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). To determine if induction of antimicrobial peptides is a downstream event from CED-1 binding to <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, we measured mRNA levels of <italic>abf-1</italic> and <italic>abf-2</italic> in WT and CED-1 mutants 24 h after exposure to <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Exposure of WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> up-regulated mRNA levels of <italic>abf-1</italic> and <italic>abf-2</italic> 4.4- and 4.1-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> and not depicted). In contrast, CED-1 mutants exposed to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> up-regulated <italic>abf-1</italic> and <italic>abf-2</italic> levels only 1.6- and 1.9-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> and not depicted), indicating that CED-1 expression is required for maximal induction of these antimicrobial proteins. Of note, WT and CED-1 mutants up-regulated antimicrobial peptide mRNAs equally in response to infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (unpublished data). Collectively, these data suggest that <italic>CED-1</italic> is critical in protecting <italic>C. elegans</italic> from <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, and that expression of <italic>CED-1</italic> is required for induction of antimicrobial peptides that may play a role in the host response to fungal pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>C03F11.3</italic>, a <italic>CD36</italic> orthologue, mediates <italic>C. elegans</italic> survival after <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection</title><p>Our search for potential <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues of the various mammalian scavenger receptors identified that only four of these receptors have possible <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues: <italic>SCARF1</italic> (<italic>CED-1</italic>), <italic>CD36</italic> (<italic>C03F11.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>F11C1.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>R07B1.3</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>F07A5.3</italic>), <italic>SCARB1</italic> (<italic>Y49E10.20</italic>), and <italic>SCARB2</italic> (<italic>Y76A2B.6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

The RNAi Consortium has previously stated that its lentiviral library silences genes in a diverse set of cell types, contains five shRNAs for nearly every gene in the mouse genome, and is capable of significantly reducing target mRNA levels (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Using a subset of the mouse lentiviral shRNA library targeting TLRs, scavenger receptors including <italic>CED-1</italic> orthologues, c-type lectins, and other pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>), we performed a screen to identify genes that mediate macrophage activation induced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> stimulation using RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophages. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> induced a broad spectrum of cytokines and chemokines in RAW cells, including IL-1&#x003b2; and MIP-2 (unpublished data).

As a control, WT macrophages were stimulated with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in the presence of RAGE-Fc or isotype control antibody. CD36-Fc and anti-TLR2 individually blocked &#x0223c;45&#x02013;55% of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;induced IL-1&#x003b2; expression. Combining both inhibitors blocked &#x0003e;75% of IL-1&#x003b2; induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 h</xref>). In contrast, control antibody and RAGE-Fc had no effect on <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;induced IL-1&#x003b2; expression.

We found that <italic>C. albicans</italic> induced the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, IL-12<sub>p40</sub>, IFN-&#x003b3;, MIP-2, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, RANTES, and IP-10 from WT macrophages (Fig. S5 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages stimulated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> had a marked reduction in the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, IL-12<sub>p40</sub>, MIP-2, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, and RANTES, whereas the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; and IP-10 was similar to WT macrophages (Fig. S5 a). We also found that CHO-CD36 cells bind <italic>C. albicans</italic> in a &#x003b2;-glucan&#x02013;dependent manner (Fig. S5 b). Finally, we found that CD36-deficient macrophages showed an &#x0223c;50% reduction in binding <italic>C. albicans</italic> relative to WT macrophages (Fig. S5 c). Collectively, these data demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> C03F11.1 and its mammalian orthologue CD36 are components of a previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily conserved pathway for fungal pathogen recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of CD36 deficiency after in vivo infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic></title><p>To study the role of CD36 in fungal infections in vivo, WT and <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were infected i.v. with the virulent <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain H99. The i.v. route of infection was used because it mimics the hematogenous spread observed when the organism disseminates, and because it is more reproducible and easier to accurately inoculate the same amount into each mouse. To assess the course of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, the spleen and liver were harvested from WT and <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice on day 5 after i.v. infection. <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice displayed significantly increased numbers of CFUs in the spleen and liver at day 5 compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, a and b</xref>). To visualize the number of yeast in the liver samples, we stained liver sections with calcofluor. We found significantly more <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in liver sections from <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, c and d</xref>), confirming results obtained from our microbiological assay.</p><p>To further confirm the yeast CFU counts, we designed primers to the cryptococcus capsule A gene and determined the number of copies in each organ by QPCR. The cryptococcal capsule plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infection, and expression of this mRNA reflects the presence and viability of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). As expected, mRNA expression of the capsule A gene paralleled the number of CFU counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, e and f</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the fungal load differences seen in WT and <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice correlated with the induction of proinflammatory mediators, we determined the level of cytokines and chemokines induced in the spleen and liver 5 d after i.v. infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. We found that several chemokines (MIP-2, MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MIP-1&#x003b2;) and cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, and IL-12<sub>p40</sub>) were induced in the organs of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, g and h</xref>). In contrast, all of these cytokines were markedly reduced in the organs of <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, g and h</xref>). To analyze whether loss of CD36 expression affects the susceptibility of mice to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, we infected WT and <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice i.v. with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We found that <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice succumbed to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU) infection significantly faster than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 i</xref>). When lower doses (10<sup>5</sup> CFU) of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> were used, similar results were obtained. However, at lower doses of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, 100% mortality in the <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was delayed by 5 d compared with the higher doses. In all experiments, we found that <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice succumbed at a significantly faster rate than WT mice regardless of the dose. Of note, expression of the other known &#x003b2;-glucan receptors Dectin-1, Dectin-2, mannose receptor, and TLR2 were not affected in <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082109/DC1</ext-link>). Collectively, these data show that CD36 expression is required for <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;induced cytokine and chemokine production in vivo, and demonstrate that CD36 is a cellular receptor for strains of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> that are pathogenic to humans and mice, and plays a crucial role in the host response to this organism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Opportunistic yeasts cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immune systems. Several yeast cell-wall proteins are recognized by the innate immune system in mice and humans; however, the molecular mechanisms and receptors used by immune cells to bind and trigger cell activation have not been fully elucidated. In this paper, we show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> receptors CED-1 and C03F11.3, and their mammalian orthologues, the scavenger receptors SCARF1 and CD36, mediate host defense against pathogenic yeast. In the absence of CED-1 or C03F11.1, nematodes succumb much faster to fungal infection and fail to induce the production of antimicrobial peptides. In mammalian cells, SCARF1 and CD36 mediate binding and the subsequent induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after exposure to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Furthermore, binding of C. <italic>neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> to SCARF1 and CD36 is &#x003b2;-glucan dependent. The role of CD36 in these responses appears to be nonredundant in vivo, because the number of yeast cells in the spleen and liver of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;infected <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were significantly higher than WT mice, and <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice died at an accelerated rate after <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, indicating an essential role of CD36 in controlling the infection. Furthermore, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the organs of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>&#x02013;infected <italic>CD36<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were significantly reduced compared with WT mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the scavenger receptors SCARF1 and CD36 are nonredundant components of an evolutionarily conserved pathway for fungal recognition and innate immunity that is necessary for controlling fungal infections in vivo. SCARF1 and CD36 do not appear to signal on their own in response to fungal binding; instead, they collaborate with TLR2 but not TLR4 or TLR9 for induction of cytokines. It is possible that collaboration of different scavenger receptors with different TLRs is determined by the ligand at hand. Different ligands may trigger different collaborations between these two classes of pattern recognition receptors.</p><p>An important aspect of our findings is reflected by the role of <italic>CED-1</italic> and <italic>C03F11.3</italic> genes in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> We have previously established <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a simple model host in which yeast pathogenesis can be studied. CED-1 is a phagocytic receptor known to mediate the engulfment of dying cells. Our studies identify a novel role for CED-1 in host defense. Nematodes deficient in CED-1 are more rapidly killed by the yeast pathogen <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and the Gram-negative bacteria <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> than WT worms, and fail to produce the antimicrobial peptides abf-1 and abf-2 in response to these infections. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a role for CED-1 in fungal recognition and host defense. Recently, Haskins et al. demonstrated that CED-1 was required for the survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> after infection with the human pathogen <italic>S. enteric</italic> strain 1344 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CED-1 is critical in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> immune response to live yeast and Gram-negative bacteria, and confirm the role of this receptor as an innate immune receptor. CED-1 does not appear to act alone as an innate immune receptor, as C03F11.3 also plays a nonredundant role in the nematode response to fungal infection. We are currently investigating if these two receptors play complementary roles in host defense against fungal as well as bacterial pathogens. Our data show that there is a remarkable similarity between the role of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian scavenger receptors in innate immunity. Indeed, just as <italic>C. elegans</italic> scavenger receptors are necessary for antimicrobial peptide production, mammalian scavenger receptors are required for cytokine production in response to fungal pathogens.</p><p>Identifying the receptors responsible for pathogen recognition is essential to understanding the innate immune system. Several classes of pathogen recognition receptors have now been described, each capable of recognizing and responding to conserved microbial structures. Scavenger receptors are cell-surface proteins present on a variety of cell types. Although scavenger receptors have been primarily studied for their ability to bind endogenous modified LDL and &#x003b2;-amyloid, they also recognize and respond to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Scavenger receptors recognize a myriad of microbial structures, including LPS, lipoteichoic acid, DNA, and RNA. A role for scavenger receptors in the recognition of fungal pathogens has not been established. Recently, Rice et al. found indirect evidence for the involvement of scavenger receptors in the innate sensing of fungal pathogens. They showed that acLDL, a common ligand for many scavenger receptors, inhibits &#x003b2;-glucan binding to monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Our data show that SCARF1 and CD36, both of which bind acLDL, serve a nonredundant role as receptors for &#x003b2;-glucans. Interestingly, although the role of other &#x003b2;-glucan receptors in fungal pathogens in vivo remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), our data indicate that SCARF1 and CD36 play important roles in vivo in controlling fungal infection.</p><p>In our shRNA screen, we also found that TLR2 was required for maximal cytokine and chemokine production from macrophages stimulated with live <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Several TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9) have been shown to be involved in triggering macrophage activation by <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, or fungal-derived molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). In vitro experiments have shown that CD14 cooperates with TLR2 and TLR4 in binding to the major component of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> capsule, polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan. However, CD14, TLR2, and TLR4 appear to only play relatively minor roles in vivo in the host response to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). TLR2&#x02013;6 heterodimers are involved in recognition of zymosan; however, cytokine production in TLR6-deficient macrophages is only moderately reduced in response to zymosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Similar to TLR6, the absence of TLR9 on macrophages results in only a moderate reduction in cytokine production after stimulation with fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). These data are consistent with our findings that silencing the expression of TLR2, but not TLR4, TLR6, or TLR9, in macrophages resulted in reduced cytokine production in response to live <italic>C. neoformans</italic> stimulation.</p><p>Other receptors, including Dectin-1, mannose receptor, Galectin-3, and Mincle, have been shown to bind yeast or to components of its capsule or cell wall (i.e., &#x003b2;-glucan and mannans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Dectin-1 cooperates with TLR2 for the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to &#x003b2;-glucan stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, Nakamura et al. did not find any difference in cytokine production in response to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection between WT and Dectin-1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). We confirmed these results and found that RAW macrophages silenced for Dectin-1 or Dectin-2 did not exhibit a reduction in cytokine induction after stimulation by <italic>C. neoformans.</italic> Our results are possibly caused by the low expression of these receptors on RAW cells. However, it is likely that CD36 and SCARF1 rather than Dectin-1 play a more prominent role in cytokine production than Dectins in response to fungal pathogens. The mannose receptor binds <italic>C. neoformans</italic> through the recognition of mannosylated proteins present in the fungal cell wall. After <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, mannose receptor&#x02013;deficient mice died significantly faster than WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Interestingly, no significant difference in survival between mannose receptor&#x02013;deficient and WT mice infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic> was observed, and both mice exhibited competence in inflammatory cell recruitment and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Because SCARF1 appears to bind fungal pathogens in a mannan-dependent manner, it is possible that SCARF1 and the mannan receptor play complementary roles in innate immunity to <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The role of scavenger receptors in innate immunity is only beginning to be uncovered. Our data strongly support such a role in response to fungal infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Reagents.</title><p>The extracellular domain of mouse CD36 was cloned into the Fc fusion mammalian expression vector pFUSE-IgG1-Fc2 (InvivoGen).
