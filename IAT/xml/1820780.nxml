Recently, we and others have shown that, at early embryonic stages prior to the emergence of granule cell precursors (E12), waves of neurogenesis in the cerebellar rhombic lip produce specific hindbrain nuclei followed by deep cerebellar neurons.

In the mouse embryonic brain, closure of the neural tube at around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) generally creates a ventricular zone of neural progenitors that give rise to successive waves of differentiating neurons; however, at the opening of the fourth ventricle the neuroepithelium extends directly to the roof plate, resulting in an edge along the cerebellar and hindbrain neural plate (r1&#x02013;r8) termed the rhombic lip. Located at the caudal boundary of the cerebellar anlage in dorsal r1, the cerebellar rhombic lip is a unique germinal territory that gives rise to granule cells and other neurons of the cerebellum and hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Immediately following neural tube closure, the expression of the mouse Atonal homolog Math1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is required for the granule cell lineage and other rhombic lip derived neuronal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], begins to be induced in rhombic lip cells that subsequently migrate away from the rhombic lip rostrally over the dorsal surface of the cerebellar anlage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The roof plate is required for these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and is a source of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members that have been shown to be sufficient to induce cerebellar progenitors to express Math1 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, mouse embryos lacking BMP receptor expression in the neural tube lose Math1 expression in the rhombic lip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], indicating a crucial role for BMP signaling in the ongoing induction of Math1 during rhombic lip neurogenesis.</p><p>A variety of fate mapping approaches have led to the conclusion that the cerebellar rhombic lip produces temporally distinct neuronal populations during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, we have generated a temporal fate map of the Math1 cells of the cerebellar rhombic lip, using transgenesis in mice to label cohorts of Math1 cells by expressing an inducible Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) under the control of the Math1 enhancer. We and others have reported that, prior to emergence of granule cell precursors, the cerebellar rhombic lip is the germinal origin of specific hindbrain and deep cerebellar neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Here, we propose that, throughout the peak period of neurogenesis in the rhombic lip (E9.5 to E16.5), there is an ongoing BMP-mediated induction of Math1 in cerebellar progenitors that produces waves of distinct neuronal populations over time. Both the presence of Notch responsive genes in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the observation that Notch can antagonize BMP signaling in other neuronal cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] suggest that the Notch pathway may regulate this process. Utilizing both loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that an antagonistic interaction between Notch and BMP receptor signaling in cerebellar progenitors regulates their maintenance and differentiation within the rhombic lip throughout embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Loss of Notch1 in the cerebellar primordium increases rhombic lip neurogenesis</title><p><italic>Notch1 </italic>mRNA is expressed in the cerebellar primordium as early as E9 (data not shown), and by E12.5 is restricted to neural progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). BMP activity in the rhombic lip and caudal VZ is evident from the expression of Msx2, a homeodomain transcription factor that has been shown to be a target of BMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Note that the expression pattern of Msx2 overlaps with the expression of Math1 at this embryonic stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Expression of the bHLH transcription factor Mash1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] likely delineates the precursors of Purkinje cells and other GABAergic cerebellar neurons that arise from the ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Within the VZ, Hes5 expression reflects Notch signaling activity in the cerebellar progenitor pool, while the punctate expression of Delta1 likely indicates a subpopulation of neural precursors that are undergoing differentiation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Notch and BMP signaling components in the embryonic cerebellar primordium.

Loss of Notch1 did not have an overt effect on isthmic or roof plate markers at this stage (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Both of the mRNAs for the bHLH transcription factors Mash1 and Math1 are expressed at higher levels in the mutant embryos, but in a complementary pattern: <italic>Mash1 </italic>expression is increased in the rostral cerebellar primordium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d, e</xref>) whereas there is a robust increase in <italic>Math1 </italic>expression proximal to the rhombic lip in comparison to wild-type littermates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f, g</xref>). This increase in <italic>Math1 </italic>expression is apparent at the protein level as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2h, i</xref>), and appears to reflect an increase in both cell numbers as well as the levels of Math1 expression induced within differentiating cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Conditional loss of Notch1 in the early embryonic cerebellum results in precocious differentiation at the expense of the progenitor pool. <bold>(a) </bold>Whole mount &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining of an E9.5 En1cre; Rosa-stopLacZ reveals the extent of recombination across the mid-hindbrain region. <bold>(b-g) </bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization with antisense probes for <bold>(b, c)</bold><italic>Notch1</italic>, <bold>(d, e)</bold><italic>Mash1</italic>, and <bold>(f, g) </bold><italic>Math1 </italic>on sagittal cryosections of the cerebellar primordia from E10.5 floxNotch1 (b, d, f) and En1cre; floxNotch1 (c, e, g) embryos. <bold>(h, i) </bold>Immunohistochemistry for Math1 on E10.5 floxNotch1 (h) and En1cre; floxNotch1 (i) tissue cryosections. <bold>(j-o) </bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization with antisense probes for <bold>(j, k)</bold><italic>Notch1</italic>, <bold>(l, m) </bold><italic>Mash1</italic>, and <bold>(n, o) </bold><italic>Math1 </italic>on sagittal cryosections of the embryonic cerebella from E12.5 floxNotch1 <bold>(j, l, n) </bold>and Engrailed1-cre; floxNotch1 <bold>(k, m, o) </bold>embryos.

Nevertheless, no obvious increase in cell death (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, or caspase-3 immunohistochemistry), or decrease in proliferation (short term bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) in the residual cerebellar ventricular zone was observed at this stage (data not shown). Following the upregulation of <italic>Mash1 </italic>in the mutants at E10.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d, e</xref>), <italic>Mash1 </italic>expression is decreased in all but the most rostral territory of the ventricular zone in comparison to wild type at E12.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2l, m</xref>). In contrast, an increase in <italic>Math1 </italic>expression is still evident in the E12.5 mutants, and scattered <italic>Math1</italic><sup>+ </sup>cells are observed in a broader area of the ventricular zone in comparison with sections from wild type littermates at the same medial-lateral position (brackets in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2n, o</xref>). This <italic>Math1 </italic>expression pattern in the mutant resembles that observed in the most medial sections from wild-type animals, where the cerebellar primordium is thinner and in closer proximity to the midline and roof plate. The increase in subpial distribution of <italic>Math1</italic><sup>+ </sup>cells in the mutant could be accounted for by an increase in migration rate away from the rhombic lip, which is consistent with the observation that Math1 activity is required for subpial migration of rhombic lip neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The increase in <italic>Math1 </italic>expression and concomitant decrease in <italic>Mash1 </italic>from E10.5 to E12.5 in the mutants suggests that early loss of Notch1 results in an increase in rhombic lip neurogenesis at the expense of maintaining the ventricular zone progenitor pool. Consistent with this, by E16.5, the mutant cerebellum is greatly reduced in size in comparison to wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;d</xref>), and there is a severe decrease in the Purkinje cell precursors (calbindin immunostaining) that are normally generated from the ventricular zone beginning around E12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e, f</xref>). In contrast to the results presented in a previous study on the En2-Cre; floxNotch1 mutant mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we did not observe any postnatal survival of mutant embryos, and even by E18.5 there was no apparent recovery of the mutant cerebellum in terms of size or morphology (data not shown). The greater severity of phenotype in our study most likely results from a more complete loss of Notch1 in the cerebellar primordium using the En1-cre knock-in mouse than was obtained in the En2-cre; floxNotch1 mutant.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Conditional loss of Notch1 in the cerebellar primordium results in severe hypoplasia and loss of Purkinje cell precursors. <bold>(a, b) </bold>Sagittal whole mount view of E16.5 floxNotch1 (a) and En1-cre; floxNotch1 (b) brains.

To obtain a short term fate map of the <italic>Math1</italic><sup>+ </sup>cells that arise in the En1cre; floxNotch mutant cerebellum, we generated this conditional mutant on a Math1-LacZ knock-in (+/-) background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and analyzed the residual &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining present in rhombic lip lineages in coronal sections at E14.5.

The persistence of granule cells in the mutant may reflect the fact that, while the En1cre driver used in these experiments recombines the vast majority of the mes/r1 primordium, the most lateral regions of the cerebellar primordium escape recombination (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that some granule cells are generated laterally and migrate medially to populate the rostral external granule layer (EGL). Alternatively, as discussed in more depth below, there may be distinct lineage-restricted pools of rhombic lip progenitors that are maintained independently of Notch activity until they begin to divide asymmetrically to produce neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>The level of Notch activity in cerebellar progenitors regulates their cell fate</title><p>If the loss of Notch1 enhances the responsiveness of cerebellar progenitors to inductive signals that direct rhombic lip neurogenesis, then expression of Notch ligands (for example, Delta) should also render cells more receptive to these developmental cues by virtue of lateral inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To test this hypothesis directly, we generated a pseudotyped bicistronic retrovirus that expresses full length Delta1, along with human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), to allow histochemical detection of transfected cells. Approximately 10<sup>6 </sup>virions were injected into the ventricle of E9.5 to E10 embryos <italic>in utero </italic>using ultrasound backscatter microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and the infected animals analyzed three weeks after birth.

Strikingly, similar injections with retroviruses expressing full length Delta1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) resulted in the labeling of granule cells predominantly, as observed by position, morphology (note the PLAP staining of parallel fibers in the molecular layer), and immunohistochemical co-labeling with antibodies against Zic2 (green) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and PLAP (red; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref> inset). Furthermore, Delta1 infections at this stage also appeared to contribute to the DCN (white arrow). Given that these retroviruses require approximately 24 hours to integrate and express the Delta1 protein, we suggest that these Delta infected cells were differentiating and expressing Math1 at around E11.5 to E12 and thus contributed to the DCN and early specified (anterior) GCP that are normally produced at that time.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Notch1 activity regulates cell fate decisions in the embryonic cerebellum.

To test whether ectopic BMP activity could induce <italic>Cath1 </italic>expression, we electroporated a constitutively active form of the BMP receptor 1b (caBMPR) at a level sufficient to induce patterning changes but not cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. While a control electroporation of a GFP reporter plasmid alone did not induce <italic>Cath1 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref>), ectopic activation of the BMP signaling pathway in the cerebellar primordium (dashed circle) resulted in a robust induction of <italic>Cath1 </italic>expression along the dorsal surface of the cerebellar anlage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c, d</xref>). Interestingly, when the Notch1 ICD was co-electroporated along with the caBMPR expression plasmid into the cerebellar ventricular zone, the ectopic induction of <italic>Cath1 </italic>was suppressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e, f</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Thus, although ventricular zone progenitors are competent to respond to BMP signaling and express <italic>Cath1</italic>, they are prevented from doing so by high levels of Notch activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Interaction between Notch and BMP receptor signaling in the cerebellar primordium. <bold>(a-f) </bold>Stage 10 to 12 chick embryos were electroporated <italic>in ovo </italic>with a GFP reporter plasmid and the expression plasmids described below.

Electroporations in chick cerebellar primordia of caBMPR alone or caBMPR and Notch1 ICD were stained by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated Smad1, a direct readout of BMP receptor signaling activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Smad1 is a transcription factor that, upon phosphorylation by the BMP receptor serine/threonine kinase activity, forms a heterodimer with Smad4 and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes (for example, <italic>Msx1/2</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6h</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the levels of phosphorylated Smad1 were elevated in both caBMPR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6i</xref>) and caBMPR/Notch1 ICD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6k</xref>) electroporated tissue, demonstrating that expression of the Notch ICD does not interfere at this stage of the BMP signaling pathway. However, while electroporation of caBMPR into the cerebellar primordium (dashed oval) resulted in ectopic expression of Msx1/2 in the ventricular zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6j</xref>), this induction was suppressed when Notch1 ICD was co-electroporated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6l</xref>). Counts of <italic>GFP</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Msx1/2</italic><sup>+ </sup>cells in the ventricular zone of caBMPR and caBMPR/Notch1 ICD electroporated cerebella from three embryos each are shown in the graph and indicate that, while approximately 80% of ventricular zone cells transduced with caBMPR express Msx1/2, this percentage drops to around 10% when Notch1 ICD is co-transduced. Thus, expression of the Notch1 ICD antagonizes the BMP signaling pathway at the level of Msx1/2 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have examined the early stages of cerebellar development to gain an understanding of how neurogenesis in the rhombic lip is regulated throughout embryogenesis. We find that Notch signaling is critical for controlling the timing of induction of rhombic lip neurons from the cerebellar progenitor pool as well as for maintaining a progenitor population for subsequent waves of neurogenesis. Using <italic>in vivo </italic>gain-of-function methods, we show that the neural differentiation of cerebellar progenitors can be inhibited by constitutive activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway during early embryogenesis, and that cell autonomous downregulation of Notch activity via expression of Delta1 at early embryonic stages (E11.5) increases the responsiveness of cells to differentiate as rhombic lip neurons. Furthermore, we find that activation of the BMP signaling pathway can induce the rhombic lip proneural gene <italic>Math1 </italic>ectopically in the ventricular zone, and that simultaneous activation of the Notch pathway blocks this inductive effect at the level of Msx expression. Thus, we propose that antagonism between the Notch and BMP signaling pathways regulates the differentiation of cerebellar progenitors throughout the period of neurogenesis in the rhombic lip.</p><p>We and others have recently shown that there is an ongoing induction of Math1 in the cerebellar rhombic lip that produces distinct populations of neurons over time; here, we find that this inductive process is regulated by interactions between the Notch and BMP signaling pathways. However, at present little is known about the cerebellar progenitors that give rise to rhombic lip <italic>Math1</italic><sup>+ </sup>lineages, and whether they are composed of a number of lineage-restricted progenitor populations or a single pool of progenitors. Previous work from our lab and others suggests that the neural progenitor cells within the ventricular zone are heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and that while at early embryonic stages some progenitor lineages are being maintained by symmetric non-neurogenic divisions, others are becoming neurogenic and divide asymmetrically to produce differentiating neurons. It appears likely that Notch signaling is particularly critical in maintaining a progenitor lineage during asymmetric cell divisions. In this context, our fate mapping results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> may indicate that there are multiple <italic>Math1</italic>-negative progenitor lineages within the cerebellar progenitor population that give rise to rhombic lip neurons. While the total number of hindbrain neurons (PBG, MPT, LPB) specified appears to be relatively unaffected by loss of Notch1, the LPB neurons appear to be increased in number at the expense of the MPT neurons and DCN, suggesting that these rhombic lip derived neurons may arise from a common progenitor lineage. The persistence of GCPs in this experiment may reflect that there is a distinct progenitor population for GCPs that is maintained independently of Notch activity during the production of hindbrain and DCN until specification of GCPs begins. This possibility could account for the observation that only the early born (rostral) GCPs appear to be specified in the conditional Notch1 mutant, in that Notch signaling would be required to maintain the GCP progenitor pool during the period of GCP induction, and thus these progenitors would be rapidly depleted in the absence of Notch activity. Alternatively, the GCPs that are observed may have arisen from the most lateral regions of the cerebellar primordium that are not recombined by the En1-Cre driver since these cells (but not DCN) are known to migrate from lateral to medial positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>The role of BMP signaling in neural induction has been studied in many contexts, as has the anti-neurogenic role of Notch signaling. However, little is known at present about how these two pathways interact <italic>in vivo </italic>to regulate neurogenesis. A recent study on cell fate determination in neural crest derivatives demonstrated a dominant effect of Notch activation in preventing neuronal differentiation in response to BMP signaling <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this study, it was found that transient Notch activation in neural crest progenitors resulted in a permanent gliogenic fate switch. In the context of the cerebellum, both Notch and BMP signaling have been shown to regulate neurogenesis, but it is not clear that these signaling pathways interact in the same manner as observed in the neural crest. We find it unlikely that cerebellar progenitors that are maintained in the ventricular zone via Notch signaling are committed exclusively to a glial fate. Rather, at this stage of progenitor maturation, Notch signaling acts to inhibit responsiveness to BMP signaling but is not itself instructive until later developmental stages.</p><p>Our data demonstrating that the Notch and BMP receptor signaling pathways interact competitively within cerebellar progenitors suggest that the Notch1 ICD and activated Smad1/Smad4 moieties converge on a common target. It has been reported that the Notch1 ICD binds to the core transcriptional activator p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and forms a complex with p300/CBP-associated protein (P/CAF), Rbp-J and Mastermind like-1 (MAML1) to activate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylated Smad1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with the Notch-1 ICD in the presence of p300 and P/CAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting that these core transcription co-activators may mediate the interactions between Notch and BMP signaling. An intriguing complement to the above is suggested by a recent report that Smad1 contains inhibitory phosphorylation sites that are targeted by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling from the isthmus could, therefore, potentiate Notch signaling in the cerebellar primordium by decreasing the responsiveness of rostral cerebellar progenitors to BMPs secreted from the roof plate.</p><p>The cerebellar rhombic lip is a unique germinal zone that produces specific hindbrain nuclei, DCN, and granule cell precursors in a temporally regulated manner. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how the ongoing induction of Math1 in cerebellar progenitors is regulated in the rhombic lip throughout embryogenesis. Because the initiation of neurogenesis in the rhombic lip begins immediately following neural tube closure, and continues late into embryonic development, we find a critical role for Notch1 signaling in the cerebellar primordium during this period to inhibit cerebellar progenitors from responding prematurely to rhombic lip inductive signals. We suggest this represents the first of a set of distinct roles that Notch1 performs in the embryonic cerebellum. We propose Notch1 signaling acts iteratively in the cerebellar progenitor population, first by inhibiting the overproduction of early rhombic lip derived neurons, then by regulating neurogenesis in the ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and finally by stimulating gliogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, in addition to Notch1, other Notch family members have been shown to regulate granule cell precursor development during embryogenesis through possible reciprocal interactions with Math1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Postnatally, Notch2 signaling has been shown to regulate the maturation of granule cell precursors in the EGL by maintaining them in a proliferative state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the Notch signaling pathway acts to arrest the differentiation state of cerebellar precursors at multiple developmental stages. Deciphering how the Notch signaling pathway modulates the responsiveness of neural progenitors to developmental cues will be crucial for understanding the regulation of growth and differentiation of the central nervous system throughout embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse genotyping and tissue preparation</title><p>Engrailed1-cre, floxed Notch1, Math1-LacZ, and Rosa26 stopLacZ mice were genotyped as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].
