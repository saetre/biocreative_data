Early studies of actin in amphibian oocytes gave the first clear evidence for actin being a nuclear constituent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c4">4</xref>). Subsequently, a number of immunocytology and immunoelectron microscopy studies, analyses of permeabilized cells, and <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-linking experiments provided further strong support for the view that actin is a nuclear component (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c1">1</xref>). There is likely to be a delicate balance between globular (G) and filamentous (F) actin, the globular form being by far the predominant one in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear actin has been tentatively implicated in RNA synthesis. It was shown early on that injection of anti-actin antibodies or actin-binding proteins into amphibian oocyte nuclei blocks transcription of the lampbrush chromosomes but not of ribosomal RNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c5">5</xref>). Actin was also reported to be required for efficient transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> by RNA polymerase II, presumably acting at the pre-initiation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c6">6</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that an anti-actin antibody inhibits <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c7">7</xref>). Finally, monomeric actin seems to be required for the chromatin remodeling complex BAF to associate with chromatin during the gene activation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c8">8</xref>). Thus, actin is likely to play a role in the transcription process, but the precise mechanisms are still to be revealed.</p><p>Early on, it also seemed attractive to couple nuclear actin to mRNA transport. Actin was recorded in pre-messenger ribonucleoprotein (pre-mRNP, also designated hnRNP) preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c9">9</xref>), and at the ultrastructural level it was observed in pre-mRNA-containing fibrogranular material in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, direct evidence for a functional role was obtained in a recent microinjection study suggesting that actin is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of retroviral RNAs, and it was also proposed that the transport of cellular mRNAs could be dependent on actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c11">11</xref>). Finally, it has recently been demonstrated in a dipteran insect that actin is bound in a specific manner to at least one of the hnRNP proteins in pre-mRNP particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c12">12</xref>). Evidently, we need more information on the interaction between actin and pre-mRNP particles to also elucidate the specific function(s) of actin in the transport process.</p><p>The hnRNP proteins comprise a large number of proteins that are classified into several families and sub-families based on structural&#x0002f;functional motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c13">13</xref>). In mammals, for example, there are more than 20 major and a large number of minor protein species, designated A1 to U hnRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c14">14</xref>). The most abundant hnRNP proteins belong to the A&#x0002f;B type and exhibit a well defined modular structure. The N-terminal domain is highly conserved and consists of two tandemly repeated, 80&#x02013;90 amino acid long, RNA-binding domains (RBD). The C-terminal part of the protein is considerably more divergent, is glycine-rich, and is called the auxiliary domain. Therefore, the A&#x0002f;B-type proteins are often referred to as 2xRBD-Gly proteins. These proteins form a steadily expanding family of proteins with a large number of post-transcriptional isoforms as well as extensive post-translational modifications. In addition to a general packing role in RNA processing and transport, a number of specialized functions have been ascribed to the hnRNP A&#x0002f;B proteins. A1 and A2&#x0002f;B1 proteins participate in constitutive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c15">15</xref>) as well as in alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c16">16</xref>) splicing by antagonizing the SR splicing factor ASF&#x0002f;SF2 in the 5&#x02032; splice site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c18">18</xref>). A1 has also been implicated in RNA transport as it is shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c19">19</xref>) and contains a nuclear export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c20">20</xref>). A2 is likely to be involved in mRNA transport and mRNA localization in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c21">21</xref>) as well as in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c22">22</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated the interaction of actin with pre-mRNP particles in a mammalian system suitable for systematic and large-scale analysis of hnRNP proteins associated with actin. Using 40S hnRNP complexes obtained from fractionated rat liver nuclear extracts, we have isolated actin-binding proteins with DNase I affinity chromatography and further analyzed them by 2D gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry. We have found a specific subset of rat A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins tightly associated with nuclear actin. These include DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A (CArG binding factor A), a minor variant of hnRNP A2 and three minor variants of hnRNP A3 (mBx). The interaction of actin with DBP40 and DBP40 with poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA has been further studied both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is proposed that the interaction is direct and that the actin&#x02013;DBP40 complex bound to pre-mRNA in the nucleus is transferred to the cytoplasm bound to mRNA. Finally, as hnRNP A&#x0002f;B proteins are known to enter cytoplasm, it is possible that actin is associated not only with DBP40 but with a specific subset of A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins in the mRNP particle when delivered to the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The monoclonal 3G1 and 1B6 antibodies against <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic> hnRNP proteins were produced in our laboratory as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c23">23</xref>).

Following stringent washes, DNase I beads were resuspended in urea-containing isofocusing sample buffer (ISB) (6 M urea, 0.3&#x00025; Ampholytes 3&#x0002f;10, 1.25&#x00025; NP-40) to elute the bound proteins. In parallel, prior to incubation with DNase I beads, 30 &#x000b5;l aliquots of the 40S pre-mRNP fraction were treated with RNaseA at a final concentration of 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l for 15 min at room temperature. Following incubation with DNase I beads as described, bound proteins were similarly eluted with ISB buffer after stringent washes. In both cases bound proteins were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis.</p><p>Binding experiments with purified proteins were performed stepwise. Typically, 100 &#x000b5;l DNase I beads were pre-equilibrated in G-buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM DTT) and then saturated with purified G-actin. The excess actin was washed away and the actin&#x0002f;DNase I beads were then subdivided into aliquots and individually incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled DBP40 and hnRNP A2 for 30&#x02013;40 min at 4&#x000b0;C with continuous mixing. The beads were then spun down and washed batchwise six times with 1 ml phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 1&#x00025; NP-40, 0.1&#x00025; deoxycholate and 1 mM DTT to remove non-specifically bound material. Bound proteins were heat denatured, eluted, resolved by 10&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE and detected by autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title>2D gel electrophoresis</title><p>2D gel electrophoresis was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c26">26</xref>). In the first dimension, proteins were resolved on tube gels by non-equilibrium pH-gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE). The tube gels were then carefully extruded from the capillary and equilibrated in DTT-containing Laemmli buffer prior to placing them on the prepared 10&#x00025; SDS polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension (SDS&#x02013;PAGE).

Actin was identified with a monoclonal antibody termed AC-15 (Sigma Immunochemicals). The primary antibodies were detected with a goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) (DAKO).

The proteins were digested within the gel with trypsin, and the generated peptides were collected as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c27">27</xref>). Contaminants and salts were removed from the samples with reverse phase (C<sub>18</sub>) chromatography desalting columns (ZipTip, Millipore). Normally, 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of sample was applied to the column followed by washing with 20 &#x000b5;l of 0.1&#x00025; trifluoroacetic acid and elution with 3 &#x000b5;l of 60&#x00025; acetonitrile containing 1&#x00025; acetic acid directly into the nano-ES needle.</p><p>Mass spectra of the tryptic peptides were recorded on a Voyager DE-Pro matrix-assisted laser desorption&#x0002f;ionization time-of-flight (MALDI&#x02013;TOF) mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems). Nano-electrospray (nano-ES) collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra were recorded on a quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass). This instrument was equipped with an orthogonal sampling ES-interface (Z-spray, Micromass). Metal-coated nano-ES needles (Protana A&#x0002f;S) were used and opened manually on the stage of a light microscope to give a spraying orifice of &#x0223c;5 &#x000b5;m. This resulted in a flow rate of &#x0223c;20&#x02013;50 nl&#x0002f;min when a capillary voltage of 0.8&#x02013;1.2 kV was applied. Desolvation was facilitated by a counter-current drying gas (nitrogen). The cone voltage was set at 40 V. For the acquisition of CID spectra, the precursor ion isotope cluster was selected with quadrupole 1. The collision voltage was optimized in the range 20&#x02013;40 V with argon as collision gas. The product ion spectra were recorded on the orthogonal TOF.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of proteins for protein&#x02013;protein interaction assays</title><p><italic>Purification of native actin.</italic> Actin prepared from calf thymus cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c28">28</xref>), was a gift from Dr Uno Lindberg.</p><p><italic>In vitro transcription&#x0002f;translation of</italic><italic><sup>35</sup></italic><italic>S-labeled DBP40 and hnRNP A2.</italic> The plasmids containing the full-length ORF of DBP40 and hnRNP A2 were used as templates for TNT-coupled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation essentially following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction manual (Promega).

Relative to the 40S hnRNP fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>A), only a small subset of hnRNP proteins remained bound to DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B). Sepharose alone did not bind any proteins (data not shown). The DNase I-bound proteins, designated 1&#x02013;5 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B, display pI values ranging from basic to acidic. The two spots of protein no. 5 (a and b) are assumed to correspond to different variant forms of the protein. Addition of RNase A to the isolated 40S fraction prior to DNase I co-precipitation had the general effect of reducing the amount of proteins resolved by 2D analysis. However the same spots appeared to be present regardless of the RNase A treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B, top and bottom). We conclude that actin is associated with a defined subset of hnRNP proteins and that this interaction could be partly dependent on RNA.</p><p>Actin was not eluted off the DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose resin with the urea-containing ISB buffer as shown by 2D gel electrophoresis of the eluted proteins and by western blot analysis using an anti-actin antibody (data not shown). However, when the DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose beads with adsorbed 40S hnRNP proteins were resuspended in Laemmli SDS-containing loading buffer, actin was detected in the gel (data not shown).</p><p>To start characterizing the proteins co-precipitated with DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose we used three monoclonal antibodies raised against hnRNP proteins: 3G1, 1B6 and 9H10. The 3G1 antibody recognizing the <italic>C.tentans</italic> hnRNP protein hrp36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c24">24</xref>) detected three spots in the 40S fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>a), and only two were still present among the proteins pulled-down with DNase I beads (the middle spot is missing) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>b and c). The 1B6 antibody made against <italic>C.tentans</italic> hnRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c36">36</xref>) cross-reacted with rat major hnRNP A&#x0002f;B proteins in the 40S particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>d), but these proteins were not present in the pull-down fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>e and f). Finally, the 9H10 antibody, specific for mammalian hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c37">37</xref>), recognized the rat hnRNP A1 in the 40S fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>g), but this protein did not co-precipitate with actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f2">2</xref>h and j). We conclude that only a specific subset of hnRNP proteins can be co-precipitated with actin from a very complex pre-mRNP 40S fraction. Remarkably, the most abundant hnRNP A&#x0002f;B-type proteins do not seem to be among these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the actin-associated hnRNP proteins</title><p>Immunodetection using specific monoclonal antibodies did not reveal the nature of the proteins co-precipitated with DNase I. Therefore, the five major protein species (labeled 1&#x02013;5 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B) were excised from the 2D Coomassie-stained gels. The two tentative variants of protein no. 5 (a and b) were analyzed both individually and together (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B). The proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin and subsequently subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. A number of peptides were obtained from each spot, and three from each protein were sequenced (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf275tb1">1</xref>). Data bank searching allowed complete identification of the following proteins corresponding to the isolated spots: hnRNP A2 (protein no. 1), hnRNP A3 (no. 2), hnRNP A3 (no. 3), hnRNP A3 (no. 4), DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A (no. 5), all being A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins. As expected, when the spots 5a and 5b were analyzed individually by tandem mass spectrometry, they turned out to be variants of DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A. (For further information on the highly homologous proteins DBP40 and CBF-A, see Discussion.)</p><p>DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A was recorded as two acidic variants of the protein. In the 2D gel, there was also an additional actin-associated protein close to the two DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A variants, which could represent a third variant.</p><p>The actin-associated hnRNP A2 variant (spot 1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B) behaved differently from the predominant rat hnRNP A2 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>A). It was highly enriched when DNase I affinity chromatography fractionation was performed, suggesting that we have identified a not yet characterized low abundance variant of hnRNP A2 with a very basic pI.</p><p>Three variants of hnRNP A3 with widely different p<italic>I</italic>s were co-precipitated with DNase I beads from the 40S fraction. The basic variant (spot 2 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B) probably constitutes a novel variant (see major variants in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>A). The neutral variant (spot 3 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B) has a pI value close to that of the major rat A3 (mBx) variants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>A). However, as it is present in such a low amount, it is probably also a minor variant. The acidic variant (spot 4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>B) behaves similarly to the recombinant <italic>X.laevis</italic> A3 homolog in terms of its acidic pI (data not shown) and is clearly different from the major A3 (mBx) variants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f1">1</xref>A). Thus, two of the actin-associated A3 variants, and presumably all three, represent minor variants of the hnRNP A3 protein.</p><p>In summary, we have identified the major proteins co-precipitated with DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose beads as being the A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP protein DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A, one minor variant of A2 and three minor variants of hnRNP A3.</p></sec><sec><title>Actin is directly associated with DBP40</title><p>As the DBP40 cDNA sequence has recently been reported by Wang and Parrish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c30">30</xref>) and the clone was made available to us, it was feasible to further study the relation between actin and DBP40. Initially, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies with purified actin and DBP40 to establish whether the interaction is direct. T7-tagged DBP40 was translated and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate and subsequently purified by T7-tag antibody affinity chromatography. In addition, an abundant human hnRNP A2 isoform, used as control in the actin-binding experiments, was expressed and purified in the same way as DBP40. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f3">3</xref>A shows an electrophoretic analysis of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled DBP40 and hnRNP A2 proteins used in the binding studies (lanes 1 and 2, respectively).</p><p>To carry through the binding assay, the purified G-actin was first pre-incubated with DNase I beads pre-equilibrated in low ionic strength G-buffer. Following incubation with purified, <sup>35</sup>S-labeled DBP40 or hnRNP A2, the actin&#x0002f;DNase I beads were washed and after heat denaturation the bound proteins were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The gels were fixed and dried, and the proteins detected by autoradiography. Only DBP40 specifically binds actin since DBP40 but not hnRNP A2 was recovered in the bound fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f3">3</xref>B, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). None of the proteins were able to bind to DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose beads lacking actin (lanes 2 and 4). We conclude that DBP40, but not the abundant hnRNP A2 variant, interacts directly with actin <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DBP40 is likely to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm</title><p>To investigate whether DBP40 is present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, we expressed full-length T7-tagged DBP40 by transfecting sub-confluent COS-1 cells with a DBP40 clone inserted into a plasmid vector for mammalian expression. Cells overexpressing DBP40 were then harvested and extracts prepared from nuclei and cytoplasm. To avoid cytoplasmic contaminations the isolated nuclei were thoroughly washed prior to the preparation of the nuclear extract. The proteins were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analyzed by western blotting. Nuclear leakage was excluded by analysis of the distribution of nuclear protein hnRNP C1&#x0002f;C2 (Fig.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). Immunodetection of DBP40 using a monoclonal antibody against the T7 tag indicated that DBP40 is located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2, respectively); the second, lower band in the cytoplasmic extract is likely to be a degradation product. As the monoclonal antibody against the T7-tag did not cross-react with any nuclear and cytoplasmic species in the non-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4), it is assumed to be specific for the overexpressed T7-tagged DBP40 protein. Moreover, we have recently raised an antibody against DBP40 and shown that the endogenous protein is distributed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm in non-transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, DBP40 appears both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p><p>To establish whether DBP40 is exported from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, we performed microinjection experiments. Fluorescein-labeled recombinant DBP40 was co-injected with Texas Red-dextran into the nucleus of simian COS-1 cells. The cells were fixed either immediately or after 90 min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>B). In parallel experiments, DBP40 and albumin, both labeled with fluorescein, were separately injected into simian COS-1 nuclei and incubated for 90 min as above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>C). Both experiments showed that DBP40 had been partly transported to the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>B and C), whereas both dextran (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>B) and BSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f4">4</xref>C) remained confined to the nucleus. Thus, DBP40 is exported into the cytoplasm. Fluorescein-labeled DBP40 was subsequently injected into the cytoplasm of COS-1 cells. After 15&#x000a0;min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C the protein accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting a fast import kinetics (data not shown). These results, together with the cellular distribution revealed in DBP40-transfected cells, suggest that DBP40 is a shuttling A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP protein.</p></sec><sec><title>DBP40 binds to mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To determine whether DBP40 also binds to mRNA, cells overexpressing DBP40 were exposed to UV light to promote formation of covalently cross-linked protein&#x02013;RNA complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c19">19</xref>). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were then prepared from UV-irradiated cells, and after SDS treatment the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNP complexes were bound to oligo-dT Sepharose beads. Following stringent washes, bound RNA&#x02013;protein complexes were eluted with low ionic strength buffers and then precipitated. The samples were subsequently RNase-treated and resuspended in SDS-loading buffer prior to heat denaturation. The proteins were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analyzed by western blotting. As expected, hnRNP C1&#x0002f;C2, used as control, was cross-linked to nuclear but not cytoplasmic poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f5">5</xref>, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). DBP40 cross-linked to nuclear poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA too (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f5">5</xref>, lane 5), but in addition to cytoplasmic poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f5">5</xref>, lane 6). Neither C1&#x0002f;C2 nor DBP40 proteins co-purified with the RNA if the UV irradiation was omitted (see lanes 3 and 4, and 7 and 8, respectively). We conclude that DBP40 is associated with poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and appears to accompany the mRNA sequence during the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Actin binds to DBP40 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To establish whether actin and DBP40 are associated in living cells, transfected COS-1 cells overexpressing T7-tagged DBP40 were treated with the membrane-permeable, cleavable cross-linking reagent DSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c8">8</xref>). Cross-linked nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were treated with urea to abolish non-cross-linked protein interactions, and DBP40 with associated proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7-tag antibody agarose beads; samples not treated with urea were analyzed in parallel. After cleavage of the cross-linker by boiling, the proteins were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and actin and DBP40 were detected by western blotting using a monoclonal anti-T7-tag antibody and an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-actin antibody, respectively. In the absence of cross-linker, actin was co-precipitated with DBP40 both from a nuclear and from a cytoplasmic extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f6">6</xref>A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively), but no actin was recorded after urea treatment (lanes 2 and 4, respectively). The binding of DBP40 to the antibody column was not affected by urea (lanes 2 and 4). In the presence of cross-linker, actin remained partly bound to the DBP40 column even after urea treatment of the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf275f6">6</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). We conclude that actin and DBP40 are directly bound <italic>in vivo</italic> and are part of the same complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Actin is associated with a subset of hnRNP proteins in pre-mRNP particles</title><p>We have now shown that actin is associated with a specific subset of rat liver hnRNP proteins present in a 40S hnRNP particle preparation. The proteins were isolated by DNase I affinity chromatography, fractionated by 2D gel electrophoresis, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. The following five proteins were recorded: DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A, a minor hnRNP A2 variant and three minor hnRNP A3 (mBx) variants. These five proteins all belong to the A&#x0002f;B type of hnRNP proteins, which can be resolved by 2D gel electrophoresis into a large number of isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c14">14</xref>). The diversity among related hnRNP proteins is mainly generated by differential splicing of common RNA precursors but post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, methylation of arginine and glycosylation) contribute as well. Most of the abundant rat hnRNP proteins, including hnRNP A1, B1 and B2 proteins and the major variants of hnRNP A2 and A3, are not part of the DNase I co-precipitated fraction, emphasizing that the actin-associated hnRNP proteins represent a well defined subset of hnRNP proteins.</p><p>The A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins are likely to be bound to pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c13">13</xref>), which was directly shown in the present study for DBP40 using UV cross-linking. Such a conclusion is in good agreement with a recent study by Inoue <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c38">38</xref>), in which it was demonstrated that CBF-A is present in hnRNP particles sedimenting in sucrose gradients up to 200S or more. We conclude that the actin-associated A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins are likely to be present in pre-mRNP particles and in a specific subset of the 40S hnRNP particles prepared from pre-mRNPs.</p><p>In the present study, DBP40&#x0002f;CBF-A appears as two (and possibly three) variants, which are all associated with actin. DBP40 was first described as a feline protein that can bind to parvovirus single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c30">30</xref>), while CBF-A was discovered as a mouse CArG box-binding factor A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c39">39</xref>). The feline DBP40 and mouse CBF-A are likely to be homologs with an overall amino acid sequence identity of 92&#x00025;. DBP40 and CBF-A belongs to a subfamily of highly homologous A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins, presently comprising 10 members from five species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c40">40</xref>). Some of the proteins bind to DNA and are believed to participate in the replication of DNA, e.g. DBP40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c30">30</xref>), or in transcriptional regulation, e.g. CBF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c42">42</xref>) and ssDBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c43">43</xref>), while others bind to RNA and are proposed to be involved in post-transcriptional processes, e.g. ABBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c44">44</xref>). Some of the proteins might also have dual functions; for example, as mentioned above, the transcriptional regulator CBF-A is associated with RNA in hnRNP particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c38">38</xref>), suggesting that it might also function post-transcriptionally. The fact that the proteins of this subfamily are strikingly similar along their whole lengths and still coupled to widely different cellular processes might suggest that they exert a structural role and perhaps organize the DNA or RNA into well defined higher order structures, a role proposed for A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c13">13</xref>).</p><p>The hnRNP A2 and hnRNP A3 variants associated with actin are low abundance hnRNP proteins and, in particular, the basic variants become highly enriched upon DNase I fractionation. The only functional information available concerns the abundant hnRNP A2 variant. This protein is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c19">19</xref>) and plays a role in vectorial transport of mRNA in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c21">21</xref>) and enhances cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c22">22</xref>). However, in this study the major A2 variant does not associate with actin, and the minor A2 and A3 variants studied here could exert other functions. In fact, there is good evidence that the variants of a given hnRNP protein play different roles in mRNA metabolism. The polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and hnRNP D represent two striking examples of this principle. PTB has three different isoforms, which have distinct activities in both alternative splicing and IRES-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c45">45</xref>). The hnRNP D protein regulates mRNA turnover by acting as an RNA destabilizing protein specifically binding to AU-rich mRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c46">46</xref>). The four isoforms known show different destabilizing effects on the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c46">46</xref>). We conclude that the minor A2 and A3 variants associated with actin could function in RNA targeting and translation like the abundant hnRNP A2 variant but other roles should also be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>The nature of the interaction between actin and the pre-mRNP particle</title><p>The DNase I chromatography experiment showed that DBP40 and minor variants of hnRNP A2 and A3 are associated with actin. To start to establish whether the interaction between actin and the hnRNP proteins is direct or indirect, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution experiment with purified actin and recombinant DBP40. The result revealed that actin can bind to DBP40, suggesting that actin is interacting directly with DBP40 in the pre-mRNP particle. As DBP40 is also capable of binding RNA, it seems to form a bridge between actin and the pre-mRNA molecule. The corresponding reconstitution experiments could not be carried out with the A2 and A3 variants as cDNA clones for these minor protein variants are not yet available. Therefore, it is still an open question whether actin interacts directly with each one of the five identified, actin-associated hnRNP proteins, or whether it only binds to DBP40, while the other four hnRNP proteins are coupled to DBP40 via protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>It is also an open question whether actin is in a globular (G) or filamentous (F) form when binding to the pre-mRNP particle. Nuclear actin can appear in individual microfilaments and even as bundles of microfilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c2">2</xref>), but biochemical studies have shown that by far most nuclear actin appears in a monomeric or short oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies with fluorescent phalloidin, a drug specific to filamentous actin, have usually shown that the cytoplasm but not the nucleus is stained in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c1">1</xref>). Finally, actin-containing Balbiani ring mRNP particles in the nucleus are often not associated with any fibrous structures as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c12">12</xref>). Thus, most of the available evidence suggests that actin associated with pre-mRNP&#x0002f;mRNP particles is in a monomeric or short oligomeric form, a conclusion also drawn by Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The actin&#x02013;DBP40 complex presumably enters the cytoplasm bound to mRNA</title><p>Similarly to other A&#x0002f;B-type hnRNP proteins, e.g. hnRNP A1 and A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c19">19</xref>), we show that DBP40 is likely to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The transfection experiment demonstrated that DBP40 appears in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the microinjection experiments directly showed that DBP40 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, i.e. DBP40 is likely to shuttle. The cross-linking experiments revealed that DBP40 is bound to the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA as well as to actin both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, it seems likely, although it still remains to be proven, that the DBP40&#x02013;actin complex, along with the associated minor variants of hnRNP A2 and A3, is bound to mRNA during the nucleocytoplasmic transfer.</p><p>In the dipteran <italic>C.tentans</italic>, we have shown that the A&#x0002f;B-type hrp36 protein is bound to actin, and the complex is associated with Balbiani ring pre-mRNA&#x0002f;mRNA from the gene in the cell nucleus to the polysomes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c12">12</xref>). Thus, the rat DBP40 behaves similarly to the insect hrp36 in the sense that it binds actin in the nucleus and is transported into the cytoplasm coupled to mRNA. However, the mammalian data clearly suggests a more complex interaction between actin and hnRNP proteins in the pre-mRNP&#x0002f;mRNP particles, as actin is associated, directly or indirectly, with at least five different A&#x0002f;B-type proteins. Whether these proteins form a distinct supramolecular entity binding actin or whether they interact with actin as separate molecules remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible roles of RNP-associated actin</title><p>In order to understand the role of actin present in the RNP particles, both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions have to be considered because the actin&#x02013;DBP40 complex seems to be associated with the RNA throughout the processes of transcription, splicing, transport and translation just like the <italic>C.tentans</italic> actin&#x02013;hrp36 complex. Since actin binds to nascent pre-mRNP, it is possible that it mediates packaging of the pre-mRNA into an RNP particle and could thus affect the processing of pre-mRNA. Another possibility would be that actin is involved in intranuclear movement and&#x0002f;or nucleocytoplasmic transport. This latter possibility is supported by a recent study indicating that actin is involved in nuclear export of viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c11">11</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that actin contains functional leucine-rich, nuclear export signals, possibly mediating the export of mRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c48">48</xref>).</p><p>In the cytoplasm, the actin&#x02013;DBP40 complex bound to the mRNA could influence translation, mRNA turnover or mRNA transport, all processes known to be affected by hnRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c14">14</xref>). A large fraction of mRNA is known to be associated with cytoskeletal structures and in particular with actin microfilaments which may serve a role for RNA transport and&#x0002f;or localization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c49">49</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the cellular microfilament network also plays a direct role in the structure and function of the translation system and perturbations of this&#x000a0;&#x000a0;network affect protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf275c50">50</xref>). Therefore, if the RNA-associated actin proves to be functional in the cytoplasm, either in its G-form or F-form, it could be essential that actin becomes coupled to the mRNA already in the nucleus and is linked to the mRNA entering the cytoplasm. This could demonstrate a requirement for mRNA to undergo a nuclear preparatory event, involving actin and a subset of hnRNP proteins, in order to function properly in the cytoplasm.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf275f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> 2D electrophoretic analysis of the proteins in 40S pre-mRNP particles and of a subset bound to DNase I&#x02013;Sepharose.
