Several lines of evidence suggest that Stm1p plays a role in translation under nutrient stress conditions, although its mechanism of action is not yet known. In this study, we show that yeast lacking Stm1p (<italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394;) are hypersensitive to the translation inhibitor anisomycin, which affects the peptidyl transferase reaction in translation elongation, but show little hypersensitivity to other translation inhibitors such as paromomycin and hygromycin B, which affect translation fidelity. Ribosomes isolated from <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast have intrinsically elevated levels of eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (eEF3) associated with them. Overexpression of eEF3 in cells lacking Stm1p results in a growth defect phenotype and increased anisomycin sensitivity. In addition, ribosomes with increased levels of Stm1p exhibit decreased association with eEF3. Taken together, our data indicate that Stm1p plays a complementary role to eEF3 in translation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> gene <italic>STM1</italic> and its encoded protein Stm1p have been implicated in myriad biological processes, including apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, telomere biosynthesis, cell-life span regulation, messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation and nutritional stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">1&#x02013;11</xref>). However, it is not inherently obvious how a single protein is able to influence so many different biological processes. One possible explanation is that Stm1p is involved in a general process, such as protein synthesis, that, in turn, has an impact upon a whole host of cellular functions. While Stm1p was originally identified as a G*G multiplex nucleic-acid-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), we showed that Stm1p is primarily a cytoplasmic protein that preferentially associates with 80S ribosomes and polysomes, which are the &#x02018;engines&#x02019; of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We also found that Stm1p significantly affected rates of protein synthesis under nutrient stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, a role of Stm1p in protein synthesis could help explain the variety of biological processes affected by it.</p><p>Translation consists of three steps: initiation, elongation and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Each step is facilitated by a variety of auxiliary proteins known as initiation, elongation and termination factors, many of which are functionally conserved among all organisms. Two elongation factors are key for the peptide chain elongation reaction, and both are highly conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Elongation factor 1 (eEF1A in eukaryotes and EF-Tu in prokaryotes) is responsible for binding cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomal A-site; elongation factor 2 (eEF2 in eukaryotes and EF-G in prokaryotes) is involved in translocating both mRNA and tRNA from the A-site to the P-site following peptidyl transfer. However, yeast and certain other fungi possess an additional elongation factor, eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (eEF3), which is indispensable for translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>YEF3</italic> gene encodes eEF3, which is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Yeast eEF3 is a 116 000-kDa protein that possesses ribosome-stimulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). eEF3 interacts with both ribosomal subunits and facilitates eEF1A-mediated cognate aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27">22&#x02013;27</xref>). While a great deal is known about the role of eEF3 in translation elongation, details about its regulatory role in this process remain unknown.</p><p>Although we have previously shown that Stm1p affected protein synthesis under nutrient deprivation conditions and polysome profiles in the presence of rapamycin, we do not yet know the exact role that Stm1p plays in translation. Using Stm1p mutants and both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, we found that Stm1p perturbs the normal association of eEF3 with ribosomes and affects translation elongation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Yeast strains, media and microbiological methods</title><p>Yeast strains investigated include K699 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,-15 leu2-3,-112 ssd1-&#x00394; trp1-1 ura3</italic>) BY4741 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>his3&#x00394;1 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0</italic>) and their respective <italic>stm1&#x00394;</italic> mutants, D28 and 4107.

Yeast were routinely propagated in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 1% dextrose) at 30&#x000b0;C. For particular experiments, yeast were propagated in either synthetic minimal (SD) or synthetic complete (SC) medium supplemented with or lacking the appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases for the strains under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

For example, anisomycin competes with the binding of the 3&#x02032; end of aminoacyl-tRNA to the peptidyltransferase center, thereby inhibiting translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Cycloheximide, in addition to its inhibition of translation initiation at low concentrations, can also inhibit polypeptide chain translocation when present at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The aminoglycoside antibiotics hygromycin B and paromomycin affect translation through dual mechanisms, both by distorting the ribosomal A site, which causes the misreading of aminoacyl-tRNAs, and by inhibiting ribosomal translocation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We observed no differences in colony size or number of yeast cultures grown on rich medium containing inhibitory concentrations of cycloheximide (0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml), paromomycin (200 &#x003bc;g/ml) or hygromycin B (50 &#x000b5;g/ml) (data not shown). We found that only anisomycin (20 &#x000b5;g/ml) had an appreciable but small inhibitory effect on <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Because we had previously observed that the greatest phenotypic differences with <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; occurred under nutrient deprivation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), we investigated the antibiotic sensitivity of <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast grown on SD medium supplemented with a minimal set of required amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Under these conditions, we found that anisomycin strongly inhibited the growth of <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast, whereas cycloheximide only slightly reduced growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Moreover, we found that neither hygromycin B nor paromomycin had any appreciable effect on the growth of either wild-type or <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast. Taken together, these data indicate that certain protein synthesis inhibitors that affect translation elongation have an inhibitory effect on yeast growth in the absence of Stm1p, especially under supplemented minimal medium conditions. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Yeast lacking Stm1p are more sensitive to certain protein synthesis inhibitors.

To better understand whether Stm1p affects any translation elongation factors, we purified 80S ribosomes from wild-type and <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and analyzed the proteins present in these samples by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Although most proteins associated with 80S ribosomes were found in similar amounts in either wild-type or <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains, there were a few candidates that were present in greater amounts in ribosomes isolated from one or the other yeast strain. One protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa, was identified as Stm1p and was present in wild type but not <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast extracts. Another differentially observed protein was a 115-kDa species that was substantially more abundant in 80S ribosomes from <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast than in those from wild-type yeast. This protein was identified as yeast eEF3 (Yef3p) by peptide fingerprinting (data not shown). Thus, these biochemical data indicate that Stm1p affects the equilibrium binding of eEF3 to ribosomes. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Increased association of eEF3 with ribosomes in the absence of Stm1p.

Note that these ribosomal species were prepared in the absence of cycloheximide, which is usually added to prevent continued translation elongation and loss of ribosomes associating with mRNA. The ribosomal protein L3, which is normally present in the 60S large ribosomal subunit, 80S monosomes and polysomes, was used as an internal control. As we previously observed, there were no appreciable differences in the distribution or sedimentation properties of the different ribosomal species obtained from wild-type and <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This result was further confirmed by the similar L3 protein distribution in both gradients. Stm1p was predominantly distributed in 80S monosomes and to a lesser extent in polysomes, which is also consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, we noted a striking difference in the eEF3 protein distribution in ribosomes either possessing or lacking Stm1p. When Stm1p was present, eEF3 was approximately equally distributed between a low-sedimentation species, thought to be &#x02018;free&#x02019; eEF3 protein, and eEF3 that co-sedimented with 80S monosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Very little eEF3 was detected in the polysome fractions. However, when Stm1p was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), the levels of eEF3 associated with 80S monosomes and lighter polysomes were substantially higher than eEF3 levels when Stm1p was present. Taken together, these data suggest that Stm1p negatively influences the equilibrium binding of eEF3 to ribosomes, which is consistent with our observation that increased amounts of eEF3 associate with ribosomes lacking Stm1p.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of eEF3 exacerbates the reduced cell growth phenotype, decreased protein synthesis, increased polysomes and increased eEF3 : ribosome association observed in <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains</title><p>Based on the above results linking the function of eEF3 to Stm1p, we used a genetic approach to test the effects of eEF3 overexpression on cell viability in the presence or absence of Stm1p. Yeast strain BY4741 or its isogenic counterpart <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; was transformed with plasmid YLR249W, which allowed galactose-inducible overexpression of the yeast eEF3 protein, or the control vector pBG1805. Overexpression of eEF3 in cells possessing Stm1p conferred a reduced cell growth phenotype compared to that observed with cells possessing endogenous levels of eEF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Reduced cell growth was also observed with an isogenic <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; strain possessing endogenous levels of eEF3 when propagated in a galactose-containing medium. Notably, when eEF3 was overexpressed in a strain lacking Stm1p, a dramatic growth inhibition was observed. Addition of anisomycin exacerbated the reduced growth phenotypes observed when eEF3 was overexpressed or when Stm1p was absent and caused increased anisomycin sensitivity in <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast overexpressing eEF3. Thus, under growth conditions with minimal medium, the absence of Stm1p can exacerbate the slow growth phenotypes resulting from eEF3 overexpression and anisomycin treatment. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>In the absence of Stm1p, eEF3 overexpression exacerbates the cell grow defect, reduces translational efficiency and increases eEF3 : ribosome association.

In this experiment, L3 protein served as a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp645f3"/></fig></p><p>Yeast eEF3 has a well-established function in translation, where it is thought to facilitate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">15&#x02013;19</xref>). Likewise, there exists some evidence that the observed phenotypes resulting from <italic>STM1</italic> deletion are the result of its role in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To investigate whether the complementary effects of these two proteins on cell growth could be the result of changes in translation efficiency, bulk protein synthesis in wild-type and <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; BY4741 yeast strains, either with endogenous eEF3 levels or overexpressing eEF3, was investigated using a [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Under the conditions tested, both <italic>STM1</italic> deletion and eEF3 overexpression had similar effects on protein synthesis, with a 36% reduction of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine incorporation into proteins after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). However, when both <italic>STM1</italic> was deleted and eEF3 was overexpressed, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine incorporation was suppressed by 72%. These data demonstrate that the absence of Stm1p and overexpression of yeast eEF3 have additive effects on the process of translation.</p><p>An effect of <italic>STM1</italic> deletion on translation should be observed through changes in polysome profiles. For example, when translation elongation is inhibited one often observes an increase in polysomes relative to the 80S ribosome peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). We found that wild-type BY4741 yeast overexpressing eEF3 exhibited a slight increase in polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Comparing the area under the polysome peaks to that under the 80S peak, we measured a polysome to 80S ratio (P/80S) of 0.80, which was slightly greater than the polysomes : 80S ratio observed for wild-type BY4741 harboring a control plasmid (P/80S = 0.51). A more pronounced increase in polysomes was observed with <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; BY4741 yeast (P/80S = 1.16), with the greatest increase being found for <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; BY4741 yeast overexpressing eEF3 (P/80S = 1.23). Taken together, these data support the contention that <italic>STM1</italic> deletion and/or eEF3 overexpression negatively impact translation elongation.</p><p>We also analyzed the amount of eEF3 protein from cell lysates by western blot analysis to determine whether Stm1p influenced cellular levels of the eEF3 protein. Basal levels of the eEF3 protein were similar in both wild-type and <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Likewise, the extent to which eEF3 could be overexpressed was comparable in both strains. Thus, Stm1p apparently does not appreciably affect the homeostasis of eEF3. Similarly, levels of Stm1p were unchanged when eEF3 was overexpressed. Thus, eEF3 does not appreciably affect the homeostasis of Stm1p. Next, we determined whether the observed growth defect correlated with increased levels of eEF3 associated with ribosomes. Ribosomes from wild-type and <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains, both with and without eEF3 overexpression, were purified by centrifugation through sucrose gradients and the proteins associated with 80S ribosomes were analyzed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Regardless of whether endogenous eEF3 levels were present or eEF3 was overexpressed, the amount of eEF3 associated with 80S ribosomes was dramatically increased in ribosomal fractions from <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains as compared with isogenic wild-type strains. Notably, the amount of Stm1p found associating with ribosomes was not affected by the overexpression of eEF3. These data demonstrate a direct correlation between the observed cell-growth inhibition and the amount of eEF3 associated with ribosomes, suggesting a functional relationship between eEF3 and Stm1p <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosomes with increased levels of Stm1p exhibit decreased eEF3 association</title><p>Because we found that ribosomes from <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strains exhibited increased eEF3 association, we hypothesized that Stm1p negatively regulates the amount of eEF3 associated with ribosomes. We sought reciprocal support for this model by testing the effects of Stm1p overexpression on eEF3 association with ribosomes. Given that Stm1p has been shown to be a target for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), we chose to pursue these studies using the proteasome defective strain AVL78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Yeast strain AVL78 was transformed with plasmid YLR150W, which allows galactose-inducible overexpression of Stm1p, or the control vector pBG1805. Overexpression of Stm1p in these cells conferred a substantially reduced growth phenotype compared to yeast with endogenous levels of Stm1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This reduced growth was correlated with an initial reduction in total protein synthesis, although the rate of protein synthesis was similar at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This apparent delay in protein synthesis may be, in part, a result of the impaired proteasome function in these cells, which allows accumulation of otherwise relatively labile proteins. In addition, the observed reduction in protein synthesis correlated with an increase in heavy polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, P/80S increased from 0.63 to 1.07), suggesting that Stm1p overexpression might inhibit translation elongation. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Overexpression of Stm1p in a proteasome-deficient strain (AVL78) led to decreased amounts of eEF3 associated with ribosomes.

We found that yeast overexpressing Stm1p demonstrated an accumulation of a more slowly migrating species that cross-reacted with anti-Stm1p antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Accumulation of this high-molecular-weight species had no effect on cellular eEF3 or actin levels. Given that Stm1p overexpression was performed in a proteasome-deficient yeast strain, we hypothesized that the high-molecular-weight species corresponded to ubiquitinated Stm1p. This hypothesis was verified with an immunoprecipitation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Curiously, no apparent increase in levels of normally migrating Stm1p was observed when Stm1p was overexpressed. This result suggests that Stm1p levels may be tightly regulated in cells to ensure that excess Stm1p does not accumulate.</p><p>To test the effects of Stm1p overexpression on the complement of proteins associating with ribosomes, we used ultracentrifugation of whole-cell extracts to obtain ribosomes and their constituent proteins from yeast both with or without overexpression of Stm1p.

We found that overexpression of Stm1p led to an increased amount of ubiquitinated Stm1p associated with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). Correspondingly, we found decreased amounts of eEF3 associated with ribosomes from cells overexpressing Stm1p. This experiment confirms our hypothesis that Stm1p negatively regulates the amount of eEF3 associated with ribosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that yeast lacking the ribosome-associated protein Stm1p exhibited increased sensitivity to specific protein synthesis inhibitors, e.g. anisomycin and cycloheximide, especially when propagated in minimal medium. The effect of <italic>STM1</italic> deletion on the sensitivity of the cells to anisomycin provides good <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of a role for Stm1p in translational elongation. We also found that ribosomes lacking Stm1p had elevated levels of the yeast-specific elongation factor eEF3 associated with them as compared with wild-type ribosomes. In addition, we found that when ribosomes had elevated levels of associated Stm1p, they exhibited decreased levels of eEF3 association. Similarly, overexpression of eEF3 in cells lacking Stm1p resulted in an enhanced growth defect, which notably correlated strongly with elevated levels of eEF3 associated with ribosomes. Taken together, these genetic and biochemical data suggest that Stm1p is important for eEF3 function, presumably by affecting the proper association of eEF3 with 80S ribosomes.</p><p>One of the best ways of determining how Stm1p affects translation <italic>in vivo</italic> is to investigate Stm1p-dependent changes in ribosome distribution following sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. We observed that the absence of Stm1p caused a notable increase in polysomes, which was exacerbated by eEF3 overexpression. Similarly, depletion or inactivation of the yeast translation factor eIF5A was shown to cause a pronounced increase in polysomes and inhibit translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Given that our methionine incorporation experiments indicated decreased protein synthesis in <italic>stm1</italic>&#x00394; yeast that was exacerbated by eEF3 overexpression, these data strongly support the contention that the absence of Stm1p affects translation elongation in a cooperative fashion with eEF3. In addition, overexpression of Stm1p caused both an increase in heavy polysomes and a decrease in protein synthesis. Such is reminiscent of human ribosomal S5 protein expression in yeast, which demonstrated an increase in heavy polysomes and a decrease in eEF3-ribosome interactions, thereby affecting translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, there may be an ideal range of Stm1p and eEF3 concentrations that permit optimal translation elongation.</p><p>Previously, we found that Stm1p exists in a 1:1 complex with 80S ribosomes and interacts with both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The interface between ribosomal subunits is well-known to be very important for ribosomal function, as it is the interaction site for aminoacyl-tRNA and the canonical elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2. As mutations or deletions of genes directly involved in translation elongation usually lead to a lethal phenotype or substantial alterations in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43 B44 B45">40&#x02013;45</xref>), we postulate that Stm1p most likely does not have an overlapping interaction site with eEF1A and eEF2. Cryo-electron microscopy of the eEF3-80S ribosome complex has indicated that eEF3 interacts with both the large and small ribosomal subunits but at a different site than those recognized by eEF1A and eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The fact that eEF3 has a completely different binding site from the canonical elongation factors is consistent with the observation that in the absence of Stm1p more eEF3 associates with ribosomes. It is of interest to note that sequence alignments between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> eEF3 (Yef3p) and Stm1p show some degree of sequence similarity, especially in the C-terminal regions of each protein (Pickering,B., unpublished data). However, this sequence similarity is not conserved in homologs of these proteins found in other yeasts and lower fungi. In fact, the most significant sequence homology between these different eEF3 and Stm1p proteins maps to the C-terminal end of eEF3, which is rich in arginine and lysine residues, and basic patches within the C-terminal region of Stm1p. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that eEF3 and Stm1p share overlapping ribosome-binding sites recognized by these basic domains.</p><p>Translocation of tRNAs in yeast ribosomes during translation elongation requires two canonical elongation factors, eEF1A and eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). eEF1A facilitates cognate aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A-site in 80S ribosomes. Following the peptidyl transferase reaction, eEF2 facilitates the translocation of deacylated tRNA from the P- to the E-site and aminoacyl-tRNA from the A- to the P-site. Afterwards, eEF3, which is thought to interact with 80S ribosomes near the E-site, facilitating dissociation of deacyl-tRNA from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These findings are consistent with the allosteric model of translation, whereby release of tRNA from the E-site in turn facilitates occupancy of the A-site with cognate aminoacyl-tRNA, thereby permitting efficient translation elongation. Andersen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) have proposed a detailed model for the specific role of eEF3 in the translation elongation cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This model involves the following steps: (i) weak binding of eEF3 to post-translocation ribosomes with the deacyl-tRNA &#x02018;locked&#x02019; in the ribosome E-site by an &#x02018;in&#x02019;-position L1 stalk and the 40S head; (ii) a conformational change in eEF3, which is caused by ATP binding, which results in higher-affinity ribosome binding and the repositioning of the L1 stalk to an &#x02018;out&#x02019; position; and (iii) eEF3 conformation-promoted ATP hydrolysis, resulting in eEF3 dissociation from the ribosome, E-site opening and unlocking of the 40S head. This last step allows the eEF1A&#x02013;GTP&#x02013;aminoacyl-tRNA complex to bind to the ribosomal A-site and deacyl-tRNA to be released from the E-site, allowing a subsequent round of elongation to ensue. Our data are consistent with a model in which ribosome-bound Stm1p tempers binding of eEF3 to 80S ribosomes. This could occur through Stm1p directly competing with eEF3-ribosome binding, promoting eEF3 ATPase activity and/or facilitating an eEF3 or ribosome conformational change that permits efficient dissociation of eEF3 from ribosomes following ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of Stm1p, eEF3 may not efficiently dissociate from ribosomes, potentially leading to an unproductive cycle of ATP binding, eEF3 conformational change and ATP hydrolysis. The failure of eEF3 to dissociate from the ribosome could prevent the release of deacyl-tRNA from the E-site and binding of eEF1A&#x02013;GTP&#x02013;aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site, thereby retarding these final steps in the cycle of translation elongation. In addition, these effects are likely be exacerbated when concentrations of deacyl-tRNA are elevated and/or aminoacyl-tRNAs are depressed, exactly the circumstances that occur during nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Similarly, given that the net effect of anisomycin on protein synthesis is to block aminoacyl-tRNA access to the ribosome peptidyltransferase center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), this provides an explanation for the observed increased sensitivity of yeast lacking Stm1p or overexpressing eEF3 to this particular antibiotic. We believe that Stm1p, when bound to the ribosome, facilitates the release of the ATP-hydrolyzed conformation of eEF3, thereby permitting efficient translation elongation. However, high concentrations of Stm1p could also inhibit eEF3-80S ribosome binding and thereby reduce translation elongation, which we observed. The exact mechanism by which Stm1p binds to the ribosome and affects the function of eEF3 awaits further structural data and is currently under investigation. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Role of Stm1p in translation elongation. Shown is a model of the yeast elongation cycle. Starting at the top left, Stm1p at high concentrations can inhibit the association of eEF3 (green ellipse) to post-translocation ribosomes. After ATP binding, which causes an elongated eEF3 conformation and unlocking of the E-site by moving the ribosome L1 stalk, bound Stm1p (red ellipse) can facilitate eEF3 dissociation from the ribosome and prevent reassociation. With eEF3 absent from the ribosome, the ternary complex eEF1A&#x02013;GTP&#x02013;aminoacyl-tRNA can then associate, delivering aminoacyl-tRNA (blue ellipse) to the ribosome A-site and releasing deacyl-tRNA (orange ellipse) from the E-site, steps inhibited by the antibiotic anisomycin (An). In the absence of Stm1p, eEF3 can inappropriately associate with ribosomes, thereby inhibiting subsequent ternary complex binding and deacyl-tRNA release and inhibiting efficient elongation, especially under conditions of translational stress (e.g. nutrient deprivation or antibiotic inhibition).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp645f5"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grant G-1199 from the Robert A.
