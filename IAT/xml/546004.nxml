One such mechanism, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), was discovered about twenty years ago in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and then described in human inherited diseases caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which introduce premature termination codons (PTCs). Contrary to what would be predicted based on the nature of the mutation (a premature translational arrest), the resulting nonsense mRNAs rarely code for truncated protein products and are rather rapidly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hence, NMD was first envisaged as a mean to protect cells against the effects of deleterious truncated proteins, with potential dominant-negative effects or a gain of function. Moreover, it seems that NMD has not solely evolved under the pressure of nonsense mRNAs originating from mutations but it also monitors PTC-containing transcripts arising from abnormalities in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. NMD plays a role in normal cellular development as examplified by the production of functional TcR and Ig genes. During lymphocyte maturation, these genes are subjected to extensive rearrangements and somatic mutation events. Approximately two-thirds of the rearranged genes are not in the proper translational reading frame and the resulting transcripts are down-regulated by NMD, ensuring that only functional TcR and Ig genes are expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. More recently, it was suggested that NMD could play a role in the regulation of gene expression. This was first suspected following the identification of unproductive splicing products of the SRp20 and SRp30b proteins or the ribosomal proteins L3, L7a, L10a and L12 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The coupling of alternative splicing, which generates transcripts containing PTCs and NMD, which degrades these transcripts, enables the negative regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This system, termed RUST (for Regulated Unproductive Splicing and Translation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) is also used in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It was suggested that alternative splicing leading to NMD might prove to be a common mechanism of autoregulation of many splicing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), which generally acts as a splicing repressor, downregulates its own expression by repressing exon 11 inclusion in the mature mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The resulting alternative PTB mRNA lacking exon 11 contains a PTC and is subjected to NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This negative autoregulation prevents the accumulation of PTB, and therefore the inappropriate processing of its targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This coupling of alternative splicing and NMD seems to be a rather common mechanism, as <italic>in silico </italic>analyses show that 35% of EST-suggested alternative transcripts contain PTCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Alternative splicing is thought to occur in 30&#x02013;60% of human genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and in addition to expanding proteome diversity, it may play a role in gene expression regulation by generating PTC-containing alternative isoforms. Interestingly, 10 to 30% of nonsense transcripts can escape NMD and are further immune to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whether such transcripts code for proteins with a physiological function is unknown.</p><p>Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH, E.C. 3.7.1.2) is the last enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. A deficiency in FAH causes hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI; OMIM 276700), the most severe disease of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This inherited metabolic disorder is characterized by severe hepatic and renal dysfunctions often resulting in death in the first years of life if untreated. HTI displays phenotypic heterogeneity with both chronic and acute forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The <italic>fah </italic>coding gene located on chromosome 15 in the q23-q25 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] spans over 35 kb and contains 14 exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Forty-seven mutations have been identified so far in the <italic>fah </italic>gene, including 7 nonsense mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. While characterizing the effects of the W262X nonsense mutation on FAH mRNA metabolism, we identified two alternative transcripts, del100 and del231 in a HTI patient homozygous for W262X. These transcripts are found in normal cells and thus are not due to the nonsense mutation <italic>per se</italic>. Interestingly, del100 has skipped exon 8 and as a consequence, the reading frame is shifted, with the appearance of several new PTCs. This transcript is therefore likely subjected to NMD, as suggested by a block of translation by cycloheximide. However, the amount of nonsense transcript which escapes NMD seems to be sufficient to produce a protein of 31-kDa, detected in several human tissues. This report suggests that NMD may allow for the production of low amounts of protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of two alternative transcripts of the <italic>fah </italic>gene</title><p>The W262X mutation is a G-&#x0003e;A transversion located in exon 9 of the <italic>fah </italic>gene at nucleotide position 786 and is frequent in the Finnish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. No protein was detected in the liver or the fibroblasts of homozygous patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with this type of mutation, we demonstrated that W262X mRNAs are degraded by NMD in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. While studying the decay of W262X nonsense FAH transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we repeatedly observed two additional RT-PCR products in homozygous W262X/W262X cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Purification and sequence analysis of these two products revealed that they were alternative transcripts of the <italic>fah </italic>gene. The first one, del100, lacks exon 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and the second one, del231, which is less abundant, lacks both exons 8 and 9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In del100, the skipping of exon 8 from the mature transcript causes a shift in the reading frame and as a consequence, several new PTCs appear, the first one being located at the 3' end of exon 10, at the new amino acid position 270 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The G786A mutation does not code for a stop codon in del100 but causes the replacement of a glycine by a glutamate residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Del231 does not show further disruption of the open reading frame downstream of the deletion and is predicted to code for a shorter FAH-like protein (about 34-kDa) missing the region encoded by exons 8 and 9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>Del100 and del231 were first identified in the liver of a patient harboring another mutation (Q279R), which weakens the donor splice site of exon 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because the W262X mutation is located in the same exon and that in some cases a nonsense codon can affect splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we wondered whether these two transcripts were due to an effect of the W262X mutation on a cis-acting splicing element in exon 9. To test this hypothesis, RT-PCRs were performed using primers spanning the exon7-exon9 junction or the exon7-exon10 junction to specifically amplify del100 and del231 respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, both del100 and del231 transcripts were detected by this method, in homozygous mutant cells (W262X/W262X; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, middle panel), as well as in normal cells (wt/wt; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, middle panel). The identity of these amplification products was verified by sequencing (data not shown). A similar result was found in various human cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel). Indeed, del100 and del231 were amplified in fibroblasts, HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel) and in human liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel), the tissue where FAH is the most expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, del100 was amplified in two HTI cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which harbor either a splice mutation in intron 12 (IVS12/IVS12; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) or two nonsense mutations in exon 13 (E357X/E364X; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Del231 was not detected in these two cell lines as expected, since these mutations introduce PTCs either following exon 12 skipping (IVS12/IVS12) or due to the two nonsense mutations themselves (E357X and E364X), that likely target the nonsense transcripts to the NMD pathway.</p><p>Altogether, these data strongly argue in favor of del100 and del231 being minor alternative transcripts of the <italic>fah </italic>gene, rather than resulting from the presence of the W262X mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>The del100 transcript is translated into a protein</title><p>The identification of two minor alternative transcripts of the <italic>fah </italic>gene raised the question whether they resulted from errors of the splicing apparatus and were unproductive alternative transcripts or whether they could produce protein products with potential physiological roles. There is presently no reported indication for the existence of additional FAH isoforms. The DEL231 open reading frame is identical to FAH, except for the missing region encoded by the skipped exons 8 and 9 and corresponding to amino acids 203 to 280 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The open reading frame of the del100 transcript is identical to FAH and del231 from the ATG start codon to amino acid 202. However, the last 67 amino acids of the putative DEL100 protein encoded by exons 9 and 10 are completely different, due to the shift in the reading frame following exon 8 skipping (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To find out if del100 was translated into a protein, we raised an antiserum against the last 67 amino acids of the putative DEL100 protein and used it to search for the presence of this protein in different adult human tissues. These tissues were obtained after an autopsy and only one sample per tissue was tested, due to the difficulty to obtain them. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> (middle panel), a cross-reacting band was present in heart, liver, kidney, spleen, suprarenals and bladder. The DEL100 protein has an apparent molecular weight of 31-kDa, consistent with the value of 29.7-kDa calculated from its sequence. Interestingly, the expression level of the DEL100 protein varied between the different tissues and it differed from that of FAH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, top panel). For example, FAH was barely detected in the spleen, whereas the expression level of the DEL100 protein was the highest in this tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal part of the FAH protein was used to detect both FAH and DEL100 in the tissues where FAH is the less expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). DEL100 was barely detected in the spleen, suggesting that the protein is synthezised in very low amounts.</p><p>The specificity of the signal was verified by adsorbing the antiserum on the purified C-terminus of DEL100, used for the mouse immunization. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> (top panel), the affinity-purified antiserum still recognized the 31-kDa protein, whereas the non-adsorbed fraction did not show any cross-reactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, bottom panel). The protein of low molecular weight, which is recognized by the non-adsorbed antiserum in the spleen, is unspecific background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, middle panel and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, bottom panel; indicated by a star). A DEL100 protein with the Myc tag was synthesized in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription-translation assay and immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. The anti-DEL100 antiserum recognizes the immunoprecipitated DEL100-Myc protein, further demonstrating its specificity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Altogether these results suggest that the del100 alternative transcript is translated into a protein of 31-kDa whose expression in different tissues differs from that of FAH.</p></sec><sec><title>The del100 transcript seems to be subjected to NMD</title><p>The skipping of exon 8 in del100 causes a change in the reading frame and as a consequence, several new stop codons appear (different from the W262X mutation). To verify if the nonsense del100 transcript was subjected to NMD, lymphoblastoid cells were treated with cycloheximide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) an inhibitor of translation. Stabilization of nonsense transcripts following such a treatment suggests that they are degraded through the NMD pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The effectiveness of the treatment was previously verified on the full-length W262X containing transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and an example is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (upper panel). The full-length transcript was up-regulated in the homozygous cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>; W262X/W262X) but remains unaffected in wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>; wt/wt). The same treatment was used to determine the fate of the del100 transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A stabilization of this alternative transcript was observed when the FAH transcripts were amplified from exons 6 to 14 in wild-type and homozygous cells (indicated by a star in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The same result was obtained using a specific amplification of the del100 transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, second panel and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The amount of del100 following cycloheximide treatment increased about 5-fold the level observed in untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results suggested that del100 is indeed subjected to NMD in homozygous cells and in normal cells as well. In contrast del231, which does not contain any PTC as a result of the skipping of both exons 8 and 9, seemed relatively unaffected by the cycloheximide treatment as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and does not seem to be subjected to NMD. This result confirmed those obtained in E357X/E364X or IVS12/IVS12 HTI fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), where del231 was undetectable probably because of the introduction of PTCs in these transcripts and their targeting to the NMD pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Del100 and del231 were originally identified while studying the impact of NMD on hereditary tyrosinemia type I. During the characterization of the effects of the W262X mutation on FAH mRNA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we detected two minor alternative transcripts. If due to the W262X mutation, they should only be produced when the nonsense mutation is present, i.e. in heterozygous (W262X/wt) and homozygous (W262X/W262X) cell lines. However, by using specific primers for each transcript, we found that both del100 and del231 are produced in normal lymphoblastoid cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and in normal human liver. Del100 was also present in two different HTI cell lines harboring different nonsense mutations (E357X/E364X) or a splice mutation (IVS12+5g-&#x0003e;a) in exon 13 or intron 12 respectively. These data argue in favor of del100 and del231 resulting from alternative splicing pathways rather than from a W262X-associated altered splicing mechanism. We suggest that both transcripts result from a weak definition of exon 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Indeed, exon 8 is subjected to many alterations as a result of splice mutations in the region encompassing exons 6 to 9. For example, due to a splice mutation in intron 6 (IVS6-1g-&#x0003e;t; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]), a cryptic acceptor site in exon 8 is activated or exon 8 is skipped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Del100 and del231 were also identified in the case of the Q279R mutation, a splicing mutation that weakens the donor splice site of exon 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> presents with a model that could explain these observations: we suggest that in the major splicing pathway, intron 8 is removed before introns 7 and 9, leading to a splice intermediate that contains the merged exons 8 and 9. Both exons are subsequently defined as a single exon. The order of intron removal is an important determinant of the outcome of splice-site mutations and could explain some unusual alterations, like the skipping of contiguous exons, as strongly suggested by studies of the COL1A1 and COL5A1 splice mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Altogether, these data suggest that at least del231 may arise through a minor splicing pathway due to an error-prone splicing apparatus because of the weak definition of exon 8 and the order of intron removal. Del100 could originate from a second minor splicing pathway, in which exon 8 is skipped alone because of its weak definition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Del100 and del231 are thus the first cases of alternative splicing for the <italic>fah </italic>gene. However, it remained to see whether they were unproductive splice isoforms or whether they could code for protein isoforms. The del231 transcript retains an unchanged open reading frame when compared to FAH. The putative DEL231 protein would be similar to FAH except for the lower molecular weight (about 35-kDa), due to the missing region encoded by exons 8 and 9. We have been unable to detect a protein species of the size that could correspond to DEL231 using an antibody against full-length FAH. Whether this reflects the absence of such a protein or its presence in a very low amount undetectable with the presently available antibodies remains unknown. The latter explanation seems plausible since the del231 transcript, although not subjected to NMD, is much less abundant that the full-length FAH transcript or del100, as it is barely detected in W262X cells with the RT76 and RT025 primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and the number of PCR cycles needed for its visualization is higher than for del100 when using the specific primers.</p><p>The structure of the putative DEL100 protein in the N-terminal part is identical to that of FAH. But due to exon 8 skipping, the reading frame is very different in the last 67 amino acids. DEL100, a 31-kDa protein, was detected in different human tissues using an antiserum raised against the specific C-terminal part of the putative protein. The antiserum is specific for the DEL100 protein and does not cross-react with FAH. In addition, the cross-reacting 31-kDa band was lost after adsorbing the antiserum against the purified peptide used for the immunization and the antiserum recognizes an <italic>in vitro </italic>translated DEL100-Myc protein, demonstrating its specificity. Thus the del100 transcript seems to direct the synthesis of a protein. This result is surprising because this transcript contains PTCs and seems to be subjected to NMD, as shown by a block of translation following a cycloheximide treatment. Interestingly, FAH and DEL100 have converse expression patterns in the human tissues examined. This suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of the two proteins, since the two transcripts originate from the same pre-mRNA. Alternative splicing, a highly regulated process, which can be developmental-stage or cell-specific, could be responsible for this difference of expression. For example, exon 8 may be more prone to skipping in the spleen given the concentration of specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting splicing regulators. This could be a way to downregulate the level of FAH transcript, by producing an alternative transcript, which is further eliminated by NMD. Indeed recent <italic>in silico </italic>analyses and observations on splicing factors have suggested that NMD, when coupled to alternative splicing, could regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Del100 could be another example of such a coupling of alternative splicing and NMD. In such a case, DEL100 would not be expected to play any function in the cell.</p><p>Very low levels of proteins can sometimes have enormous effects. Interestingly, 10&#x02013;30% of nonsense transcripts escape NMD and when associated with polysomes are stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Is the coupling of alternative splicing with NMD in order to degrade the unproductive isoform the only option? An alternative, as proposed by Neu-Yilik <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], may be that NMD could function in quantitatively controlling the expression of low amounts of protein. In this view, the PTC-containing del100 transcript may produce a protein with a physiological, although still unknown, function in the cell. The FAH structure contains a C-terminal part of 300 residues, which presents a novel arrangement of &#x003b2;-strands and plays a functional role in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding, dimerization and catalysis of its substrate, fumarylacetoacetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Many of the residues encoded by exon 8 are part of the &#x003b2;-strands and residue 233 serves to bind the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The DEL100 protein, which lacks these residues, is thus very unlikely to function in catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds. While the function of DEL100 is unknown at this time, it may have a function in tyrosinemia. Indeed, not all mutations affecting the <italic>fah </italic>gene will similarly affect the DEL100 protein. For example, mutations affecting exons downstream of exon 10 will affect FAH production but not that of the DEL100 protein. This might be reflected in the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in HTI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Preliminary computer analyses of DEL100 motifs using Proscan at PBIL suggest that it contains a putative DNA-binding motif (RVFLQNLLSvSQARLR with 89% similarity found to the consensus sequence). Whether DEL100 can function as a regulating factor remains unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>NMD was first envisaged as a mechanism to prevent the accumulation of faulty transcripts, arising from mutations or processing abnormalities. Recent <italic>in vivo </italic>observations and <italic>in silico </italic>analyses have suggested a new role of NMD in gene expression regulation, when coupled to alternative splicing. We report here the identification of an alternative nonsense transcript of the <italic>fah </italic>gene, which despite being subjected to NMD, produces a protein in different human tissues. This provides an interesting starting point for the analysis of the role of NMD in the regulated productive splicing and translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from lymphocytes of a HTI patient and his parents as described in Tremblay and Khandjian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The other human cell lines, HeLa (cervix) and normal fibroblasts, were cultured in DMEM 10%. Fibroblasts of other HTI patients (WG1647, mutation IVS12/IVS12; and WG1922, mutation E357X/E364X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) obtained from the Montreal Children's Hospital (C.R.

RNA from human normal liver was extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). 1 &#x003bc;g RNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) and Stratascript (Stratagene). FAH cDNA was amplified from exons 6 to 14 using the following primers: RT76 (5'-CGT GCC TCC TCT GTC GTG-3') and RT025 (5'-GGG AAT TCT GTC ACT GAA TGG CGG AC-3'). Sense primers were designed to specifically amplify del100 and del231. RT84 (5'-TGG AGC TGG AAA TGC ACG-3') spans the exon 7 to exon 9 junction, whereas RT85 (5'-TGG AGC TGG AAA TGG ACC-3') spans the exon 7 to exon 10 junction. Amplification of the alternative transcripts with RT84 or RT85 was performed using HotStart (Qiagen) and PCR conditions were optimized in order to minimize nonspecific hybridization of the primers. Moreover, for each amplification (the FAH transcripts and RAR), the kinetic of the reactions were performed and the number of cycles used for each PCR was in the exponential phase.</p><p>Analysis of the cycloheximide treatment was done as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Production of an antiserum against the DEL100 protein</title><p>An antiserum against the C-terminal part of the DEL100 protein was raised in mouse.

Controls for FAH, del100 and del231 are displayed on the left to show that the PCR reactions are in the linear range. (A) FAH amplification from exons 6 to 14 in the lymphoblastoid cell lines. The two additional products (del100 and del231) seen in the homozygous cell line (W262X/W262X) are depicted below the gels. Exons are represented by boxes and introns by lines. Del100 has skipped exon 8 and as a consequence, the reading frame is shifted (W262X becomes G229E). A first PTC is located at the 3'end of exon 10 (270X). Del231 has skipped both exons 8 and 9, but without any change in the reading frame. (B) Primers designed to specifically amplify del100 and del231 span exon 7 to 9 or exon 7 to 10 junctions respectively (depicted in blue). Full-length, del100 or del231 cDNAs were cloned in pRC/CMV and were amplified to verify primer specificity to each alternative transcript. Both transcripts are present in normal cells (wild-type lymphoblasts or fibroblasts and HeLa cells) and human liver. Del100 is amplified in HTI cells with a splice mutation in exon 12 (IVS12/ IVS12) or two nonsense mutations in exon 13 (E357X/E364X).

FAH and DEL231 proteins are identical, except for the region encoded by exons 8 and 9, which is missing in DEL231. DEL100, due to the skipping of exon 8 and the resulting change in the coding frame, differs from FAH at its C-terminal end. The black bar below the DEL100 protein represents the region used to raise the antiserum. (B) 30 &#x003bc;g proteins of a 10% (w/v) tissue homogenate were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted using a rabbit anti-FAH (top panel; dilution 1:25,000) or a mouse anti-DEL100 antiserum (middle panel; dilution 1:1,000). A band with an apparent molecular weight of 31-kDa is detected by the anti-DEL100 antiserum in all tissues tested. The star indicates non-specific signal.

Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. RAR serves as a control for RNA quantity in each sample. Control amplifications (showing an increasing number of cycles) for del100, del231 and RAR are displayed on the left to show that, with the conditions used, each PCR reaction is in the exponential phase. (A) [&#x003b1;<sup>33</sup>P]-dATP was incorporated during the PCR reaction and the products loaded on a 6% acrylamide gel. The gel was used to directly expose an X-ray film and the signal was quantified using the NIH Image 1.2 software.

The effectiveness of the donor and acceptor splice sites were determined using the webgene program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://itba.cnr.it/webgene/"/> and is indicated above the sequence. A cryptic acceptor splice site is used in the case of the IVS6-1g-&#x0003e;t mutation (described in [35]). Exons are represented by boxes and introns by lines. The thick arrow is the major splicing pathway, whereas thin arrows are minor alternative splicing pathways. We suggest that del231 could be explained by the fact that intron 8 is spliced out before introns 7 and 9, leading to an intermediate in which exons 8 and 9 are defined together. Because of exon 8 weak definition, a minority of transcripts eliminates both exons 8 and 9. Del100 could be produced by another minor splicing pathway, in which exon 8 is skipped alone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-6-1-5"/></fig></sec></back></article>
