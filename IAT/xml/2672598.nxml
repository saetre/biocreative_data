During the development of multicellular organisms, however, growth and division can be temporally uncoupled, and the signaling pathways that regulate these growth programs are poorly understood. A good model for analyzing proliferation control in such systems is the morphogenesis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult abdominal epidermis by histoblasts. These cells undergo a series of temporally regulated transitions during which neither cell size nor division rate is constant. The proliferation of histoblasts during metamorphosis is uniquely amenable to clonal analysis in combination with live imaging. Thereby, we show that abdominal histoblasts, which grow while in G2 arrest during larval stages, enter a proliferative stage in the pupal period that is initiated by ecdysone-dependent <italic>string/</italic>Cdc25 phosphatase transcription. The proliferating histoblasts have preaccumulated stores of Cyclin E, which trigger an immediate S phase onset after mitosis. These rapid cell cycles lack a G1 phase and result in a progressive reduction of cell size. Eventually, the histoblasts proceed to a stage of slower proliferation that, in contrast to the preceding, depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling for progression through the G2/M transition and on insulin receptor/PI3K-mediated signaling for growth. These results uncover the developmentally programmed changes coupling the growth and proliferation of the histoblasts that form the abdominal epidermis of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Histoblasts proceed through three distinct stages: growth without division, division without growth, and growth-coupled proliferation. Our identification of the signaling pathways and cell-cycle regulators that control these programs illustrates the power of in vivo time-lapse analyses after clone induction. It sets the stage for the comprehensive understanding of the coordination of cell growth and cell-cycle progression in complex multicellular eukaryotes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>A fundamental issue in biology is the question of how the rate of cell division is coupled to cell growth.

Over the last decades considerable progress, mostly in cultured cells, has been made in the identification of the crucial regulators that govern cell-cycle progression and growth. In general, cells proceed through canonical cell cycles in which S and M phases are separated by G1 and G2 phases. Passage beyond early G1 usually depends on growth factors and mitogens. Without such factors, cells halt growth and cell-cycle progression, and enter G0. When present, these factors stimulate a cascade of events culminating in the activation of G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, which restart cell-cycle progression and lead the cells into S phase (DNA replication). The second regulated cell-cycle transition, progression from G2 into M, is also controlled by Cdk activity. Importantly, the corresponding mitotic cyclin/Cdk complexes are activated by Cdc25 phosphatases, which remove inhibitory phosphate modifications from Cdk1. For maintenance of cell size, cell-cycle progression must be accompanied by cell growth. A key regulator of cellular growth is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway reduces cell, organ, and organism size (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Cell proliferation in developing organisms involves in many cases a programmed temporal uncoupling of growth and progression through the cell cycle, with stage- and tissue-specific deviations from the canonical form. At the onset of embryogenesis, cell divisions are often extremely rapid. Well-studied examples include the syncytial cleavage cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, the cleavage stages in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and the early embryonic divisions in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;). In these processes, the high speed of early embryonic cell-cycle progression is in part enabled by growth beforehand during oogenesis, which results in cells with abundant maternally derived stores. The presence of these stores eliminates the need for gene transcription during the initial cycles and also explains the absence of G1 and G2 phases. Maternally derived Cyclin E is thought to trigger an immediate entry into S phase after each mitosis. Moreover, high levels of maternally derived mRNAs for mitotic cyclins and Cdc25 allow a rapid onset of mitosis very soon after completion of S phase. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, G1-less cell cycles continue even after cellularization, which follows the 13th syncytial S/M cycle. In these cell-division cycles, however, entry into mitosis, and thereby the length of the G2 phase, becomes controlled by <italic>string</italic> (the Cdc25 homolog) transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Unconventional cell cycles without G1 are also characteristic of mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESC) as well as some tumor cells (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Rapid, growthless early cycles result in a progressive cleavage of the zygote into increasingly smaller cells. Previous growth followed by the partitioning of large cells into smaller cells is not only observed in the context of oogenesis and early embryogenesis. For instance, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, which remain quiescent during the early larval stages, initially increase in size before their size is again reduced during progression through asymmetric divisions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The progenitor abdominal histoblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which remain quiescent during the larval stages, undergo rapid proliferation after pupation and eventually form the adult abdominal epidermis by replacing the larval epidermal cells (LECs). As shown earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; and also in this work, these cells provide a highly accessible system for a detailed analysis of the temporally programmed molecular mechanisms that control the coupling of cell growth to cell proliferation. Histoblasts are specified during embryogenesis and are organized in small nests of cells surrounded by LECs. While LECs grow and endoreduplicate, histoblasts remain arrested in a G2 phase during larval stages. They also grow during this period although far less extensively than the LECs. Importantly, in contrast to the LECs, they reenter mitotic cell-division cycles at the onset of metamorphosis. Early, from 0 h to 8 h after puparium formation (APF), they undergo three very rapid and synchronous growthless divisions (around 2.5 h each). Later, from 8 h to 36 h APF, the length of their cell cycle increases progressively (up to 8 h), and they undergo interphase growth while keeping their overall size constant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. After invading and replacing the larval epithelium, histoblasts acquire epidermal and neural fates and terminally differentiate. How histoblast cell divisions and growth are genetically regulated and interconnected is essentially unknown.</p><p>In this paper, we identify the signaling pathways and their target regulators that, following pupation, control cell-cycle reentry, cell-cycle speed, and growth during histoblast proliferation. Our results are derived from experiments exploiting a novel and powerful combination of clonal analyses and in vivo visualization. We find that during larval stages, arrested histoblasts accumulate cellular mass in a process dependent on the insulin receptor/PI3K pathway (Stage 0&#x02014;before cell-cycle entry). Thereafter, ecdysone-dependent <italic>string</italic> transcription triggers exit from the quiescent G2 state at the onset of metamorphosis. As a result of the accumulation of the G1/S regulator Cyclin E during larval stages, the initial cell cycles are G1-less and very fast (Proliferation Stage 1). Moreover, cell growth does not keep up with progression through these rapid cell cycles. Finally, upon depletion of stored Cyclin E, histoblasts proceed into a stage of slower proliferation (Proliferation Stage 2) in which G1 is restored. In contrast to the previous stage, cell proliferation depends on mitogenic and growth factor signaling. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is required for the G2/M transition, and the insulin receptor/PI3K pathway for cell growth. Analogous regulation might occur in other proliferative tissues and perhaps in tumors as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Histoblast Exit from Cell-Cycle Arrest Relies on <italic>string</italic> Transcription Stimulated by Ecdysone</title><p>During larval periods, histoblasts remain arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Accordingly, the overexpression of String, but not Cyclin A, Cyclin B, or Cdk1, in histoblasts triggered their premature hyperproliferation in larval stages (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000079-g001">Figure 1</xref>A with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000079-g001">1</xref>B; unpublished data&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).

Although mitogenic signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF) is generally thought to control progression through the G1 phase, EGFR signaling is also required for progression through G2 in several processes in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. How EGFR stimulates the G2/M transition in histoblasts is not yet entirely clear, but potential targets include either positive regulators of Cdk1 activity such as String and the mitotic cyclins A and B or negative regulators such as the Wee1/Myt1 kinases.</p><p>Spitz, a diffusible EGFR ligand (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;), whose expression increases from 5 h APF onwards in both histoblasts and LECs, is required for EGFR activation. Indeed, wild-type histoblasts nonautonomously rescue adjacent <italic>spitz</italic> mutant cells, and overexpression of Argos (a Spitz antagonist) in LECs suppresses divisions in adjacent histoblasts. We previously showed that the death of LECs is spatially and temporally coordinated with the expansion of the histoblast population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. A paracrine effect of Spitz secreted by LECs might be part of this feedback regulation. LEC death would reduce available Spitz levels and thereby adjust histoblast proliferation.</p><p>Interphase growth is in great part responsible for the expansion of histoblast nests, and we found that insulin and PI3K signaling are necessary for both cell growth and cell-cycle progression during the late Stage 2 divisions. Histoblasts mutant for either <italic>dp110</italic> or <italic>chico</italic>, or histoblasts that overexpress PTEN, arrest at the end of the early fast cell cycles (Stage 1). Compatible with these findings, we have identified a dynamic regulation of several components of the insulin/PI3K pathway such as <italic>chico</italic> or <italic>sgg</italic> (GSK3) by transcriptomic analysis during the transition between Stages 1 and 2 (M. I. Grande and E. Martin-Blanco, unpublished data). In accordance with these results, PI3K signaling is also essential in the control of conventional cell cycles in imaginal discs, affecting both growth and proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Further, in zebrafish, inhibition of insulin function results in impaired embryonic growth, arrested cell divisions, and increased lethality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, in mammals, PI3K promotes cell division and directs growth of postmitotic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000079-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In summary, the coupling of cell growth and cell-cycle progression during <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal morphogenesis proceeds through a series of developmentally programmed stages. We found that the sequential and coordinated activities of extrinsic hormonal, mitogenic, and growth signals, respectively mediated by the ecdysone receptor, EGFR, and PI3K, regulate histoblast numbers and size. The combination of live observation and clonal analysis and the identification of the elements involved in regulating the distinct stages should allow further progress towards a molecular understanding of the developmental mechanisms that control cell proliferation in histoblasts, and the modeling of related clinically relevant processes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks.</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained on standard culture media.
