The fundamental unit of chromatin is a nucleosome, which is made up of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Luger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, every nuclear process that requires access to DNA proceeds in the context of chromatin. This makes possible to regulate the process through the chromatin structure. To stabilize or overcome the inhibitory effect of chromatin, some mechanisms that alter the chromatin structure are necessary. One of the mechanisms for modulation of the chromatin structure is modification of histones by acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, or ADP-ribosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Turner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, histone variants have been also shown to be important for modulating chromatin status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Polo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of variants that have been reported to date correspond to two types of histones, H2A and H3. Many of the H2A variants are involved in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Pusarla1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. H2A.Z, one of the best-studied H2A variants, is essential for establishing proper chromatin structure in many organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Raisner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, mammalian H2A.Z contributes to unique structure of centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Greaves1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and is essential to maintain the genome integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Rangasamy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the function of H2A.Z in constitutive heterochromatin, H2A.Z also has a role for formation of facultative heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Greaves2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Sarcinella1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has a single H2A.Z variant, H2Av that comprises 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of cellular H2A protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Palmer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As mammalian H2A.Z, H2Av nonrandomly localizes to heterochromatin regions and many euchromatin regions on polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Leach1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, A recent study has demonstrated that chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> H2Av mutants exhibits reduced H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and reduced HP1 binding and Pc binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Swaminathan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting an essential role of H2Av for silent chromatin formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Another important modulator of chromatin regulation is ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, which alters the chromatin structure or positioning of nucleosomes. ISWI is one of the highly conserved and well-characterized ATPase subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Deuring1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Tsukiyama1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ISWI forms several kinds of chromatin remodeling complexes: ACF (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Ito1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, CHRAC (chromatin accessibility complexes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-VargaWeisz1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Tsukiyama1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In vitro assays have shown that these ISWI complexes facilitate the sliding of histone octamers on DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Corona1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Langst1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The Remodeling and Spacing Factor (RSF) complex has been purified from human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-LeRoy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and consists of two subunits: Rsf-1 and SNF2H, a human counterpart of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI. RSF possesses not only the chromatin remodeling activity, but also chromatin assembly activity in vitro. Rsf-1 assembles nucleosomes randomly with its histone chaperone activity. The resulting nucleosomes are then redistributed into a periodic array by the ATP-utilizing nucleosome mobilization factor SNF2H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Loyola1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. No other single factor can execute the same activities as RSF. While the biochemical property of RSF has been investigated in vitro, the in vivo function of the factor remains elusive.</p><p>We investigated the biological function of RSF by using a genetically amenable organism <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Because the catalytic subunit ISWI is shared with other remodeling factors, we focused on the Rsf-1 subunit.

We show here physical interactions between dRsf-1 and ISWI suggesting that they function together as an RSF complex in vivo. A <italic>dRsf-1</italic> mutation dominantly suppresses position effect variegation (PEV). These results suggest that dRsf-1 functions in transcriptionally silent chromatin formation. Furthermore, we show physical and functional interactions of dRsf-1 with H2Av and the H2Av-exchanging factor Tip60 complex. Based on these findings, we propose that RSF plays a role in histone H2Av replacement, thereby contributing to the formation of silent chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of dRsf-1</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains a single candidate for human <italic>Rsf-1/HBXAP</italic> counterpart gene <italic>CG8677</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Loyola2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Shamay1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

To investigate whether the RSF complex is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we first made co-immunoprecipitation analyses using embryonic nuclear extracts. ISWI proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-dRsf-1 antibodies, but not with control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). Reciprocally, we verified that dRsf-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-ISWI antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). Both types of the co-immunoprecipitation were observed in the presence of 80 &#x000b5;g/ml ethidium bromide, suggesting that the interaction between dRsf-1 and ISWI is not mediated through nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000011.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Quantification of the band intensities indicated that almost all dRsf-1 interacts with ISWI in the embryonic nuclear extracts. Next, we fractionated an embryonic nuclear extract by gel filtration through Superose-6 and analyzed the fractions for the presence of dRsf-1 and ISWI by western blotting. dRsf-1 was eluted in a single peak at about 1MDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The majority of ISWI peaked around 670 KDa as previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Corona1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, which may correspond to ACF/CHRAC-containing fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-VargaWeisz1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, approximately 20&#x00025; of ISWI was eluted wit the dRsf-1 peak. To test if dRsf-1 forms a complex with ISWI, we pooled the dRsf-1 peak fractions (No. 18&#x02013;19), and again fractionated it by gel filtration through Superose-6. This process eliminated the ACF/CHRAC complex containing ISWI, and we observed that dRsf-1 and ISWI were eluted in a single peak. Finally we compared the distribution of dRsf-1 with that of ISWI on polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The distribution of dRsf-1 was mostly coincident with that of ISWI in euchromatic regions. Consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation data and the fact that ISWI is also included in other complexes, not all signals of ISWI colocalized with the dRsf-1 signals on polytene chromosomes. Indeed, we observed localization of ISWI but not dRsf-1 on the centromeric heterochromatin and the 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome region (Arrow heads C and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, respectively). These biochemical and cytological data indicate that ISWI and dRsf-1 work on chromatin as an RSF complex and also suggest that at least some ISWI-containing complexes are present on chromatin independently.</p><fig id="pgen-1000011-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000011.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Interactions between dRsf-1 and ISWI.</title><p>(A) Co-immunoprecipitation of dRsf-1 and ISWI. <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-ISWI antibodies (left panel), anti-dRsf-1 antibodies (right panel) or control IgG (Mock).

Instead, the level of histone H2Av on chromatin is reduced in the <italic>dRsf-1<sup>3602</sup></italic> mutant and our biochemical and genetic studies show that dRsf-1 contributes to silent chromatin formation coincident with histone H2Av incorporation in euchromatin regions. Judging from these observations, the effect of each mutation on PEV appears to come from different mechanisms. Various types of ISWI complex seem to exist independently on chromatin and execute different functions in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Mutations of Non-Heterochromatic Proteins Suppress PEV</title><p>PEV is thought to be caused by spreading of the heterochromatic state into neighboring regions of euchromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Wakimoto1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. While products of some <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes are thought to localize and function on heterochromatin regions, proteins encoded by other <italic>Su(var)</italic> genes such as <italic>dRsf-1</italic> (this study), <italic>E(Pc)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Stankunas1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Z4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Eggert1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and so on do not localize to heterochromatin regions. A recent study has reported that the mutation of <italic>dG9a</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of euchromatic H3K9 methyltransferase <italic>G9a</italic>, also suppresses PEV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Mis1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Because, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, localization of such proteins is usually analyzed on polytene chromosomes in the post mitotic stage, one possibility is that they bind to heterochromatin regions transiently in cell cycle progression or during an early developmental stage. For example, Su(var)3-3, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of LSD1 has been reported to localize on heterochromatin region during early embryonic stages and to play an essential role in establishment of heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Rudolph1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we were unable to detect the dRsf-1 protein on heterochromatin regions during cell cycle progression or during early embryonic stages (data not shown).</p><p>Thus, a more plausible interpretation of PEV suppression in the <italic>dRsf-1</italic> mutant is that dRsf-1 activities on a juxtaposed euchromatic region can allow the spreading of centromeric heterochromatin in the <italic>dRsf-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> background. We speculate that PEV could occur through not only the invasion of heterochromatin, but also the guidance of centromeric heterochromatin spreading from a potential facultative heterochromatin region. Indeed, the formation of constitutive heterochromatin and facultative heterochromatin share common molecular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Craig1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. When the potential facultative heterochromatin region becomes juxtaposed with the constitutive heterochromatin region, the heterochromatic state might be easily spread into the neighboring region.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>RSF Functions in an Early Step of the Silent Chromatin Formation</title><p>We found that the level of H2Av on chromatin was reduced in <italic>dRsf-1</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We also observed the physical and functional interactions of RSF with H2Av and the H2Av-exchanging factor Tip60 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g008">8</xref>). These findings raise an intriguing possibility that RSF directs local H2Av replacement through its association with the Tip60 complex during the silent chromatin formation. Our future study should address whether the genetic interaction between <italic>dRsf-1</italic> and Tip60 complex component <italic>dReptin</italic> results in a defect in H2Av deposition at the <italic>white</italic> locus close to heterochromatin.</p><p>Although the level of H2Av on chromatin was reduced in <italic>dRsf-1</italic> mutant, we could still detect a residual level of H2Av, suggesting that some factor other than RSF may also contribute to the step. The presence of such factor may also explain our observation that the gross distribution of Domino along polytene chromosomes was not altered in the dRsf-1 mutant (unpublished observation). Loss of both RSF and the putative factor may be required to cause a dramatic change in the localization of Domino. The presence of other factor may also explain why <italic>H2Av</italic> is essential for fly development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-VanDaal1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> but <italic>dRsf-1</italic> is not. Furthermore, while dRsf-1 is absent from the chromocenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), H2Av has been reported to be a component of centromeric chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Leach1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, another remodeling complex or mechanisms must be responsible for the deposition of H2Av at constitutive heterochromatin.</p><p>Interestingly, H2A.Z, the H2Av ortholog in other organisms, has been reported to affect chromatin condensation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Fan1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The acidic patch of H2A.Z has been thought to allow strong interaction with N-terminal tail of H4 from a neighboring nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Fan2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The nucleosome arrays formed by RSF may create a platform for incorporation of H2Av and also allow the precisely arranged nucleosome-nucleosome interactions through H2Av. As incorporation of yeast H2A.Z, Htz1, into nucleosomes inhibits chromatin remodeling activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Li1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, it may be necessary to remodel the basal nucleosome array before incorporation of h2Av. The resulting nucleosome array may easily promote HP1-mediated higher-order chromatin folding as observed for H2A.Z-containing nucleosome array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000011-Fan1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, and facilitate H3K9 methylation.</p><p>Based on our findings and the above information, we propose the following pathway of condensed silent chromatin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000011-g008">Figure 8D</xref>): First RSF forms nucleosome arrays and induces exchange of H2A for H2Av through association with the Tip60 complex. This allows further steps of silent chromatin formation, such as histone H3K9 methylation and HP1 binding, to proceed or proceed more efficiently, which ultimately lead to chromatin compaction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Strains and Genetics</title><p>Flies were raised on a standard agar/cornmeal/yeast medium.
