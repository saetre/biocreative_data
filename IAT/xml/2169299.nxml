Highly enriched in the dendritic spine, neurabin is important for spine morphogenesis and synaptic formation. However, less is known about the role of neurabin in hippocampal plasticity and its possible effect on behavioral functions. Using neurabin knockout (KO) mice, here we studied the function of neurabin in hippocampal synaptic transmission, plasticity and behavioral memory. We demonstrated that neurabin KO mice showed a deficit in contextual fear memory but not auditory fear memory. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the hippocampal CA1 neurons showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly reduced, whereas long-term depression (LTD) was unaltered in neurabin KO mice. Moreover, increased AMPA receptor but not NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission was found in neurabin KO mice, and is accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of GluR1 at the PKA site (Ser845) but no change at the CaMKII/PKC site (Ser831). Pre-conditioning with LTD induction rescued the following LTP in neurabin KO mice, suggesting the loss of LTP may be due to the saturated synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that neurabin regulates contextual fear memory and LTP in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), is thought to be important for memory formation and storage in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Bliss1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Silva1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, the reduced phosphorylation of GluR1p845 in the neurabin KO may affect activity-dependent AMPA receptor contribution to LTP. Second, the synaptic responses may be saturated and simply could not undergo activity-dependent potentiation. To test the first idea, we examined whether forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, could rescue the loss of LTP by increasing PKA activities and therefore phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 site. Perfusion of forskolin (10 &#x000b5;M) for 10 minutes significantly increased AMPA EPSCs in hippocampal CA1 neurons in wild-type mice (180.9&#x000b1;20.6 &#x00025; of control; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5, P&#x0003c;0.05, paired t-test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001407.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

Due to the lack of selective inhibitors for neurabin, it is impossible to study functions of neurabin in synaptic and behavioral functions using pharmacological approaches. In the present study, we found that genetic deletion of neurabin reduced contextual fear memory, but not auditory fear memory and acute sensory sensitivity. For synaptic plasticity, we found the reduced LTP, but not LTD or short-term plasticity in neurabin KO mice. These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that neurabin regulates hippocampus-related fear memory and plays different roles in hippocampal LTP/LTD as compared with spinophilin KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Feng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with the recent evidence from neostriatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Allen2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, it suggests that neurabin may play a critical role in learning and memory in the mammalian brain.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Neurabin Regulates Synaptic Transmission</title><p>Function of AMPA receptor is modulated by different mechanisms, including phosphorylation and their membrane expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Derkach1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Malinow2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we found that AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC is significantly increased in the neurabin KO mice. At least three possibilities may account for the enhancement. First, the expression of AMPA receptor may be upregulated in neurabin KO mice. This possibility is excluded, since the total expression of GluR1 or GluR2&#x00026;3 in hippocampus is similar between wild-type and neurabin KO mice. However, the results may reflect a preferential synaptic expression of AMPARs in the neurabin KO mice. Second, presynaptic glutamate release may be increased in the KO mice. However, this is not the case, as we found that PPF is increased in KO mice, suggesting the release probability may be decreased in KO mice. Third, the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor may be altered in neurabin KO mice. Indeed, our biochemical results showed that phosphorylation of GluR1 is significantly decreased at PKA site (Ser845), whereas phosphorylation is unaltered at the CaMKII site (Ser831). The results are particularly interesting, considering the both sites could be regulated by PP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Malinow2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Lee1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible explanation for the results is that neurabin-binding protein PP1 may not directly target the phosphorylated sites on GluR1 subunit in dendritic spines, but through other substrates instead. For instance, PP1 could inhibit CaMKII function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Blitzer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Strack1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby affecting the phosphorylation on GluR1p831.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that phosphorylation of GluR1p845 in the neostriatum was reduced in neurabin KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Allen2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The reason for the discrepancy may reside in: (1) Hippocampal cultured neurons/slices may represent functions of neurabin in early developmental stages. The present studies were performed from adult hippocampal slices. (2) Inhibition of neurabin stimulated motility and the number of dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Zito1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

(3) The discrepancy of evoked EPSCs and mEPSC observed in neurabin KO mice could be reconciled since evoked response and spontaneous response may recruit different presynaptic release pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Kavalali1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> as well as the postsynaptic receptor pools (Kavalali E., personal communication).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Neurabin Regulates Synaptic Plasticity</title><p>PP1 is known to play a major role in the control of LTP and LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Malenka1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Considering the interaction of neurabin with PP1, it is reasonable to believe that neurabin is important in targeting PP1 to the dendritic spine, thereby modulating long-term plasticity. Indeed, it has been reported that neurabin is involved in synaptic plasticity in neostriatum and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Allen2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Hu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Hu2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results showed that LTP but not LTD is reduced in adult hippocampal slices from neurabin KO mice. These results suggest that modulation of neurabin on the synaptic plasticity may depend on brain regions, age of animals, slice preparations, genetic manipulations or acute versus chronic lack of neurabin.</p><p>Reduction of LTP but not LTD in the neurabin KO mice is interesting, since PP1 is critical for the induction of LTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Morishita1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and deletion of spinophilin selectively reduced LTD but not LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Feng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Several mechanisms may account for the altered synaptic plasticity observed in neurabin KO mice. First, since PKA and CaMKII act in parallel in controlling synaptic incorporation of GluR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Esteban1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, reduced phosphorylation of GluR1p845 may affect activity-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking. For example, the reduction in Ser 845 phosphorylation seen in the neurabin KO may decrease the pool of &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; receptors, and hence inhibit LTP. To test this idea, we studied the LTP in the presence of forskolin. We found that LTP is still impaired in neurabin KO mice, suggesting that decreased in &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; pool of GluR1 is not the mechanism. Second, since AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC is enhanced in the KO mice, the synaptic responses may have already been saturated and thus affect the following LTP induction. If this is the case, unsaturating synaptic transmission with a prior induction of LTD should &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; LTP in neurabin KO mice. Indeed, we found LTP is observed by preconditioning the KO mice with LTD induction (de-depression), suggesting that saturated EPSCs impair the LTP induction in neurabin KO mice. However, we have to keep in mind that de-depression is a different type of synaptic plasticity, which might utilize very different induction mechanisms from that of LTP. Third, neurabin and spinophilin co-localized in spines to a large extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Muly1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the normal LTD in neurabin KO mice may be due to the functional redundancy between these two proteins and spinophilin may compensate in some way for the lost neurabin. Fourth, neurabin-binding PP1 may not directly modulate LTP or LTD. That is, some other binding proteins other than PP1 recruited by neurabin in the dendritic spine may be involved in the modulation synaptic plasticity. Further studies are clearly needed to investigate the exact signaling pathways for neurabin-related LTP.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Neurabin Regulates Contextual Fear Memory</title><p>Despite the critical role of neurabin in synaptic formation and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Allen2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-Zito1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001407-TerryLorenzo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, much less is known about its role in behavioral functions.

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular devices, CA) and the stimulations were delivered by a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode placed in striatum radium. The recording pipettes (3&#x02013;5 M&#x02126;) were filled with solution containing (mM): 145 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.1 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP, 5 QX-314 (adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH). When using spike-time protocol for LTP induction, CsMeSO<sub>3 </sub>was replaced by equimolar K-gluconate and QX-314 chloride was omitted in the internal solution. For induction of LTP with pairing protocol, cells were held at &#x0002b;30 mV while Schaffer collateral afferents were stimulated at 2 Hz for 80 pulses. The spike-timing protocol for LTP involved paired 3 presynaptic stimuli which caused 3 EPSPs (10 ms ahead) with 3 postsynaptic action potentials at 30 Hz, paired 15 times every 5 s. For induction of LTD with pairing protocol, cells were held at &#x02212;45 mV while Schaffer collateral afferents were stimulated at 1 Hz for 300 pulses. To compare the I-V curve of NMDA or AMPA EPSCs, similar EPSC amplitudes were induced in both groups by adjusting the stimulation intensity. When short-term plasticity was studied, AP5 (50 &#x000b5;M) was perfused in the ACSF to avoid the NMDA receptor-dependent long-term plasticity. Access resistance was 15&#x02013;30 M&#x02126; and was monitored throughout the experiment. Data were discarded if access resistance changed more than 15&#x00025; during an experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation</title><p>The hippocampus tissues were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 , 2 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; SDS) containing 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, MO), and 1X phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 (Sigma, MO). Protein was quantified by Bradford assay. Electrophoresis of equal amounts of total protein was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 4&#x000b0;C for Western blot analysis. Membranes were probed with 1&#x02236;3000 dilution of anti-GluR1 (Upstate, NY), anti-GluR2&#x00026;3 (Chemicon, CA), 1&#x02236;2000 dilution of anti-PSD95 (Chemicon, CA), 1&#x02236;1000 dilution of anti-phospho-GluR1 Ser845 (Upstate, NY) or anti-phospho-GluR1 Ser831 (Upstate, NY),and 1&#x02236;1000 dilution of anti- NR1 (Upstate, NY) anti-NR2A (Chemicon), or anti-NR2B (Chemicon) antibodies. The membranes were incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody diluted 1&#x02236;3000 for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection of the proteins with Western lightning chemiliminescence reagent plus (Perkin Elmer Life sciences, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To verify equal loading, membranes were also probed with 1&#x02236;3000 dilution of anti-actin antibody (Sigma, MO). The density of immunoblots was measured using NIH Image software.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Data Analysis and Statistics</title><p>Results were analyzed by t-test, paired t-test, or two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test to identify significant differences.
