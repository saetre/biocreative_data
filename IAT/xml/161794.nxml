It is released by activated platelets and leukocytes, and is one of the most potent mitogens found in serum. LPA acts through G-protein-coupled receptors to activate a number of intracellular signalling pathways including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades and Rho signalling. This leads to cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation and suppression of apoptosis. One way in which these effects are mediated is induction of immediate-early genes such as c-<italic>fos</italic>.</p><p>The c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter has been extensively studied as a model for signal-activated gene induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It contains several regulatory elements, namely a serum response element (SRE), a cAMP-responsive element (CRE), a <italic>sis</italic>-inducible element, and an AP-1-like site, which serve to integrate input from a host of signalling pathways. These promoter elements are strongly interdependent. Mutation of one of them inhibits c-<italic>fos </italic>activation through any of the other elements, suggesting that they are connected by protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The c-<italic>fos </italic>SRE is constitutively occupied by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Its presence allows members of the Ets family ternary complex factors (TCFs) to bind to the SRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A well understood mechanism underlying c-<italic>fos </italic>induction is phosphorylation of TCFs by MAP kinases, leading to transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. SRF bound to SRE reporter genes can also be activated independently of TCFs by at least two signalling pathways, one involving the small GTPase Rho, while the other is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, how these pathways contribute to the control of the endogenous c-<italic>fos </italic>gene is not clear. In addition, SRF is phosphorylated in a signal-regulated manner by several kinases, including MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP-K1, also called RSK) and MAPKAP-K2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. SRF phosphorylation has been correlated with enhanced DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but so far there is no direct evidence for a functional role of SRF phosphorylation.</p><p>The CRE is bound by CRE binding protein family members, including CREB and ATF1. Upon phosphorylation, they recruit the co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP), thus effecting transactivation. Phosphorylation of CREB can be induced by several distinct pathways. For instance, in response to elevated intracellular cAMP levels, CREB is phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Growth factors and cellular stresses induce CREB phosphorylation by activating downstream targets of the classical extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the stress-activated p38 pathway, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MAPKAP-K1b/RSK2 was initially thought to be the major growth factor-regulated CREB kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but recent evidence indicates that mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) play this role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Signal-dependent changes in chromatin structure as part of the nucleosomal response constitute an additional level of regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Stimulation rapidly induces histone phosphorylation and acetylation at the loci of immediate-early genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Histone kinase activity has been shown for both MAPKAP-K1b/RSK2 and MSK1, while CBP possesses histone acetyltransferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, these molecules might play a dual role by contributing to c-<italic>fos </italic>induction at the level of chromatin remodeling as well as promoter activation.</p><p>Transfection experiments have shown that LPA targets the SRE to activate the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter. This was proposed to occur through a Rho-dependent pathway, independently of TCFs and MAP kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, a more recent study concluded that induction of the endogenous c-<italic>fos </italic>gene by LPA requires the ERK pathway, but not Rho signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, some c-<italic>fos </italic>induction by LPA remains in cells that lack SRF and thereby signalling to the SRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], indicating that other promoter elements may contribute to c-<italic>fos </italic>induction.</p><p>Here, we analyse the signalling events leading from LPA stimulation to c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter activation. We confirm that regulation of the endogenous c-<italic>fos </italic>gene involves the ERK pathway and provide direct genetic evidence for a role of MSK1 in this process. Furthermore, we suggest phosphorylation of CRE binding proteins by MSK1 as a mechanism to link the ERK pathway to the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter, thus allowing for SRF-independent c-<italic>fos </italic>induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The ERK pathway is involved in c-fos induction by serum and LPA</title><p>Serum-starved wild type (WT) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were stimulated with fetal calf serum (FCS) or LPA. Activation of the major MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2, JNK1/JNK2, and p38 was determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies against their T-X-Y activation motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation was rapidly induced by both stimuli, followed by a slow decline. Induction of JNK1/JNK2 phosphorylation showed a delayed onset and was less pronounced. Induction of p38 phosphorylation was barely detectable.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>MAP kinase activation in WT ES cells. </bold>WT ES cells were serum-starved for 36 h and stimulated with 15% FCS or 20 &#x003bc;M LPA for the times indicated.

To test this, WT ES cells were stimulated with FCS and LPA in the absence or presence of PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Accumulation of c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA after 30 min of stimulation was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Induction of c-<italic>fos </italic>by both stimuli was reduced in the presence of PD98059. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> shows that PD98059 inhibited ERK activation. It should be noted, however, that PD98059 did not completely block ERK activation in this cell type (data not shown), so that our data may in fact underestimate the importance of the ERK pathway. To further corroborate that the ERK pathway mediates c-<italic>fos </italic>induction by FCS and LPA, Ro318220 was used to inhibit MAPKAP-K1/RSK and MSK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], two downstream targets of ERK1/ERK2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Induction of c-<italic>fos </italic>by both stimuli was strongly inhibited by Ro318220. Therefore, the ERK pathway is involved in c-<italic>fos </italic>induction by FCS and LPA in mouse ES cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Ro318220 suggests that signalling through the ERK pathway involves MAPKAP-K1 or MSK1, or both kinases.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of c-<italic>fos </italic>in WT ES cells. </bold><bold>A </bold>&#x02013; Cells were serum-starved for 36 h and incubated with 25 &#x003bc;M PD98059 during the last hour of starvation where indicated.

We therefore tested whether FCS or LPA could induce CREB phosphorylation in ES cells in an MSK1-dependent manner. In wild type ES cells, both stimuli induced phosphorylation of CREB and the closely related transcription factor ATF1 on serine 133 and serine 63, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, this phosphorylation was greatly reduced in ES cells lacking MSK1, despite normal ERK activation in these cells. CREB and ATF1 expression has previously been shown to be unperturbed in <italic>Msk1(-/-) </italic>ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Only a small induction remains in the absence of SRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. ERK-dependent CRE activation through CREB phosphorylation by MSK1 could provide a mechanism for this residual induction. If this were the case, the residual induction seen in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>cells should still be sensitive to inhibition of the ERK pathway. To test this, <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] were used to measure c-<italic>fos </italic>induction in the absence or presence of PD98059 or Ro318220 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As observed before, c-<italic>fos </italic>induction was drastically reduced in these cells (data not shown). The residual activation elicited by LPA (about five fold as compared to more than 60 fold in wild type cells) was too small to reliably measure the effects of PD98059 and Ro318220. However, the residual response to FCS was sensitive to inhibition of the ERK pathway, showing that TCF phosphorylation is not the only mechanism by which this pathway contributes to c-<italic>fos </italic>induction. Therefore, downstream targets of ERK1/ERK2 can activate the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter in the absence of SRF. MSK1 might be such a downstream target, linking the ERK pathway to the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter by CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE activation.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of c-<italic>fos </italic>in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells. </bold>Cells were serum-starved, treated with PD98059 and Ro318220 as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

Our experiments do not address the role of JNK1/JNK2 in c-<italic>fos </italic>induction. However, since activation of a chromosomal SRE reporter gene by LPA has been found to require JNK-mediated histone hyperacetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], JNK1/JNK2 may be involved in c-<italic>fos </italic>regulation at the level of chromatin remodelling.</p><p>The kinetics of ERK1/ERK2 activation and c-<italic>fos </italic>induction, as well as the reduced c-<italic>fos </italic>induction in the presence of the ERK pathway inhibitors PD98059 and Ro318220 are consistent with a role of ERK1/ERK2 in c-<italic>fos </italic>induction by serum and LPA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A major mechanism by which ERK1/ERK2 mediate c-<italic>fos </italic>induction, is phosphorylation of TCFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, even though TCFs can bind the c-<italic>fos </italic>SRE only in the presence of SRF, the knockout of SRF does not completely abolish c-<italic>fos </italic>induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This suggests a role for other c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter elements. We show that in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells, the residual response to serum is still PD98059- and Ro318220-sensitive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), indicating SRF-independent signalling through the ERK cascade. It should be noted, however, that data with Ro318220 have to be treated with caution as it inhibits several kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>A possible mechanism for the residual c-<italic>fos </italic>induction in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells is activation of CREB bound to the c-<italic>fos </italic>CRE. Phosphorylation of CREB leading to transactivation has been shown to occur downstream of ERK1/ERK2 in response to mitogenic stimuli in a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To examine a role for MSK1 in this process, we used ES cells lacking MSK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Induction of c-<italic>fos </italic>in these cells was reduced by more than 50% as judged by quantitative RT-PCR as well as RNase protection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and unpublished results). Transfection of dominant negative CREB into fibroblasts has been shown to reduce c-<italic>fos </italic>induction to a similar extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Consistent with these results, we found that serum and LPA induce CREB phosphorylation in wild type cells, and that this is greatly reduced in <italic>Msk1(-/-) </italic>ES cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Some CREB phosphorylation remains in the absence of MSK1, indicating that another CREB kinase exists in these cells. As MSK2 activity is undetectable in ES cells (unpublished results), the identity of this kinase remains unclear. Similarly, an undefined ERK-regulated CREB kinase distinct from MSK1 and MSK2 exists in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The interpretation of some of the residual c-<italic>fos </italic>induction in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells being due to CREB phosphorylation implies that the CRE is able to mediate c-<italic>fos </italic>activation in the absence of SRF. In the presence of SRF, CRE activation by mitogenic stimuli appears to be insufficient for c-<italic>fos </italic>activation, but requires co-operation of CREB and SRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Possibly, this requirement is relieved in cells lacking SRF. The reduction of c-<italic>fos </italic>induction by more than 50% in <italic>Msk1(-/-) </italic>ES cells being completely mediated by the CRE seems at odds with the 60&#x02013;70% reduction seen in <italic>Srf(-/-) </italic>ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], where the effect should be due to a nonfunctional SRE. This may reflect interactions between the different promoter elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], with a lack of transactivation at the CRE reducing the effectiveness of the SRE. In addition, it may indicate multiple roles for MSK1. Another potential function for MSK1 is histone phosphorylation as part of the nucleosomal response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. MSK1 could therefore play a dual role by controlling c-<italic>fos </italic>at the level of chromatin remodelling as well as promoter activation. It was, however, not possible to examine this in ES cells due to the high level of mitosis-related histone phosphorylation in these cells that never become truly quiescent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Also, to more directly evaluate the role of the CRE in c-<italic>fos </italic>regulation, it would be helpful to analyse the activation of reporter genes driven by a minimal CRE, the wild type c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter and mutant derivatives of the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter in which particular promoter elements are inactivated. However, we failed to establish these assays in ES cells as we were unable to efficiently activate exogenously added reporter constructs.</p><p>Besides MSK1, other kinases could act in a similar fashion. MAPKAP-K1/RSK also lies downstream of ERK1/ERK2, and it has been suggested to phosphorylate CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, in MAPKAP-K1b/RSK2-deficient cells derived from Coffin-Lowry patients, serum-induced CREB phosphorylation and c-<italic>fos </italic>induction was normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This argues against a role of MAPKAP-K1/RSK in mediating the response to serum and also to LPA, which is a serum constituent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that MSK1 is an important ERK-activated mediator of mitogen-induced c-<italic>fos </italic>activation. In addition, they indicate that MSK1 may effect activation of the c-<italic>fos </italic>promoter by phosphorylating CRE binding proteins. To further delineate the mechanisms leading to immediate-early gene activation, the respective functions of the CREB kinase and the histone kinase activity of MSK isoforms need clarification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and stimulation</title><p>Mouse embryonic stem cells lacking SRF or MSK1 have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Cells were cultured as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For stimulation experiments followed by quantitative RT-PCR, 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were seeded on 3.5 cm gelatinised tissue culture plates, grown in complete medium for 24 h and incubated in serum-free medium as indicated in the figures. For most other experiments, cells were grown to confluence in complete medium, followed by incubation in serum-free medium as indicated in the figures. Cells were stimulated with fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) or LPA (Sigma) at final concentrations of 15% (v/v) and 20 &#x003bc;M, respectively.
