A PCR/RFLP protocol was developed for typing of <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 strains and 88 <italic>E. coli </italic>strains reacting with H4 antiserum were investigated. Nucleotide sequencing of complete <italic>fliC </italic>genes of six <italic>E. coli </italic>strains which were selected based on serum agglutination titers, <italic>fliC</italic>-PCR genotyping and reference data revealed 96.6 to 100% identity on the amino acid level. The functional expression of flagellin encoded by <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 from strain U9-41 and from our strain P12b which is an H4 expressing variant type was investigated in the <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109 which encodes flagellar type H48. The <italic>fliC </italic>recombinant plasmid carrying JM109 strains reacted with both H4 and H48 specific antisera whereas JM109 reacted only with the H48 antiserum.

Typing systems for identification of related <italic>E. coli </italic>strains were developed in the early 1940ies when it became evident that certain <italic>E. coli </italic>strains were agents of infantile gastroenteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In 1944, Kauffmann established the method of serological typing for <italic>E. coli </italic>O- (lipopolysaccharide) and H-(flagellar) antigens which allowed the grouping of <italic>E. coli </italic>strains according to their O:H-types (serotypes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Serotyping proved to be widely useful for identification of enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>(EPEC) strains from stools of diarrhoeic infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and is successfully employed for characterization of pathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>strains from both humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The genetic analysis of <italic>E. coli </italic>populations by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) allowed the detection of clonal types of strains which carry specific virulence markers and are associated with disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It was shown that the O:H serotype is a good marker for identification of strains belonging to clonal types of pathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. At present, 176 O- and 53 H-antigens are described for <italic>E. coli </italic>which can occur in different combinations in wildtype isolates of strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the large number of O- and H-antisera which are needed for <italic>E. coli </italic>serotyping and the laborious typing procedure restricts its usage to a few reference laboratories. Therefore, alternative typing methods were developed including molecular characterization of genes coding for the O- and H-antigens in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Typing of <italic>fliC </italic>genes by PCR was successfully employed for characterization of human pathogenic O157:H7 and O26:H11 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of <italic>fliC </italic>genes coding for flagellar antigens H7 and H6 revealed large sequence similarities between strains sharing the same H-type but different O-types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, molecular typing of the <italic>fliC </italic>gene allows H-typing of non-flagellated (non-motile) <italic>E. coli </italic>isolates which cannot be analyzed for their flagella with H-specific antisera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The flagellar type H4 is frequently occurring in <italic>E. coli </italic>belonging to many different O-groups including strains of shiga toxin-producing <italic>E. coli </italic>(STEC) and extraintestinal pathogenic serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], (K.A. Bettelheim, The VTEC table, May 2003, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microbionet.com.au/vtectable.htm"/>). Moreover, a cryptic <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 gene was described to be present and to be spontaneously expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>strain P12b (O15:H17) which carries another type of flagella called H17 which is not encoded by the <italic>fliC </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, we became interested in the genetic variability of flagellar H4 genes in <italic>E. coli </italic>strains belonging to different O-serogroups and pathotypes. We have used the published nucleotide sequence of the <italic>fliC </italic>gene present in the <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 reference strain U9-41 (accession AB028472) to develop a PCR which allows discrimination between the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 gene variants. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the <italic>fliC </italic>gene was performed on other <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 strains that either showed deviations in the PCR analysis or were reported to harbour allelic types of the H4-<italic>fliC </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or revealed differences in the agglutination reaction compared to the reference strains. To study the expression of different flagellar H4 types we have cloned their corresponding <italic>fliC </italic>genes and have introduced them into the laboratory <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Expression of recombinant flagella was demonstrated by serotyping and by immuno electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Serological detection of the flagellar H4 antigen in different <italic>E. coli </italic>wildtype host strains</title><p><italic>E. coli </italic>reference strains U9-41 (O2:K1:H4) and P12b (O15:H17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109 (O-rough:H48) (this study), which was used for expression studies were investigated for inhibition of motility in swarm-agar containing 1:600 dilutions of either H4, or H48-antiserum (see Methods). U9-41 and P12b were fully inhibited for their motility in the presence of H4 antiserum derived from strains U9-41 or from P12b but not in the presence of H48 specific antiserum. The <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109 was not inhibited for motility by H4 antisera but by H48 antiserum. These findings indicate that H4 antisera specifically inhibited the motility of <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 strains and that the antigenically different flagellar type H17 was not expressed or lost in our P12b isolate, similar as previously described with spontaneously arising variants of P12b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We became interested if other <italic>E. coli </italic>H17 strains would also carry the genes for expression of H4 type flagella as it was described for P12b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For this, we have investigated five additional <italic>E. coli </italic>H17 strains (872-69, 107-74, 305-78, 870-69 and 327-01) for their serological reaction with different H4 specific antisera and all strains showed specific positive reactions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). H-serotyping performed with strains from the collection of the Robert Koch-Institute revealed 88 <italic>E. coli </italic>strains which agglutinated with H4 antisera and the results obtained with 10 representative strains are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. All strains agglutinated with both, H4<sub>U9-41 </sub>and H4<sub>P12b </sub>antiserum, but were not agglutinating with antisera made against other H-antigens (data not shown). Differences in agglutinating titers between H4<sub>U9-41 </sub>and H4<sub>P12b </sub>antisera were not more than twofold with either strain indicating that both sera were similar for their specificity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The strains P7d, E1541-68, 107-74 and 305-78 showed significantly lower agglutination titers with H4 antisera than did the reference strains U9-41 and P12b, which had been used for production of H4 typing sera, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These findings prompted us to compare all the H4 strains with all other <italic>E. coli </italic>H-types for polymorphisms in the <italic>fliC </italic>gene by HhaI digestion of <italic>fliC</italic>-PCR products as described in the Method section.</p></sec><sec><title>HhaI-RFLP typing of <italic>fliC </italic>genes in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>PCR products obtained with primers fliC-1 and fliC-2 were digested with HhaI to obtain H-serotype specific RFLP patterns from reference strains for the 53 different <italic>E. coli </italic>H-serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. HhaI-RFLP typing of <italic>E. coli fliC </italic>genes coding for flagellar types H1 to H56 revealed individual patterns corresponding to the different H-serotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Flagellar antigens H3, H17, H35, H36, H44, H47, H53, H54 and H55 were reported to be not encoded by <italic>fliC </italic>but by other genes (<italic>flkA</italic>, <italic>fllA, flmA </italic>and others) in the corresponding <italic>E. coli </italic>strains and the <italic>fliC </italic>HhaI patterns obtained from these strains do therefore not correspond to their H-serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. HhaI-RFLP patterns were found conserved among strains sharing the same H-serotype independent of their O-antigen as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (data not shown). An exception was found for H-serotypes 2, 8, 18, 19, 21, 33 and 47 in which single strains possessed different HhaI-RFLP patterns when compared with the corresponding H-type reference strain (data not shown). The HhaI-RFLP patterns of different H-types were distinguishable from each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The results from HhaI-RFLP typing corresponded with the earlier reports showing that the <italic>fliC </italic>gene in strain P12b codes for flagella of serotype H4. The relationship between <italic>fliC </italic>genes present in the different <italic>E. coli </italic>strains was further investigated by nucleotide sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide sequence analysis of the <italic>fliC </italic>genes present in representative <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 strains</title><p>To obtain the entire coding region of the <italic>fliC </italic>gene in <italic>E. coli </italic>strains oligonucleotide primers fliC-5 and fliC-6 were deduced from the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 chromosomal region and applied to amplify the corresponding chromosomal regions from <italic>E. coli </italic>strains U9-41 (O2:K1:H4), P12b (O15:H17), U1-41 (O5:K4:H4), P7d (O68:H4), C107-74 (O15:H17) and E1541-68 (O154:H4) as listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. These strains were taken as flagellar type H4 representatives according to previously published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and according to the H-serotyping performed in this study. The analysis of the coding sequences of the <italic>fliC </italic>genes present in these strains revealed in all cases a length of 1050 bp. As a control, the <italic>fliC </italic>gene of the strain U9-41 was sequenced and found to be identical to the previously deposited <italic>fliC </italic>sequence (accession AB028472). The identity of the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 sequences ranges from 97,6 % to 100 %. The greatest sequence difference to the <italic>fliC </italic>gene coding sequence of strain U9-41 was found in the <italic>fliC </italic>gene of strain P7d (exchange of 20 nucleotides), whereas the <italic>fliC </italic>sequences of strains U1-41 and U9-41 were identical to each other. All deduced flagellins have a length of 349 amino acids. The greatest deviation in the primary structure to the FliC protein of the reference strain U9-41 was again observed for the FliC protein of strain P7d (exchange of 9 aa in a stretch of 349 aa). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the alignment of the deduced FliC proteins of all investigated strains. The FliC protein of strain U1-41 is 100% identical to that of strain U9-41 and therefore not shown. Similarities of the deduced amino acid sequences of the FliC proteins (flagellins) are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR based detection of <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 specific DNA sequences</title><p>Amplification of the <italic>fliC </italic>genes present in <italic>E. coli </italic>strains U9-41 and P12b with primers fliC-1 and fliC-2 resulted in the generation of a 953 bp internal PCR product with both strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 4+5). The nucleotide sequences of this stretch of DNA of strains U9-41 and P12b were compared for restriction enzymes which cut at different sites in the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>U9-41 </sub>and <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>sequence. HhaI was found to cut at identical sites confirming the results from HhaI RFLP typing (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In contrast, enzymes HpaII and MboI were found to generate each different restriction fragments from PCR products of the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>U9-41 </sub>and <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>gene, respectively. Both enzymes were taken for RFLP typing of amplified <italic>fliC </italic>genes (primers fliC-1 and fliC-2) from 88 <italic>E. coli </italic>strains which showed agglutination reactions with H4 antisera (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Eighty-six of the 88 strains showed HpaII and <italic>Mbo</italic>I restriction profiles which corresponded to the patterns obtained with strain U9-41 (O2:K1:H4) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Exceptions were made by strains P7d (O68:H4) and P12b (O15:H17) which showed individual restriction patterns which differed from all other H4 strains investigated in this study. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and expression of <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 genes in the <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109</title><p>In order to study the functional expression of the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 genes in a different genetic background we cloned the corresponding PCR products of strains U9-41 and P12b into the vector pLITMUS38 as described in the Methods section.

JM109 was serotyped as O-rough:H48, and it showed the same HhaI-RFLP <italic>fliC</italic>-pattern as the <italic>E. coli </italic>reference strain P4 (O16:H48) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The functional expression of the cloned <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 genes in the JM109 derivative strains TPE1976 (<italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>U9-41 </sub>clone) and TPE1978 (<italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>clone) was analyzed by tube agglutination with H4 and H48 antisera, respectively. The strains TPE1976 and TPE1978 showed agglutination with H48 and H4 sera whereas the parental JM109 strain reacted only with H48 serum (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). To find out if the flagellins of the <italic>fliC </italic>recombinant plasmid carrying JM109 strains were co-assembled in all flagella or assembled separately we studied the parental strain JM109 and its <italic>fliC-</italic>H4 derivative TPE1978 by IEM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;G</xref>). Both strains were found to express 2-4 flagella per cell which appeared morphologically typical as long helical filaments (diameter 18 nm, length up to 20 &#x003bc;m) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The reaction of H48 antiserum with bacteria followed by detection of adsorbed antibodies with anti-rabbit-IgG coupled with 10 nm immuno-gold particles showed a specific and homogeneous labelling of flagella present on the surfaces of JM109 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and of TPE1978 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). When H4 serum was used, only flagella of strain TPE1978 became immuno-labelled (5 nm gold particles) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and no labeling was observed with JM109 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), confirming H-serotyping results. Sequential double labeling experiments with H48 and H4 antibodies resulted in staining of all flagella on the surfaces of JM109 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) and TPE1978 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). However, both 5 nm (H4 label) and 10 nm (H48 label) gold particles were only bound to flagella of TPE1978 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) whereas the flagella of JM109 were exclusively labelled with 10 nm gold particles which indicates the H48 antigen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). These results demonstrate that both H48 and H4 flagellins are co-assembled in the flagella made by the <italic>fliC</italic>-H48/H4 genes in strain TPE1978.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>fliC </italic>genes of representative <italic>E. coli </italic>strains for the 53 different H-types were recently investigated and compared for their nucleotide sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

In this work, we performed a complete characterization of the <italic>fliC-</italic>H4 genes from different <italic>E. coli </italic>strains with primers which were generated on the basis of the previously published <italic>fliC </italic>sequence (accession AB028472) of the <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 reference strain U9-41. The comparison of the <italic>fliC </italic>gene sequence encoding H4 flagella in strain P12b with the <italic>fliC </italic>sequences of five other <italic>E. coli </italic>H4 or H17 strains revealed a high similarity on the DNA and on the amino acid level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

The detection of some genetic variants in the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4 gene of <italic>E. coli </italic>strains studied here points to a sequence diversity similar as described previously for the <italic>fliC </italic>genes of <italic>E. coli </italic>H6 and H7 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Recent studies have demonstrated that the <italic>fliC </italic>gene of strain P12b encodes flagellar type H4 and it was suggested that the gene for the H17 flagellin is encoded by a locus outside <italic>fliC</italic>, however the gene responsible for the flagellar type H17 was not identified in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our study, cultures of strain P12b were fully inhibited for motility and swarming in the presence of H4 antiserum but not in the presence of H48 antiserum which was used a non-specific control. This result indicates that H17 type flagella were not expressed or lost from our P12b isolate, similar as previously described with mutant strains of P12b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The functional expression of the cloned <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>U9-41</sub>and <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>genes in the genetic background of <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 strain JM109 which shows flagellar serotype H48 confirmed their coding capacity. Since we found coexpression of cloned flagellins with the parental H48 flagellin, we became interested in the composition of flagella made by the <italic>fliC </italic>recombinant plasmid carrying JM109 strains. Electron microscopy of flagella from JM109 and from the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>recombinant plasmid carrying strain revealed no differences between JM109 and TPE1978 showing both a typical helical organization of normal sized flagella on their surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Immuno-gold staining of bacteria which were prior incubated with H48 and H4 antisera revealed high specificity of the rabbit antisera for the flagellar structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;G</xref>). Single (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4 B+D</xref>) and double labelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4 F</xref>) experiments with different sized gold markers demonstrated that all flagella present on the surface of TPE1978 were labelled after incubation with H48 and H4 antiserum. Our results indicate that both H48 and H4 flagellins are coassembled in the flagella made by the <italic>fliC</italic>-H4<sub>P12b </sub>recombinant plasmid carrying strain. This finding is surprising in view of the molecular weight size differences found between H48 and H4 flagellin. To our knowledge, the assembling of two different flagellins in the same filament has not yet been demonstrated before. The H48 flagellin of <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 (accession AE000285) is a 51.3 kDa protein consisting of 498 amino acids and thus much larger than the 36.3 kDa H4 flagellin which is composed of 349 amino acids. However, both flagellins share conserved N- and C-terminal sequences which are known to be involved in the structural assembly of flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. H48 and H4 flagellins differ largely for their central regions which are not involved in flagellar assembly and function but which contain flagellar antigenic epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>We were able to show that the introduction of an isolated <italic>fliC </italic>gene in <italic>E. coli </italic>can change the antigenic properties of the flagella made by this strain. Horizontal transfer of <italic>fliC </italic>genes may contribute to the diversity of flagellar serotypes by recombination within <italic>E. coli </italic>recipient strains. The mammalian host immune system is the driving force for continuous selection of new flagellar antigens in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Published data indicate that both mutation and recombination events in the <italic>fliC </italic>gene have taken place in the evolution of <italic>E. coli </italic>flagellar antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our <italic>fliC </italic>sequence data have shown that the flagellar type H4 which is present in <italic>E. coli </italic>strains of clinical importance covers several genetic variants which are closely related to each other.

Cultures carrying recombinant pLITMUS38 plasmids were grown in the presence of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin. IEM was performed using fresh, non-formalized cultures of motile bacteria. For IEM, aliquots of respective bacterial cultures were diluted 1:2 in PBS pH 7.2 and adsorbed onto glow-discharge treated 400 mesh grids coated with Pioloform and carbon (Wacker Chemie, Munich, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Grids with adsorbed bacteria were preincubated for 30 min at room-temperature with blocking buffer (0.1 % bovine serum albumine (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) in PBS). Rabbit anti-H48- and anti-H4 hyperimmune sera were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. After conditioning, specimens were incubated for 30 min at room temperature on droplets of the specific, unlabelled antibodies. Non-bound antibody was removed by washing the grids twice for 10 min on blocking buffer. Immuno-specifically bound primary antibodies were detected using anti-rabbit-IgG-gold 5 or -gold 10 nm conjugates (British Bio Cell International Ltd, Cardiff, UK). The conjugates were diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer and reacted for 30 min at room temperature. Unbound conjugate was removed by a sequence of washing steps (two times with blocking buffer for 5 min each; once with PBS for 3 min and a final wash with double destilled water for 3 min) at room temperature. Before negative staining with 1 % uranyl acetate (pH 4.0&#x02013;4.5), the grids were washed rapidly on 4 droplets of double destilled water. The preparations were analyzed with an EM 10 electron microscope (Zeiss-LEO, Oberkochen, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. To look for different antigenic determinants expressed on the flagella of strains JM109 or TPE1978, double immuno-labelling was performed using H48 and H4 antisera sequentially and two anti-rabbit-IgG-gold conjugates with different sized markers for the detection of the bound primary unlabelled rabbit antibody. Both <italic>E. coli </italic>strains were incubated with rabbit anti-H4 (1:1000) followed by anti-rabbit-IgG-5 nm gold and two washing steps on droplets of blocking buffer for 10 min. The samples were subsequently incubated with anti H48 antibody (1:1000) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit-IgG- 10 nm gold. Removal of surplus conjugate and negative staining were performed as detailed above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author's contribution</title><p>LB conceived of the study and carried out PCR genotyping and coexpression studies.
