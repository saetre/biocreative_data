The expression of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is augmented in high-grade and metastatic tumors. Observations of the clinical behaviour of prostate tumors suggest that the increased secretion of IL-6 and CCL5 and the higher expression of PSMA may be correlated. We hypothesized that PSMA could be endowed with signalling properties and that its stimulation might impact on the regulation of the gene expression of IL-6 and CCL5. We herein demonstrate that the cross-linking of cell surface PSMA with specific antibodies activates the small GTPases RAS and RAC1 and the MAPKs p38 and ERK1/2 in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. As downstream effects of the PSMA-fostered RAS-RAC1-MAPK pathway activation we observed a strong induction of NF-&#x003ba;B activation associated with an increased expression of IL-6 and CCL5 genes. Pharmacological blockade with specific inhibitors revealed that both p38 and ERK1/2 participate in the phenomenon, although a major role exerted by p38 was evident. Finally we demonstrate that IL-6 and CCL5 enhanced the proliferative potential of LNCaP cells synergistically and in a dose-dependent manner and that CCL5 functioned by receptor-mediated activation of the STAT5-Cyclin D1 pro-proliferative pathway. The novel functions attributable to PSMA which are described in the present report may have profound influence on the survival and proliferation of prostate tumor cells, accounting for the observation that PSMA overexpression in prostate cancer patients is related to a worse prognosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia in man in developed countries. Death from prostate cancer occurs largely in patients with the aggressive androgen-insensitive metastatic disease. A number of studies have recently demonstrated that a prominent role in tumor survival and progression can be attributed to soluble mediators present in the tumor microenvironment. Among these, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a fundamental role in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and differentiation in many cell types and it is also implicated in the development and progression of several forms of tumours including that of the prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Naka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Trikha1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, the expression of IL-6 and its receptor is consistently demonstrated in human prostate cancer cell lines and in freshly isolated cells from human prostate carcinoma and benign prostate hyperplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Siegall1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Hobisch1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinically, the levels of IL-6 in serum are significantly elevated in many men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Adler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Drachenberg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, IL-6 activates androgen receptor-mediated gene expression in LNCaP cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Chen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Ueda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that IL-6 may play a critical role during the progression of prostate cancer. In addition, over-expression of IL-6 in androgen-responsive LNCaP cells promotes their androgen-independent growth in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Lee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the chemochine CCL5 (RANTES) was found to be expressed by human prostate carcinoma cells and reported to stimulate their proliferation and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Vaday1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, also CCL5 appears to be directly involved in the behaviour of prostate carcinoma cells. The gene expression of both IL-6 and CCL5 is mainly regulated at a transcriptional level, by the cooperative activity of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor with members of at least five different families of transactivators including AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Naka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Noticeably, the cooperation between NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 appears to be essential for the constitutive deregulated production of IL-6 observed in the androgen-independent, aggressive prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Zerbini1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene induction occurs depending on the ability of a variety of cell surface receptors to activate distinct and/or partially overlapping intracellular signalling pathways eventually targeting the phosphorylation site(s) of one or more MAP kinases (i.e. p38, ERK1/2, JUNK) committed in turn to activate IL-6 and/or CCL5 gene transactivators. Cytokines, growth factors receptors, adhesion molecules and many other membrane-generated signals all share the ability to efficiently promote IL-6 or CCL5 gene expression and consequently also their downstream effects. In addition, under long-term treatment conditions, IL-6 can activate its own gene expression and, in prostate cancer, autocrine and paracrine loops involving IL-6 and one of its multiple activators, the TGF-beta, have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and neuroendocrine differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Culig1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The expression levels of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been proposed as a useful indicator of the severity of the disease in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Rajasekaran1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Chang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. PSMA is a type-II integral membrane protein, predominantly localized to the epithelial cells of the prostate gland and endowed with folate-hydrolase and carboxypeptidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Rajasekaran1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Its low expression in normal prostate epithelial cells increases several fold in high-grade prostate cancers, in metastatic and in androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Silver1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These features have made it emerging as one of the most promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Silver1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Bander1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The clinical observations suggesting a possible correlation between high levels of IL-6 production and PSMA expression in high-grade prostate cancer prompted us to investigate whether a functional relationship may exist between the presence of PSMA at the cell surface and the level of gene expression of IL-6. CCL5 was also investigated because it shares with IL-6 the mechanism of gene induction and the pro-proliferative activity. The hypothesis that PSMA belonged to the ever increasing category of molecules endowed with signalling properties was also suggested by previous observations showing that silencing, inhibiting or knocking-down PSMA modulates the adhesion/de-adhesion processes via activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in LNCaP cells or via activation of p21-activated kinase1 (PAK1) in normal endothelial cells (HUVEC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Barwe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike what previously done by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Lee2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we decided to stimulate rather than to inhibit or silence PSMA at the surface of LNCaP cells and to overcome the lack of defined PSMA ligand(s) by cross-linking the extra-cellular domain of the molecule with specific antibodies.</p><p>Here, by using the androgen-independent LNCaP cell line, we present for the first time evidence that the antibody-mediated aggregation of PSMA greatly induce the basal gene expression of both IL-6 and CCL5 in LNCaP cells. Gene induction occurs due to an activation cascade involving RAS, RAC1, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs, leading to the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor. In addition, we demonstrate that both IL-6 and CCL5 promote the proliferation of LNCaP tumour cells reaching their maximal activity synergistically. Moreover, we present a novel finding related to the ability of CCL5 to induced proliferation in LNCaP cells thank to the activation of STAT5 and the consequent increase of expression of cyclin D1, a pathway controlling cell growth in normal and prostate cancer cells. This newly discovered functions of PSMA implicate this molecule as an important regulator of the prostate tumour cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals, cell culture reagents and antibodies</title><p>PD098059 and SB202190 inhibitors were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA).

Controls included treatment with anti VCAM-1, with 7E11c or with Gam alone and the use of untreated cells. Cells were then washed and used as a source of cell lysates. We first assayed the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 in crude lysates obtained from the same cell cultures immunoblotted with antibodies specifically detecting the active, phosphorylated form of the two kinases. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>, ERK1/2 and p38 were found activated at low levels in untreated LNCaP cells. Upon PSMA cross-linking, both ERK1/2 and p38 became considerably phosphorylated at 10 min. Sustained levels of phosphorylation lasted up to 20 min, and then returned to basal levels. It is known that the small GTPases RAS and RAC1 lie upstream on the MAPKs activation pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Roberts1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, to examine if PSMA cross-linking could activate also RAC1 in LNCaP cells, we performed an activation assay with a GST-Pak fusion protein which is able to bind and precipitate the active form of RAC1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, PSMA cross-linking determined endogenous RAC1 activation in the same lysates. Similar results were obtained in the case of RAS, whose constitutive activation level was greatly augmented upon PSMA cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Cross-linking performed with an isotype matched mAb recognizing VCAM-1 failed to induce activation in all assays and at all points of the time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g002">Fig. 2, all panels</xref>). Gel densitometry of independent experiments performed with different cell lysates confirmed the significance of the increased activation of ERK1/2, p38, RAC1 and RAS observed following PSMA, but not VCAM-1 cross-linking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004608-t001">Table 1</xref>). Because the time-course of RAS and RAC1 activation paralleled that of p38 and ERK1/2, these results overall indicate that PSMA is able to induce a sustained activation of the RAS- and RAC-MAPK pathways.</p><fig id="pone-0004608-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004608.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Kinetics of ERK1/21/2, p38, RAC 1 and RAS phosphorylation induced by PSMA cross-linking.</title><p>LNCaP cells were left untreated or subjected to PSMA cross-linking for the indicated times at 37&#x000b0;C.

Further, we analyzed the role of PSMA-activated p38 and ERK1/2 in a loss-of-function condition achieved by using two pharmacological inhibitors: SB 202190 (SB), a compound binding specifically p38 and blocking reversibly its enzymatic activity or PD 98059 (PD), an inhibitor specifically preventing the activation of the ERK1/2-activating kinase MEK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Davies1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. LNCaP cells were stimulated as confluent monolayer and harvested 24 h later. To determine the basal and inducible release of IL-6 and CCL5 in culture, LNCaP cells and the corresponding cell-free supernatants were separately recovered from each treated or untreated cell culture. Cell lysates and cell-free supernatants were used to determine respectively the total protein amount and IL-6 and CCL5 accumulation in the supernatant of each sample.

IL-6 and CCL5 appeared to act synergistically in inducing LNCaP cells proliferation, as demonstrated by the finding that the addition of as little as 1 ng/ml of IL-6 to the most effective dose of CCL5 raised the LNCaP cells proliferation up to values which were significantly higher than those of controls (168&#x00025;&#x000b1;2.9, p&#x0003c;0.001), and, perhaps more importantly, greater than those observed in the presence of 5 ng/ml of CCL5 (p&#x0003c;001).

It has been also reported that STAT5 phosphorylation regulates the expression of cyclin D1 in tumor cells including those of prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Brockman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Dagvadorj1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. To investigate the downstream effects of CCR5 engagement in LNCaP cells, the cells were cultured in the presence of 5 ng/ml of CCL5 for the indicated times and then analysed as for the expression of STAT 5 and Cyclin D1 by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g005">Fig. 5 C</xref> phosphorylated STAT5 appeared as a doublet at 30 min. The doublet lowered its intensity at 1 h to return to the almost undetectable level observed in untreated cell at 3 h. Consistently, the amount of cyclin D1 was found more than doubled at 1 h and at 3 h, thus indicating that CCL5 can regulate LNCaP cells proliferation in a STAT 5-Cyclin D1 dependent way. Taken toghether, these results demonstrate that the antibody-mediated clustering of PSMA at the LNCaP cells surface activates signalling pathways able to directly or indirectly control the LNCaP cells growth. To confirm that the complex series of phenomena reported in the previous paragraphs led to LNCaP cells proliferation we decided to test if the cross-linking of PSMA would indeed induce the LNCaP cells proliferation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004608-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> LNCaP cells proliferation was found to be increased following PSMA cross-linking (175&#x00025;&#x000b1;11, p&#x0003c;0.05), whereas the bindings of the sole anti-PSMA, of 7E11c or the cross-linking of 7E11c were all devoid of significant activity.</p><fig id="pone-0004608-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004608.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Effects of pro-proliferative stimuli on LNCaP cells.</title><p>A) LNCaP proliferation induced by treatment with CCL5 and/or IL-6. <sup>3</sup>H-TdR uptake of cells after 24 h of culture with CCL5 (grey bars), 72 h of culture with IL-6 (hatched bars) or 24 h of culture with combinations of CCL5 and IL-6 (crossed bars) at the indicated concentrations.

PSMA recruitment at the surface of LNCaP cells elicits a signaling wave involving small GTPases RAS, RAC1, and MAPK p38 and ERK1/2 activation. Consistent with the p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor was also activated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Naka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> following PSMA stimulation and the minimal basal level of both IL-6 and CCL5 production was increased two-three fold. The discrete role of PSMA-mediated activation of p38 and ERK1/2 was examined under loss-of-function conditions secured by the blocking activity of kinase-specific chemical inhibitors, used at concentrations not affecting the adhesion of LNCaP cells nor the expression of PSMA at their surface (not shown). In this setting, p38 kinase exerted a wider and greater activity than ERK1/2 on both the basal and the PSMA-induced expression of IL-6 and CCL5. A possible explanation of the greater function of p38 may reside in the different roles played by p38 and ERK1/2 in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-IL6, major transactivators of both IL-6 and CCL5 promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Naka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously reported that in normal human thymic epithelial cells p38 MAPK induced the post-transcriptional activation of both NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-IL6, whereas ERK1/2 was involved in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B only. Consistent with the dual activity of p38, its inhibition with SB202190 almost abrogated the cytokine production, whereas ERK1/2 inhibition with PD98059 resulted in a lesser effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Mainiero1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Colombara1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The distinct functions of the two MAPKs may well be reproduced also in prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by our results with the inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190, thus suggesting that also in LNCaP cells p38 MAPK exerts a wider role than ERK1/2 on IL-6 and CCL5 transcription factors.</p><p>The membrane proximal events leading to RAS and RAC1 activation following PSMA recruitment have not been studied yet and full elucidation of these aspects will require further investigations.</p><p>Irrespective of the composition of the signaling platform used by PSMA in transducing external stimuli, our results provide evidence that PMSA can regulate the gene expression of IL-6 and CCL5 in the same LNCaP cells. These results were obtained following direct stimulation of the molecule under &#x0201c;in vitro&#x0201d; conditions closely resembling a physiological setting and without substantial cell manipulations. In addition, because biochemical studies and functional assays were performed with cell lysates and cell supernatants obtained from the same cell cultures, these results directly demonstrated that PSMA-elicited signals flowed efficiently from the membrane to the nucleus. The amount of IL-6 and CCL5 released in culture by the LNCaP cell line may appear lower than that produced by other cell lines. However, it has to be considered that a low concentration measured in cell supernatants can be dramatically high for a portion of the cell membrane and that the LNCaP cell line used by us represents only one of the multiple clones composing the prostate cancer cell population, thus emphasizing the importance that the synergic activity of IL-6 and CCL5 on LNCaP cells proliferation described by us may have in an &#x0201c;vivo&#x0201d; microenvironment. IL-6 has yielded conflicting results in prostate tumor cell lines including LNCaP. Cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic activity as well as growth arrest and neuroendocrine differentiation were all observed following treatment with IL-6 &#x0201c;in vitro&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Culig1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, the notion that the level of IL-6 and its receptor increase during prostate carcinogenesis &#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d; is still unchallenged, so that IL-6 is nowadays considered a good candidate for targeted therapy in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Culig1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Differences in the cellular and experimental systems employed together with the complexity of the signaling pathway elicited by cytokines may possibly explain the divergence between the clinical and the &#x0201c;in vitro&#x0201d; experimental evidence.</p><p>Little is known about CCL5-CCR5 interaction in LNCaP cells, apart from the pro-proliferative activity previously reported by G. Vaday et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Vaday1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and confirmed also in the present paper. The novel finding presented herein is the ability of CCL5 to activate STAT 5 thereby regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and ultimately controlling the LNCaP cell cycle progression.</p><p>Overall, it appears that PSMA signaling may be involved at multiple stages of the LNCaP cell deregulation and possibly also of in vivo tumorigenesis, because 1) increased ERK1/2 activation correlates with increasing Gleason score and advanced tumor stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Carey1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and 2) increased activation of STAT 5 has been observed &#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d; in 65&#x00025; of human prostate cancers, being associated with high histological grade and being a predictor of early disease recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Brockman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Dagvadorj1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Li1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, STAT 5 inhibition induces cell death in human prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Ahonen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It could be hypothesized that following stimulation via PSMA the prostate tumor cells augment IL-6 and CCL5 production which are in turn used as growth factors in both autocrine and paracrine manner, triggering a cell proliferation/survival loop conferring resistance to apoptosis and an overall definite advantage to tumor cell populations. Within this context, the ability of PSMA to activate RAC1 may be highly relevant, inasmuch as RAC1 activation decreases the expression of E-cadherins thereby loosening intercellular adhesions and facilitating the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Woods1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. If so, activated RAC1 could therefore favor the response of LNCaP cells to the mitogenic activity of IL-6 and CCL5 meanwhile participating to the induction of their expression.</p><p>These events may have a direct bearing also on tumor cell proliferation and survival &#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d;. The prostate gland is composed mainly of stromal, epithelial, and neuroendocrine cells. The dynamic balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis maintains the cellular and tissue homeostasis. This balance is generated by a continuous cross-talk among these cell populations resulting from cell-cell contacts and the release of growth factors, chemokines and neuropeptides acting in a paracrine and autocrine manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Rajasekaran1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Deregulation in this communication circuit may contribute to the derangement of one or more tissue component(s) of the prostate gland, possibly resulting in benign prostate hyperplasia or prostate carcinoma. The pathway components here described are already the targets of therapeutic interventions with pharmacologic or biotechnologic inhibitors in other types of epithelial tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004608-Roberts1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, also in prostate tumors the biochemical intermediates involved in NF-&#x003ba;B activation and augmented IL-6/CCL5 gene expression might represent adequate therapeutic targets aiming at interfering with one or more of the MAPKs activation pathway(s), thereby counteracting their effects on tumor cell proliferation and migration</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004608-Naka1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
