CoAA is a coactivator that regulates transcription-coupled splicing and its own pre-mRNA transcript is alternatively spliced. We show here that the CoAA gene is embryonically expressed and alternatively spliced in multiple tissues to three splice variants, CoAA, CoAM and CoAR. During retinoic-acid-induced P19 stem cell differentiation, the expression of CoAA undergoes a rapid switch to its dominant negative splice variant CoAM in the cavity of the embryoid body. CoAM functionally inhibits CoAA, and their switched expression up-regulates differentiation marker Sox6. Using a CoAA minigene cassette, we find that the switched alternative splicing of CoAA and CoAM is regulated by the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence upstream of the CoAA basal promoter. Consistent to this, we show that p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF induce CoAM splice variant through the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence. We have previously shown that the CoAA gene is amplified in human cancers with a recurrent loss of this <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence. These results together suggest that the upstream regulatory sequence contributes to alternative splicing of the CoAA gene during stem cell differentiation, and its selective loss in human cancers potentially deregulates CoAA alternative splicing and alters stem cell differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most eukaryotic genes contain interspersed introns that are removed from pre-mRNA by RNA splicing to yield functional mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In addition to constitutive splicing, the majority of human gene transcripts is alternatively spliced, producing distinct mRNA products which contribute greatly to the complexity of the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Alternative splicing is cell-type-specific and developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Splicing variants yield functionally different proteins which are often critical for specific cellular functions. In contrast, altered alternative splicing patterns are often associated with different types of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and aberrant alternative splicing is one of the characteristics of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing has been extensively shown to be coupled with transcriptional regulation. A number of regulatory proteins may be involved in alternative splicing decisions. These proteins are in the spliceosome particles, the SR protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and a number of cofactor proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although intronic and exonic sequence elements within pre-mRNA are required for splicing, substantial evidence also suggests that protein complexes recruited by promoter sequences determine, in a transcription-coupled manner, the choices and patterns of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). For example, steroid hormones have been shown to regulate alternative splicing through nuclear hormone receptors and their coactivators in promoter complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). One mechanism by which promoter sequences may influence splicing is by directing the assembly of splicing factors on the RNA polymerase II (RNAP) C-terminal domain during RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Coactivator CoAA (<underline>coa</underline>ctivator <underline>a</underline>ctivator) was originally cloned as a nuclear receptor coactivator TRBP/NcoA6-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). CoAA stimulates transcriptional activation mediated by nuclear receptors and transcription factors, and also regulates alternative splicing through a number of steroid hormone receptor-stimulated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). CoAA (also known as paraspeckle protein 2, PSP2) is a major component of nuclear paraspeckles and is colocalized with splicing factor p54<sup>nrb</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). CoAA is a member of the hnRNP family and contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain with 27 repeating tyrosine- and glutamine-rich motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Both RRMs and the C-terminal activation domain are essential for CoAA activities. The C-terminal repeats are homologous to sequences in a family of oncoproteins containing EWS (Ewing's sarcoma) and TLS/FUS (translocation/fusion in liposarcoma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), which regulate alternative splicing. The human CoAA gene itself is also alternatively spliced. One of the splice variants, termed CoAM (<underline>coa</underline>ctivator <underline>m</underline>odulator), contains the N-terminal RRMs but lacks the C-terminal activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). CoAM serves as a natural dominant negative form antagonizing the functions of CoAA in transcription and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that the CoAA gene at chromosome 11q13 is amplified in human cancers including lung and skin cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Molecular analysis reveals the CoAA-coding sequence and its basal promoter are retained within the amplicon, whereas a upstream sequence is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The recurring gene aberration with loss of the CoAA regulatory sequence implies a potential functional importance of the CoAA gene regulation, including its alternative splicing. In this study, using an embryonal carcinoma (EC) P19 stem cell neuronal differentiation system, we demonstrate that the expression of CoAA dramatically switches to its alternative splicing variant CoAM in cells destined to form the cavity of embryoid bodies (EBs). Overexpression of CoAM induces differentiation marker Sox6 in the absence of retinoic acid (RA), suggesting the switch from CoAA to CoAM expression may play an important role in promoting differentiation. Furthermore, we show that deletion of a CoAA upstream regulatory element, which is lost in a number of cancers, impairs the switch in alternative splicing from CoAA to CoAM in a CoAA minigene cassette. In particular, CoAA down-regulation is absent. Data thus support a model in which loss of the regulatory element disturbs the balance of alternative splicing of the CoAA gene and results in constant CoAA expression and defective CoAM expression. This defect may promote maintenance of a stem cell phenotype and prevent differentiation. In summary, our study indicates that switched alternative splicing of the CoAA gene is regulated by its upstream sequence during stem cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Polyclonal anti-CoAA antibody (CoAA specific, against 307&#x02013;545 aa) and anti-RRM antibody (against 1&#x02013;156 aa of CoAM) were prepared in rabbits by immunization with GST fusion proteins (Covance).

The EBs were trypsinized and plated in tissue culture dish. The cells were further differentiated (D3&#x02013;D12) for an additional 12 days in the absence of RA.

The CoAA minigene was designed to prevent the expression of functional CoAA and CoAM proteins that otherwise might interfere with splicing of its own minigene. Excluding the promoter region, the human CoAA gene spans &#x0223c;11&#x02009;kb containing three exons, nt 1&#x02013;432, 7589&#x02013;9053 and 9836&#x02013;10&#x02009;718 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Deletions were introduced to the minigene within the first intron (645&#x02013;7419), within the second exon (7876&#x02013;8801) that encodes the activation domain, and within the third exon (10&#x02009;044&#x02013;10&#x02009;718) containing the 3&#x02032; untranslated region. A 1-nt (G) insertion in the first exon disrupted the open reading frame and prevented the production of RRM domains. Expression of CoAA and CoAM transcripts was detected using vector-specific primers that distinguish the minigene and the endogenous gene transcripts. A cassette consisting of the CoAA minigene linked naturally to various fragments of its own promoter was inserted into a promoter-less pcDNA3 vector (BglII to XhoI). As a control, a separate construct was prepared with the CoAA minigene expressed under the control of a CMV promoter in pcDNA3.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>Normalized first-strand cDNAs from multiple normal human tissues and cancer cell lines (MTC&#x02122; panels, Clontech) were analyzed by PCR using primer pairs common to all CoAA splicing forms.

We have previously shown that the CoAA gene is alternatively spliced and produces CoAA and CoAM transcripts through competitive 5&#x02032; alternative splicing events between the second and third exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The resulting CoAA and CoAM proteins share two N-terminal RRM domains, but only CoAA possesses the C-terminal activation domain containing repeated YxxQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Consequently, CoAA is a potent transcriptional coactivator, whereas CoAM competes with CoAA via shared RRM domains and represses CoAA activities in both transcription and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In this study, using RT-PCR analysis we identified a third splice variant of CoAA, designated here as CoAR (<underline>coa</underline>ctivator <underline>r</underline>egulator), in multiple human adult and embryonic tissues, and in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Sequencing analysis indicated that the CoAR transcript was derived by joining the first and third exons, skipping the entire second exon and altering the reading frame for the third exon. CoAR contains only one RRM domain encoded by the first exon. The transcriptional activity of CoAR is moderately repressive when expressed in a transient transfection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). This splice variant was previously undetected due to its low abundance in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), in which CoAA and CoAM were originally cloned. The nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of CoAR have been deposited at the NCBI with accession number DQ294957. </p><p>The CoAA mRNA transcript is expressed in all tissues and cells examined as shown by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), a result consistent with previous northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Sequence analyses confirmed that the three PCR products observed are the three CoAA splice variants. The CoAA transcript is relatively abundant in both normal tissues and cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). However, the relative levels of CoAA, CoAM and CoAR mRNAs vary between samples. In some human fetal tissues and cancer cell lines, CoAM or CoAR expression is below the limits of detection. The variation in the expression ratios of CoAA isoforms, which could partially due to the alternative splicing regulations, represents a possible cell-specific control of CoAA activity through its inhibitory splice variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Switched alternative splicing of CoAA and CoAM during P19 stem cell differentiation</title><p>To investigate CoAA alternative splicing in a physiological context, we analyzed a murine EC stem cell line, P19, during neuronal differentiation. P19 is a teratocarcinoma-derived pluripotent stem cell line that can give rise to all three germ layers in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Undifferentiated P19 EC cells in culture can be induced by RA to differentiate to neuronal and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) or by DMSO to cardiac and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Treatment of P19 EC cells with RA for up to 4 days induces non-adhering aggregates called EBs which resemble the inner cell mass of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Prolonged culture in the absence of RA for an additional 12 days induces neuronal differentiation into a mixture of cell types including differentiated neurons and glial cells, as well as a variety of partially differentiated or undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the expression of endogenous CoAA and its splicing variant transcripts using RNA isolated at different time points during P19 cell differentiation. Expression of CoAA shows a rapid but transient decrease, reaching the minimum at Day 4 corresponding to the EB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, the expression of CoAM is drastically increased during EB formation, reaching the maximum level at Day 4 and declining rapidly during further differentiation. These data indicate that an alternative splicing switch between CoAA and CoAM occurs during EB formation. The expression of CoAR is very low and without significant change at the EB stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We focused our subsequent analysis on CoAA and CoAM. The switched expression was confirmed using primer pairs common to both CoAA and CoAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), and was quantitatively measured by real-time PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). A number of differentiation markers were analyzed simultaneously as controls. The expression of Nanog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) followed by Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), and then by CoAA declines upon RA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Meanwhile, the expression levels of Sox6, a member of the Sox (<underline>S</underline>RY b<underline>ox</underline>) gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), a neuronal marker, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a glial cell marker, increase sequentially during neuronal differentiation. These data together suggest that a switched expression of CoAA transcripts occurs during the EB stages of P19 cell differentiation. We also examined mouse ES cells and switch from CoAA to CoAM expression was also found in ES cells during EB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Since the EB of ES cells was undisrupted in continued culture condition, the down-regulation of CoAM was delayed, correlating to the presence of EB. In addition to RA-induced neuronal differentiation, the switched expression of CoAA and CoAM was also detected during DMSO-induced muscle differentiation of P19 cells (not shown). These results indicate that the increase of CoAM, which inhibits CoAA transcriptional activity, might be common in different type of stem cell differentiation at the EB stage. </p><p>To detect the expression of CoAA and CoAM at the protein level, we evaluated the two CoAA polyclonal antibodies. One was raised against the two N-terminal RRM domains (anti-RRM) for detecting both CoAA and CoAM, and the other was raised against the CoAA-specific C-terminal activation domain (anti-CoAA). A CoAM-specific antibody is not feasible due to its overlapping primary sequence with CoAA. The two antibodies detected both endogenous and overexpressed CoAA in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The endogenous CoAM protein level is very low in this cell line, which is consistent with its mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). </p><p>Since CoAM mRNA is significantly elevated in EBs of P19 cells, we compared the staining pattern of the two antibodies to infer the expression pattern of CoAM. EBs are large multi-cell aggregates that form cavities at Day 4 of RA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). CoAA expression, assessed by anti-CoAA, was detected in almost all cells of early-stage EBs, but only in the outer layer of mature EBs. CoAA was not detected in the EB cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, the high level of expression of CoAM, detected by anti-RRM with the comparison of anti-CoAA, was found predominantly within the EB cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The majority of signals within the cavity is unlikely contributed by CoAR when the mRNA level is considered, especially, when further confirmed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Most of the CoAM protein appears to be in cytoplasm although a low level of nuclear CoAM may also be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This pattern was also confirmed by overexpression of a Flag-tagged CoAM in P19 cells (Supplementary Figure S3). A mechanism in regulating the nuclear&#x02013;cytoplasm shuttle of CoAM at this stage is unclear, however, other splicing regulators have been reported to be shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The rapid decline of CoAM expression in later stages of differentiation might be due to the loss of CoAM-containing cells through apoptosis in the cavity, where a high level of cleaved active caspase-3 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). CoAM mRNA levels appear to decline more rapidly than CoAM protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). At the D3 stage, CoAM protein still remains but CoAM mRNA is almost absent. This is possibly due to the longer protein half-life and the shorter mRNA half-life during degradation processes when cells become apoptotic. Our data together suggest that cells expressing CoAM are located in the EB cavity. Since CoAM potently represses transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), it may regulate target gene expression and splicing during essential steps of cavitation at the EB stage.</p><p>To confirm the involvement of CoAA in neuronal differentiation, we compared the endogenous CoAA protein expression patterns in mouse embryonic tissues at gestational stages of E12.5 and E15.5 by immunohistochemistry. In the developing brain, CoAA is widely expressed in the neocortex at E12.5. The expression is reduced in the ventricular zone at E15.5, but is enriched in neurons migrated to the cortical plate that raises cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Due to the high expression level of CoAA and low expression levels of CoAM and CoAR, the anti-RRM antibody that detects all three CoAA splicing forms was unable to distinguish from anti-CoAA in immunohistochemical staining (data not shown). However, the data did not exclude the possibility that CoAM and CoAR are present in certain tissues, in which their mRNAs were detected by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, high levels of CoAA expression were detected in almost all fetal tissues at E12.5 (Supplementary Figure S1). By contrast, at E15.5, CoAA expression appeared to be restricted to certain cell types during differentiation (Supplementary Figure S2). These results nonetheless suggest that the CoAA is a predominant form and is expressed in a cell-specific manner during differentiation in multiple tissues including brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased CoAA and increased CoAM induce Sox6 expression in P19 cells</title><p>The ability of CoAM to antagonize CoAA function, together with the dramatic decrease of CoAA and the increase of CoAM in the EB cavity, raise the possibility that the switch of CoAA and CoAM might be involved in regulating differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we altered CoAA and CoAM levels by overexpressing or RNAi, and monitored the expression level of differentiation marker genes, including Sox6 and MAP2. Sox6 is a member of a protein family defined by a high mobility group protein domain, called SRY box. Sox family proteins are widely involved in differentiation including sex determination, and in brain, bone and muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Sox6 is known to be up-regulated during neuronal differentiation in P19 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and has a function in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Since the up-regulation of CoAM is immediately followed by that of Sox6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), we chose Sox6 as one of the marker genes for analysis. We overexpressed CoAM or applied CoAA RNAi in undifferentiated P19 cells in the absence of RA. The siRNA for CoAA was evaluated in P19 cells (Supplementary Figure S4) and was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). While earlier differentiation markers such as Nanog or Oct4 did not change levels in the absence of RA induction, the expression of Sox6 and the neuronal marker MAP2 was induced by overexpressing CoAM or by the treatment with CoAA siRNA in the absence of RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The endogenous CoAA level was decreased during both treatments. The data indicate that CoAA and CoAM may be specific in regulating a subset of genes including Sox6, especially in their downstream differentiation pathways. However, the increased Sox6 level was transient in contrast to the effect of RA induced differentiation, which produced a sustained elevation of Sox6. The relapse effect might be due to the transient increase of CoAM or the transient decrease of CoAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These data nevertheless suggest that CoAA and CoAM are able to directly or indirectly regulate Sox6. It is still yet to be known whether CoAA and CoAM are necessary or sufficient to maintain the differentiation program in the absence of RA induction. In summary, the ratio of CoAA and its dominant negative CoAM may be critical during P19 stem cell differentiation, particularly at the EB stage. </p></sec><sec><title>Construction of CoAA minigene</title><p>Alternative splicing is regulated at multiple levels, particularly when coupled with transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Evidence has suggested that alternative splicing can be regulated through intronic or exonic enhancers and silencers as well as differential usage of promoter and regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We have previously identified the loss of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of amplified CoAA gene in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), suggesting that this sequence may play an important regulatory role. To investigate if this sequence regulates the alternative splicing of the CoAA gene in P19 cells, we constructed a shortened CoAA minigene with intact splicing junctions. The minigene is under the control of CoAA promoter with or without its native <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences. Thus, the CoAA minigene splicing can be analyzed in P19 cells using transient transfection approach.</p><p>The design of the minigene ensures that no functional CoAA or CoAM protein is expressed but alternative splicing capability is preserved. The rationale for this design is to eliminate the potential effect of the CoAA protein in regulating its own splicing. The CoAA minigene was constructed with a shortened first large intron, a reading frame-shift mutation in the first exon and a deletion within the second exon encoding the activation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) (see Materials and methods section). A minimum of 160 nucleotides surrounding each splicing site was left intact. The minigene was first evaluated under a CMV promoter by RT-PCR using vector-specific primers to avoid endogenous interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). The results demonstrate that the CoAA minigene was capable of producing both CoAA and CoAM equivalent transcripts, when CoAA and CoAM cDNAs were used as positive controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We also verified that the CoAA minigene has no coactivator effect on activation of an MMTV-luciferase reporter, which is consistent with the predicted absence of CoAA or CoAM functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Although potential intronic or exonic regulatory elements in the minigene could be affected, our data indicate that the CoAA minigene preserves its splicing capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), as well as its switching capacity (see below). </p><p>The minigene was then constructed under control of the CoAA basal promoter with various lengths of its upstream <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence to evaluate the regulation of the alternative splicing switch in P19 cells. The human CoAA gene contains a highly GC-rich basal promoter with predicted transcription-factor-binding sites for Sp1 and NF-Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and Supplementary Figure S5). These transcription-factor-binding sites and their spacing are highly conserved among human, mouse and rat species. Within a 10&#x02009;kb sequence upstream of the human CoAA gene, there are 21 <italic>Alu</italic> repeats, which belong to the short interspersed repetitive sequences (SINEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). A similar pattern of SINEs is also present in the mouse CoAA gene. We have previously cloned 5&#x02009;kb of the human CoAA upstream sequence and generated a series of deletion fragment constructs with a luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Serial deletions of this <italic>Alu</italic>-rich sequence significantly increased the reporter expression in P19 cells, suggesting that this region contains a <italic>cis</italic>-acting silencing element in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Further deletion of the basal promoter region successively reduced the transcription activity, indicating that an intact basal promoter is essential for gene activation. Together, these data suggest that an <italic>Alu</italic>-containing <italic>cis</italic>-regulating element and the CoAA basal promoter are functionally required in P19 cells. The various lengths of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences in the CoAA minigene were then compared in subsequent splicing analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF are involved in regulating of the alternative splicing of CoAM</title><p>We first tested the alternative splicing of the CoAA minigene in P19 cells using two well-characterized splicing regulators, polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) and p54 nuclear RNA-binding protein (p54<sup>nrb</sup>). PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup> are RRM-containing proteins that have been suggested to regulate pre-mRNA splicing and to associate with transcription and splicing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">38&#x02013;43</xref>). Both endogenous PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup> are present in undifferentiated P19 cells (not shown). In the absence of RA induction, overexpression of either PSF or p54<sup>nrb</sup> in undifferentiated P19 EC cells induced a very significant elevation of endogenous CoAM, but not of CoAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The stimulation of CoAM expression by PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup> was also evident in cells transfected with the P0 minigene, that carries the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating <italic>Alu</italic>-containing sequence (&#x02212;5000 to +88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). However, there was much less induction of CoAM transcript when the CoAA P2 minigene was driven only by the CoAA basal promoter (&#x02212;1320 to +88) under the same condition. In addition, p54<sup>nrb</sup>, but not PSF, significantly induced CoAM expression from the CoAA minigene driven by a CMV promoter. These data suggest that inclusion of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence in the minigene promotes CoAM splicing similar to that in the endogenous gene. In contrast, CMV has a different promoter protein complex assembly, which may permit regulation by p54<sup>nrb</sup> but not by PSF. The p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA is relatively constant while PSF mRNA increased in RA-induced P19 cells as detected by RT-PCR analysis (not shown). There is no apparent correlation between the expression levels of p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF and the switch from CoAA to CoAM during RA-induced differentiation. Thus, the involvement of p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF in regulating alternative splicing of the CoAA gene might be due to their protein modifications at the particular differentiation stage. RA may induce certain signaling pathways that lead to the p54<sup>nrb</sup>/PSF activation in a splicing complex responsible for CoAM expression. Our data minimally suggest that the alternative splicing of CoAM can be regulated through PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup>, although other splicing factors might also be involved. The data also indicate that the promoter and upstream <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences are involved in alternative splicing decisions. </p><p>To seek potential mechanism for the involvement of CoAA promoter and regulatory sequence in alternative splicing, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using antibodies against p54<sup>nrb</sup>, RNAP II, one of the SR proteins named SRp20, and transcription factor NF-Y, whose binding sites are present in the CoAA promoter (Supplementary Figure S5). ChIP analysis suggests that there are physical interactions of protein complexes containing p54<sup>nrb</sup>, RNAP II, SRp20 and NF-Y with the CoAA basal promoter region as well as the <italic>Alu</italic>-containing <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>B and C). NF-Y, RNAP II, p54<sup>nrb</sup> and SRp20 all strongly interact with the CoAA basal promoter region (&#x02212;80&#x02009;bp) at all time points of RA induction. However, they have varied interaction strength with the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences (&#x02212;3000 and &#x02212;8500&#x02009;bp) during differentiation. In particular, their interactions are generally increased at the EB2 stage. p54<sup>nrb</sup>, however, has a different interacting pattern, in which the interaction with the &#x02212;3000-bp region is more constant than the interaction with the &#x02212;8500-bp region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The alteration of interaction level during RA-induced differentiation is correlated with the early stage of EB formation. Although the details of the interacting pattern during differentiation may be complex, our data suggest that there are interactions among promoter/enhancer complexes and splicing factors including p54<sup>nrb</sup>. These data further support that alternative splicing regulation may require the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence and the basal promoter of the CoAA gene.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence is responsible for alternative splicing switch from CoAA to CoAM during P19 cell differentiation</title><p>To examine the upstream <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence in regulating alternative splicing of CoAA and CoAM during P19 cell differentiation, we compared the CoAA minigene with different lengths of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence. During RA-induced EB formation, the endogenous CoAA gene undergoes a dramatic switch in alternative splicing from CoAA to CoAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The P0 (&#x02212;5000 to +88) minigene, though at a reduced expression level, undergoes a similar switch, which has similar timing to that of the endogenous CoAA gene at stage EB4. In contrast, the P2 (&#x02212;1320 to +88) and the P4 (&#x02212;410 to +88) minigenes containing the basal promoter region have relatively high levels of expression of both CoAA and CoAM but are unable to induce a complete switch after RA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). There was up-regulation of CoAM, but the down-regulation of CoAA was totally absent. Thus, when compared to the endogenous gene or P0 minigene, the expression of CoAM transcript from the P2 and P4 minigene fails to remain dominant at the EB4 stage. In addition, the CMV-driven minigene, in which the CoAA basal promoter was substituted with a CMV promoter, shows an incomplete switch in expression between CoAA and CoAM upon RA induction. Quantification of the PCR products in the gel is shown in the lower panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. The transcriptional level appears to be linked with alternative splicing on the CoAA minigene. The higher transcriptional rates in the P2 or P4 minigene are correlated with inadequate CoAM splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), whereas a lower transcriptional rate in the P0 minigene shows an almost complete switch from CoAA transcript to CoAM transcript. These data imply a linked transcription rate and alternative splicing regulation, and again suggests that regulatory sequence and promoter context are involved in regulating alternative splicing decisions. As switched expression of CoAA and CoAM is correlated with EB cavitation during stem cell differentiation, the CoAA gene at this stage might be regulated at the alternative splicing level through its promoter and <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Increasing evidence indicates that alternative splicing plays an important role in differentiation and development. We show here, during neuronal stem cell differentiation, the alternative splicing of CoAA switches to its dominant negative CoAM during the cavitation of the EB. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the switched expression of alternative splicing variants with antagonizing functions during EB cavitation. The switch subsequently induces the expression of differentiation marker Sox6. In addition, we show that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating element of the CoAA gene is required for the switch, which leads to suppressed CoAA activity through both reduced CoAA expression and functional inhibition by CoAM. As shown in the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), while the basal promoter region activates transcription and stimulates the production of CoAA, the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence represses transcription and stimulates alternative splicing of CoAM. This balance is shifted, presumably by regulating factors, binding the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence during EB cavitation. In human cancers, in which the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence was lost from the amplified CoAA gene, this balance might be irreversibly altered so that CoAA is overexpressed, consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>); and CoAM may be underexpressed in stem cells with disturbed normal differentiation. Sustained coactivator CoAA expression would be predicted to impact target genes with respect to both transcription and alternative splicing, perhaps contributing to maintaining an undifferentiated cell phenotype. </p><p>The mRNA expression pattern of the endogenous CoAA gene is complex. All three isoforms are identified by RT-PCR in the majority of human tissues and are confirmed by subsequent nucleotide sequencing. Their relative ratio and abundance in each tissue partially reflect the alternative splicing regulation of the CoAA gene. Because of the absence of additional upstream open reading frame in the CoAA gene, the ratio change is less likely due to the nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Our analysis of protein levels is limited by the overlapping nature of the primary sequences, and the generally low levels of CoAM and CoAR. The endogenous CoAM protein is difficult to detect except in EB. CoAA, however, is found in all cell lines analyzed, including P19 cells, and is abundant in many tissues analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Although CoAR is a functional repressor for CoAA, CoAR may not contribute significantly to the suppressed CoAA activity in the EB cavity, largely because the low levels of expression and the absence of up-regulation at EB stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This is probably because both CoAA and CoAR share splicing junctions at exon 1 and exon 3. In contrast, CoAM utilizes a unique splicing junction at exon 2, whose regulation may be separated from that of CoAA. Thus, the observed protein increase in EB cavity is contributed by CoAM. In addition, CoAA protein is expressed in most cells at the mouse E12.5 stage (Supplementary Figure S1). At later stages of development, the expression appears to become gradually restricted to cells undergoing further differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In adult mouse, CoAA expression is also quite abundant in some tissues examined, including in germ cells of testis (Supplementary Figure S2). The CoAA expression pattern suggests a functional role of CoAA in multiple tissues. Its dominant negatives, whose levels in specific cells remain to be determined, may regulate CoAA by changing their relative ratios through alternative splicing.</p><p>The basal promoter of the CoAA gene appears to be highly conserved among human, mouse and rat species (Supplementary Figure S5). The <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence is also quite conserved with a similar high density of <italic>Alu</italic> repeats in human and B1 repeats in mouse. These sequence features suggest that the CoAA gene may share a similar regulation cross species. Although protein factors associated with the CoAA regulatory sequences are largely unknown, there are three conserved NF-Y sites and one conserved Sp1 site located within the CoAA basal promoter. In contrast, the CMV promoter contains four cyclic AMP-responsive elements (CREs), three NF-&#x003ba;B sites and one Sp1 site. The CMV promoter does not show apparent homology with the CoAA promoter. However, their distinct but overlapping protein-binding profiles might provide the explanation that both p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF induce CoAM expression through the protein interactions on the CoAA promoter, while only p54<sup>nrb</sup> but not PSF induces CoAM expression through the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Presumably, the protein complexes on each promoter have differential interactions with p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSF. Our ChIP analysis indeed suggests that there are dynamic protein interactions between transcription/splicing complexes and CoAA promoter sequence, or <italic>Alu</italic>-rich <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Especially, the protein complexes increase the interaction with the <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequence at early stage of EB formation (EB2). Thus, it is evident that the CoAA gene may be regulated through its <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences during EB formation. The functions of <italic>Alu</italic> repeats have been shown to be associated with gene regulation including CpG methylation-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45 B46 B47">45&#x02013;47</xref>), and hormone-induced gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">48</xref>). Evidence has also suggested that <italic>Alu</italic> repeats contain alternative splicing enhancers and silencers, and participate in alternative splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">49</xref>). In addition, the repetitive nature of <italic>Alu</italic> repeats may facilitate DNA rearrangement, which explains the aberration of the CoAA gene in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although the precise size of the CoAA <italic>cis</italic>-regulating element has not been defined, our results suggest that the <italic>Alu</italic>-rich region critically regulates CoAA expression and alternative splicing, at least during stem cell differentiation.</p><p>Since both the RRMs and the C-terminal activation domain are required for CoAA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the alternatively spliced CoAM may compete with CoAA through their shared RRMs. The RRM domains have been shown to be the most abundant protein domains in nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">52</xref>), however, several available crystal structure analyses indicate the structures of RRMs are highly specific. For example, the RRMs of hnRNP A1, U1A and sex lethal have their unique peptide architectures with specific interacting surfaces toward nucleic acids or proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">53</xref>). In this regard, the RRM-containing CoAM may compete only with CoAA for the same binding partners and thus serve as a CoAA dominant negative. The abundance of CoAM will then become critical for controlling endogenous CoAA function. And therefore, the switched alternative splicing between CoAA and CoAM may be an important approach to fine-tune CoAA activity, especially during differentiation at the EB stage.</p><p>Cell fate determination in stem cell differentiation involves a complex pattern of gene regulation including alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">55</xref>). Although RA is a nuclear receptor ligand, its target genes during differentiation are largely undetermined. CoAA as a nuclear receptor coactivator may also regulate an array of genes, including their alternative splicing. A cascade of alternative splicing regulation during differentiation and development has been documented, which might facilitate the understanding of the CoAA function. One of the best examples is the <italic>sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>Sxl</italic>) gene in sex determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Sxl</italic> regulates <italic>transformer</italic>, which in turn regulates <italic>double-sex</italic>, all through alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The <italic>Sxl</italic> transcript is alternatively spliced producing an RRM-containing protein that stimulates its own splicing via a positive feedback mechanism. This establishes and maintains the status of <italic>Sxl</italic> alternative splicing and determines phenotype of male or female in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">56</xref>). Similarly, the CoAA gene is also alternatively spliced producing splicing regulators with antagonized functions. In addition, CoAA regulates its own gene through positive feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In the absence of RA induction, overexpression of CoAM alone, which shares identical RRMs with CoAA, can significantly stimulate the production of the differentiation marker Sox6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, Sox6 and some Sox family members have also been shown to regulate alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">37</xref>). Thus, a potential cascade of splicing regulation involving CoAA might exist during stem cell differentiation. Further studies are needed to confirm if the on/off switch of CoAA controls specific differentiation programs in the mammalian system and which factors, including PSF and p54<sup>nrb</sup>, are responsible for the switch.</p><p>In summary, we find that the alternative splicing of CoAA switches to its dominant negative form CoAM during EB cavitation of EC cell differentiation. In addition, we show that CoAA promoter and <italic>cis</italic>-regulating sequences play an important role in regulating alternative splicing. The finding not only provides a potential explanation for oncogenic CoAA in regulating stem cell differentiation, but also supports the concept that the promoter/enhancer participates in alternative splicing decisions.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkl1092_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkl1092_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank William S.
