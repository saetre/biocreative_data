Recently SURFINs, a new family of antigens encoded by the <italic>surf </italic>multi-gene family, has been reported. One member of the family, SURFIN<sub>4.2</sub>, was found present both at the pRBC-surface and at the merozoite apex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The presence of a second SURFIN member, SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>(PFD0100c, PFD0105c) is reported here. Bioinformatic tools were used to study the structure of the <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene. To investigate the expression of <italic>surf </italic>genes PCR and real-time quantitative PCR (Rt-QPCR) were employed and Northern and Western blots were used to confirm the size of the <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene and the SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>protein respectively. Localization of SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>was determined using immunofluorescence assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene was found present in one copy by Rt-QPCR in some parasites (3D7AH1, 3D7S8, 7G8) whereas six copies of the gene were identified in FCR3 and FCR3S1.2. <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>was found transcribed in the late asexual stages of the parasite beginning &#x02248;32 hours post invasion and throughout the schizont stages with the level of transcription peaking at late schizogony. The levels of transcript correlated with the number of gene copies in FCR3 and 3D7S8. <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>was found to encode a polypeptide of &#x02248;Mw 258 kDa (SURFIN<sub>4.1</sub>) present within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), around free merozoites as merozoite-associated material, but not at the pRBC-surface. Despite multiple <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene copies in some parasites this was not reflected in the levels of SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>polypeptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>is a member of the SURFINs, present in the PV and on the released merozoite. The results suggest different SURFINs to be expressed at different locations in the parasite and at distinct time-points during the intra-erythrocytic cycle.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The erythrocytic life cycle of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>is characterized by complex interactions of parasite derived surface exposed antigens with host receptors and immune defence proteins. At the surface of the the parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs), parasite antigens provide adhesive properties and at the same time allow for limited parasite resistance to the host immune response by virtue of great sequence variability. In case of the well-characterized surface antigen <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a multi-adhesive variable ligand of 200&#x02013;400 kDa, this is achieved by clonal exchange, "switching" of the mutually expressed PfEMP1 encoding <italic>var </italic>gene. A unique set of &#x02248;60 <italic>var </italic>genes is present in each parasite genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. With the release of merozoites from the host cell, a number of additional parasite proteins are exposed to the immune system, which, in response to the host immune pressure, show polymorphisms or are differentially expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The merozoite, which is the invasive form of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, invades erythrocytes in a cascade of events in which multiple receptor-ligand interactions facilitate parasite attachment, reorientation, junction formation and entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The machinery employed in this process is complex and involves proteins at the merozoite surface and in specialized secretory organelles at the merozoite apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Triggered by the initial parasite attachment to the host cell, micronemes and/or rhoptries release their contents. The Duffy binding-like (DBL) family (EBA-175 and its paralogues EBA-140 (BAEBL) and EBA-181 (JESEBL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) in micronemes and the reticulocyte binding like (RBL) family (PfRh1, PfRh2a, PfRh2b, PfRh3 and PfRh4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) in the neck of rhoptries have been shown to be relevant for merozoite infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, several copies of Pf <italic>Rh1 </italic>gene were reported in FCR3, W2mef, and FCB1 (13, 3 and 4 respectively) when compared to 3D7. Thus, apart from the different protein antigens expressed on the surface of the merozoite, the complexity of the malaria parasite is increasing by the introduction of gene duplications and deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>SURFINs are a small family of large (200&#x02013;300 kDa) proteins, which are composed of domains structurally related to PvSTP1 of <italic>Plasmodium vivax </italic>but also other exported and surface exposed parasite proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], including PfEMP1, the <italic>P. vivax </italic>VIR family and <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi </italic>variant surface antigen (SICA<italic>var</italic>). In accordance with this structural relationship, SURFIN<sub>4.2 </sub>was found co-transported with PfEMP1 to the pRBC-surface. The protein is also observed on the merozoite as merozoite-associated material (MAM) at the apical end of the released merozoites. In the 3D7 parasite SURFINs are encoded by 10 surface-associated interspersed (<italic>surf</italic>) genes, which are located close or within the subtelomeric region of five chromosomes. Frequent recombination events in this area are responsible for the considerable variability of proteins encoded in this region, also observed in SURFINs. N-terminally, SURFINs contain a cysteine rich domain (CRD) defined by six conserved cysteine residues, five of which are found positionally conserved in PvSTP1. The CRD precedes a region of high size and sequence variability, followed by a putative transmembrane (TM) region. In contrast to the variable N-terminal region, the C-terminal domain of SURFINs is relatively conserved and characterized by tryptophane rich domains (WRD) of approximately 150 amino acid residues, separated by less conserved sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The WRDs establish a structural link to several <italic>Plasmodium </italic>surface proteins, i.e. PfEMP1, <italic>Pk</italic>SICA<italic>var </italic>and also the giant erythrocyte membrane protein 332 (Pf332), of which recent data also suggests surface exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the study were to analyze the <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene structure to determine whether it is a pseudo gene, as previously annotated, or a complete functional gene. The transcription pattern of the <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene and localization of SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>on the protein level were also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Parasites and cultures</title><p>Parasites 3D7AH1, 3D7S8, FCR3, FCR3S1.2, 7G8 and TM180 were maintained in continuous culture according to standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>surf </italic>gene presence and sequence heterogeneity in various parasite lines</title><p>Based on the 3D7 sequences of the annotated SURFINs, two sets of forward and reverse primers (Primer set 1 and Primer set 2), were designed for each <italic>surf </italic>gene.

Total RNA was extracted using the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, USA) and DNAse treated (Ambion, USA). The RNA (100 ng) was reverse transcribed (RT+) using MuLV reverse transcriptase enzyme and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Primers (<italic>surf</italic>C<sub>4.1</sub>F/R and Sintra<sub>4.1 </sub>F/R) were consequently designed on opposite sides of the intergenic region of the two previously annotated genes (yielding amplification products of 1160 bp and 450 bp respectively, see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). cDNA from ring stages, trophozoite stages and schizont stages was amplified using <italic>surf</italic>C<sub>4.1</sub>F and <italic>surf</italic>C<sub>4.1</sub>R.

Goat-anti-rabbit Ig coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:10,000, Amersham Biotech, Sweden) was used as secondary antibody and the protein was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) (SIGMA) in water.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>copy numbers and transcription levels</title><p>Copy numbers of <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>were determined for 7G8, 3D7AH1, FCR3 and their daughter clones 3D7S8 and FCR3S1.2. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared using Easy-DNA&#x02122; Kit (Invitrogen) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, transcriptional levels were analysed for 3D7S8 and FCR3. Parasites were kept tightly synchronized using 5 % (w/v) sorbitol, and were harvested at 4 h post invasion intervals for two consecutive parasite generations. RNA from each time point was isolated using the RNeasy<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and contaminating gDNA was removed using the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Total RNA was reversely transcribed with SuperScript III RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), with random hexamers and oligo(dT)<sub>12&#x02013;18 </sub>(300 ng/ml and 25 ng/ml respectively; Invitrogen) at 50&#x000b0;C for two hours. For each cDNA synthesis reaction, a control reaction without reverse transcriptase (RT-) was performed with identical amounts of template. For real-time quantitative PCR (Rt-QPCR) determination of copy numbers as well as to monitor relative transcription of <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>to the endogenous control <italic>seryl-tRNA synthetase</italic>, the primers <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>were employed:</p><p>5'-TTTGAAGCTCCTGGTCAAGGA-3', <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1</sub>-3': TTGTTTGTGCAAGTGTTTTGAAAG, PF07_0073-5': TATCATCTCAACAGGTAT CTACATCTCCTA and PF07_0073-3': TTTGAGAGTTACATGTGGTATCATCTTTT. These primers as well as the complete Rt-QPCR amplified product were designed to conserved regions in the parasite lines studied. Amplification efficiencies of the primer pairs were tested on dilution series of both gDNA and cDNA from all parasites, and were proven sufficiently close (ranging from 94.4 to 99.2%) to obviate the need for a correction factor. Amplification reactions for both relative copy numbers (gDNA) and relative transcription (cDNA) were done in quadruplicate in 20 &#x003bc;l, containing Power SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 300 nM of each forward and reverse primer and 2 ng of template. Forty five cycles (95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min) were performed in an ABI sequence detector 7500 (Applied Biosystems). Relative copy numbers were analysed according to the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method and plotted using SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software Inc.).

This was obtained by bioinformatic analysis and confirmed by PCR, which shows that <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>is one complete gene with three exons separated by two introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In PlasmoDB, <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene was previously annotated as two individual open reading frames, PFD0100c and PFD0105c separated by a 410 bp intergenic region (hereby referred to as intergenic region). However, RT-PCR amplification using primers designed to amplify the fragment surrounding this intergenic region, showed a single band from cDNA indicating that the annotation was incorrect and that these two predicted open reading frames compose a single open reading frame. This led to the recent re-annotation of the gene in PlasmoDB v5.4. In this study the <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>transcript was shown to be a single open reading frame in 3D7S8, FCR3, FCR3S1.2, 3D7AH1, 7G8 and TM180 parasite lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>from gene to protein</bold>.

The gene encodes a 258 kDa protein, SURFIN<sub>4.1</sub>, which is of a slightly smaller molecular weight than the previously characterised SURFIN<sub>4.2 </sub>(286.4 kDa) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>With the knowledge that <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>exists as one complete gene, copy number polymorphisms were analysed in different parasite isolates.

The increase in <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>gene copy numbers correlated with a five-fold increase in RNA transcription observed in FCR3 compared to the 3D7S8 parasite strain. However, the increase in copy number of the gene was not reflected on level of protein, rather that the protein was present a similar levels in the two parasites. This might be due to sequence differences in the protein in FCR3, resulting in poorer recognition by the antibodies raised using a protein construct from 3D7S8 And another possibility may be that there is a certain level of translational repression as has been previously described in <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The temporal transcriptional profile of <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>was analysed in the 3D7S8 and FCR3 parasite strains. <italic>surf</italic><sub>4.1 </sub>is transcribed during the late stages from &#x02248;32 h post invasion peaking at the late schizont stages (44&#x02013;48 hrs).

SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>is also observed as amorphous material (MAM) around the merozoites, which could suggest that it plays a role in the merozoite invasion process. It is interesting to note that SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>partially co-localises with both SURFIN<sub>4.2 </sub>and EBA175 in the intact schizont but the proteins differentiate in the segmented schizonts.

This observation is in line with the IFA on air-dried monolayer results, which indicates that SURFIN<sub>4.1 </sub>remains within the PV and is not present in the pRBC cytoplasm or at the surface of IE. Immunofluorescence assay on live cells showed no reactivity with SURFIN<sub>4.1</sub>-C1 serum.
