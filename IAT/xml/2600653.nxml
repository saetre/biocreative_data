Physiological signals regulate rapid, transient changes in PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. Mutations that lower PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> cause neurodegeneration in human patients and mice. The function of Vac14 in the regulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> was uncharacterized previously. Here, we predict that yeast and mammalian Vac14 are composed entirely of HEAT repeats and demonstrate that Vac14 exerts an effect as a scaffold for the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex by direct contact with the known regulators of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>: Fig4, Fab1, Vac7 and Atg18. We also report that the mouse mutant <italic>ingls</italic> (<underline>in</underline>fantile <underline>gl</underline>io<underline>s</underline>is) results from a missense mutation in Vac14 that prevents the association of Vac14 with Fab1, generating a partial complex. Analysis of <italic>ingls</italic> and two additional mutants provides insight into the organization of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex and indicates that Vac14 mediates three distinct mechanisms for the rapid interconversion of PI3P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, these studies show that the association of Fab1 with the complex is essential for viability in the mouse.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>pale tremor</italic></kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate</kwd><kwd>PIKfyve</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositide phosphate (PIP) lipids are transiently generated on the cytoplasmic face of selected intracellular membranes.

PIPs function through recruitment of specific effector proteins, which in turn regulate ion channels, membrane fission and fusion, and formation of membrane tubules. PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is synthesized by phosphorylation of PI3P. Both PI3P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> are generated in the endomembrane system, a heterogeneous system of membranes involved in traffic to and from the plasma membrane, the lysosome, and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>).

In mammalian cells, these proteins, also known as Fab1/PIKfyve/PIP5K3, Fig4/Sac3, and Vac14/ArPIKfyve, are located on early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ikonomov <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Rutherford <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Association of the three mammalian proteins in cultured cells has been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Sbrissa <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).

A null mutation of <italic>Fig4</italic> in the <italic>pale tremor</italic> mouse results in the formation of vacuoles in the cell bodies of neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system, with extensive degeneration of sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and juvenile lethality around the time of weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chow <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). A null mutation of <italic>Vac14</italic> results in perinatal lethality with extensive degeneration of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The level of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is reduced by approximately 50&#x00025; in cultured fibroblasts from both mutants. The increased sensitivity of neurons to mutations causing PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency could result from the high rate of membrane turnover required for maintenance of axonal and dendritic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Volpicelli-Daley and De Camilli, 2007</xref>).

Examination of the corresponding mutation in yeast <italic>vac14</italic>, combined with analysis of additional partially functional mutants of yeast <italic>vac14</italic> and <italic>fab1</italic>, led to the determination that Vac14 nucleates the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex. The mutants led to the identification of specific regions of the Vac14 protein required for interaction with proteins in the complex. We also demonstrate that two additional regulators of the Fab1 kinase, Vac7p and Atg18p, reside within the complex. We find that formation of the complex is essential for the osmotic-stress-induced activation of Fab1. Analysis of the new <italic>vac14</italic> and <italic>fab1</italic> mutants provides insights into the organization of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex and its crucial function in the mammalian nervous system.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotype of the ingls mouse</title><p>The spontaneous mutation <italic>ingls</italic> (infantile gliosis) arose on the DBA/2J strain background and has been maintained by 23 generations of backcrossing to strain C57BL/6J to generate the congenic line B6. <italic>ingls</italic>.

When lysates were fractionated on a 10&#x02013;50&#x00025; glycerol gradient, Fab1 was distributed in two peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>). The smaller peak, fraction 3, contained monomeric Fab1p (predicted molecular weight 257 kDa). The larger peak, fractions 6&#x02013;8, contained Fab1p in a complex that sediments more slowly than the 670 kDa molecular weight standard in fractions 4 and 5. Although the predicted molecular weights of Vac7p, Fig4p, and Vac14p are 128, 101, and 99 kDa, respectively, significant proportions of these proteins comigrated with the large Fab1p complex: Vac7p, in fractions 6 and 7; Fig4p, in fractions 6&#x02013;8; and Vac14p, in fractions 5&#x02013;8. That the peak fractions for Fab1p, Vac7p, Fig4p, and Vac14p overlap but are not identical may be explained by the presence of a mixture of partial and complete complexes. For example, the ternary complex of Fab1p, Vac14p, and Fig4p is found exclusively on the membrane of the vacuole, whereas Vac14p and Fig4p associate with each other in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Botelho <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Most of the Atg18p (55 kDa) behaved as a monomer (fractions 1 and 2), but some Atg18p comigrated with the complex (fractions 5&#x02013;7), suggesting that this small fraction is also part of the complex. Alternatively, the Atg18 in fraction 6 could be trailing from the earlier fractions. However, note that the intensity of fraction 6 is the same as fraction 5. Genetic evidence (below) strongly suggests that a portion of Atg18p is part of the Vac14p complex.

We find that both Vac7p and Atg18p exert an effect through direct contact with Vac14p. Our analysis strongly suggests that the organization of the complex produces dynamic, stimulus-induced changes in PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, by three distinct mechanisms. First, the activator Vac7p and the inhibitor Atg18p bind to overlapping sites, close to the site of Fab1p. This arrangement could facilitate the rapid activation and inactivation of the Fab1p lipid kinase during hyperosmotic stress in yeast. Second, Fab1p and Fig4p bind simultaneously to nonoverlapping sites on Vac14p, bring them into close proximity, so that the lipid kinase and phosphatase share access to the same pools of PI3P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Third, the close proximity of Fab1p and Fig4p is also consistent with our earlier postulate that Fig4p may function as a protein phosphatase to activate Fab1p by dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Duex <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vac14 contains multiple HEAT repeats</title><p>The partial loss of function of Vac14 in the <italic>ingls</italic> mouse prompted us to evaluate the molecular function of this uncharacterized protein.

Conversely, HEAT repeats 10&#x02013;21 of Vac14p were sufficient to bind Fig4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, Fab1p, Fig4p, and two additional Fab1p regulatory proteins all directly contact Vac14p and make a large complex that regulates both the synthesis and turnover of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The composition of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex facilitates dynamic regulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub></title><p>The <italic>fab1-2</italic> mutation disrupts the ability of Fab1p to interact with Vac14p and prevents coprecipitation of Fab1p with Fig4p. Negative two-hybrid test results (not shown) suggest that Fab1p and Fig4p do not interact directly. Fab1p binds to the N terminus and Fig4p binds to the C terminus of Vac14p. We propose that Vac14p assumes a conformation that brings Fab1p into close proximity to Fig4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). This physical proximity may explain our previous evidence that the lipid phosphatase Fig4p is an activator of the Fab1p kinase, possibly through dephosphorylation of the Fab1 protein. Importantly, the phosphatase activity of Fig4p is required for its regulatory function; an active site mutant that retains interaction with Vac14p is nonetheless defective in elevation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bonangelino <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Duex <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>). Fig4p may also contribute to Fab1p activation through stabilization of the regulatory complex.</p><p>In addition to both the lipid phosphatase and lipid kinase, the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex includes a second pair of proteins with opposing effects on PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels: a lipid kinase activator and inhibitor. The close association of each of these proteins in a complex may be key to the rapid modulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Duex <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>).</p><p>Identification of the components of the Vac14p complex provides new insights into the acute regulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. First, the Fab1p lipid kinase and Fig4p lipid phosphatase reside in the same complex and bind to opposite ends of Vac14p. A conformational change in Vac14p could simultaneously affect the activities of the kinase and phosphatase in opposite directions, amplifying the net effect on PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Second, the complex contains both an activator and an inhibitor of Fab1p, Vac7p, and Atg18p, respectively, which bind to the same region of Vac14p, and most likely bind close to Fab1p. Again, an altered conformation of Vac14p could result in opposite effects on binding of the two proteins, amplifying the effect of either one alone on Fab1p activity. Third, Fig4p has a dual function and is both a lipid phosphatase and an activator of the lipid kinase. The structure of the protein complex is most likely to facilitate the rapid flux in PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels that occurs in response to various biological stimuli.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required for neural function and pigmentation</title><p>Similar to the null mutations of mouse <italic>Fig4</italic> and <italic>Vac14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chow <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), the <italic>Vac14</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ingls</italic> mutation results in reduced intracellular levels of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, cytoplasmic vacuolization, neurodegeneration, and early lethality. As the <italic>Vac14</italic>-null mouse dies perinatally, defects in nervous system function were inferred solely from the histopathology of newborn mice. The <italic>ingls</italic> mouse lives up to 3 weeks, permitting direct observation of abnormal neurological function, pigmentation, and growth defects. The <italic>Vac14</italic>&#x02013;ingls mice develop a tremor and motor incoordination exemplified by ataxic gait and difficulty in righting. Although the steady-state levels of Vac14&#x02013;ingls protein are normal and interaction with Fig4 is retained, binding of Fab1 is abolished. The failure of the corresponding yeast mutant to activate Fab1 strongly suggests that failure of <italic>ingls</italic> Vac14&#x02013;L156R to activate mammalian Fab1 accounts for the low level of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in fibroblasts from the <italic>ingls</italic> mouse. The data suggest that dissociation of Fab1 from the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex is the molecular basis for neurodegeneration and lethality in the <italic>ingls</italic> mouse. Thus, the ability of Vac14 to nucleate the complete PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex is essential for normal neural function.</p><p>Differences between the <italic>Vac14</italic>&#x02013;ingls, <italic>Vac14</italic>-null and <italic>Fig4</italic>-null mice are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.

This rescue of sensory neurons may be explained by their greater capacity for synthesis of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, or by a higher abundance of downstream effector proteins. The <italic>Vac14&#x02013;ingls</italic> mutant exhibits astrocytosis with earlier onset and greater severity than the other mutants, which merits further investigation. Hydrocephalus is also more severe in the <italic>ingls</italic> mice, with huge distention of the ventricles. Differences in the abundance of interacting proteins may account for the cell-type-specific effects of these mutations. The mixed-strain backgrounds of the two null mutants may also contribute to phenotypic differences from the congenic C57BL/6J.ingls mice discussed here.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Defects of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulation and human disease</title><p>Mutations of human <italic>FIG4</italic> result in the peripheral neuropathy Charcot&#x02013;Marie&#x02013;Tooth type 4J, with features similar to those in the <italic>Fig4</italic>-null mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chow <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).

This work indicates that the activation of Fab1 by the Vac14 complex is conserved from yeast to mammals and is essential for nervous tissue function, pigmentation and viability. Vac14 nucleates assembly of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> core regulatory complex in yeast and serves as a scaffold for the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). Loss of interaction between Vac14 and Fab1 results in the lethal neurological disorder in <italic>ingls</italic> mice. Analysis of the <italic>ingls</italic> mutation enabled us to localize the Fab1-interaction domain of Vac14. In yeast, the <italic>vac14&#x02013;ingls</italic> mutation also disrupts interaction with Vac7p, a positive regulator of Fab1p, and Atg18p, a negative regulator. The mammalian homologue of Vac7p has not been identified, whereas four distinct homologues of Atg18p are present in the mammalian genome: WIPI 1&#x02013;4. Further work will be required to identify all components of the mammalian PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex and to determine the functions of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.
