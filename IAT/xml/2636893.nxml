FAH expression was restored in hybrid hepatocytes and, upon <italic>in vivo</italic> expansion, ameliorated the effects of FAH deficiency. Here, we show that fusion-derived polyploid hepatocytes can undergo ploidy reductions to generate daughter cells with one-half chromosomal content. Fusion hybrids are, by definition, at least tetraploid. We demonstrate reduction to diploid chromosome content by multiple methods. First, cytogenetic analysis of fusion-derived hepatocytes reveals a population of diploid cells. Secondly, we demonstrate marker segregation using &#x000df;-galactosidase and the Y-chromosome. Approximately 2&#x02013;5&#x00025; of fusion-derived FAH-positive nodules were negative for one or more markers, as expected during ploidy reduction. Next, using a reporter system in which &#x000df;-galactosidase is expressed exclusively in fusion-derived hepatocytes, we identify a subpopulation of diploid cells expressing &#x000df;-galactosidase and FAH. Finally, we track marker segregation specifically in fusion-derived hepatocytes with diploid DNA content. Hemizygous markers were lost by &#x02265;50&#x00025; of <italic>Fah</italic>-positive cells. Since fusion-derived hepatocytes are minimally tetraploid, the existence of diploid hepatocytes demonstrates that fusion-derived cells can undergo ploidy reduction. Moreover, the high degree of marker loss in diploid daughter cells suggests that chromosomes/markers are lost in a non-random fashion. Thus, we propose that ploidy reductions lead to the generation of genetically diverse daughter cells with about 50&#x00025; reduction in nuclear content. The generation of such daughter cells increases liver diversity, which may increase the likelihood of oncogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The liver comprises many different types of cells, including hepatocytes. Hepatocytes perform numerous physiological functions, such as detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. Hepatocytes have the ability to fuse with blood cells, generating hybrid hepatocytes that contain nuclei from both fusion partners. In cases of genetic liver disease, fusion between diseased hepatocytes and normal blood cells can result in the formation of hybrid hepatocytes that function normally. In this series of experiments, we show that fusion hepatocytes produce daughter cells with one-half the amount of DNA found in the parental fusion hepatocyte. Furthermore, we show that the daughter cells are genetically distinct from each other. The increase in genetic diversity within the liver could give rise to hepatocytes lacking proper growth control, potentially resulting in tumor formation and cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell divisions in mitosis are thought to always produce daughter cells with the same chromosome content as the parental cell.

This result was surprising since fusion-derived cells should be at least tetraploid. Thus, we hypothesized that fusion-derived hepatocytes could undergo ploidy reductions during regeneration, leading to genetic diversity among daughter cells.</p><p>The present study rigorously examines whether fusion-derived hepatocytes undergo ploidy reductions. First, cell fusion experiments show conclusively that fusion-derived polyploid hepatocytes generate daughter cells with one-half DNA content. Unexpectedly, a high degree of aneuploidy was seen among fusion-derived cells. Secondly, ploidy reduction events were associated with independent marker segregation. Hepatocytes derived by cell fusion were expected to retain markers from each cell participating in the fusion event. Indeed, analysis of liver sections from repopulated mice showed the majority of nodules harboring both donor and host markers. However, we also detected a low (but highly reproducible) percentage of FAH positive nodules lacking additional markers. Third, to exclude the possibility that diploid hepatocytes expressing donor markers arose from transdifferentiation of hematopoietic cells, we employed a Cre-loxP reporter system in which &#x000df;-galactosidase (&#x000df;-gal) was only expressed in hepatocytes generated though cell fusion. As expected, polyploid hepatocytes expressed &#x000df;-gal and FAH. Consistent with the cytogenetic results, hepatocytes with diploid DNA content also expressed &#x000df;-gal and FAH. Finally, we tested individual cells for donor and host markers. Single cell PCR analysis of diploid daughter cells revealed a heterogeneous population containing a combination of donor and host markers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that fusion-derived polyploid hepatocytes undergo ploidy reduction events, generating heterogeneous populations of lower ploidy daughter cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fusion-Derived Hepatocytes Generate Daughter Cells with One-Half DNA Content</title><p>Cell fusion produces hybrids with increased centrosome and chromosome numbers.

For example, fusion between a female diploid blood cell (40,XX) and male diploid hepatocyte (40,XY) results in a tetraploid fusion-derived hepatocyte (80,XXXY). A ploidy reduction event generates two types of daughter cells (40,XY and 40,XX) that can polyploidize, giving rise to tetraploid cells (80,XXYY and 80,XXXX, respectively). Because we could not distinguish between daughter cells that lost the Y-chromosome and host female hepatocytes, we focused exclusively on Y-chromosome positive metaphases. Fusion-derived tetraploid hepatocytes (&#x0223c;80,XXXY) were detected in 21&#x00025; of the metaphases analyzed. Approximately 14&#x00025; of Y-chromosome positive metaphases were nearly diploid (&#x0223c;40,XY), corresponding to daughter cells arising through ploidy reduction. Furthermore, 8&#x00025; of cells were &#x0223c;80,XXYY, which is the expected karyotype for polyploidized diploid cells.</p><p>In addition to finding fusion-derived hepatocytes arising from diploid-diploid cell fusion, we detected cells generated by fusion between male tetraploid hepatocytes (80,XXYY) and female diploid blood cells (40,XX). Hexaploid cells (120,XXXXYY) were detected in 17&#x00025; of the metaphases. Furthermore, triploid cells (either &#x0223c;60,XYY or XXY), which are the predicted daughter cells of hexaploid reduction events, were identified in 17&#x00025; of metaphases. Together, these data strongly support the emergence of daughter cells containing one-half DNA content from fusion-derived hepatocytes. Similar to normal diploid hepatocytes, diploid daughter cells either remain diploid or polyploidize to generate tetraploid hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Marker Segregation in Fusion-Derived Hepatocytes</title><p>After demonstrating that fusion-derived hepatocytes could generate daughter cells with one-half chromosome content, we hypothesized that ploidy reduction events should also lead to marker segregation among daughter cells.

Initially, serial transplantation experiments were performed. Cytogenetic analysis showed that 14&#x00025; of fusion-derived hepatocytes were nearly diploid. Surprisingly, fusion-derived hepatocytes were highly aneuploid. While most regenerating nodules expressed all markers of cell fusion, a fraction of FAH positive nodules (2&#x02013;5&#x00025;) were Y-chromosome negative or &#x000df;-gal negative. This frequency suggests that 4&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the nodules were initiated by cells that had undergone ploidy reduction events. Next, we utilized a &#x000df;-gal reporter system to track fusion products in discrete ploidy populations. Polyploid hepatocytes expressed FAH (indicating that fusion-derived cells were reprogrammed to express donor genes) and &#x000df;-gal (demonstrating that these cells were derived by cell fusion). Significantly, diploid hepatocytes also expressed &#x000df;-gal and FAH, establishing that these cells originated from polyploid fusion-derived hepatocytes. Finally, we carefully tracked donor/host markers in hepatocytes that had undergone ploidy reductions by single cell genotyping. The majority of diploid daughter hepatocytes (87&#x00025;) were negative for one or more markers, giving rise to a heterogeneous population of cells. These results suggest that markers/chromosomes segregate independently during ploidy reduction events.</p><p>Hepatocyte polyploidization has been documented in many species (reviewed by Gupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Gupta1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>), but ploidy reversal has not been rigorously characterized. Our experiments provide proof-of-concept that ploidy reversal does occur in fusion-derived hepatocytes. Several reports also suggest that normal hepatocytes may undergo ploidy reduction. For instance, treatment of rodents with hepatotoxins thioacetamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-DiezFernandez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and carbon tetrachloride <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Steele1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> led to a dramatic increase in diploid hepatocytes and concomitant decrease in polyploid hepatocytes over 72 hr.

Thus, it is possible that normal polyploid hepatocytes undergo ploidy reductions, but this hypothesis remains to be tested.</p><p>The high degree of aneuploidy displayed by fusion-derived hepatocytes is surprising.

Whether binucleated hepatocytes could resume cytokinesis is unclear, but it remains a possibility. In the context of fusion-derived hepatocytes, the completion of cytokinesis would generate two mononucleated diploid daughter cells, each with the same genotype as the original fusion partners. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, subsets of diploid hepatocytes contained a donor marker (<italic>Fah</italic>) and a recipient marker (Cre and/or Y-chromosome), proving that these cells were genetically distinct from the original fusion partners.

Fusion-derived hepatocytes have increased numbers of centrosomes, which could result in the formation of multiple spindle poles during prophase. Thus, multipolar mitotic events could enrich for daughter cells with diploid chromosome content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, multipolar mitosis cannot adequately explain the clustering of fusion-derived hepatocytes with atypical chromosome counts. For example, triploid hepatocytes with &#x0223c;60 chromosomes (XXY or XYY) comprised 17&#x00025; of the metaphases analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These daughter cells likely originated from hexaploid fusion-derived hepatocytes. It is difficult to imagine how multipolar mitosis would enrich for cells with such abnormal chromosome counts. Furthermore, if ploidy reduction were achieved by multipolar mitosis, then each chromosome should be lost with the same low frequency (i.e., 1/19 for autosomes). Single cell genotyping of diploid daughter hepatocytes showed loss of R26R (located on chromosome 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Zambrowicz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>) and the Y-chromosome at 50&#x00025; or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This high degree of marker segregation strongly suggests that chromosome/marker loss occurs in a non-random fashion.</p><p>Another possibility to explain the emergence of daughter hepatocytes with one-half DNA content is cell division without DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This type of ploidy reduction was first described in the mosquito <italic>Culex pipiens</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Berger1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Grell1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> but has never been described in mammalian cells. In this model, fusion-derived hepatocytes could proceed through G1 phase of the cell cycle, skip S-phase and progress to G2/mitosis. Pairing between homologous chromosomes would ensure proper chromosome segregation. This type of mechanism accounts for the generation of diploid daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g003">3E and 3F</xref>) as well as enrichment for atypical triploid daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, the high degree of marker loss seen in diploid daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) is possible through a chromosome pairing interaction. Rigorous testing of all potential mechanisms must be performed to elucidate the cellular processes governing ploidy reductions in fusion-derived hepatocytes.</p><p>Finally, direct transmission of DNA via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) into diploid hepatocytes must be considered. HGT among somatic cells involves phagocytosis of apoptotic cells followed by nuclear uptake/integration of whole chromosomes or chromosome fragments by the engulfing cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Bergsmedh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Holmgren1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. HGT was hypothesized to induce hepatocyte reprogramming in xenotransplantation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Brulport1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In our studies, diploid host hepatocytes could acquire genes from apoptotic donor blood cells, resulting in hepatocyte reprogramming while maintaining a nearly diploid chromosome count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, the presence of multiple donor markers on different chromosomes by HGT is expected to be rare, and we found that nearly half of diploid fusion-derived hepatocytes harbored at least two donor markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000385-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, our data strongly argue against an HGT-type of mechanism.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, ploidy reduction events have significant implications. In the context of fusion-derived hepatocytes, ploidy reductions can be a confounding factor when tracing markers during stem cell transplantation. Donor markers can be lost during ploidy reductions, thus leading to an underestimate of engraftment. Similarly, host markers can be lost from hybrids, obscuring the existence of fusion and giving the false impression of transdifferentiation. Because cell fusion between transplanted cell types and target organs has been described in many experimental systems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Wagers1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>), the possibility of ploidy reductions needs to be considered when interpreting cell transplantation experiments. Furthermore, we propose that ploidy reduction events may contribute to tumorigenesis. The independent segregation of chromosomes from polyploid cells results in genetically heterogeneous diploid daughter hepatocytes. Individual daughter cells could lose tumor suppressors, generating a subset of hepatocytes with oncogenic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oregon Health and Science University approved all mouse experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mice</title><p>The following inbred mouse strains were used: wild-type (C57Bl and 129), transgenic ROSA26 (C57Bl and 129) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Friedrich1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Fah<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (C57Bl and 129) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Grompe2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, transgenic R26R-<italic>lacZ</italic> C57Bl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Soriano1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, transgenic Albumin-Cre C57Bl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Postic2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cell Isolation and Sorting</title><p>KLS cells were sorted from mouse bone marrow, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000385-Domen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
