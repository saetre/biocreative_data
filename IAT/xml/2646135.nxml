However, excess of glucose has been associated with several diseases, including diabetes and the less understood process of aging. On the contrary, limiting glucose (i.e., calorie restriction) slows aging and age-related diseases in most species. Understanding the mechanism by which glucose limits life span is therefore important for any attempt to control aging and age-related diseases. Here, we use the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> as a model to study the regulation of chronological life span by glucose. Growth of <italic>S. pombe</italic> at a reduced concentration of glucose increased life span and oxidative stress resistance as reported before for many other organisms. Surprisingly, loss of the Git3 glucose receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, also increased life span in conditions where glucose consumption was not affected. These results suggest a role for glucose-signaling pathways in life span regulation. In agreement, constitutive activation of the G&#x003b1; subunit acting downstream of Git3 accelerated aging in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and inhibited the effects of calorie restriction. A similar pro-aging effect of glucose was documented in mutants of hexokinase, which cannot metabolize glucose and, therefore, are exposed to constitutive glucose signaling. The pro-aging effect of glucose signaling on life span correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in oxidative stress resistance and respiration rate. Likewise, the anti-aging effect of both calorie restriction and the <italic>&#x00394;git3</italic> mutation was accompanied by increased respiration and lower reactive oxygen species production. Altogether, our data suggest an important role for glucose signaling through the Git3/PKA pathway to regulate <italic>S. pombe</italic> life span.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lowering caloric intake by limiting glucose (the preferred carbon and energy source) increases life span in various species. Excess glucose can have deleterious effects, but it is not clear whether this is due to the caloric contribution of glucose or to some other effect. Glucose sensed by the cells activates signaling pathways that, in yeast, favor the metabolic machinery that makes energy (glycolysis) and cell growth. The sensing of glucose also reduces stress resistance and the ability to live long. Does glucose provoke a pro-aging effect as a result of its metabolic activity or by activating signaling pathways? Here we addressed this question by studying the role of a glucose-signaling pathway in the life span of the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Genetic inactivation of the glucose-signaling pathway prolonged life span in this yeast, while its constitutive activation shortened it and blocked the longevity effects of calorie restriction. The pro-aging effects of glucose signaling correlated with a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and an increase in reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, a strain without glucose metabolism is still sensitive to detrimental effects of glucose due to signaling. Our work shows that glucose signaling through the glucose receptor <italic>GIT3</italic> constitutes the main cause responsible for the pro-aging effects of glucose in fission yeast.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucose is the major carbon source entering the metabolic pathways.

Mutations blocking the action of genes controlling nutrient- signaling pathways increase replicative life span (RLS), defined as the number of times a mother yeast cell produces a daughter cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Jiang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-ReverterBranchat1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, genetic deletion of PKA signaling via Gpr1 or Gpa2 genes resulted in the extension of RLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Kaeberlein2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, nutrient-signaling shortens chronological life span (CLS), the time a yeast population remains viable in stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Fabrizio1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Wei1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In other words, nutrient-signaling pathways have a pro-aging effect in budding yeast. So far, mutations found to increase life span in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> map to genes that respond to multiple nutrients, such as the PKA, Sch9 and Tor pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Dilova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Glucose is the major source of calories for yeast. Experimentally, calorie restriction (CR) is achieved by reducing the concentration of glucose in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cultures. Under these conditions, yeast cells exhibit an increase in both their replicative life span, and their CLS. It is therefore possible that nutrients, and more particularly the glucose-signaling pathway, are major regulators of the effects of calorie restriction on aging.</p><p>In yeast, the connection between nutrient sensing and mitochondrial activity has been depicted in different contexts. This regulation of mitochondria allows yeast to adapt its energy metabolism to the available nutrients, and is crucial for the control of longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Dilova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Several genetic studies demonstrate that forcing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to use respiration instead of fermentation induces a gain in both chronological and replicative life span <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Lin2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Piper1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. To summarize, the activity of nutrient-signaling pathways seem to promote aging by inhibiting both stress resistance and respiration. However, the predominance and the interdependence of each of these two functions, metabolic changes and signaling in the control of longevity are still nebulous.</p><p>Our laboratory introduced <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> as a model organism for the study of chronological aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Roux1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The use of this particular yeast is justified by the differences existing with budding yeast in traits that can potentially affect longevity. Both have been referred as Crabtree-positive yeast because of their capability to repress mitochondrial respiration in favour of glycolysis when glucose is abundantly available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-VanUrk1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless in fission yeast, the Crabtree effect is less pronounced than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> since the inhibition of oxygen consumption by glucose is smaller; in other words <italic>S. pombe</italic> maintains a higher respiration rate in the presence of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-VanUrk1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, it is hard to isolate respiratory-deficient cells (<italic>petite</italic>) in <italic>S. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Chu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Shfer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, while these mutants occur spontaneously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>S. pombe</italic> differs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> because of its lack of glyoxylate cycle that makes it inefficient in ethanol consumption as carbon source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-deJongGubbels1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Zuin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, fission yeast is also distinguishable in its mitochondrial inheritance which is mediated by microtubules like in higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Chiron1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we wished to determine whether glucose metabolism or extracellular glucose signaling is responsible for the regulation of life span. We found that environmental glucose decreases CLS in <italic>S. pombe</italic> in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect is mimicked in cells lacking the glucose receptor Git3p, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which signals the presence of glucose in the medium through a cAMP/PKA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Welton1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, the constitutive activation of the G&#x003b1; subunit of the G protein-coupled to the glucose receptor significantly decreases CLS. Deletion in the Git3/PKA signaling is characterized by higher oxidative stress defense, respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential; the same features observed in CR. Interestingly, CR has no effect either on stress defense or longevity in the strain constitutively activated for Git3/PKA (by mutational activation of the G&#x003b1; subunit), although it still enhances respiration. Knockout of <italic>S. pombe</italic> hexokinase genes (<italic>hxk1</italic> and <italic>hxk2</italic>), which are required to channel extracellular glucose into glycolysis, does not extend CLS in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. On the contrary, these mutant yeast strains accumulated glucose in the medium, exhibited increased glucose signaling and accelerated aging. Reduction of extracellular glucose or mutation of the glucose receptor Git3p rescued their aging phenotype. Altogether, our data suggest that glucose signaling constitutes the main pathway in the pro-aging effect of glucose in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Growth on Glucose Decreases Chronological Life Span in Fission Yeast</title><p>To study the effects of glucose concentration on CLS, wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells were cultured in rich medium with different concentrations of glucose.

High glucose concentration, acting through the Git3/PKA pathway, promotes aging and decreases stress defense and respiration.

The loss of Git3p GPCR blocks the detrimental effects of glucose in double hexokinase mutant. This suggests that glucose exerts a strong pro-aging effect via the Git3/PKA signaling pathway. Notably, the premature death of double hexokinase mutant due to high glucose is concomitant with an accumulation of ROS.</p><p>It is remarkable that the effect of deleting hexokinases differs between <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

Conversely, we could not discard the possibility that some pro-aging effects of glucose are mediated by the non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins by glucose. Nevertheless, altogether our data point toward a regulation of longevity primarily via the glucose signaling through Git3/PKA pathway, raising the question about the underlying mechanisms. Although further work is required to discover the mechanisms by which glucose signaling accelerates aging in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, our current evidence points to the mitochondria as the target of glucose signals. First, CR (low glucose) in wild type yeast enhances respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential, prevents ROS production and improves oxidative stress defense. Second, <italic>&#x00394;git3</italic> cells have a similar phenotype and, in addition this strain displays a higher expression of cytosolic superoxide dismutase in stationary phase.

This pathway signals the presence of glucose, the preferred energy source. It also controls stress resistance, growth rate and sexual development, modifies mitochondrial metabolism, and ultimately controls life span as we have shown in this study. Similar to our observations for the Git3/PKA pathway in fission yeast, a decrease in the insulin/IGF-1 signal increases longevity as a function of CR in mammals. The extent to which dietary restriction may actually be effective in humans is still unknown. Our results also show that CR and loss of the Git3p GPCR cooperate to increase life span. This suggests that if this pathway is conserved in higher organisms, its inhibition may lead to an anti-aging treatment not relying on strict diets with a limited caloric content as used in animal research. Interestingly, inhibition of cAMP synthesis by the knockout of the type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) gene induced Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent stress resistance and lengthened life span in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000408-Yan1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since CR and inhibition of glucose signaling cooperate to extend life span in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, it would be interesting to combine agents that reduce cAMP synthesis or reduce PKA activity with CR in mammals.</p><p>In conclusion, our work with <italic>S. pombe</italic> highlights the importance of glucose-signaling pathways and oxidative stress resistance in aging. Given the importance of glucose as a central metabolite, it is surprising that the pathway for glucose sensing existing in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has not been found yet in mammals.

Cells were cultured in YEC to a given OD, and then the culture was diluted in its own medium if OD<sub>595</sub> was greater than 1.5, or concentrated in its own medium by centrifugation if OD<sub>595</sub> was less than 0.8. The goal was to measure the respiration of cultures with similar concentrations and in the exact medium in which the samples were taken. 10 mL of culture, sometimes diluted or concentrated, was incubated with gentle agitation at 30&#x000b0;C and 5 mL was loaded in the measurement chamber at 30&#x000b0;C with agitation. The oxygen consumption was followed with a Clark electrode YSI model 53 oxygen monitor until all oxygen was consumed in the chamber. The calibration of the Clark electrode for the maximum oxygen concentration (100&#x00025;) was done on the air. The consumption was linear, the measure was recorded with a tracer Linear1100 and the slope was calculated for each sample.
