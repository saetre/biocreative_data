Protein serine/threonine phosphatases-1 (PP-1) and 2A (PP-2A) account for 90% of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in eukaryote cells and play distinct roles in regulating multiple cellular processes and activities. Our previous studies have established the expression patterns of the catalytic subunits for PP-1 (PP-1cs) and PP-2A (PP-2Acs) in bovine and rat lenses. In the present study, we have determined the expression patterns of PP-1cs (PP-1&#x003b1; and PP-1&#x003b2;) and PP-2Acs (PP-2A&#x003b1; and PP-2A&#x003b2;) in the retina and cornea along with the ocular lens of the mouse eye. Moreover, since the function of PP-2A is largely relied on its regulatory subunits, we have also analyzed the expression patterns of the genes encoding the scaffold A subunits of PP-2A, PP2A-A&#x003b1; and PP2A-A&#x003b2;, and the regulatory B family subunits of PP-2A, PP2A-B&#x003b1;, PP2A-B&#x003b2;, and PP2A-B&#x003b3;.

Stable clones of &#x003b1;TN4&#x02013;1 cells expressing either PP-1&#x003b1; or PP-2A&#x003b1; were used to analyze the differential protections against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PP-1 is more abundant than PP-2A in the mouse eye.

Phosphoproteome studies have revealed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modulate functions of more than one third of the total cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can regulate many different biologic processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression, differentiation, transformation, apoptosis, neuronal transmission, and many other cellular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>In eukaryotes, dephosphorylation at serine/threonine residues are executed by four major protein phosphatases, phosphatase-1 (PP-1), phosphatase-2A (PP-2A), phosphatase-2B (PP-2B), and phosphatase-2C (PP-2C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and several minor phosphatases including phosphatase-4 (PP-4), phosphatase-5 (PP-5), phosphatase-6 (PP-6), and phosphatase-7 (PP-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Among these different serine/threonine phosphatases, PP-1 and PP-2A accounts for 90% of the intracellular protein serine/threonine phosphatase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although more than 90 PP-1 interacting proteins or targeting proteins have been identified or predicted, the functional enzyme of PP-1 exists as a single catalytic subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, the holoenzyme of PP-2A is a heterotrimer, which consists of a scaffold A subunit tethering a catalytic C subunit, and a regulatory B subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Both A and C subunits exist in &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms encoded by different genes. However, for the B subunit, at least 16 genes have been identified encoding four subfamilies of the regulatory subunits (B, B&#x02019;, B,&#x0201d; and B&#x02019;&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. The B family of regulatory subunits contains several different isoforms including &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Both PP-1 and PP-2A play important roles in the eye. For example, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) acts as a tumor suppressor and is also important for eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Conditional inactivation of Rb through the overexpression of viral gene E7 in the ocular lens leads to microphthalmia and cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. PP-1 directly dephosphorylates Rb to modulate its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. During eye development, one of the B family regulatory subunits of PP-2A was found participating in both IGF/PI3K/Akt and hedgehog signaling pathways to regulate the separation of the eye field and the early induction of eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. PP-2A was also found to participate in the signaling cross-talk of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that PP-1 is a predominant phosphatase in the ocular lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The inhibition of PP-1 but not PP-2A by okadaic acid induces apoptosis of the treated rabbit and rat lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. In exploring the possible molecular mechanism by which PP-1 promotes survival of lens epithelial cells, we have recently demonstrated that PP-1 can directly dephosphorylate p53, a tumor repressor and a master regulator of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] whose inactivation causes lens cataractogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Through dephosphorylation of p53 at serine residue 15 and 37, PP-1 downregulates the transcriptional and apoptotic activities of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. More recently, we have demonstrated that PP-1 is a major phosphatase that dephosphorylates Pax&#x02212;6 to modulate its function in regulating brain and eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].</p><p>To further study protein phosphatase&#x02013;1 and protein phosphatase&#x02013;2A in the eye, we have compared the differential expression patterns of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits for PP-1 and PP-2A in the retina, lens epithelium, lens fiber cells, and cornea of the mouse eye. Furthermore, we have analyzed the expression patterns of five different isoforms of PP-2A regulatory subunits, PP2A-A&#x003b1;, PP2A-A&#x003b2;, PP2A-B&#x003b1;, PP2A-B&#x003b2;, and PP2A-B&#x003b3; in the above four tissues. Our results demonstrate that PP-1 is a more abundant phosphatase than PP-2A in all four tissues of the mouse eye. Both PP-1 and PP-2A may play important roles in the mouse eye, and the functions of PP-2A appear to be highly regulated in the mouse retina and cornea. The genes encoding PP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, PP-2A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, and PP2A-B&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; are all differentially expressed in the four different tissues of the mouse eye to ensure their proper functions. In addition, when introduced into lens epithelial cells, &#x003b1;TN4&#x02013;1, PP-1 and PP-2A protect lens epithelial cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Mice used in this study were handled in compliance with the &#x0201c;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x0201d; (National Academy Press, Washington, DC).

The mRNAs for three isoforms, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;, of PP2A-B subunits in the retina also displayed the highest levels of expression among the four different ocular tissues of mouse eye (Panels 3&#x02013;5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In the cornea, while PP2A-B&#x003b1; and PP2A-B&#x003b3; mRNAs were strongly expressed, PP2A-B&#x003b2; mRNA was just barely detectable (Panels 3&#x02013;5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In the ocular lens, only PP-2A-B&#x003b3; mRNA was prominently detected (Panel 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Both PP2A-B&#x003b1; and PP2A-B&#x003b2; were barely detectable in the lens fiber cells and the lens epithelium (Panels 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Real-time PCR analysis of the mRNAs for PP2A-A&#x003b1;, PP2A-A&#x003b2;, PP2A-B&#x003b1;, PP2A-B&#x003b2;, and PP2A-B&#x003b3; confirmed the general expression patterns of the five mRNAs revealed by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, it was found that in the mouse retina, the mRNA level for PP-2A&#x003b2; was approximately 0.62 fold more than that for PP-2A&#x003b1;.

In all four ocular tissues examined, the catalytic subunits for PP-1 (PP-1cs) are predominantly expressed at both mRNA and protein levels over the catalytic subunits for PP-2A (PP-2Acs). Among the four tissues, the mRNAs for the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits of PP-1 and PP-2A displayed the highest levels of expression in the retina and slightly reduced levels in the cornea but much reduced levels in the ocular lens of the mouse eye. The proteins for the catalytic subunits of PP-1 and PP-2A were strongly expressed in both the retina and cornea but substantially reduced in the lens epithelium and barely detectable (PP-2Acs) or absent (PP1cs) in lens fiber cells of the mouse eye. The mRNAs for five isoforms (PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and PP2A-B&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;) of PP2A-A and PP2A-B subunits are highly expressed in the mouse retina, but three out of the 5 mRNAs are reduced and the remaining two barely detectable in mouse cornea. In the ocular lens of the mouse eye, only the mRNAs for PP2A-A&#x003b2; and PP2A-B&#x003b3; are clearly detectable in both the epithelial and fiber cells. The proteins for both A and B subunits are highly expressed in the retina and cornea but are much less abundant in the ocular lens. Moreover, the lens fiber cells have slightly higher levels of PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; proteins than the lens epithelial cells. The strongest fluorescence signals for PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and PP2A-B&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; proteins were detected in the mouse cornea, and somewhat reduced signals were detected in the retina and ocular lens. Also, P2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; but not PP2A-B&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; is differentially distributed in the mouse retina. Finally, both PP-1&#x003b1; and PP-2A&#x003b1; are able to protect mouse lens epithelial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. PP-1&#x003b1; displayed stronger anti-apoptotic ability than PP-2A&#x003b1; did. These results demonstrate that both PP-1 and PP-2A may play important roles in four different tissues of the mouse eye and that the function of PP-2A seems to be highly regulated in these ocular tissues. Indeed, various functions of the protein serine/threonine phosphatases in the eye has recently begun to be unfolded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>First, the protein serine/threonine phosphatases are involved in regulation of eye development. For example, during drosophila eye development, the catalytic subunit of PP-2A is found to be implicated in the regulation of the R7 photoreceptor specification through both positive and negative regulation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Wassarman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] have demonstrated that a reduction in the dose of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit for PP-2A stimulates the signal from Ras1 but impairs the signal from Raf.</p><p>Regulation of eye development by protein phosphatases is also observed in the vertebrate. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, PP-2A is involved in the regulation of eye induction and subsequently eye field separation. Rorick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] have shown that one of the B family subunits for PP-2A is required for the IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway and that interfering with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibits eye induction. Furthermore, during eye field separation, this subunit is also implicated in regulating the hedgehog-signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>PP-1 and PP-2A protect lens epithelial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. <bold>A</bold>: western blot analysis confirms the overexpression of PP-1&#x003b1; (a) and PP2A&#x003b1; (b) in &#x003b1;TN4&#x02013;1 cells.

Edwards et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] have reported that in the horseshoe crab, inhibition of PP-1 and PP-2A activity by okadaic acid interferes with physiologic functions of the photoreceptor cells. In the ocular lens, &#x003b1;-crystallins are important lens proteins, which act as molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], anti-apoptotic regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and autokinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Previous studies from several laboratories have revealed that &#x003b1;-crystallins are phosphorylated by different serine/threonine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] and dephosphorylated by serine/threonine phosphatases including PP-2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>] and other unknown phosphatases. A change of the phosphorylation status is closely linked to its functional ability. Hoover et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>] have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 59 in &#x003b1;B-crystallin is critical for its cellular protection.</p><p>Finally, changes in the protein serine/threonine phosphatase expression or activity are implicated in the pathogenesis of the vertebrate and human eyes. In this regard, Palczewski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>] have observed that rd mice have elevated PP-2A activity from postnatal day 5 to day 10. The loss of photoreceptors in rd mice begins on postnatal day 11. It is suggested that the elevated PP-2A activity may be implicated in photoreceptor death. In the murine model of glaucoma, Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>] found that activation of PP-2B by increased intraocular pressure leads to apoptotic retinal ganglion cell death. Kantorow et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>] observed that the mRNA for the regulatory subunit of PP-2A is downregulated in the epithelial cells of the human cataractous lenses, suggesting possible roles of PP-2A activity in maintaining normal lens transparency. Consistent with this early observation, we demonstrate here that both PP2A-A&#x003b2; and PP2A-B&#x003b3; are expressed at higher levels in the fiber cells than in the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of the PP-1 activity by okadaic acid leads to upregulated expressions of the pro-apoptotic genes, which leads to eventual apoptosis of the treated lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Consistent with these early observations, we showed here that both PP-1 and PP-2A are able to protect mouse lens epithelial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8B</xref>). The mechanisms mediating this protection include the attenuation of p53 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15 as well as some other residues by PP-1 and PP-2A and also the attenuation of Bak upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8D</xref>). Our recent studies have shown that both PP-1 and PP-2A are able to directly dephosphorylate p53 at these residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Stress-induced apoptosis of lens epithelial cells play an important role for non-congenital cataractogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that the genes encoding both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits for PP-1 and PP-2A are highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in both the retina and cornea but are reduced in the ocular lens of the mouse eye. Such expression patterns likely reflect the difference of the functional requirements for these phosphatases by different eye tissues. In the retina, light-activated signaling pathways mediate rapid protein translocation within photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The constant transmission of the light-induced signals into the brain may need high levels of protein serine/threonine phosphatases to reverse the kinase action. The demonstration that the inhibition of PP-1 and PP-2A activity by okadaic acid blocks photoreceptor response in horseshoe crab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] provides evidence to support this possibility. In the cornea, the epithelial cells are constantly renewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Since both PP-1 and PP-2A are involved in the control of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], it is not surprising that highly renewal tissues such as the cornea have strong expression of both PP1 and PP-2A. In the ocular lens, on the other hand, cell division is relatively slow in the mature lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. Although the lens epithelial cells at the equatorial region are constantly differentiating into new fiber cells, this process is significantly slowed in the mature lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprise that the expression levels of PP-1 and PP-2A are substantially reduced in the ocular lens than in the retina and cornea of the mouse eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The holoenzyme of PP-2A consists of three different subunits, the regulatory A subunit, the catalytic C subunit, and the regulatory B subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. The A subunit serves as a scaffold to tether both C and B subunits. The B subunit is assembled into the A-C dimer of PP-2A after methylation of the C subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], and the presence of strong expressions from all three B subunits (PP2A-B&#x003b1;, PP2A-B&#x003b2;, and PP2A-B&#x003b3;) of PP-2A in the mouse retina suggests that PP-2A have multiple functions in this ocular tissue and such functions seem to be highly regulated. The relatively higher level of the PP2A-A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; protein distribution in the pigment layer than in the neuro-retina layer of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>) suggests that the PP-2A function in the pigment layer may be even more important. In the mouse cornea, the two types of PP-2A regulatory subunits are also strongly expressed. However, different from the expression patterns of the PP-2A regulatory subunits in the mouse retina, both PP2A-A&#x003b1; and PP2A-B&#x003b2; are much reduced.</p><p>Such results indicate that the functions of the scaffold PP2A-A&#x003b1; and PP2A-A&#x003b2; subunits may be different, and such differential expression patterns of the PP2A-A&#x003b1; and PP2A-A&#x003b2; subunits in the retina and cornea of the mouse eye may parallel the differential expression of the regulatory B subunits. In other words, certain members of the B regulatory subunits may have preferential affinity to PP2A-A&#x003b1; than to PP2A-A&#x003b2;. This would also explain why in the ocular lens, both PP2A-A&#x003b1; and PP2A-B&#x003b2; are also barely detectable or absent. Of course, different from both the retina and cornea, the ocular lens only expresses PP2A-A&#x003b2; and PP2A-B&#x003b3;, suggesting PP-2A function in the ocular lens may be less demanding. This would be consistent with our previous observation where the inhibition of PP-1 but not PP-2A caused apoptosis of lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, both RT&#x02013;PCR and real-time PCR were used to determine the expression patterns of mRNA for genes encoding both catalytic subunits for PP-1 and PP-2A and also the regulatory subunits for PP-2A. While RT&#x02013;PCR gave a direct observation of the amplified gene expression product, the real-time PCR presented a quantitative measurement. Our studies of the different mRNA levels with both methods demonstrated consistent results in majority of the samples of all four tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Only a minor discrepancy was observed for the mRNA levels in the lens epithelium and lens fiber cells where expressions of the different mRNAs were lower than those in the retina and cornea. Such minor difference may be actually derived from the variations of the mRNA levels in different animals since the samples used for RT&#x02013;PCR and real-time PCR were extracted from different groups of mice with the same age. Our results reveal that the expression levels of mRNAs for both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits of PP-2A are relatively lower than that of PP-1 in all for ocular tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Such a difference is even more striking at the protein levels. In the retina, cornea, and lens epithelium of the mouse eye, the protein level of PP-1cs is twofold to threefold higher than that of PP2Acs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that PP-1 is a more abundant protein serine/threonine phosphatase than PP-2A in the mouse eye. This result is consistent with our previous study where in both the rat and bovine lenses, we observed that PP-1cs is more abundant than PP-2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although the two mRNAs for the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits of PP-1cs are only slightly higher than that of PP-2Acs, the proteins for &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; catalytic subunits of PP-1 are about twofold to fourfold higher than the corresponding catalytic subunits of PP-2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that the PP-2A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; mRNAs are either restricted during translation or PP-2A&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; proteins are less stable. We are currently investigating the two possibilities. Regardless, such results clearly show that both PP-1cs and PP-2c are differentially expressed in the four ocular tissues of mouse eye.</p><p>In summary, our present studies provide important information regarding the expression patterns of the two most important protein serine/threonine phosphatases in different tissues of the mouse eye. Our results reveal that PP-1 is a more abundant phosphatase than PP-2A in the mouse eye and that the genes encoding both catalytic subunits for PP-1 and PP-2A and the regulatory subunits for PP-2A are all differentially expressed. These results provide a foundation for exploring the functions of PP-1 and PP-2A in the retina, cornea, and the ocular lens of the vertebrate eye. Furthermore, our results that a variety of regulatory subunits of PP-2A are all expressed in the retina and cornea of the mouse eye reveal that in these ocular tissues, PP-2A has highly regulated, important functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is supported in part by the NIH/NEI grant, 1R01EY015765; the UNMC start-up funds; the Lotus Scholar Professorship Funds from Hunan Province Government and Hunan Normal University; and the Changjiang Scholar Team Award from the National Education Ministry of China,</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protein kinases and phosphatases: the yin and yang of protein phosphorylation and signaling.</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>1995</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>225</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7834742</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name><name><surname>Blagoev</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Gnad</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Macek</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mortensen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2006</year><volume>127</volume><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17081983</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gallego</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Virshup</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protein serine/threonine phosphatases: life, death, and sleeping.</article-title><source>Curr Opin Cell Biol</source><year>2005</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>197</fpage><lpage>202</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15780597</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="book">Yan Q, Mao YW, Li DW.
