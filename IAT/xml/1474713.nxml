The majority of this radioactivity was associated with a soluble protein of less than 10,000 molecular weight. Synthesis of this cadmium-binding protein was induced by the metal as demonstrated by incorporation of radioactive cysteine. Most copper ingested by larvae was also found to associate with a low molecular weight, inducible protein, but some of it was found in an insoluble fraction. Zinc was unable to, or very inefficient at, binding or inducing the synthesis of a similar protein. A D. melanogaster cDNA clone was isolated based on its more intense hybridization to copies of RNA sequences from copper-fed larvae than from control larvae. This clone showed strong hybridization to mouse metallothionein-I cDNA at reduced stringency. Its nucleotide sequence includes an open-reading segment which codes for a 40-amino acid protein; this protein was identified as metallothionein based on its similarity to the amino-terminal portion of mammalian and crab metalloproteins. The ten cysteine residues present occur in five pairs of near-vicinal cysteines (Cys-X-Cys). This cDNA sequence hybridized to a 400-nucleotide polyadenylated RNA whose presence in the cells of the alimentary canal of larvae was stimulated by ingestion of cadmium or copper; in other tissues this RNA was present at much lower levels. Mercury, silver, and zinc induced metallothionein to a lesser extent. Whether (any of) the protein(s) discussed above correspond(s) to that coded by this RNA sequence has not yet been determined.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0105-a" xlink:role="109"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0108-a" xlink:role="112"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0109-a" xlink:role="113"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="107" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="108" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="109" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="110" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="111" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="112" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="113" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="114" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="115" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00436-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="116" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
