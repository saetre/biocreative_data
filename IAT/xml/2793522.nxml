After two weeks mice were sacrificed. Sera were collected before immunization and at sacrifice. To quantitate OVA specific IgG antibodies, 96 well plates were coated overnight with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml OVA, washed with PBS plus 0.05 Tween (Sigma) and blocked with PBS plus 10&#x00025; FBS. 100 &#x000b5;l serum samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature at the 1&#x02236;10000, 1&#x02236;20000, and 1&#x02236;50000 dilutions. Plates were washed three times, incubated with 100 &#x000b5;l of anti mouse IgG-HRP antibody (1&#x02236;5000 dilution) for 45 min at room temperature. Reaction was developed with the HRP substrate tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) (Becton-Dickinson). Results were expressed as optical densities at 405 nm.
