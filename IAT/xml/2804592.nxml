The DDIT3 protein has a central role in endoplasmatic reticulum stress and DNA damage response by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. DDIT3 has recently been implicated in the stress response leading to death of pancreatic insulin producing &#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and it may also be a part of cellular stress conditions causing neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

In pilot experiments, we used HT1080 cells stably expressing FUS-DDIT3-GFP and could weakly detect endogenous CDK2 in immunoprecipitates while cyclin E was not found (data not shown). To further confirm a possible interaction between FUS-DDIT3 and CDK2, we instead transiently transfected cells using cloned <italic>CDK2 </italic>cDNA expressed in frame with the fluorescent protein DsRed1. Cells co-transfected with <italic>CDK2</italic>-DsRed1 and either of <italic>FUS-DDIT3 </italic>or <italic>DDIT3 </italic>expressing constructs showed presence of CDK2-DsRed1 in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from both FUS-DDIT3 and DDIT3 transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). In contrast, CDK2-DsRed1 was not found in immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with the N-terminal part of FUS present in the FUS-DDIT3 protein or in GFP-transfected control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).

We found that endogenous CDK2 co-immunoprecipitated with DDIT3, FUS-DDIT3 and FUS-DDIT3 lacking a leucine zipper domain. These results indicate that the region binding CDK2 is located N-terminally of the leucine zipper part of DDIT3. ClustalW alignment performed between DDIT3 and the related C/EBP&#x003b1; showed conservation of several amino acids in distinct regions shared by the two proteins but that DDIT3 lacks a region similar to the one that binds CDK2 in C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Co-immunoprecipitation of DDIT3 and CDK2</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>HT1080 cells were co-transfected with the indicated GFP constructs and CDK2-DsRed1.

CDK2 and the CDK2 binding cyclin E were found to change their localization in FUS-DDIT3 expressing cells to a pattern that was identical to the FUS-DDIT3 nuclear granules reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This suggests that CDK2 and cyclin E are translocated to nuclear structures defined by the FUS-DDIT3 protein. As the DDIT3 part is considered a DNA-binding transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we speculate that the FUS-DDIT3 defined structures may contain active chromatin and mRNA at different stages of processing. Thus, the accumulation of CDK2 and cyclin E to such nuclear regions may result in changed phosphorylation patterns and regulation of substrates present at these foci.</p><p>DDIT3 is able to form DNA-binding heterodimers with C/EBP&#x003b1; through its leucine zipper region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and C/EBP&#x003b1; is reported to bind CDK2 and inhibit its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the binding between DDIT3 and CDK2 is mediated through C/EBP&#x003b1; or another C/EBP protein. However, we here show that a DDIT3 mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain binds CDK2, which implies a binding between DDIT3 and CDK2 that is independent of other C/EBP proteins. DDIT3 and C/EBP&#x003b1; contain several regions with sequence similarities but the proline-histidine rich part reported to bind CDK2 in C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>) is not present in DDIT3. This suggests that DDIT3 binds CDK2 through a different mechanism than C/EBP&#x003b1;.</p><p>Analyses of GFP-immunoprecipitates failed to detect cyclin E in these samples. The absence of cyclin E in CDK2 immunoprecipitates bears resemblance to previous reports showing that C/EBP&#x003b1; disrupts CDK2/cyclin complexes leading to growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that the DDIT3 bound to CDK2 disrupts CDK2/cyclin E complexes in similar way as C/EBP&#x003b1;. Consequently, since cyclin E is a major regulator of CDK2 kinase activity in G1, the DDIT3 binding may alter CDK2 activity in DDIT3 and FUS-DDIT3 expressing cells. We did however not detect a change in phosphorylation status of CDK2 in FUS-DDIT3 expressing cells compared to control cells. To further analyze the functional effects of DDIT3/FUS-DDIT3 binding to CDK2, we immunoprecipitated CDK2 in cells transiently transfected with <italic>FUS-DDIT3</italic>, <italic>DDIT3 </italic>and GFP constructs. Analysis of the precipitates revealed enhanced binding of CDK2 to components of the cytoskeleton in cells expressing FUS-DDIT3 and DDIT3. An increased affinity for cytoskeletal components and crosstalk between cell cycle proteins and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins could lead to changes in cytoskeleton structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we show that CDK2 is translocated to nuclear structures defined by the FUS-DDIT3 oncoprotein and that it binds the DDIT3 part of the chimera. Cyclin E is also recruited to FUS-DDIT3 nuclear structures but can not be found in CDK2-containing DDIT3/FUS-DDIT3 precipitates. The interaction of FUS-DDIT3 and DDIT3 with CDK2 appears to alter the binding affinity of CDK2, possibly leading to changed phosphorylation patterns and regulation of cytoskeletal or other proteins. Many of the observed biological effects of DDIT3 may involve the interaction with CDK2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
