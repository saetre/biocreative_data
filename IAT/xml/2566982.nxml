Amylopectin structure imparts the ability to form semi-crystalline starch granules, which in turn provides its glucose storage function. The enzymatic steps of amylopectin biosynthesis resemble those of the soluble polymer glycogen, however, the reasons for amylopectin's architectural distinctions are not clearly understood. The multiplicity of starch biosynthetic enzymes conserved in plants likely is involved. For example, amylopectin chain elongation in plants involves five conserved classes of starch synthase (SS), whereas glycogen biosynthesis typically requires only one class of glycogen synthase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Null mutations were characterized in <italic>AtSS2</italic>, which codes for SSII, and mutant lines were compared to lines lacking SSIII and to an <italic>Atss2</italic>, <italic>Atss3 </italic>double mutant. Loss of SSII did not affect growth rate or starch quantity, but caused increased amylose/amylopectin ratio, increased total amylose, and deficiency in amylopectin chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 12 to DP28. In contrast, loss of both SSII and SSIII caused slower plant growth and dramatically reduced starch content. Extreme deficiency in DP12 to DP28 chains occurred in the double mutant, far more severe than the summed changes in SSII- or SSIII-deficient plants lacking only one of the two enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SSII and SSIII have partially redundant functions in determination of amylopectin structure, and these roles cannot be substituted by any other conserved SS, specifically SSI, GBSSI, or SSIV. Even though SSIII is not required for the normal abundance of glucan chains of DP12 to DP18, the enzyme clearly is capable of functioning in production such chains. The role of SSIII in producing these chains cannot be detected simply by analysis of an individual mutation. Competition between different SSs for binding to substrate could in part explain the specific distribution of glucan chains within amylopectin.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Insoluble starch granules function as a central component of plant metabolism to store reduced carbon produced during photosynthesis. Starch is made up of two types of glucan homopolymer, amylose and amylopectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Amylose molecules typically comprise several thousand glucose units joined by &#x003b1;-(1&#x02192;4) glycoside bonds, with a low frequency of branch points provided by &#x003b1;-(1&#x02192;6) glycoside bonds. Amylopectin has a degree of polymerization (DP) on the order of 10<sup>4 </sup>&#x02013; 10<sup>5 </sup>glucose units per molecule, and contains a relatively high frequency of branch linkages, approximately 5%. A specific distribution of &#x003b1;-(1&#x02192;4)-linked glucan chain lengths, together with clustered positioning of &#x003b1;-(1&#x02192;6) branch linkages, provides structure to amylopectin that allows crystallization and formation of insoluble starch granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The ability to crystallize in turn provides the functionality of starch because very large numbers of glucose units can be stored as an energy source to be used later when photosynthesis is not operative. Thus, an important objective towards the aim of fully understanding plant physiology is to determine how each of the enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis functions to produce a polymer with a crystallization-competent architecture.</p><p>Starch is produced by the coordinated actions of the following enzymes: 1) ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase (ADPGPP), which provides the nucleotide sugar donor ADPGlc; 2) starch synthase (SS), which catalyzes the transfer of a glucosyl unit from ADPGlc to a growing polymer chain through an &#x003b1;-(1 &#x02192; 4) glycoside bond; 3) starch branching enzyme (SBE), which cleaves an internal &#x003b1;-(1 &#x02192; 4) linkage and transfers the released linear chain to a C-6 hydroxyl, thus forming a new &#x003b1;-(1 &#x02192; 6) branch point; 4) starch debranching enzyme (DBE), which selectively hydrolyzes &#x003b1;-(1 &#x02192; 6) linkages and has been proposed to provide an editing function in selection of branch points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Most organisms outside the plant kingdom possess a single class of glycogen synthase (GS), in some instances comprising two closely related isoforms, which catalyzes the same glycosyl transferase reaction as the plant SSs. In contrast, a highly conserved feature of starch biosynthesis in diverse plant species is the presence of five distinct classes of SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], again often with multiple isoforms in each class. Each SS class is found in unicellular green algae and thus likely was established prior to the evolution of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Such conservation suggests that each SS is functionally significant for synthesis of granular starch as opposed to water-soluble glycogen, presumably through its influence on the architectural structure of amylopectin. Some functions of SSs with regard to amylopectin architecture are relatively well understood, however, for the most part their functional relationships to each other remain to be determined.</p><p>One SS is nearly exclusively granule-bound (GBSS), whereas the other four classes are distributed between granules and stroma (SSI, SSII) or are located nearly entirely in the stroma (SSIII, SSIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Genetic evidence indicates that all five SSs have specific functions that cannot be provided by any other SS class. For example, elimination of GBSS by mutation or antisense gene expression conditions loss of the amylose component of starch granules without major effects on amylopectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, it appears that GBSS is specifically involved in amylose biosynthesis and that no other SS can provide this function. SSII deficiency in numerous species results in increased frequency of short glucan chains (DP6 to DP11) within amylopectin, decreased abundance of DP12 to DP25 chains, and in most instances an elevated amylose to amylopectin ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A possible explanation for these results is that SSII catalyzes formation of chains of DP12 &#x02013; DP25, and that the other SS isoforms cannot fulfil this function. The uniformity of the SSII-mutant phenotype also indicates that the physiological function of SSII is conserved across plant species, in addition to the paralogous amino acid sequences.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis </italic>is useful as a model organism for study of SS function, as well as starch biosynthesis in general, owing to genome-wide reverse genetic resources that can provide null mutations in all of the individual enzyme classes. Using such tools the effects of eliminating either SSI, SSIII or SSIV on <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaf starch have been determined. Mutations that eliminate SSI cause decreased frequency of the shortest linear chains within amylopectin, of DP6 to DP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Loss of SSIII causes increased frequency of long glucan chains greater than DP60 but has relatively little effect on the abundance of any chains less than DP50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. SSIV deficiency did not cause any noticeable changes in amylopectin structure, however, this enzyme has a function in initiation of starch granule formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>These unique phenotypes provide further evidence that each SS isoform serves a role in starch biosynthesis that cannot be supplied by any of the other enzyme classes. Genetic data alone, however, cannot fully determine the specific physiological functions of any enzyme because the phenotypic effects on starch structure might not necessarily be direct. Such considerations are important in light of the findings that SSI, SSII, and SSIII from either wheat or maize are capable of assembling with each other into various multiple subunit complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, analysis of plants lacking multiple SSs may be informative regarding the comprehensive mechanisms by which the chain length distribution within amylopectin molecules is determined. This approach has been reported previously using antisense technology to simultaneously repress the levels of SSII and SSIII in potato tubers, and synergistic effects indicative of functional interactions between the two enzymes were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Arabidopsis provides a tractable genetic system to further these studies owing to the ability to completely eliminate any SS class by null mutation and to couple these mutations in desired combinations by standard genetic manipulations. Also, studying SS functions in different organisms, and in a transient starch system in leaves compared to storage starches in tubers or other tissues, likely will reveal conserved biochemical functions that are significant in determination of amylopectin structure.</p><p>In this study analysis of SS functions in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves was extended by characterization of mutations in <italic>AtSS2</italic>, the gene coding for SSII, and by construction of a double mutant line that is completely deficient in both SSII and SSIII activity. Loss of SSII in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>has effects very similar to those observed in other species. Elimination of SSII and SSIII together causes synergistic defects more severe than those resulting from mutation of only one of the two enzymes with regard to starch content and amylopectin structure. Thus, designation of SS function based on particular chain length ranges synthesized by each enzyme class is not likely to fully explain the conservation of multiple SSs. The data suggest that competition between different SS enzymes for binding to the ends of growing linear chains is an additional factor important for the determination of amylopectin structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of null mutations in the gene coding for SSII</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genomic locus At3g01180, hereafter referred to as <italic>AtSS2</italic>, codes for a protein highly similar in amino acid sequence to SSII proteins from rice, wheat, barley, pea, potato, and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that clearly falls into the conserved group of orthologous SSII genes distinct from any other SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Comparison of the genomic sequence to the corresponding cDNA sequence (Genbank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_110984">NM_110984</ext-link>) revealed that <italic>AtSS2 </italic>comprises eight exons and seven introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA contains at least 168 nt upstream of the initiation codon. The computational programs ChloroP and TargetP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] predict that the first 55 amino acids of the polypeptide coded for by <italic>AtSS2 </italic>are likely to function as a chloroplast targeting peptide, and the predicted molecular weight of the mature protein is approximately 81 kDa.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene structure and allele verification</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, <italic>AtSS2 </italic>gene map.

Two T-DNA insertion mutant lines, Salk_065639 and Salk_102650, were obtained from the Salk collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and a third T-DNA insertion line, EIB123, was obtained from the T-DNA mutant collection at INRA of Versailles, France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, all subsequent analyses were performed independently in two different <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>wild type backgrounds, Columbia for the Salk lines and WS for the INRA Versailles line. The mutations in these lines were designated as <italic>Atss2-1</italic>, <italic>Atss2-2</italic>, and <italic>Atss2-3</italic>, respectively.</p><p>PCR amplification of genomic DNA was used to identify homozygous mutant lines for each allele. Gene specific primer pairs flanking the approximate site of the T-DNA insertion identified the wild type allele, and one gene specific primer in combination with a T-DNA end primer revealed the mutant allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) (primer pair sequences for genotype assignment are specified in Methods). The nucleotide sequences of the fragments amplified by one gene specific primer and a T-DNA end primer were determined in order to identify the exact insertion sites. These results showed that the T-DNA element in <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>is located in exon 2, and those in <italic>Atss2-2 </italic>and <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>are located at distinct sites in exon 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Several successive generations of plants were genotyped by PCR analysis to confirm that each line was homozygous for its <italic>Atss2 </italic>allele.</p><p>RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that the three T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtSS2 </italic>locus effectively prevented expression of normal mRNA. For all three <italic>Atss2 </italic>alleles, primers flanking the known insertion site failed to generate any RT-PCR signal, whereas the same primer set generated a fragment of the expected size from wild type mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and data not shown). Thus, normal <italic>AtSS2 </italic>transcripts are lacking in all three mutant lines. Some abnormal transcripts, however, do accumulate from the mutant genes. RT-PCR signal was detected when mRNA from an <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>plant was amplified using primers located in the downstream region of the gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, primer pair 2LP2/2RP2). Similarly, amplification of an upstream region was detected from mRNA of an <italic>Atss2-2 </italic>plant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, primer pair 2LP1/2RP1) or an <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>plant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, primer pair For51/Rev51) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>In the case of <italic>Atss2-1</italic>, immunoblot analysis was used to determine whether the mutation prevented accumulation of the protein product. Total soluble leaf extracts were first fractionated by anion exchange chromatography in order to partially purify SSII and thus facilitate its detection. Proteins in selected chromatography fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with a monoclonal antibody, referred to as &#x003b1;AtSSII, elicited using full-length recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>SSII as the antigen. Wild type extracts analyzed in this way revealed a signal at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which matches the predicted molecular mass for mature SSII after removal of the putative plastid targeting peptide. This band was not detected in the same chromatography fractions from <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>homozygous mutant leaf extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These results, together with the RT-PCR data, indicate that <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>is a null allele in the sense that no detectable SSII protein is present in the homozygous mutant plants. <italic>Atss2-2 </italic>and <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>are also likely to be null alleles based on the demonstrated disruption of the mRNA structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of an <italic>Atss2</italic>, <italic>Atss3 </italic>double mutant and analysis of plant growth phenotypes</title><p>A double mutant was generated in order to examine for possible synergistic effects of simultaneous elimination of both SSII and SSIII.

Soluble leaf extracts were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography, and equal volumes of selected fractions were loaded onto non-denaturing PAGE gels containing 0.33% glycogen. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated in a buffer containing ADPGlc and glycogen, and then stained with I<sub>2</sub>/KI solution. Gel zones that contain an active SS stain dark brown in these assays because the enzyme lengthens exterior glucan chains on the glycogen substrate. Two major SS activity bands were observed in wild type leaf extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The more slowly migrating band was previously identified as SSIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The faster migrating band was identified as SSI based on its absence from <italic>Atss1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The minor band visible below the major SSI band in the double mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) also requires a functional <italic>AtSS1 </italic>gene (data not shown) and thus is identified as a form of that enzyme. The faint band visible in fractions 18 and 19 in the analysis of wild type and the <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>mutant in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> is not an SS activity because it appears even when ADPGlc is omitted from the incubation medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SS activities observed by two dimensional zymogram</bold>.

The zymogram was also performed on total soluble leaf extract, i.e., without prior anion exchange fractionation, and again both <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutants exhibited the same pattern as wild type (data not shown). Therefore, SSII either is present in very low abundance in leaf extracts, or the zymogram assay is ineffective in detecting this particular SS form as compared to SSI or SSIII.</p><p>Total soluble SS activity in soluble leaf extracts was measured in the various mutant strains by an in vitro assay using <sup>14</sup>C-ADPGlc as a substrate.

A qualitatively similar result was observed for the <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>mutant analyzed in the WS genetic background, with the distinction that the degree of difference was larger compared to the Columbia lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

The double mutant shows enrichment and depletion in the same chain length regions as those affected by the <italic>Atss2 </italic>single mutants, but the degree of the change was extreme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

Three independent alleles of the <italic>AtSS2 </italic>locus were analyzed for phenotypic effects, and in all instances essentially identical results were obtained regarding starch structure and amylose content. Each T-DNA insertion allele originated in a distinct line as an independent event, so the probability is negligible that any unidentified second mutation in the genetic background could be the causative agent of the phenotype. Furthermore, major effects of the <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutations on other starch metabolic enzymes were not detected, so that pleiotropic effects are not a likely explanation for the changes in starch structure.</p><p>The effects of eliminating SSII on amylopectin structure in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves closely resembled the phenotype caused by SSII deficiency in other plant species including maize, barley, wheat, potato, rice, and pea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In all these species SSII mutations cause altered amylopectin structure such that the frequency of linear glucan chains of DP6 to DP10 is significantly increased while the abundance of DP12 to DP28 chains is decreased. Like most of the other plant species, <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>granules exhibit distorted morphology when SSII is inactive.</p><p>From these observations it is clear that the physiological function of SSII is highly conserved among plants. The current study indicates that this function also applies to transient starch in leaves, in addition to storage starch in the other species analyzed previously. This conservation applies regardless of the abundance of SSII activity in the soluble phase of each tissue examined. For example, in pea embryos SSII represents up to 60&#x02013;70% of the total soluble SSII activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in pea leaves SSII is a minor but detectable isoform and SSIII accounts for the major portion of the activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and in the current study SSII was undetectable in soluble extracts of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be that the portion of SSII that is present within granules is the determining factor in amylopectin structure, as opposed to that in the soluble fraction. This parameter has not been tested in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves, however, in all storage starches examined SSII has been observed to partition to some extent within the insoluble granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Another possible explanation is that the in vitro measurement of SSII activity does not accurately reflect the enzyme's activity in vivo, owing to an unidentified effect of the assay conditions employed.</p><p>Analysis of leaf starch offered an advantage in observing the effects of SSII on total starch levels, because during the diurnal cycle the starch content is reduced to near zero at the end of the dark phase. Thus, the starch that accumulates during the light phase is synthesized nearly entirely over the previous 16 h in the light regime used in this study. This is in contrast to storage starch that accumulates over a period of weeks. The observed result is that SSII mutation did not cause a major change in the starch levels at the end of the day, indicating that despite the significant change both in amylopectin structure and amylopectin/amylose ratio the overall rate of starch accumulation is not decreased by loss of SSII.</p><p>An interesting feature of starch biosynthesis in all three <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutants is that the amount of amylose produced in leaves relative to the total tissue fresh weight is increased. The fact that the percentage of amylose in starch granules rises in the absence of SSII was known from previous studies in other species. This effect on relative amylose content could result from decreased amylopectin directly caused by the SS defect. The current study, however, demonstrates that the absolute amount of amylose is increased in the mutants over that found in wild type leaves. Presumably the activity of GBSS, the isoform responsible for amylose production, is increased in <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutant granules compared to wild type.</p><p>Increased abundance of GBSS does not appear to be the explanation for the elevated total amylose content, because approximately equal amounts of this enzyme were observed by immunoblot analysis in wild type and <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>mutant granules (CD and NS, unpublished results). Possible explanations for the increased amylose content are a direct regulation of GBSS by SSII, or that the altered amylopectin structure resulting from loss of SSII affects the GBSS activity. The latter explanation could occur through an allosteric regulation of GBSS by the glucan environment in which it is located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Alternatively, it has been proposed that GBSS directly uses amylopectin as a precursor to the synthesis of amylose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. According to this hypothesis the structurally altered amylopectin of the <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutants may provide a more effective substrate for GBSS, allowing greater levels of amylose production. Yet another possible explanation for the increased total amylose content is that elevated MOS levels stimulate GBSS activity by acting as a primer, as has been demonstrated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This explanation is unlikely to apply, however, because WSP levels were not elevated in any of the mutants grown in LD conditions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) yet the total amylose increase was clearly evident (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>double mutation</title><p>Combining mutations that eliminate SSII or SSIII in a single line provided a test of whether or not those two enzymes act independently in starch biosynthesis. Previous analysis of <italic>Atss3 </italic>mutants showed no change in amylose content or granule morphology, and only minor changes in amylopectin chain length distribution on a much smaller scale than were observed here for <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Accordingly, if SSII and SSIII act independently then the expected amylopectin structure in the double mutant would be the nearly same as that of the <italic>Atss2 </italic>single mutants. To the contrary, the starch phenotype of the double mutant was far different than that of either <italic>Atss2 </italic>or <italic>Atss3 </italic>single mutants. The most likely explanation for these results is that SSII and SSIII are capable of executing the same or similar functions in the determination of amylopectin structure.</p><p>The chain length range affected in the double mutant is the same as in the <italic>Atss2 </italic>single mutants, however, the magnitude of the change is far greater. In fact, the glucan structure of the <italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>line is highly abnormal and resembles glycogen more than it does amylopectin, even though the mutant polymer is still present in water-insoluble granules. Synergism is also evident in the starch content, which is reduced in the double mutant by more than 70% at the end of the day. This compares to no reduction in content owing to the SSII deficiency, and an increase in the starch content conditioned by SSIII mutation in the growth environment used in this study.</p><p>The current study confirms the synergistic effects of simultaneous reduction in SSII and SSIII observed previously in antisense potato plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and in addition reveals several distinctions between the leaf and tuber systems. First, the total amounts of starch produced were not affected in SSII/SSIII antisense tubers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], whereas the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mutant lacking both enzymes clearly exhibited a starch deficiency. This effect is likely due to the nature of the transient system in which starch present at the end of the light phase accrues during the course of single day, compared to tubers where starch accumulates steadily over a much longer period of time. Second, more severe effects on chain length distribution were detected in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>double mutant compared to the potato antisense plants. Most notably, the extreme magnitude of the synergistic effects of simultaneous loss of SSII and SSIII on chains of DP6 to DP10 is most clearly observed in the current study. The technique applied for measurement of chain length frequency in one of the potato antisense studies prevented accurate quantification of the synergistic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the other antisense study in potato tubers synergism was detected regarding the DP range of the chains that were affected, however the change in relative abundance of any particular length chain was the same in the single and double antisense lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This result is different than the synergistic effects observed in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves. A possible explanation for the differences is that in Arabidopsis the insertion mutations completely eliminated each enzyme activity, whereas in potato the SS activities were reduced but not necessarily lost entirely. Alternatively, although the individual roles of each SS appear to be conserved in plants, the nature of the interactions in these two comprehensive biosynthetic systems may vary. These observations point out the utility of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genetic system.</p><p>The observed changes in starch metabolism in the <italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>double mutant occurred despite the fact total SS activity in soluble leaf extracts was not significantly reduced compared to wild type (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This observation is unexpected in light of the fact that SSI activity appears to account for only approximately 50% of the total, as determined by analysis of <italic>Atss1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, neither <italic>Atss2 </italic>nor <italic>Atss3 </italic>mutations alone diminish total SS activity (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This apparent paradox may be explained by the proposal that SSIII serves as a negative regulator of SSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], potentially through interactions in the same multi-subunit complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], so that SSI activity could be elevated compared to wild type in the double mutant. Similar observations were made in maize endosperm extracts in which mutations affecting SSIII caused increased total SS activity as opposed to the expected reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and nearly all of the elevated activity could be attributed to SSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A similar relationship also was demonstrated in rice endosperm, in which SSI activity was shown to be elevated 1.3 to 1.7-fold as the result of a mutation affecting SSIIIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>These considerations emphasize the point that total SS activity is not entirely responsible for amylopectin structure determination, and that the relative abundance of each conserved class of SS enzyme likely is an important factor. Similarly, total soluble activity is not solely responsible for determining starch content, because the <italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>double mutant is deficient in starch even though the remaining SS classes are able to provide a high level of activity. Either SSII or SSIII, acting in concert with SSI, are able to support the wild type level of starch synthesis. A possible explanation of this fact is that SSI may be unable to extend chains to a length suitable for BE action, whereas either SSII or SSIII can produce suitable BE substrate chains.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional interaction among SS classes</title><p>The effects of single and double mutations in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes raise the idea that normal amylopectin chain length distribution is determined in large part by competition between different SSs for binding to any glucan chain substrate along with the inherent ability of each SS class to catalyze elongation of chains of particular lengths. The latter point is illustrated by the extreme deficiency of chains of DP12 to DP25 in the <italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>double mutant. In this instance the major soluble SS remaining is SSI. Thus, this enzyme appears to be unable to elongate glucan chains much beyond DP10, which is consistent with the known biochemical properties of maize SSI measured in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Competition between SSI and SSII or SSIII for binding to each glucan chain is suggested from the phenotype caused by the <italic>Atss1 </italic>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or the analogous mutation in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Amylopectin from these mutants exhibits increased frequency of chains in the length region of DP12 to DP28 and a relative deficiency in short chains of DP6 to DP10. In the absence of SSI, access of SSII or SSIII to substrate chains may be increased owing to reduced competition with SSI. If the catalytic efficiency of SSII or SSIII relative to chain length is extended compared to SSI, then the population of DP13 to DP25 chains would rise compared to the wild type condition in which SSI to some extent prevents SSII or SSIII action. In this view, SSI may bind to the shorter chains of approximately DP10 but have a low probability of catalytic activity, thus acting as a negative regulator of SSII or SSIII by means of steric interference. The balance between short chains of DP6 to DP10 and intermediate chains of DP12 to DP28 would be determined by the relative abundance of the three enzymes, their affinities for glucan chains as a function of DP, and their catalytic efficiencies after binding to substrate, again as a function of DP. The proposal that different SS classes would compete with each other for binding to potential substrate chains is consistent with the observation that SSII from pea embryos is a distributive enzyme that dissociates from the glucan substrate after each glucose unit addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus SSII and SSIII might compete for binding to potential glucan substrates during each cycle of chain elongation.</p><p>In order to explain the chain length profile of the <italic>Atss2, Atss3 </italic>double mutant, SSIII is proposed to partially overlap with SSII with regard to the DP region suitable for catalysis, but not with that of SSI. In the absence of SSII, SSIII would still be available to produce chains in the intermediate length region, and to compete with SSI for binding to potential substrates. SSIII is proposed to compete with SSI less effectively than does SSII, in order to explain the reduction in intermediate length chains of DP12 to DP20 in the <italic>Atss2 </italic>mutants. The fact that the <italic>Atss3 </italic>mutation alone has only a minor effect on amylopectin chains shorter than DP40 could be explained by a competitive advantage of SSII over SSIII for binding to short glucan chains. Accordingly, SSIII would not be involved to a great extent in intermediate chain length production in the wild type condition, but could provide that function in the absence of SSII.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The activity of SSII is required in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>for production of the normal frequency of amylopectin chains of DP12 to DP25, and thus the protein exhibits the same function that is conserved in numerous other plant species. None of the other SS classes can completely compensate for loss of SSII, however, SSIII is able to partially function in production of DP12 to DP25 chains. SSIII is not required for the normal population of these chains. These observations can be explained by competition between SSII and SSIII for binding to the non-reducing end of each potential substrate chain. Finally, loss of SSII affects the activity of GBSS such that the total amount of amylose in leaves is increased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Wild type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>of the ecotype Columbia (Col-0), and <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>or <italic>Atss2-2 </italic>mutant lines in this background, were sown in Sunshine Soil mix.

Only experiments that had more than two independent replicates were considered for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XZ performed genetic manipulations, phenotypic determinations, and biochemical analyses involving the <italic>Atss2-1 </italic>and <italic>Atss2-2 </italic>single mutant lines and the <italic>Atss2-1</italic>, <italic>Atss3-1 </italic>double mutant, and helped to draft the manuscript. DD performed the genetic and biochemical analyses of the <italic>Atss2-3 </italic>mutant line. NS carried out biochemical assays of starch metabolic enzymes shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. MGJ, CD, and AMM conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination, and helped to draft the manuscript.
