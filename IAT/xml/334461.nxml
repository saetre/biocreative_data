Acceptor stem and T arm of pre-tRNA substrates are essential recognition elements for both enzymes. Impairing coaxial stacking of acceptor and T stems and omitting the T loop led to reduced cleavage efficiencies. Small model substrates were less efficiently cleaved by M1 RNA and RNase P from T. thermophilus than by the corresponding E. coli activities. Competition kinetics and gel retardation studies showed that truncated tRNA substrates are less tightly bound by RNase P and M1 RNA from both bacteria. Our data further indicate that (pre-)tRNA interacts stronger with E. coli than T. thermophilus M1 RNA. Thus, low cleavage efficiencies of truncated model substrates by T. thermophilus RNase P or M1 RNA could be explained by a critical loss of important contact points between enzyme and substrate. In addition, acceptor stem--T arm substrates, composed of two synthetic RNA fragments, have been designed to mimic internal cleavage of any target RNA molecule available for base pairing.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0086-a" xlink:role="5965"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0088-a" xlink:role="5967"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0089-a" xlink:role="5968"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5963"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5964"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5965"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5966"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5967"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5968"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5969"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5970"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
