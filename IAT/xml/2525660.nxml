Breaking the basement membrane (BM) barrier, a prerequisite for invasive growth, can be due to tumor induced proteolytic tissue remodeling or to reduced synthesis of BM molecules by incipient tumor cells. Laminin-332 (laminin-5), a heterotrimeric BM component composed of &#x003b1;3-, &#x003b2;3- and &#x003b3;2-chains, has recently been identified as a target structure of Smad4 and represents the first example for expression control of an essential BM component by a tumor and invasion suppressor. Biochemically Smad4 is a transmitter of signals of the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily of cytokines. We have reported previously, that Smad4 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of constitutive and of TGF&#x003b2;-induced transcription of all three genes encoding Laminin-332, LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Promoter-reporter constructs harboring 4 kb upstream regions, each of the three genes encoding Laminin-322 as well as deletion and mutations constructs were established. Promoter activities and TGF&#x003b2; induction were assayed through transient transfections in Smad4-negative human cancer cells and their stable Smad4-positive derivatives. Functionally relevant binding sites were subsequently confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Herein, we report that Smad4 mediates transcriptional regulation through three different mechanisms, namely through Smad4 binding to a functional SBE site exclusively in the LAMA3 promoter, Smad4 binding to AP1 (and Sp1) sites presumably via interaction with AP1 family components and lastly a Smad4 impact on transcription of AP1 factors. Whereas Smad4 is essential for positive regulation of all three genes, the molecular mechanisms are significantly divergent between the LAMA3 promoter as compared to the LAMB3 and LAMC2 promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We hypothesize that this divergence in modular regulation of the three promoters may lay the ground for uncoupled regulation of Laminin-332 in Smad4-deficient tumor cells in response to stromally expressed cytokines acting on budding tumor cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Functional inactivation of the tumor suppressor Smad4 in colorectal and pancreatic carcinogenesis occurs coincident with the transition of premalignant precursor lesions &#x02013; adenomas and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), respectively, to invasive and metastatic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The hallmark of invasive growth is loss of the basement membrane (BM) barrier. BMs are specialized sheet-like structures of the extracellular matrix that separate epithelia from the underlying mesenchyme. They are built through interaction of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which both provide components, mainly the laminins and collagen IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The epithelial-derived laminins constitute a family of at least 15 different isoforms in mammals, each an &#x003b1;<sub>x</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>y</sub>&#x003b3;<sub>z </sub>heterotrimer derived from a combination of one, each, out of five &#x003b1;-, three &#x003b2;- and three &#x003b3;-glycoprotein subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the gastrointestinal tract a single-layered epithelial sheet is separated from the underlying mesenchyme through a BM containing laminins- 111, -211, -332, -511 and -521 (laminins 1, 2, 5, 10 and 11), which are expressed in a characteristic regional and development dependent pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Also, in the normal adult pancreas, a single layer of ductal cells &#x02013; the presumptive precursors of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, is separated from mesenchymal cells through a BM containing laminin-332 (LM-332) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Loss of the BM barrier upon the transition to invasive growth can be due either to proteolytic degradation or to decreased synthesis of BM components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Proteolytic degradation of BM in carcinomas has been intensively investigated. It appears to be predominantly executed through proteases expressed mainly by stromal cell types like activated fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, which can be recruited through signals originating from the tumor cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying decreased synthesis of BM components, on the other hand, have rarely been addressed.</p><p>To unravel the mechanisms that underlie Smad4-mediated tumor suppression we have established derivatives of Smad4-deficient human colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma cells, in which Smad4 is stably restored through gene transfer. Using this approach we could proof Smad4's tumor suppressor function and could identify Smad4 target genes, among them VEGF and E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, we have unraveled, that LM-332, composed of &#x003b1;3-, &#x003b2;3- and &#x003b3;2-chains, is another relevant target structure of Smad4. We have shown that all three genes encoding LM-332, LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2, are under positive transcriptional control of Smad4. Smad4 increased basal and/or TGF&#x003b2;-induced expression of LM-332 in Smad4-reexpressing colon and pancreatic cancer cells leading to a huge increase in the extracellular release of the heterotrimer and to the deposition in BM-like structures at contact sites with fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>LM-332 expression is tightly controlled in normal epithelia; adenomas consistently retain normal staining patterns for LM-332 in BMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In colorectal carcinomas, in contrast, laminin deposition in BM structures becomes discontinuous or is absent suggesting that shut-down of laminin expression is associated with genetic alterations that mediate the transition to invasive growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, our finding that the tumor and invasion suppressor Smad4 can act as a positive regulator of LM-332 is consistent with current knowledge.</p><p>Here, we wished to further decipher the molecular mechanisms of how Smad4 acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of constitutive and of TGF&#x003b2;-induced expression of the three genes encoding LM-332. Smad4 encodes an intracellular messenger common to all signaling cascades induced by members of the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily of cytokines through the canonical pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cellular signaling from the TGF&#x003b2; family is initiated by binding of the ligand to transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases, T&#x003b2;RI and T&#x003b2;RII. Activated TGF&#x003b2; receptors stimulate the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) proteins, which in turn form complexes with Smad4 that accumulate in the nucleus. Here, the Smad complex can bind to DNA directly, at so-called SBE sites (Smad binding element), but with low binding affinity, only, and can also bind to and interact with a plethora of other transcription factors, coactivators or corepressors among them transcription factors of the AP1 and Sp1 families. High affinity binding of the Smad complex to a promoter is thought to occur through the incorporation of an additional transcription factor into the R-Smad-Smad4 complex, which binds to its respective cognate sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Adding to the complexity of cellular signaling networks TGF&#x003b2; besides the canonical pathway fuels into further signaling cascades like the MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2; has previously been identified as a positive regulator of LM-332 in diverse cell types among them epidermal keratinocytes and gastric adenocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. AP1 sites were found to confer TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness of the LAMA3 and the LAMC2 promoter -encoding for &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b3;2-chains- in murine keratinocytes and human colon carcinoma cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. No reports, to our knowledge, have yet been published addressing molecular mechanisms of LAMB3 -encoding for &#x003b2;3-chain- promoter regulation.</p><p>We have reported earlier, that an SBE site is functional and is involved in Smad4-mediated TGF&#x003b2; induction of LAMA3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>In silico </italic>analyses detected putative SBE sites also in the promoter regions of the LAMB3 and the LAMC2 genes but have not yet been functionally analyzed.</p><p>Here, we present detailed studies of the three promoters of the genes encoding LM-332 in human colorectal adenoma cells and in Smad4-deficient and Smad4-reexpressing colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma cells. We confirm that the SBE site at -1.5 kb confers one part of Smad4-dependent TGF&#x003b2; induction of LAMA3 expression and that the downstream AP1 sites are additionally involved. On the other hand, whereas each, three, putative SBE sites were identified in the LAMB3 and the LAMC2 promoter through <italic>in silico </italic>analyses, each of these sites proved non-functional. Rather, TGF&#x003b2; induction is conferred through AP1-sites and through a single Sp1 site in both of these promoters. In summary, our results show, that whereas Smad4 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of all three genes encoding LM-332, the underlying mechanisms are surprisingly complex and substantially diverse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human colorectal carcinoma cell line SW480 and the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Proteins and DNA were crosslinked by incubating the cells in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and the reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M.

Previously, we have established Smad4-positive derivatives from the colon carcinoma cell line SW480 by stable transfection. This cell model proved that reexpression of Smad4 at subphysiological levels was adequate to suppress tumor growth whereas TGF&#x003b2; resistance of the cells was retained. Rather, Smad4 induced mesenchymal to epithelial reversion through induction of E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We also found that Smad4-positive SW480 cells in contrast to Smad4-negative clones deposited an adhesive matrix <italic>in vitro </italic>on tissue culture plastic. Based on this observation we identified the heterotrimeric BM component LM-332 as a novel target structure of Smad4. In pancreatic carcinoma cells BxPC3 and CFPAC-1, Smad4 reexpression also increased constitutive LM-332 expression levels and additionally restored TGF&#x003b2; induction of LM-332 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In SW480 cells TGF&#x003b2; responses through the canonical pathway are restricted by very low expression levels of the TGF&#x003b2; type II receptor; Smad4-positive SW480 cells displayed TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness of the p3Tplux promoter in cotransfections with a constitutively active TGF&#x003b2; type I receptor construct, only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As these stably transfected SW480 cell clones express "subphysiological" Smad4 levels (roughly one third of "normal" endogenous levels in Smad4-positive cell lines), we asked if higher Smad4 levels as previously obtained through retroviral gene transfer in Smad4-deficient pancreatic carcinoma cells (i.e. BxPC3) were adequate to overcome the limiting receptor levels in SW480 cells. In fact, a novel set of Smad4-positive retrovirally transduced SW480 derivatives showing moderate overexpression of Smad4 (roughly threefold of "normal" endogenous levels in Smad4-positive Paca44 cells, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) displayed strong TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness in transient transfection assays with p3Tplux (5&#x02013;6 fold induction) and p6SBE (40 fold induction) promoter reporter constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Restoration of TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness through reexpression of Smad4</bold>.

We have previously reported that Smad4 is a positive regulator of the three genes which encode for the heterotrimeric Laminin-332 (LM-332) molecule, a prominent component of basement membranes (BMs). Reexpression of Smad4 in Smad4-deficient tumor cells led to secretion and deposition of the heterotrimeric molecule in BM-like structures and was associated with reversion from mesenchymal-like to epithelial morphology, with suppression of invasiveness <italic>in vitro </italic>and suppression of tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Expression control of an essential BM component thus constitutes an important function of the tumor suppressor Smad4.</p><p>Smad4 is the central mediator of TGF&#x003b2; responses through the canonical TGF&#x003b2;/Smad signal cascade. Smad4 is the single co-Smad that forms complexes with receptor-Smads, which then translocate into the nucleus where they bind to Smad binding elements (SBE) in the promoter region of target genes. In addition, Smad complexes can be targeted to DNA by interacting with ubiquitous sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors like AP1 and Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2;, in addition to the canonical pathway activates further signal cascades like the MAPK/JNK pathways, which in turn can be modified through cross-talk with the Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Addressing the molecular mechanisms through which Smad4 mediates transcriptional regulation of the three LM-332 genes we here provide evidence for three different mechanisms: First, Smad4 binds to a functional SBE site, this mechanism is operative in the LAMA3 promoter, exclusively. Secondly, Smad4 binds to AP1 (and Sp1) sites in all of the three promoters presumably via interaction with AP1 family components and lastly, Smad4 mediates transcriptional induction of AP1 factors. As AP1 sites are intimately involved in transcriptional regulation of laminin genes this Smad4 impact on AP1 factors may represent an important, though indirect mechanism of how Smad4 could affect target gene transcription even in the absence of direct binding at the respective promoters.</p><p>Whereas Smad4 increases constitutive expression levels and TGF&#x003b2; responses of all three genes encoding LM-332, the underlying mechanisms are surprisingly complex and substantially diverse. To start to decipher mechanisms and pathways involved we here used transient transfection assays using promoter-reporter constructs and showed that their activities strictly reflected responses of the endogenous genes. The colorectal adenoma cell line LT97 used as a model for premalignant cells displayed increased expression of all three LM-332 genes in response to TGF&#x003b2;. Likewise, SW480 colorectal and BxPC3 pancreatic carcinoma cells showed transcriptional induction of all three genes in a Smad4-dependent manner, whereas their Smad4-negative counterparts remained unaffected by TGF&#x003b2; treatment. The LAMA3 promoter, only, harbored a functional SBE at -1.5 kb mediating Smad4-dependent TGF&#x003b2; induction of LAMA3 promoter activity. In addition, downstream AP1 sites were shown to be involved in basal promoter activity and, in combination with the SBE, to mediate Smad4-dependent constitutive and TGF&#x003b2;-induced promoter activity.</p><p>The LAMB3 promoter to our knowledge has not yet previously been characterized. We here report that three putative SBE sites surprisingly proved non-functional through the analysis of mutation and deletion constructs. Rather, mutation of an AP1 site at -737 in the LAMB3 promoter reduced basal promoter activity and mutation of a second AP1 site at -3.5 kb abrogated TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness. Mutation of a promoter proximal Sp1 site did not show significant effects on its own, but combined mutations of the Sp1 and both AP1 sites fully suppressed Smad4 effects on basal and TGF&#x003b2;-induced promoter activities. Likewise, Smad4-dependent regulation of the LAMC2 promoter was mediated through two AP1 sites and an Sp1 site residing within a 350 bp downstream promoter region. Of note, whereas Sp1 sites are involved in positive regulation of both the LAMB3 and LAMC2 promoters, the LAMA3 promoter with a downstream Sp1 site mutated displayed strongly increased activity suggesting that in the LAMA3 promoter the Sp1 site exerts transcriptional repression (data not shown).</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed TGF&#x003b2;-induced binding of Smad4 to the functional SBE in the LAMA3 promoter and to the promoter regions harboring functional AP1 sites in each of the three promoters, confirming that all three genes encoding LM-332 are direct Smad4 target genes. Binding of Smad4 to AP1 sites may work via interaction of Smads with AP1 transcription factors as previously shown in the regulation of collagenase-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], MMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], interleukin-11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and demonstrated by Liberati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and Yamamura et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In addition, expression analysis of AP1 family transcription factors revealed Smad4-dependent transcriptional induction in response to treatment with TGF&#x003b2; indicating that direct and indirect mechanisms may converge on these three promoters to regulate LM-332 expression. Of note, whereas TGF&#x003b2; induced binding of Smads to promoter elements in the c-jun and junB promoters has been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] the involvement of Smads in transcriptional regulation of other AP1 family members is a novel finding in this work.</p><p>Interestingly, the dual interdependence of Smad4 and AP1 factors is not without precedence. Our data suggest that Smad4, both, impinges on the regulation of AP1 expression as well as depends on AP1 factors for binding to AP1 sites. Likewise, it has been shown earlier that the androgen receptor drives the expression of ETS transcription factors and can then be co-dependent on ETS factors for its recruitment to a subset of promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>We do not yet know if all of these Smad4 effects are mediated through the canonical TGF&#x003b2;/Smad signaling pathway. TGF&#x003b2; can also activate the MAPK pathway among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; phosphorylation and activation of AP1 proteins through the MAPkinase pathway has been described long ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, all of the TGF&#x003b2; effects observed in our cell models are dependent on Smad4. So, if other signal cascades in addition to the canonical pathway were involved in transcriptional regulation of the laminin genes in SW480 and BxPC3 cells these also function in a strictly Smad4-dependent manner.</p><p>We are only beginning to decipher Smad4 functions in cellular signaling networks. Here, we addressed molecular mechanisms underlying Smad4-dependent regulation of constitutive (cell-autonomous) and of TGF&#x003b2;-induced transcription of laminin genes. Of note, although Smad4 is a positive regulator of all three LM-332 chains the underlying mechanisms are surprisingly complex and binding sites involved are divergent for the LAMA3 promoter on the one hand and for the LAMB3 and LAMC2 promoters on the other side. We hypothesize that this divergence in modular regulation of the three promoters may lay the ground for uncoupled regulation of LM-332 at the invasive front of tumors where an intracellular accumulation of the &#x003b3;2-chain can often be observed and represents an impressive molecular marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Invading/budding tumor cells are maximally exposed to cytokines expressed by stromal cells at the invasive front. For example, monocytes/macrophages present in many tumors at high numbers are a major source not only for TGF&#x003b2; but also for TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Interestingly, Korang et al. reported that TNF&#x003b1; in epidermal keratinocytes inhibited LAMA3 but not LAMB3 and LAMC2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We also observe uncoupled responses of the three LM-332 genes to TNF&#x003b1; in Smad4-deficient but not in Smad4-positive tumor cells (Zboralski et al., in preparation) suggesting that loss of Smad4 may also contribute to uncoupled regulation of LM-332 and consequently to an intracellular accumulation of the &#x003b3;2-chain. NF-kB binding sites mediating TNF&#x003b1; responses through the canonical pathway are present in all three promoters but have not yet been functionally analyzed. In addition, TNF&#x003b1; can also signal through Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and through AP1 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] which we have shown here to be implicated in Smad4-dependent transcriptional regulation of the laminin genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, whereas Smad4 is a positive regulator of basal and of TGF&#x003b2;-induced promoter activities of the three LM-332 genes, the underlying mechanisms are surprisingly complex and significantly differ between the three promoters. Uncoupled regulation, namely induction of the LAMC2 but not the LAMA3 gene in response to signals derived from the tumor stroma at the invasive front of tumors is an important issue in tumor biology. We here show that multiple transcription factors and binding sites are involved in transcriptional regulation of the LM-332 genes. At least some of them, i.e. components of the AP1 family, are well known to be targeted through cytokines other than TGF&#x003b2;, cytokines, which may also be present in the microenvironment of invasive tumor cells. Thus, it will be interesting in the future to address the impact of the Smad4 status of tumor cells on transcriptional responses in the context of various environmental stimuli.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DZ participated in the design of the study, performed plasmid construction experiments and luciferase assays, carried out Northern and ChIP analyses and drafted the manuscript, MB established the novel SW480 and MZ the BxPC3 Smad4 cell system, assisted by SH and AS, SAH sequenced the promoter reporter constructs and WS contributed to the design of the study.
