Furthermore, host nutritional status may be markedly influenced by the composition and activities of the GTM since it is apparent that the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes is decreased in obese individuals and genetically obese mice harbour an &#x0201c;obese microbiome&#x0201d;, with a transferable elevated capacity for energy sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Turnbaugh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several recent investigations have demonstrated considerable integration of prokaryotic and mammalian metabolism with respect to polysaccharide metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Ley1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Xu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Xu2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and other host processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Verberkmoes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Gill1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> which is strong evidence for co-evolution of host and microbiota.

However, since the microbiota exists in close proximity with mammalian tissues, there are many host factors host that may also influence the diversity, richness and stability of the microbiota.

For example, recent studies have investigated the possible correlation between host genetic relatedness and fecal microbial profiles in human adult twins. Zoetendal <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Zoetendal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> used PCR-DGGE-based fecal profiling to demonstrate a correlation between overall genetic relatedness and similarity indices of abundant fecal microbiota 16S rRNA sequence variants. Similarly, Stewart <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Stewart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> profiled fecal bacterial populations and calculated of the degree of similarity in the predominant fecal microbiota of identical twin pairs, fraternal twin pairs and unrelated, paired controls. Since the highest levels of similarity was found in genetically identical twins, with significant differences evident between the identical and fraternal twins, the authors concluded host genetics influenced the composition of the dominant eubacterial population in children. Dicksved et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Dicksved2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> investigated the GTM profiles in 10 monozygotic twin pairs where one or both had Crohn's disease and eight healthy twin pairs and showed that GTMs were more similar between healthy twins than between twins with CD, especially when these were discordant for the disease. The authors concluded that &#x0201c;genetics and/or environmental exposure during childhood, in part, determine the gut microbial composition&#x0201d;.</p><p>Despite the obvious usefulness of studies using human twins, they do not present a definitive means of separating genetic from environmental influences due to the frequent confounding influence of close social and familial contact. In the Stewart study for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Stewart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, the genetically-related volunteers were living in the same home environment at the time of sample collection.</p><p>Further evidence for the importance of host genetics in the determination of host-microbe interaction is provided by a recent study by Khachatryan <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Khachatryan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> who profiled the GTMs of subjects with the auto-inflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever and showed that significant changes in GTMs occurred during inflammatory episodes according to sequence analyses and FISH. Importantly however, the allele-carrier status of individuals for the genes associated with this disease was a significant determinant of GTM composition, even in remission.</p><p>Whilst the environment represents a continuous microbial challenge to the GTM, it is believed that external influences upon the microbial composition of the GTM are greatest in nascent microbiotas, following birth.

Whilst these processes fundamentally affect the animal and human health, they may also represent important and largely overlooked variables when designing animal experiments and interpreting associated data. In the current investigation, the hypothesis that murine GTM composition and metabolism is dictated principally by genetic factors was tested using various highly inbred mouse strains and a reproducible DNA fingerprinting technique (PCR-DGGE), combined with quantitative PCR and urinary metabolite analyses for compositional and metabolic analyses, respectively. Uniquely, embryos of two distinct strains of mice (C57 and Agoutie) were surgically implanted into a surrogate BDF1 strain mother, thus enabling GTM development to be investigated within different genetically distinct strains of mice under essentially identical environments.</p><p>Better understanding of strain and location-dependant variation in murine GTMs has obvious implications for the use of animals as experimental models.

The use of CBA nu/nu and SCID mice additionally enabled specific immune-impairment to be studied since these animals lack T cells and T and B cells, respectively. GTM fingerprints from replicate (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3&#x02013;6) animals, housed at the University of Manchester (designated environment A) clustered together, based on mouse strain with inter-strain concordance, ranging from 71 to 100&#x00025; and intra-strain concordance between 50 and 55&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008584-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This observation was largely corroborated by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008584-t001">Table 1</xref>) where inter-strain variation was apparent, particularly for total fusobacteria, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Importantly, quantitative PCR analysis showed variation in numbers of organisms present in individual mice of the same strain were not significant for 37/49 values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008584-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Whilst these data were suggestive of genetic determination of GTM profiles, further analyses was necessary to differentiate between environmental and genetic factors, since individual mouse strains were housed together with like strains and familial GTM profiles could be perpetuated through maternal contact and by coprophagia.</p><fig id="pone-0008584-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008584.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Strain-dependent clustering of mouse GTMs.</title><p>UPGMA cluster analysis of fecal DGGE profiles from six genetically distinct strains of mice.

In order to investigate the stability of GTMs, the effect of environmental change was studied in highly immunocompromised SCID mice; selected from a line that had been bred and maintained in the same unit within the University of Manchester (environment A) for 6 years. These animals were relocated to an alternative room (environment B) within the same institution at 8 weeks of age (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). Age-matched animals were also maintained in their original environment. All animals underwent changes in GTM profiles between 4 and 8 weeks of age but at maturity, the GTMs of relocated animals did not markedly differ from those that had not been moved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008584-g003">Fig 3</xref>). This experiment was also repeated for C3H mice with the elaboration that animals were relocated at either <italic>c.</italic> 4 or 8 weeks of age. This resulted in marked changes in GTM profiles that were only manifested in immature animals, as evidenced by the distinct clustering of GTM profiles in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008584-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). Additionally, urinary metabolite profiles for C3H mice moved at 8 weeks of age and those that remained in the original environment clustered together and were distinct from those moved at four weeks of age, thus corroborating the DGGE data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008584-g004">Fig 4b</xref>). Examination of the UPLC-MS data revealed a complex pattern of ions/metabolites increasing or decreasing in intensity in the group relocated at four weeks of age compared to those in the other two groups indicating a difference in metabolite patterns between the two groups. Confirmation of the characteristic GTM profiles associated with each animal, together with high degrees of microbiota stability of mature animals suggested a possible role for host-specific factors but could also be attributed to colonization-resistance of mature GTMs, resulting in the age-dependant variations in the influence of environmental change. It was therefore, necessary to more effectively differentiate between environment and genetic factors in order to better differentiate between these variables.</p><fig id="pone-0008584-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008584.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of relocation on the GTM profiles of highly immunocompromised SCID mice (UPGMA cluster analysis of fecal DGGE profiles).</title><p>All animals were housed in environment A until 8 weeks of age.

Animal models are currently used to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicology of new drugs etc. Differences in GTMs associated with the maintenance of animals within distinct research centers could have obvious, but to date, poorly understood effects on experimental outcomes. Such variation may for example, significantly influence drug metabolism within apparently identical mouse strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Specific metabonomic studies have shown that individual, pre-dose urinary metabolic phenotypes (which are strongly influenced by the microbiota <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Phipps1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> can be used to predict the metabolic fate and toxicity of drugs and other xenobiotics in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Clayton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and the urinary metabolic phenotype of human volunteers was recently found to predict the metabolic fate of acetaminophen (paracetamol) based on the quantity of urinary p-cresol, a product of gut microbial metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Clayton2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Clayton3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whilst other reports have suggested that host genetics are primarily responsible for the composition of the GTM in humans and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Zoetendal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Stewart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> some of these have utilized fraternal and identical human twins and sibling groups. Whilst such approaches are laudable, differentiation between environmental and genetic factors remains a problem. Other investigations have however, indicated a complex interplay between genetics and environment. For example, a study involving reciprocal transplantations of GTMs between germ-free zebra fish and mice has indicated that host-factors are involved in the selection of GTM profiles which, although resembling those of the donor animal with respect to bacterial lineages, assumed relative abundances more closely resembling the normal GTM profile of the recipient host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Rawls1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Another key investigation used a comprehensive, network-based analysis of fecal 16S rRNA genes sequences from humans but also from 59 other mammalian species to elucidate major influences such as diet and host phylogeny upon the GTM composition and to gain insight into the likely evolution of such associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008584-Ley2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. GTM communities were more similar between conspecific hosts than between different species and when conspecific hosts lived separately, significant clustering was still apparent in some (for example, between two baboons living on different continents; one in the wild, one in captivity), but not all cases. Highly significant clustering was also apparent according to diet which could be analysed as a variable independently of host phylogeny. Interpersonal differences between humans appeared to be lower than differences between distinct mammalian species.</p><p>In the current study, the use of animal models has suggested that the environment is a major factor in the determination of the GTM profiles of mice. This is evidenced by the apparent strain-dependence of GTM compositional and metabolic profiles, which were absent when genetically distinct mice were gestated and reared by the same mother and by GTM variation within isogenic mice derived from different research institutions. From a practical perspective, differences in GTM profiles and metabolism within putatively isogenic mice could result in significant unforeseen variation in the effects of drug treatment in experimental animals and ultimately in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics</title><p>All procedures used in this study incorporated the 1998 United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research Guidelines and were in compliance with The Scientific Procedures Act of 1986.
