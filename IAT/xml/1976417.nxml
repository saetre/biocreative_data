Natural killer cells are characterized by the expression of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM). NCAM is an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) and was the first vertebrate protein demonstrated to be glycosylated with polysialic acid (PSA), which is a homomeric polymer of &#x003b1;-2,8-sialic acid. Until now only very few proteins have been reported to be modified with PSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Our question was whether CD56 on NK cells is polysialylated and if PSA-NCAM could be the endogenous ligand masking Siglec-7. For this purpose we performed a FACS analysis examining PSA expression on peripheral blood. The impact of PSA on NK cell cytotoxicity was determined by killing assays after specific enzymatic removal of sialic acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Detection of PSA expression in human peripheral blood</title><p>To detect PSA<sup>+ </sup>cells in peripheral blood we used an antibody which binds PSA of at least twelve &#x003b1;-2,8-linked sialic acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Co-staining of PSA and CD56 not only shows co-expression but also a strong correlation of staining intensity, which indicates that CD56 on NK cells, is polysialylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Co-expression of PSA and CD56 was also verified by immunocytochemical staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Polysialylation of NCAM on NK cells has also been suggested by Lanier et al. who sowed excessive sialylation of NCAM, but the nature of the linking of sialic acid monomers was not investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>NK cells express PSA-NCAM</bold>.

To determine which polysialylating enzymes are involved in the expression of PSA on NK cells reverse transcriptase PCR was performed. We compared SIAT8D and SIAT8B mRNA expression in adult CD56<sup>+ </sup>NK cells and in human adult and fetal brain. Expression of SIAT8D was found in NK cells as well as in both brain samples. In contrast SIAT8B was expressed predominantly in fetal brain, but the expression was drastically reduced in adult brain and could not be detected in adult NK cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These findings suggest that only SIAT8D contributes to NCAM polysialylation in peripheral blood NK cells.

Separated cells were co-cultured with the target cell line K562 for four hours followed by a killing efficiency determination.

Comparison of killing efficiencies at the effector target ratio 50:1 showed no significant reduction of killing ability by the separation strategy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The slightly reduced killing efficiency of cells separated via PSA could be caused by the large labeling complex (anti PSA + anti IgM.PE + anti PE microbeads) due to steric inhibition. These data indicate that cells separated via PSA are functional NK cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>PSA<sup>+ </sup>cells are functional NK cells</bold>.

After enzymatic treatment the vitality was not reduced significantly (91% after neuraminidase treatment in comparison to 96.7% without neuraminidase treatment, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>; and 93,5% after Endo-NF treatment and 97,5% without treatment, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

The large labeling complex used to isolate PSA<sup>+ </sup>cells could cause this reduction due to steric inhibition. PSA expression has also been described on decidual NK cells (dNK cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] which are located in the human placenta where they play an important role in maintaining pregnancy. In contrast to peripheral blood derived NK cells dNK cells show only week cytotoxicity. And as their expression pattern differs from peripheral blood NK cells, even a different NK cell lineage arising from a different progenitor was suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>PCR analysis of the expression of the two polysialyltransferases SIAT8D and SIAT8B showed that NK cells only express SIAT8D. It has been shown that SIAT8D plays a predominant role in NCAM polysialylation and that mRNA levels strongly correlate with protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We could show that SIAT8D is strongly expressed on mRNA level in NK cells, which suggests that SIAT8D is the main polysialylating enzyme in adult NK cells. Its expression also provides additional evidence for polysialylation of NCAM.</p><p>As has been described before, enzymatic removal of all sialic acid residues with <italic>Clostridium perfringens </italic>Neuraminidase reduced the killing efficiency of CD56<sup>+ </sup>cells dramatically due to de-masking of siglec-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However Endo-NF treatment of NK cells did not lead to a reduction of killing efficiency. A reduction of PSA polymerization degree is supposed to have a major effect on PSA function. We thus conclude that PSA is not involved in masking Siglec-7.</p><p>Removal of PSA using Endo-NF creates a rest of four &#x003b1;-2,8-linked sialic acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The PSA antibody (Men-B) used in the experiments above recognizes PSA of a minimum chain length of twelve sialic acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We thus conclude that after Endo-NF treatment a minimum of four and a maximum of eleven &#x003b1;-2,8-linked sialic acid residues are still left on the NK cell surface. The fact that removal of sialic acid residues with Endo-NF does not lead to a reduced cytotoxicity of NK cells gives rise to the speculation that the unknown endogenous ligand of Siglec-7 consists either of maximal four &#x003b1;-2,8-linked sialic acid residues or &#x003b1;-2,6-linked branched sialic acid residues. Other candidates for the masking ligand of Siglec-7 have already been identified. Avril et al. for example showed recently expression of a so far uncharacterized &#x003b1;-2,8-disialylated O-linked glycan by NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The role of PSA-NCAM on NK cells remains unknown. PSA-NCAM has been characterized in the nervous system, where it has an impact on cell migration, axonal path finding, neurite outgrowth, fasciculation of neurites and also modulates AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (for NCAM and PSA-NCAM interactions and signal transduction see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for review). Muscle cells, including cardiac myocytes also express PSA-NCAM during development. Furthermore PSA can directly modulate the homophilic binding potential of NCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and also interactions with other proteins. And Agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix has been suggested to bind the heparin-binding site of NCAM and PSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is affected by the PSA moieties bound to NCAM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion we could show expression of PSA-NCAM on functional human peripheral blood NK cells. Our data strongly indicates that the polysialyltransferase SIAT8D is responsible for PSA expression in NK cells. Killing assays after specific removal of PSA revealed that elimination of PSA has no effect on NK cell cytotoxicity and thus indicate that polysialic acid is not the endogenous ligand masking Siglec-7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>K562 cell line was cultured in RPMI (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), 10% FCS (PAA, Brisbane, Australia), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland, UK) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/ml, Gibco) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
