Effective therapy for this pain is lacking, and the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unknown. We have previously shown that spinal nerve injury induces the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>(cPLA<sub>2</sub>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent subclass of the PLA<sub>2 </sub>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], in DRG neurons, and that inhibiting cPLA<sub>2 </sub>suppresses nerve injury-induced tactile allodynia, revealing a crucial role for this enzyme in neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Activated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>hydrolyzes the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to release arachidonic acid and lysophospholipid, and subsequently generates lipid mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor and lysophosphatidic acid. These mediators have been reported to cause sensitization of primary afferent neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and to produce allodynic behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Activation of P2X<sub>3 </sub>and P2X<sub>2+3 </sub>receptors (P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R), ionotropic ATP receptor subtypes, is involved in nerve injury-induced cPLA<sub>2 </sub>activation in DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; however, the mechanism underlying cPLA<sub>2 </sub>activation via P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The activation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>is regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues in addition to a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The catalytic domain of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>contains several phosphorylation sites, Ser505, Ser515 and Ser727, which have been reported to be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and MAPK-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) or a closely related isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], respectively. Among these serine residues, phosphorylation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>at Ser505 and Ser727 has been shown to be important for agonist-induced arachidonic acid release in mammalian cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is possible that the phosphorylation of these three serine residues may be interactive, because MNK1 is activated by MAPKs such as p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and CaMKII modulates ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, it has been recently shown that phosphorylation on Ser505 by ERK is dependent upon Ser515 phosphorylation via the activation of CaMKII in vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Among protein kinases involved in cPLA<sub>2 </sub>activation described above, MAPKs and CaMKII are expressed in DRG neurons and have important roles in pain signaling. Nerve injury induces an increase in p38 and ERK phosphorylation in DRG neurons and injection of these inhibitors attenuates nerve injury-induced tactile allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], strongly suggesting that MAPK activation in primary afferent neurons participates in neuropathic pain after nerve injury. CaMKII, which is especially abundant in the nervous system, has been implicated in various neuronal functions, such as the synthesis and release of neurotransmitter, modulation of ion channels and receptors, gene expression and synaptic plasticity. Recently, it was reported that CaMKII is localized in small- and medium-diameter DRG neurons that are known to transmit nociceptive signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), a model of inflammatory pain, increases the expression of CaMKII in sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and CaMKII activation regulates the activity of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, it raises the possibility that peripheral nerve injury may induce the activation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>via the phosphorylation of MAPKs and CaMKII in primary afferent neurons, but their roles remain to be determined.</p><p>While cPLA<sub>2 </sub>is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the normal condition, in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration promotes binding of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>to the C2 domain and then allows cPLA<sub>2 </sub>to translocate to the perinuclear region, including the nuclear envelope, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum in non-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By contrast, our previous study showed that phosphorylated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>translocates to the plasma membranes of injured DRG neurons. Therefore, the translocation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>in DRG neurons seems to be unique, but the mechanism of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>translocation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of MAPKs and CaMKII in cPLA<sub>2 </sub>phosphorylation and translocation in DRG neurons following peripheral nerve injury using pharmacological and molecular approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of neither p38 nor ERK prevents the activation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>after nerve injury</title><p>An injury to the L5 nerve caused an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 mainly in small-diameter DRG neurons (data not shown), as previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nerve injury also induced an increase in ERK phosphorylation in satellite glial cells, and to a lesser extent, in large-diameter DRG neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To examine the involvement of ERK and p38 in cPLA<sub>2 </sub>activation in DRG neurons, we tested the effects of inhibitors for MAPK kinase (MEK, a kinase upstream of ERK) and p38 that were administered through a catheter whose tip was positioned near the L5 DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Vehicle-treated rats with an L5 nerve injury displayed a marked decrease in paw withdrawal threshold after nerve injury (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). By contrast, U0126, a selective inhibitor of MEK, and SB203580, a potent inhibitor of p38, significantly suppressed the development of tactile allodynia, as previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (U0126, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; SB203580, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Whereas p38 phosphorylation in DRG neurons was not inhibited by SB203580 (data not shown), because SB203580 binds to the ATP pocket in p38 to inhibit its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], ERK phosphorylation was suppressed by U0126 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, on day 7, the levels of phosphorylated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>(p-cPLA<sub>2</sub>) in the ipsilateral DRGs of U0126- and SB203580-treated rats were not changed compared with that in vehicle-treated rats.

Similar results were obtained in immunohistochemical analyses using the ipsilateral L5 DRG that was removed 45&#x02013;60 min after injection of these inhibitors (data not shown).

We found that L5 nerve injury caused an increase in the level of phosphorylated CaMKII-immunoreactivity (p-CaMKII-IR) in the ipsilateral L5 DRG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Accumulated p-CaMKII-IR was not observed in the contralateral DRG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

To investigate this hypothesis, we examined co-localization of phosphorylated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII in DRG neurons. Since it is difficult to perform double-immunolabeling of tissue with p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and p-CaMKII antibodies, because they were raised in the same host species (rabbit), we used two adjacent DRG sections and singly immunostained one section with each antibody. We observed DRG neurons that were positive for both p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and p-CaMKII in the injured DRG (indicated by arrowheads, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To further test whether the inhibition of CaMKII activation affects nerve injury-induced cPLA<sub>2 </sub>activation, we injected a CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93, and a negative control for KN-93, KN-92, into nerve-injured rats. We found that the levels of both p-CaMKII and p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>in the ipsilateral DRG of KN-93-treated rats were much lower than those in KN-92-treated rats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), and administration of KN-93 markedly reduced the number of DRG neurons showing translocated p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>in response to nerve injury (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) on day 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) compared with KN-92 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) or vehicle administration (<italic>n </italic>= 2, 38.3 &#x000b1; 0.3%). These results suggest that CaMKII is involved in cPLA<sub>2 </sub>phosphorylation and translocation in DRG neurons caused by nerve injury.

No alteration in motor behavior after KN-93 treatment was observed (data not shown).

To examine whether CaMKII is also activated by these receptors, we applied ATP to cultured DRG neurons and found that the level of p-CaMKII-IR was increased in the vicinity of the plasma membranes of DRG neurons, similar to the translocation of p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>after applying ATP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Next, to investigate the physical association between p-CaMKII and p-cPLA<sub>2</sub>, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments and found that p-CaMKII was coimmunoprecipitated with p-cPLA<sub>2 </sub>in DRG neurons after the application of ATP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Although p38 and MEK inhibitors administered near the injured DRG prevented the development of tactile allodynia, these did not affect the activation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>. It is thus conceivable that p38 and ERK in DRG neurons participate in the development of tactile allodynia through an independent pathway or downstream of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling pathway. In particular, ERK and cPLA<sub>2 </sub>are activated in different types of cells in the injured DRG: ERK phosphorylation was seen predominantly in satellite glial cells, while activation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>is observed mainly in medium-to-large-diameter DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which supports our hypothesis. Alternatively, it is also possible that cPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor and lysophosphatidic acid, which have been reported to produce tactile allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], may affect the excitation of DRG neurons via MAPK activation in primary afferent neurons. Studies in our laboratory determining cPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated products and their roles in neuropathic pain are currently underway.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that cPLA<sub>2 </sub>is phosphorylated by CaMKII <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CaMKII is preferentially localized in pain-processing regions in the nervous system, such as the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CaMKII activity is significantly increased in the spinal cord after injection of capsaicin and formalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and CFA-induced pain behaviors and increase of CaMKII phosphorylation in the spinal dorsal horn are reduced by KN-93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of KN-93 attenuates the development of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia following chronic constriction injury (CCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These findings suggest that CaMKII expressed in the spinal cord contributes to chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain as well as acute pain. By contrast, in DRG neurons, the phosphorylation of CaMKII has an important role in nerve growth factor-induced sensitization of TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and modulation of the agonist binding to TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CaMKII expression in sensory neurons has been shown to be increased during chronic inflammation pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but there have been no reports investigating the role of CaMKII in DRG neurons in neuropathic pain. In our immunohistochemical analyses, the level of CaMKII phosphorylation was increased in the ipsilateral DRG neurons after nerve injury. We also found that DRG neurons showing translocation of both phosphorylated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII to the plasma membrane were observed in the injured DRG. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of CaMKII prevented cPLA<sub>2 </sub>phosphorylation and translocation as well as tactile allodynia following peripheral nerve injury. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and translocation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>to the plasma membrane via an interaction with activated CaMKII is a key event in the development of nerve injury-induced tactile allodynia. Our present behavioral study also reveals that KN-93 is effective in treating existing tactile allodynia, which is consistent with the behavioral analysis using a cPLA<sub>2 </sub>inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Considering a previous result showing that KN-93 administered near the spinal cord 7 days after CCI produces no significant effect on existing tactile allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the role of CaMKII in the maintenance phase of neuropathic pain may be predominant in the DRG rather than in the spinal cord.</p><p>Applying ATP caused an increase in the levels of both phosphorylated cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, and physical association of these two proteins in primary cultured DRG neurons. ATP receptor agonist-dependent phosphorylation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII were inhibited either by the selective P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R antagonist A-317491 or by the nonselective VDCC blocker cadmium. Because the ATP-evoked current is not blocked by cadmium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], our results suggest that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx via the activation of P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R may not be enough to activate CaMKII and that VDCC activation (presumably resulting from a depolarization of DRG neurons by stimulating P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R) may contribute to CaMKII activation in DRG neurons. Activation of CaMKII and cPLA<sub>2 </sub>in A23187-stimulated DRG neurons supports this notion. Subsequently, activated CaMKII would phosphorylate cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and be translocated to the plasma membrane by interacting physically with activated cPLA<sub>2</sub>. To date, there have been many studies investigating CaMKII translocation and its roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. In hippocampal neurons, CaMKII is activated by Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx through NMDA receptors and then translocated to postsynaptic density (PSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] in parallel with sustained CaMKII activity owing to an interaction with the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Activated CaMKII subsequently phosphorylates many PSD proteins, including AMPA receptors, and binds to NMDA receptor subunits, resulting in induction of long-term potentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In relation to pain, a previous study has reported that inhibition of CaMKII activity blocks translocation of AMPA receptor subunits to the plasma membrane of spinal cord neurons after capsaicin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Although there have been few reports investigating the translocation of CaMKII in the peripheral nervous system, a recent study demonstrated that CaMKII activated by electric stimulation of the sciatic nerve is implicated in the trafficking of P2X<sub>3</sub>R toward the plasma membranes of DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Given the present data showing that cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII are activated via stimulation of P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R in DRG neurons, this work indicates that P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R-dependent activation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII is enhanced under pathological conditions, such as neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that CaMKII, but not MAPKs, has an important role in cPLA<sub>2</sub>-dependent tactile allodynia via the regulation of phosphorylation and translocation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>, both of which are mediated by P2X<sub>3</sub>R/P2X<sub>2+3</sub>R and voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels in primary afferent neurons following peripheral nerve injury. Our results provide important evidence to help us to understand the mechanism underlying neuropathic pain modulated by cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and the translocation of cPLA<sub>2 </sub>and CaMKII in DRG neurons under pathophysiological conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats (250&#x02013;300 g) were used.

After the experiments, we confirmed that the tip of the catheter was positioned near the L5 DRG.
