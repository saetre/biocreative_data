Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T (T reg) cells are potent immune regulators and are found at high frequency in both human and mouse skin. Although T reg cells migrate to the skin and can dampen immune responses during experimentally induced inflammation or infection, the importance of cutaneous T reg cells for maintaining normal immune homeostasis in the skin has not been addressed. To selectively block T reg cell function in the skin, we restored the T reg cell compartment in Foxp3-deficient <italic>scurfy</italic> mice with cells whose ability to migrate to the skin was impaired because of targeted mutation of &#x003b1;-1,3-fucosyltransferase VII (Fut7). Although Fut7-deficient T reg cells were present at normal frequency and could function in all other tissues examined, these animals rapidly developed severe cutaneous inflammation. Thus, skin-resident T reg cell are essential for maintaining normal immune homeostasis at this site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tolerance against self- and harmless environmental antigens involves several levels of immune regulation. Whereas deletional mechanisms attempt to purge the B and T cell repertoire of self-reactive specificities, antigen-specific suppression of autoimmunity by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory (T reg) T cells also plays a critical role in maintaining self-tolerance. The importance of T reg cells is highlighted by the severe autoimmunity in humans and mice rendered T reg cell&#x02013;deficient because of lesions in the <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene, which in mice can be prevented by adoptive transfer of purified T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In addition, neonatal or adult ablation of T reg cells, or adoptive transfer of T reg cell&#x02013;depleted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to immunodeficient mice rapidly triggers severe autoimmune or inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that T reg cells are required for both the establishment and maintenance of self-tolerance in vivo.</p><p>T reg cells can be subdivided based on expression of homing receptors thought to direct their migration to lymphoid versus nonlymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, the relative contributions of the various T reg cell subsets to the maintenance of self-tolerance are not well defined. Several reports have demonstrated that T reg cells function within nonlymphoid sites to restrict T cell responses to foreign antigens during experimentally induced acute inflammation or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In addition, we have shown that mice whose T reg cells lack the chemokine receptor CCR4 develop spontaneous inflammatory disease in skin and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, although CCR4 helps direct T cell migration to the skin and lung airways, it may also facilitate interactions between T reg cells and antigen-presenting cells within secondary lymphoid tissues. Thus, the inflammatory disease in these animals is likely the result of impaired T reg cell function in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs, and the importance of nonlymphoid T reg cells in maintaining tolerance in the absence of a strong inflammatory stimulus has not been adequately addressed.</p><p>Surface expression of functional E- and P-selectin ligands (E-/P-lig) is required for optimal migration of effector T cells to inflamed skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Interestingly, a high percentage of circulating human and mouse T reg cells express E- and/or P-lig, and Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells make up a large fraction of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in normal skin from both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). This suggests that cutaneous T reg cells may have an important immunoregulatory function at this site, even in the absence of any infection or inflammatory response. The carbohydrate determinants of E- and P-selectin binding are generated by the &#x003b1;-1,3-fucosyltransferase VII (FuT7) enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Therefore, we used FuT7-deficient mice to determine the importance of T reg cell migration to the skin for their ability to prevent cutaneous inflammatory disease. We found that after transfer into T reg cell&#x02013;deficient <italic>scurfy</italic> (<italic>sf</italic>) mice, T reg cells up-regulated expression of cutaneous homing receptors such as E- and P-lig and migrated to the skin. Loss of FuT7 dramatically reduced T reg cell accumulation in the skin, and resulted in selective onset of severe cutaneous inflammation. Thus, our results reveal the importance of correct T reg cell positioning in the skin for the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of spontaneous autoimmune and inflammatory disease.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>T reg cells up-regulate skin homing receptors after transfer into <italic>sf</italic> mice</title><p>In <italic>sf</italic> mice, T reg cell differentiation and function is blocked because of a 2-bp insertion in the <italic>foxp3</italic> gene, which causes a frameshift and premature translational termination. As a result, these mice succumb to rapid and fatal multiorgan autoimmunity that predominantly affects the skin, liver, and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This inflammation can be prevented by adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells, which undergo extensive expansion to fill their unique homeostatic &#x0201c;niche&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In WT mice, T reg cells are distributed throughout both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Therefore, we examined T reg cell homing receptor expression and tissue-distribution 4 wk after transfer into 1&#x02013;3-d-old neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mice. To facilitate T reg cell identification, we transferred T reg cells purified from mice carrying a <italic>Foxp3<sup>gfp</sup></italic> &#x0201c;knock-in&#x0201d; allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). When compared with T reg cells from age-matched WT mice, we found that T reg cells recovered from the LNs and spleens of the recipient animals were enriched in cells expressing adhesion and chemoattractant receptors such as CCR4, CCR6, CD103, E-lig, and P-lig, that are associated with T cell migration to the skin and other nonlymphoid sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Accordingly, the transferred Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cell were found in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of the recipient animals, including the LNs, spleen, intestine, liver, lungs and skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and not depicted). Moreover, as in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), the transferred T reg cells made up a particularly large percentage of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>T reg cells transferred into <italic>sf</italic> mice up-regulate cutaneous homing receptors and accumulate in the skin.</bold> (A) Homing receptor expression in LNs and spleen 4 wk after transfer of T reg cells into a neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mouse was compared with that in an 8-wk-old <italic>Foxp3<sup>gfp</sup></italic> mouse by flow cytometry.

As early as day 6, most labeled T reg cells had fully diluted their CFSE, and in particular, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0201c;effector memory&#x0201d; T reg cells were exclusively found in the CFSE<sup>low</sup> fraction. T reg cell migration to nonlymphoid sites is associated with their expression of CD103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). To determine if the high percentage of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells in recipient animals is caused by selective outgrowth of this subset, or instead is the result of up-regulation of CD103 expression by CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, we sorted CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T reg cells from CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> donors, and cotransferred them into neonatal <italic>sf</italic> recipients. We found that the CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0201c;naive-like&#x0201d; T reg cells expanded nearly as well as their CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> counterparts, and rapidly up-regulated CD103 and other nonlymphoid tissue homing receptors (Fig. S1 B and not depicted). Collectively, these results demonstrate that after transfer into neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mice, Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells undergo robust expansion and phenotypic differentiation, resulting in their distribution throughout both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. This is consistent with data from our laboratory and others demonstrating that OVA-specific T reg cells up-regulate cutaneous homing receptors after antigen-recognition in the peripheral LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and suggests that T reg cell activity in nonlymphoid tissues may be important for their ability to prevent fatal autoimmunity after transfer into neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells</title><p>The relative abundance of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells in both human and mouse skin suggests that this may be a location in which these cells receive critical survival and/or homeostatic signals. Indeed, IL-15 and dermal fibroblasts can induce the proliferation of human cutaneous T reg cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Leukocyte expression of E- and P-lig is severely diminished in FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and as a result, T cell migration to the skin during cutaneous inflammatory responses or infection is almost completely abolished in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Therefore, to determine if loss of FuT7 impacts T reg cell homeostasis and differentiation, we compared T reg cell abundance and phenotype in age-matched WT and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In the spleen and LNs, total lymphocyte numbers (not depicted) and the frequency of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) were indistinguishable in WT and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells also exhibited normal expression of various T reg cell&#x02013;associated cell surface markers, such as CD25 and GITR (unpublished data). As expected, expression of E- and P-lig was strongly and significantly reduced in the FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells. However, the percentages of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells expressing other lymphoid and nonlymphoid homing receptors such as CD62L, CCR7, CD103, CCR4, and CCR6 were not significantly different than those observed in WT animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In addition, the surface levels of each of these markers were unchanged in FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data). Finally, we compared the ability of WT- and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells to suppress the proliferation of CFSE-labeled effector T cells in vitro. Consistent with a previous study analyzing the function of T cell receptor-transgenic T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), WT- and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells were equally effective in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of FuT7-dependent expression of E- and P-lig, there are no gross impairments in T reg cell differentiation, maintenance, or function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic and functional characterization of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells.</bold> (A) Frequency of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in peripheral LNs and spleens of 8-wk-old WT (shaded bars) or FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (open bars) mice.

Representative results of one out of two independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051559f02"></graphic></fig><p>The requirement for FuT7 in T cell migration to the skin has been primarily demonstrated in settings of experimentally induced inflammation, during which both E- and P-selectin are strongly expressed by vascular endothelial cells in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, E-selectin is also expressed constitutively (albeit at low levels) in the microvascular beds of the skin, and almost all T cells isolated from human skin are E-lig<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, suggesting a role for this receptor pair in T cell migration to the skin under homeostatic conditions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Indeed, the frequency of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was significantly reduced in the skin of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072594/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072594/DC1</ext-link>). To directly compare the ability of WT and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T reg cells to migrate to the skin, we cotransferred equal numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells isolated from CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> WT (not <italic>Foxp3<sup>gfp</sup></italic>) and CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice into neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mice, and assessed the tissue distribution of the transferred cells 4&#x02013;6 wk later. In these experiments, the recipients were heterozygous for CD45.1 and CD45.2, and thus endogenous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in these mice were CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Importantly, the recipient animals remained healthy and displayed no histological signs of the inflammatory disease or dermatitis typical of <italic>sf</italic> mice (unpublished data). After transfer, both WT- and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells expanded and were present at roughly equivalent percentages in most lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues analyzed, including the spleen, peripheral and mesenteric LNs, lungs and lung airways, intestinal epithelium, and intestinal lamina propria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and not depicted). This confirms that FuT7 is not required for T reg cell expansion and maintenance in vivo, even when placed in competition with WT cells. In contrast, relative to the cotransferred WT cells, the accumulation of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells in the skin was impaired by 5&#x02013;10-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

Combined with the high frequency of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in normal skin, this suggests that T reg cell&#x02013;mediated immunosuppression is particularly important for maintenance of cutaneous self-tolerance. However, it is not clear if T reg cell migration to the skin is actually important for this protection, or if instead T reg cells function mainly to block the initiation of aberrant immune responses in the skin draining LNs.</p><p>The importance of T reg cell migration to nonlymphoid tissues has primarily been demonstrated during strong immune responses to foreign antigens after immunization, infection, or transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In these settings, T reg cells are believed to restrain the responses of effector T cells, preventing collateral tissue damage and inflammation. For example, during delayed-type hypersensitivity responses mediated by OVA-specific T<sub>H1</sub> cells, cutaneous T reg cells had no effect on the extent of footpad swelling after OVA injection, but instead promoted more rapid resolution of the inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In contrast, T reg cells were able to inhibit development of spontaneous colitis mediated by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cells in RAG-deficient mice even when their ability to access the intestines was severely impaired, and this is likely caused by their ability to inhibit the initial priming and differentiation of colitogenic T cells specific for intestinal antigens within secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Thus, it is not clear if T reg cell migration to nonlymphoid sites is required to maintain tolerance in the absence of any strong inflammatory response or infection.</p><p>To determine if cutaneous T reg cells are required for immune homeostasis in the skin, we compared the ability of WT and FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells to prevent cutaneous inflammation after transfer into neonatal <italic>sf</italic> mice. In these experiments, we did not add any additional inflammatory stimuli or foreign antigens. Thus, unlike previous reports examining T reg cells in responses to highly immunogenic foreign antigens, our system examined the ability of T reg cells to control the initiation and progression of immune responses directed against innocuous self- and environmental-antigens, against which there are normally no strong inflammatory responses.

Moreover, whereas the frequencies of FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells in the peripheral LN, spleen, and lungs were similar to those in mice receiving WT cells, the FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells were almost completely absent from the inflamed skin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that although FuT7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-T reg cells were maintained at normal numbers and could function in the skin-draining LNs and other peripheral tissues, their inability to access the skin itself resulted in dysregulated cutaneous immune responses and severe inflammation selectively at this site.</p><p>The skin is a complex immunological organ that is continuously exposed to antigens from the external environment and its own microbial flora. The consequences of dysregulated cutaneous immune responses can be dire, and include common inflammatory and allergic diseases such as psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, scleroderma, and atopic dermatitis. Our data demonstrate that the constitutive recirculation of T reg cells through the skin is severely impaired in the absence of FuT7, and that blocking T reg cell migration to the skin results in severe tissue-specific inflammatory disease. Thus, we define a prominent role for cutaneous T reg cells in maintaining normal immune homeostasis and tolerance at this site. These results underscore the importance of further defining the signals that direct T reg cell expression of cutaneous homing receptors and promote their migration to the skin, delineating the suppressive mechanisms used by T reg cells to control inflammatory responses in the skin, and understanding the specificity and homeostasis of cutaneous T reg cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p><italic>sf</italic> mice (B6.Cg-<italic>Foxp3<sup>sf</sup></italic>/J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and bred to B6.SJL mice (Taconic Farms) to generate CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> animals.
