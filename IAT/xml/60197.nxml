This gene termed <italic>Sry</italic> (sex determining region of the Y chromosome) encodes a high-mobility-group (HMG) DNA-binding domain containing protein that exhibits sequence-specific binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c2">2</xref>). The name SOX (SRY box containing) has been given for HMG containing proteins sharing &#x0003e;60&#x00025; homology to SRY in the HMG box region. At least 30 members of the SOX family have been so far identified and are expressed in many different cell types and tissues at multiple stages during development throughout the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c4">4</xref>). They are now widely recognized as key players in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of different cell fates.</p><p> The precise function(s) of many SOX proteins is still unknown, although they have been proposed to be transcription factors that bend DNA upon binding to the minor groove of the DNA helix at the consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-(A&#x0002f;T)(A&#x0002f;T)CAA(A&#x0002f;T)G-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c6">6</xref>). Most assigned roles for SOX proteins in development are the result of gene targeting experiments in mouse or positional cloning for described human syndromes. Mutations of human <italic>SOX9</italic> leads to campomelic dysplasia, a bone dysmorphogenesis often associated with male to female sex reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c8">8</xref>). <italic>Sox10</italic> mutation leads to a combination of neural crest defects as observed in the Hirchsprung <italic>Dom</italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c9">9</xref>) or to combined Waardenburg&#x02013;Hirchsprung syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c10">10</xref>). <italic>Sox1</italic> deletion causes microphtalia and cataracts in homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c11">11</xref>), <italic>Sox4</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mutated mice die prematurely because of defects in endocardial ridges and B-lymphocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c12">12</xref>), and mice homozygous for a null mutation of <italic>Sox6</italic> die just after birth from cardiac conduction defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c13">13</xref>).</p><p><italic> Sox</italic> genes were further divided into nine subgroups (A&#x02013;I) based on the degree of homology inside the HMG domain and the presence of conserved motifs outside the HMG box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c14">14</xref>). Subgroup F is thus formed from three closely related SOX proteins, namely SOX7, SOX17 and SOX18. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, SOX17 protein functions as an early endoderm inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c15">15</xref>) and is expressed during spermatogenesis in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c16">16</xref>). Point mutations in <italic>Sox18</italic> underlie cardiovascular and hair follicle defects in <italic>ragged</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c17">17</xref>), whereas <italic>Sox18</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice are viable and display a mild coat defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c18">18</xref>). Although few examples of possible functional redundancy between SOX proteins were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c19">19</xref>), many cell types or tissues express more than one <italic>Sox</italic> gene at any given time.</p><p><italic> Sox7</italic> was first identified in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c21">21</xref>). To gain further insights into the modes of action and function of SOX7, several findings are described in the present study. First, the human <italic>SOX7</italic> open reading frame (ORF) sequence was cloned. <italic>Sox7</italic> expression analyses and chromosomal localisation were carried out in both mouse and human. Moreover, expression studies revealed some overlap with mouse <italic>Sox18</italic> expression. Transactivation studies have revealed the capacity of SOX7 protein to act as a transcriptional activator. Importantly, we also demonstrate, by using transfection experiments in the human kidney 293 cell line, that SOX7 inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the ability of TCF&#x0002f;LEF-&#x003b2;-catenin to transactivate a TCF&#x0002f;LEF-dependent reporter construct, suggesting a role for SOX7 in the modulation of the Wnt signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Human SOX7 ORF sequence and analysis</title><p>PCR was performed on 5 ng of Human Fetal Thymus Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) in a 50 &#x000b5;l reaction using <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Promega).

We then searched for human ESTs in the GenBank database using the human <italic>SOX7</italic> ORF as the query sequence. Three of the obtained ESTs (Genbank accession nos BE531107, BF732608, AA909543) have been sequenced to obtain a full-length ORF sequence. This sequence encodes a 388 amino acid protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f1">1</xref>A), with an HMG box DNA-binding domain spanning residues 44&#x02013;122, including two putative nuclear localisation signals at both ends of the domain. Exon&#x02013;intron boundaries inside the ORF were confirmed by a draft genomic sequence (GA &#x000d7; 4HGKP3TFSM) deposited in the Celera databank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c28">28</xref>).

Using PAC RPCI-21 614A20 as a probe, FISH with 30 metaphase chromosome spreads assigned mouse <italic>Sox7</italic> to chromosome 14 band D (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f1">1</xref>B, a). For human, a total of 30 metaphase spreads were probed using RPCI-11 49I23, and 90&#x00025; of the cells showed specific fluorescent spots on chromosome 8 at position p22 (Fig. 1B, b), a region of shared synteny with mouse chromosome 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c29">29</xref>). In addition, we detected by PCR amplification the presence of the genetic marker STSG29953 in the 3&#x02032;UTR region of human <italic>SOX7</italic> (data not shown), and this agrees with the human FISH analysis. In fact, STSG29953 has been previously mapped between the two microsatellite markers D8S518 and D8S277 located at 6.5 and 8.4 cM distal to the human 8p telomere, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of mouse <italic>Sox7</italic> and human <italic>SOX7</italic> genes</title><p>We examined <italic>Sox7</italic> expression in mouse and human by northern blotting and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation. Previous analyses in the adult mouse have revealed that <italic>Sox7</italic> expression is restricted mainly to oocytes and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c21">21</xref>). However, the spatial and temporal expression pattern of <italic>Sox7</italic> during mouse development has not been so far reported. To gain information on the expression profile of the mouse <italic>Sox7</italic> mRNA, a large panel of total RNAs from fetal and adult mouse tissues were hybridised with the mouse probe A (see Materials and Methods). A major band of &#x0223c;4 kb is detected in all tissues examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f2">2</xref>A). Significant embryonic <italic>Sox7</italic> expression is observed in the lanes from 9.5 until 17.5 d.p.c., with stronger expression in heart and lung. In the adult stage, heart and lung display again the strongest signals while other tissues are weakly positive. For human expression analysis, fetal and adult human tissue northern blots were hybridised with the human probe B. A major transcript of &#x0223c;5 kb is seen in all lanes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f2">2</xref>B), but at markedly variable levels. An additional band at &#x0223c;2.5 kb is detected in the adult colon and, along with a slightly larger transcript, in the fetal lung. These bands could reflect putative splice variants or unspliced messengers.</p><p> A series of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisations to whole-mount mouse embryos from 8 to 11.5 d.p.c. and sections of 17.5 d.p.c. were performed. The 4-somite stage 8 d.p.c. mouse embryo shows expression of Sox7 in the somites and head regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f3">3</xref>A). A remarkable expression of <italic>Sox7</italic> was observed throughout the embryo vasculature at 9.5 d.p.c., and clearly marked in the intersomitic vessels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f3">3</xref>B). At 11.5 d.p.c., <italic>Sox7</italic> expression appears primarily in the intersomitic vessels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f3">3</xref>C). Expressing <italic>Sox7</italic> tissues are not stained with the sense probe (not shown).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f4">4</xref>A, probing of the embryonic and adult northern blots with a mouse <italic>Sox18</italic>-derived probe revealed a major band at &#x0223c;1.6 kb along with a very similar pattern to the one with a <italic>Sox7</italic> probe seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f2">2</xref>A.

Furthermore, co-localisation of both mRNA expressions was tested and confirmed in the intersomitic vessels of 11.5 d.p.c. mouse embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse SOX7 protein harbours a C-terminal transactivation domain</title><p>SOX proteins are characterised by their ability to bind to the DNA sequence motif 5&#x02032;-(A&#x0002f;T)(A&#x0002f;T)CAA(A&#x0002f;T)G-3&#x02032; via their HMG domain. Previous electrophoretic shift assays indicated that the recombinant HMG box of mouse SOX7 binds to the AACAAT sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c21">21</xref>). We therefore tested if SOX7 would be a transcriptional activator or repressor. Transcriptional regulation was examined with mouse SOX7 truncated constructs containing the HMG domain, but lacking different parts of the C-terminal region. The full-length SOX7 plasmid, as well as the various mutants were cloned into the Myc-tagged modified vector pGlomyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c30">30</xref>). Transfection experiments done in COS7 cells revealed that the full-length SOX7 (FLSox7) activates transcription by binding to a consensus DNA binding site present in the reporter plasmid SOXLUC, while mutants with deletions of the C-terminal domain of Sox7 failed to function as transcriptional activators (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f5">5</xref>). Transcription activation domain was thus mapped within the C-terminus of the SOX7 protein. To show that deletions did not exclude SOX7 protein from the cell nucleus, SOX7 subcellular localisation was determined. COS7 cells transfected with the full-length or deleted Sox7 were processed for immunofluorescence using the anti-Myc antibody. Full-length or deleted SOX7 proteins were localised in the cell nucleus (data not shown), confirming as reported for other SOX proteins the presence of nuclear localisation signals within the HMG domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SOX7 protein represses Wnt&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-catenin-stimulated transcription</title><p>Recent data have suggested that different <italic>Xenopus</italic> SOX proteins could block &#x003b2;-catenin&#x0002f;TCF-mediated gene activation by competing with TCF factors for binding to &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c33">33</xref>). We therefore tested if a mammalian SOX protein like SOX7 could also interfere with the Wnt signalling pathway. &#x003b2;-Catenin regulation of TCF activity is commonly measured using the TOPFLASH artificial reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c34">34</xref>) in the human kidney 293 cell line that expresses endogenous TCF factors. It is noteworthy that transfection with SOX7 encoding plasmid alone does not stimulate transcription of the TOPFLASH reporter plasmid (data not shown). 293 cells were therefore cotransfected with the reporter construct TOPFLASH, along with the expression plasmid encoding a mutant form of &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-cateninS33) leading to constitutive activation of &#x003b2;-catenin-TCF target genes, and with increasing plasmid concentrations encoding the full-length SOX7 protein. Transactivation of the luciferase reporter appears clearly to be repressed in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of FLSox7 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke587f6">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Members of the <italic>SOX</italic> gene family are important for many developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c3">3</xref>). However, their functional importance has not been fully determined. In the present work, we have isolated the complete coding sequence of human <italic>SOX7</italic> and compared the encoded protein to the previously described mouse orthologue. The high sequence similarity observed between mouse and human SOX7 proteins suggests conservation of their respective functions. <italic>SOX7</italic>, <italic>SOX18</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic>, which belong to the same F subgroup, have conserved intron positions suggesting that those genes had a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c14">14</xref>).</p><p> Northern experiments in both species revealed the presence of a major transcript in various fetal and adult tissues analysed, although with different intensities. Transcripts were observed in brain, heart, lung, kidney, prostate, colon and spleen. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation analysis shows expression of <italic>Sox7</italic> mRNA, at the 4-somite stage 8 d.p.c., in the somites and head regions. Then, in stages of 9.5 and 11.5 d.p.c., <italic>Sox7</italic> expression was observed in small branching vessels and mainly associated with intersomitic vessels, and later during development at 17.5 d.p.c., expression was clearly detected in brain, cochlea, tongue, lung, liver, cartilage and vertebrae. Human expression tested at only one embryonic stage (8 week-old) gives comparable results with the latest mouse prenatal stage analysed. Intriguingly, expression of <italic>Sox7</italic> in embryonic organs such as liver, lung and heart where epithelio-mesenchymal transitions take place might suggest its possible involvement in this particular process. <italic>Sox7</italic> mRNA was detected in many tissues where <italic>Sox18</italic> gene expression has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c17">17</xref>). Indeed, in mouse, northern blots confirm almost the same expression profiles for <italic>Sox7</italic> and <italic>Sox18</italic> in most tested fetal and adult tissues, and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation shows embryonic expression co-localisation of both genes mainly throughout the embryonic vasculature, but not in the hair follicles (data not shown) where <italic>Sox18</italic> is strongly expressed. Their high sequence homology within the HMG box, and the relative similarity of their embryonic expression profiles suggest that <italic>Sox7</italic> and <italic>Sox18</italic> genes might have some overlapping functions in the corresponding tissues. This observation could support the mild defect recently reported after analysis of <italic>Sox18</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c18">18</xref>). The putative redundancy of different SOX proteins has been previously suggested in other developmental situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c3">3</xref>).</p><p> To date, human <italic>SOX7</italic> sequence has not been released by the human genome project, and its chromosomal localisation was still unknown. Using FISH analysis, we could assign the gene location on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p22) in human and on band D of chromosome 14 in mouse. For its more precise human chromosomal localisation, using the genetic marker STSG29953, we located the gene between D8S518 and D8S277 microsatellite markers within a genomic region containing some candidate genes of diverse syndromes, such as the maternally inherited deafness (OMIM no. 561000) and the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive 1 (OMIM no. 251200). <italic>SOX7</italic> gene is thus added to the short list of genes located in this genomic interval.</p><p> SOX proteins so far analysed can act as either activators or repressors of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c19">19</xref>). We demonstrated that SOX7 protein is a potent activator. This domain falls at the C-terminal end as the transactivation domain of SOX17, another member of the F subgroup implicated in endoderm development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c33">33</xref>), its exact location remains to be further investigated. Transfection experiments performed in 293 cells also showed the ability of SOX7 factor to repress TCF&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-catenin-stimulated transcription. The effect of SOX7 on the Wnt signalling pathway is in agreement with previous observations reported with SOX17.</p><p> Altogether, our data suggest that SOX7 transcription factor could act by using at least two different mechanisms, one involving target gene activation, and another involving regulation of the Wnt pathway by competing with TCF&#x0002f;LEF activity. In fact, different regulatory genes of the Wnt pathway are mutated in primary human cancers and several others promote cancer in experimental rodents. In all these cases, the common&#x000a0;denominator is the activation of gene transcription by TCF&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c35">35</xref>). The capacity of SOX7 to inhibit TCF activity, and its chromosomal localisation on the short arm of chromosome 8, a chromosomal region that includes many described tumour suppressor genes inactivated in carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c36">36</xref>), might suggest the possible role of <italic>SOX7</italic> as a tumour suppressor gene. Since the possible link of SOX proteins to oncogenesis has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke587c38">38</xref>), experiments are under way to test such a hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke587f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Comparison between human and mouse SOX7 protein sequences.
