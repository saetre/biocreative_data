Duf must be expressed, and function, in founder cells (FCs). A fixed number of FCs are chosen from a pool of equivalent myoblasts and serve to attract fusion-competent myoblasts (FCMs) to fuse with them to form a multinucleate muscle-fibre. The spatial and temporal regulation of <italic>duf</italic> expression and function are important and play a deciding role in choice of fibre number, location and perhaps size. We have used a combination of bioinformatics and functional enhancer deletion approaches to understand the regulation of <italic>duf</italic>. By transgenic enhancer-reporter deletion analysis of the <italic>duf</italic> regulatory region, we found that several distinct enhancer modules regulate <italic>duf</italic> expression in specific muscle founders of the embryo and the adult. In addition to existing bioinformatics tools, we used a new program for analysis of regulatory sequence, PhyloGibbs-MP, whose development was largely motivated by the requirements of this work. The results complement our deletion analysis by identifying transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion constructs. Experimental evidence for the relevance of some of these TF binding sites comes from available ChIP-on-chip from the literature, and from our analysis of localization of myogenic transcription factors with <italic>duf</italic> enhancer reporter gene expression. Our results demonstrate the complex regulation in each founder cell of a gene that is expressed in all founder cells. They provide evidence for transcriptional control&#x02014;both activation and repression&#x02014;as an important player in the regulation of myoblast fusion. The set of enhancer constructs generated will be valuable in identifying novel <italic>trans-</italic>acting factor-binding sites and chromatin regulation during myoblast fusion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our results and the bioinformatics tools developed provide a basis for the study of the transcriptional regulation of other complex genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multinucleate muscle fibres form by the regulated fusion of myoblasts. Muscles of different shapes and sizes are made as a result of coordinated myoblast fusion and morphogenesis. This process is perhaps best studied in the embryonic muscles of the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Furlong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). Within myogenic domains, myoblasts are separated into founder cells (FCs) and fusion-competent myoblasts (FCMs) by <italic>Notch (N)</italic> mediated lateral inhibition and other signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Carmena1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Carmena2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. FCs seed the formation of muscles by attracting FCMs to fuse and form multi-nucleate fibres in a defined pattern. The mutual recognition of FCs and FCMs is mediated by a group of transmembrane proteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. One of these, Dumbfounded (Duf, also called Kirre), marks the surface of FCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-RuizGomez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and another, Sticks and stones (Sns) the complementary subset of FCMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Bour1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. When examined by mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization or reporter-gene expression, <italic>sns</italic> and <italic>duf</italic> are expressed transiently in FCs and FCMs respectively and are turned off soon after the fusion process is complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-RuizGomez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Bour1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that <italic>duf</italic> and <italic>sns</italic> are subject to strong transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult and invertebrates, muscles consist of many myotubes bundled together to form a contractile element. <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult muscle precursor cells segregate as sister cells from embryonic founders and give rise to all adult muscles in the pupa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Lawrence1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Anant1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These adult myoblasts maintain <italic>twi</italic> expression, proliferate during larval life and remain associated with imaginal discs in the thorax and neurons in the abdomen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Currie1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Specific myoblast groups are chosen to give rise to different muscles under the influence of signaling molecules and transcription factors. Apterous (Ap) and Cut (Ct) are important for direct flight muscles development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Ghazi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>; Vestigial (Vg) and Cut (Ct), regulated by Wingless (Wg), are responsible for indirect flight muscle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sudarsan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike in the embryo, Notch-mediated lateral inhibition is not involved in founder cell specification during adult thoracic myogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Dutta1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as in the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Carmena3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Halfon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, components of the Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway mediates founder cell choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Dutta2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This results in a precise pattern of founder cells for each multi-fibre array of adult abdominal muscles. Expression of myoblast fusion genes is transient and tightly regulated in adult founder analogs too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Dutta2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The size of the muscle fibre is probably dependent upon the number of fusion events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Taylor1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The duration and level of Duf/Kirre on the FC membrane along with other fusion proteins, especially Rolling pebbles 7 (Rols7; also known as Antisocial), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Menon1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Rau1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> appears to regulate this mechanism. Duf has been shown to be a rate-limiting factor in myoblast fusion during embryonic myogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Menon2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Characterization of enhancer sequences of <italic>duf</italic> is therefore important to understand the transcriptional machinery that recognizes a FC. This will also allow us to understand the role of different factors responsible for transcriptional control of <italic>duf</italic> in different FCs and thereby development of muscle pattern.</p><p>Bioinformatics tools can predict possible transcription factor (TF) binding sites, either by comparing with previously identified sites for known TFs, or <italic>ab initio</italic> by looking for short inexact repeated patterns or &#x0201c;motifs&#x0201d;. Enhancers and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules can be predicted by clustering predicted binding sites, an approach taken by programs such as Stubb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, eCis-Analyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Berman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Berman2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and Cluster-Buster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Frith1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, with the availability of sequence information from related species including twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Clark1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, new approaches have been developed to make use of orthologous sequence from related species to specific region of interest. A simple approach is &#x0201c;phylogenetic footprinting&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Blanchette1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Blanchette2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Lenhard1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, which confines searches to sequences that are highly conserved across species, using the assumption that such regions are more likely to be functional. However, it is also known that gene regulation evolves significantly even among closely related species, and binding sites that are known to be functional in one species disappear or are replaced by new sites in other species (for example see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Ludwig1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, some newer programs, including PhyloGibbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Siddharthan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> (a motif-finder) and Stubb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> (a module-prediction program), both of which we have used in this study, analyse both conserved and non-conserved sequences but modify scoring to take into account phylogenetic relationship between species. However, these approaches cannot by themselves give a sense of the temporal or spatial aspects of gene regulation. To be effective, they must be combined with prior experimental information about the transcriptional regulation and spatio- temporal expression pattern of the genes of interest. For example, a recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Segal1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> study made use of known spatio- temporal concentrations of transcription factors to predict the expression levels of cis-regulatory modules in the segmentation network. Unfortunately such prior data is a luxury often unavailable.</p><p>We have used a combination of bioinformatics and functional enhancer deletion approaches to understand the regulation of <italic>duf</italic>. In addition to existing bioinformatics tools, we used a new program for analysis of regulatory sequence, PhyloGibbs-MP, described in a recent paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Siddharthan2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, whose development was largely motivated by the requirements of this work. Studies with Stubb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> using published consensus sequences for mesoderm relevant factors found evidence of a modular structure of enhancers both upstream of the gene and in its intron. Deletion analysis of the <italic>duf</italic> regulatory region using reporter constructs reveals specific aspects of <italic>duf</italic> regulation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> myogenesis. We find that several distinct enhancer modules regulate <italic>duf</italic> expression in specific muscle founders of the embryo and the adult. While embryonic enhancers are proximal, adult-specific enhancers are located more distal to the <italic>duf</italic> start site. These results merited a further, detailed study of the 10 kb region upstream of <italic>duf</italic>. We made a list of 44 position weight matrices for transcription factors relevant to mesoderm development, of which 38 were constructed using either the FlyReg database for DNAse I footprints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Bergman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> or recent data from bacteria-one-hybrid systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Noyes1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and 6 were taken from the literature. We rejected 13 as not being specific enough or not showing significant predictions in preliminary runs. We used the remaining 31 matrices with two programs, Stubb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sinha2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and PhyloGibbs-MP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Siddharthan2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, to predict <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules as well as binding sites for individual transcription factors. The results complement our deletion analysis by identifying transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion constructs. Most predicted sites are conserved in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, suggesting functional importance. Experimental evidence for the relevance of some of these TF binding sites comes from both specific and global ChIP-on-chip analysis from the literature, using key mesodermal regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sandmann1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Sandmann2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Zeitlinger1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Though bioinformatic predictive tools and ChIP-on-chip approaches are unable, by themselves, to predict the full spatio-temporal behaviour of gene regulation, we demonstrate their utility when combined with our experimental information. Given the many conserved aspects of myogenic regulation between flies and vertebrates, recently underscored by the demonstration of the role of kirre in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Srinivas1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, our results are likely to be of broad value.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of <italic>duf</italic> Enhancer Region</title><p>Preliminary studies of the 40 kb region upstream of <italic>duf</italic> and of the first intron (29 kb) were made using Matinspector Professional&#x000ae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Quandt1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

At stage 14, expression is clearly seen in the circular visceral muscles in a ribbon-like arrangement following fusion with neighboring FCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006960-g002">Figure 2H&#x02013;I&#x02032;</xref>, ).

From this expression analysis it is clear that elements in the 10 kb region 5&#x02032; of <italic>duf</italic> are capable of driving reporter expression in different subsets of muscle FCs. This also indicates that there are independent modules for <italic>duf</italic> expression in different muscles. These modules are not noticeably overlapping, eliciting expression in a different subset of muscles with every addition of a few hundred base-pairs of the enhancer. Each additional fragment in the 5&#x02032; represses the expression seen in a smaller proximal fragment and directs expression in different domains of <italic>duf</italic> expression. All the necessary elements for this complex spatio-temporal regulation of <italic>duf</italic> expression in all embryonic muscle FCs appears to be located in the 10 kb region 5&#x02032; of <italic>duf</italic> coding region.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Duf Enhancer Modules Mark Different Subsets of Embryonic Muscle Founder Cells</title><p>The expression pattern seen with <italic>duf</italic> upstream-lacZ reporters appears to be in specific subsets of FCs in different constructs.

We showed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006960-Siddharthan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> that these significance estimates are reliable in synthetic data, and given some reasonable assumptions on gene regulation in yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) and the state of present experimental knowledge, the significance estimates are probably very accurate in experimental systems too.</p><p>PhyloGibbs-MP is an update to PhyloGibbs, which, among other new features, has the ability to localise predictions to small regions with a specified size and average spacing, meant to represent CRMs. Its predictions of CRMs here mainly agree with Stubb&#x02032;s. However, its main task is to predict binding sites, either <italic>ab initio</italic> or with the help of &#x0201c;informative priors&#x0201d; such as our 31 mesoderm-relevant position weight matrices. While Stubb uses PWMs directly to predict sites, PhyloGibbs-MP seeks sites that are similar to one another, and only uses the PWMs to bias the search (in the form of a Bayesian prior). Thus, predictions differ between the two programs: PhyloGibbs-MP will fare poorly when only very few copies of a site are present, but will pick up more numerous sites even if they correspond relatively poorly to the known PWMs, or do not correspond to the supplied PWMs at all. It will, however, report a match to a known PWM only if the match is significant, that is, the PWM generated by the PhyloGibbs-MP alignment corresponds sufficiently closely with the prior PWM.</p><p>We ran PhyloGibbs-MP in module-prediction mode (specifying that about half the input sequence is expected to be functional) on the 30 kb upstream of <italic>duf</italic>, and also on the intron, and found a similar modular structure as with Stubb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006960-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The figure shows free energies for Stubb, and predictions of individual binding sites for PhyloGibbs-MP. The binding sites predicted by PhyloGibbs-MP generally cluster within the peaks of the free energy calculated by Stubb. We did additional PhyloGibbs-MP runs on the first 11 kb upstream of <italic>duf</italic>, specifying that all of this region is expected to be functional, and also specifying two possible widths of binding site motifs (9 bp and 12 bp). We find predicted binding sites for several key factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006960-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Predictions for the second set of homeo domain factors with some relevance to mesoderm development are shown in Supplementary data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006960.s009">Figure S6</xref>. By and large the above predictions agree with those from Stubb, which was run using the same weight matrices, and match several published consensus sites (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006960.s003">Datasheet S3</xref>). Differences in predictions are expected because Stubb reports matches to a prior factor, but does not consider the similarity of different matches to one another; whereas PhyloGibbs-MP reports conserved motifs, scored on the similarity to one another of different sites associated with each motif, and gives secondary importance to a match with a prior PWM. Nevertheless, the two programs make largely similar predictions. If we consider predictions in the key sequence window 11 kb upstream of <italic>duf</italic>, of 179 site predictions made by PhyloGibbs-MP with a significance of 0.1 or more, 138 share a 4 bp or better overlap with predictions made by Stubb (with a significance of 0.1 or more). (Stubb makes many more predictions at a given significance, however.) While some factors have sites scattered throughout the enhancer, others appear to be localised to certain regions of the enhancer. Most significant predictions by Stubb and Phylogibbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006960-g006">Figure 6</xref>) are in good concordance with the observed expression data of the <italic>duf</italic> enhancers: some such examples are discussed below.</p><fig id="pone-0006960-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006960.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>PhyloGibbs-MP and Stubb results for 11 kb <italic>duf</italic> upstream.</title><p>Predictions of individual binding sites, for various factors of interest, from Stubb and PhyloGibbs-MP along with different <italic>duf</italic> enhancer reporter deletion constructs. Stubb predicts a binding affinity of a known factor using its previously characterised position weight matrix, while PhyloGibbs-MP predicts sites that are similar to one another, but allows its search to be biased via &#x0201c;informative prior&#x0201d; weight matrices. For both programs, position weight matrices for 31 mesoderm-relevant factors, as discussed in the text, were used as priors. These are shown in the left column of sequence logos, marked &#x0201c;Prior WM&#x0201d;. PhyloGibbs-MP in addition reports a posterior WM for all motifs it finds, which is a base-count of all sites reported in each motif, weighted by their significance. Sequence logos for these are in the right column, &#x0201c;Posterior WM&#x0201d;. Stubb reports no posterior WM. PhyloGibbs-MP&#x02032;s posterior WMs are, in general, similar to the prior WMs, at least in their core features. Moreover, several positions in each PWM have high information scores, indicating a high degree of similarity among the predicted sites. These two facts encourage confidence in the quality of PhyloGibbs-MP&#x02032;s site predictions as well as in the associations with the prior WMs. Nevertheless, as with any bioinformatics program, some false positives are expected, and several genuine sites may have been missed.

Sequence preparation was as described above, but PhyloGibbs-MP was run treating all of the sequence as potentially regulatory (the specified &#x0201c;module dimension&#x0201d; being the entire length of the sequence). Also, after preliminary runs revealed poor or non-specific predictions for many factors, the list of input factors was trimmed to the following: bin, byn, E(spl), toy, kni, shn1, shn2, STAT, Ci, dmef, brk, dl, Mad, pan, Su(H), twi, Cf2-II, Eip74EF, exd, Kr, Med, prd, sd, Trl, Pnt, Abd-B group, Antp group, Ap group, Bcd group, Ladybird group, NK2 group. These were separated into two groups, one with consensus motifs 8 bp long or shorter, and the other with longer consensus motifs, because PhyloGibbs-MP cannot handle differing lengths of motifs and, while robust to small variations, will show inferior performance with highly varying motif sizes.
