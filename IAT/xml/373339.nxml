Inhibitors have now been developed which prevent PARP-1 from synthesizing poly(ADP-ribose) in response to DNA-breaks and potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA damaging agents. However, with the recent discoveries of PARP-2, which has a similar DNA-damage dependent catalytic activity, and additional members containing the &#x02018;PARP catalytic&#x02019; signature, the isoform selectivity and resultant pharmacological effects of existing inhibitors are brought into question. We present here the crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of murine PARP-2, at 2.8 &#x0212b; resolution, and compare this to the catalytic fragment of PARP-1, with an emphasis on providing a possible framework for rational drug design in order to develop future isoform-specific inhibitors.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9c3b380.0x9ad5820" notes-type="data_link"><p>PDB no. 1GS0</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c3">3</xref>) is one member of a growing family (18 proteins to date) related by a highly conserved catalytic fragment (CF) (J.-C.Am&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>., submitted), capable of synthesizing polymers of ADP-ribose, utilizing NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as a substrate. Characterized family members currently include the proteins PARP-1, PARP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c4">4</xref>), Tankyrase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c5">5</xref>), Tankyrase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c7">7</xref>), TiPARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c8">8</xref>) and vPARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c9">9</xref>). To date, the only proteins of this family known to generate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) as a direct response to DNA breaks are PARP-1 and -2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>). These proteins bind directly to single-strand DNA breaks (PARP-1) or gaps (PARP-1 and -2) and as such are enzymatically hyper-activated (&#x0223c;500-fold over basal levels for PARP-1); the ADP-ribose moiety of bound NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is then transferred to specific acceptor proteins, and to PARP-1 and -2 themselves via an auto-modification reaction. With successive enzymatic rounds, this initial post-translational modification can be extended to yield long, branched, polymeric chains of ADP-ribose &#x0005b;reviewed in de Murcia and Shall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c11">11</xref>) and Murkle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c12">12</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>Given that all currently identified PAR acceptors are DNA-binding proteins, and that PAR itself has considerable chemical and biophysical similarity to nucleic acids, PAR covalently attached to a DNA-binding protein could compete for the DNA-binding site on the modified protein and displace it from DNA, allowing DNA repair proteins access to the DNA break. Known polymer acceptors include histones (mainly H1 and H2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c13">13</xref>), DNA topoisomerases I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c14">14</xref>), DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c15">15</xref>), p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c16">16</xref>) and XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c17">17</xref>). Immunoprecipitation and co-purification experiments have demonstrated that both PARP-1 and PARP-2 are directly associated with a short-patch base excision repair (BER) complex, comprising the proteins XRCC1, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; and DNA Ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c20">20</xref>). Moreover, the importance of both PARP-1 and -2 in BER and single-strand break repair (SSBR) has been supported by a wide range of experimental data; knock-out mice deficient in either protein, show hypersensitivity to both alkylating agents and &#x003b3;-irradiation (both strong inducers of SSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c22">22</xref>), and repair of alkylated bases in cell lines derived from these mice, shows a significant delay or defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c24">24</xref>). Additional evidence to support a role for the PARPs in BER and SSBR, arises from the observation that short oligomeric lengths of ADP-ribose, attached to PARP-1 or -2, are necessary for either the recruitment or enhanced binding of BER/SSBR associated protein partners, principally XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c25">25</xref>). Further more, in living cells, PAR production in the vicinity of localized DNA strand breaks has recently been shown to be essential for the rapid recruitment of XRCC1 to the damage sites &#x0005b;Okano <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c26">26</xref>) and J.-C.Am&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>., submitted&#x0005d;.</p><p>Because it is implicated in the resolution of DNA breaks, PARP-1 has attracted a great deal of attention as a therapeutic drug target in the treatment of cancer. A number of methodologies have been proposed; including the use of PARP-1 inhibitors to obstruct DNA repair, thus increasing the cytotoxicity of certain anticancer agents (both in chemo- and radiotherapies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c28">28</xref>). It has also been selected as a target for medical conditions involving oxidant-mediated cell death, such as ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, neurodegenerative disorders and endotoxic shock, due to its involvement in other cellular pathways that are not discussed here &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c30">30</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>Until relatively recently, PARP-1 was believed to be responsible for all the DNA-damage dependent PAR synthesis in mammalian cells. However, a second DNA-damage dependent activity, PARP-2, was subsequently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c1">1</xref>). Like PARP-1, PARP-2 interacts with components of the BER and single-strand gap-repair pathways, and can probably function as both a homo- and heterodimer with PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>). PARP-2 lacks the N-terminal tandem zinc fingers and BRCT domain of PARP-1, which are replaced by a small highly basic N-terminal DNA-binding domain, with the E domain acting both as a dimerization and automodification domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>), but shares the C-terminal catalytic domain, which is the unifying feature of the wider PARP family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f1">1</xref>). The identification of 18 PARPs in mammalian cells potentially complicates the development of inhibitors intended to achieve targeted pharmacological effects. With this in mind, we have now determined the crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of murine PARP-2 (PARP-2-CF) at 2.8 &#x0212b; resolution. Comparison with the known structure of chicken PARP-1-CF provides a rational framework for the future development of type-specific PARP inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification</title><p>Full-length recombinant murine PARP-2 (PARP-2-FL) was expressed in insect cells (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, Sf9).

Partially purified protein was eluted with PBS A &#x0002b; 450 mM NaCl.

This was then applied to an ECH-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia)/3-aminobenzamide coupled affinity column. The column was washed with a linear salt gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, and bound protein eluted with 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 400 mM NaCl, 3 mM 3-methoxybenzamide, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA.

After washing, crystals were pooled, then dissolved in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and analysed on a 12.5&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel. Crystallized material corresponded to a polypeptide migrating with an apparent molecular mass of &#x02248;50 kDa, indicating that a proteolytic or break-down product had crystallized, rather than the full-length protein. N-terminal sequencing and mass-spectrometry confirmed the crystalline protein as a C-terminal fragment (residues 209&#x02013;557). On the basis of this, the asymmetric unit was expected to contain two molecules with a solvent content of 61&#x00025; (v/v).</p></sec><sec><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>The structure of the crystallized fragment of murine PARP-2 was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c33">33</xref>).

In crystallization trials, crystals took extended periods of time to appear, in some cases up to 6 months from the date of experimental set-up. Despite full-length protein being used, slow proteolysis during the time course of the experiment produced a stable fragment of &#x02248;50 kDa (as judged by SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis) which crystallized.</p><p>N-terminal sequencing and western blots identified the crystalline protein as a C-terminal fragment (residues 194&#x02013;559) encapsulating the catalytic function of the protein, but lacking the putative 7 kDa DNA-binding domain and 16 kDa dimerization domains. The structure of this PARP-2 catalytic fragment (PARP-2-CF) was determined by molecular replacement with the structure of chicken PARP-1-CF (PDB: 2PAW), and refined at 2.8 &#x0212b; (see Materials and Methods). Two molecules of PARP-2-CF are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Clear electron density corresponding to residues 209&#x02013;557 of the full-length protein can be seen for both molecules, apart from the loops comprised of residues 325&#x02013;330 which appear to be poorly ordered in these crystals.</p><sec><title>PARP-2-CF structure</title><p>The PARP-2-CF structure consists of two main parts: an &#x003b1;-helical N-terminal domain comprising residues 207&#x02013;324, and a mixed &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; C-terminal domain (residues 332&#x02013;557) containing the catalytic glutamate residue (Glu534) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f2">2</xref>).

Although structures of PARP-2 in complex with inhibitors are not yet available, the overall similarity of the PARP-1 and PARP-2 CFs allows a detailed comparison between the ligand binding sites, which will have excellent predictive power for the future design of isoform-specific PARP inhibitors.</p><p>PARP-1 and PARP-2 are able to catalyze three related but distinct reactions in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is transferred to one of three different acceptor groups, which in ordered combination generate PAR-modified proteins. &#x02018;Initiation&#x02019; involves transfer to the carboxylate group of a glutamic acid side chain on the modified protein, while subsequent &#x02018;elongation&#x02019; and &#x02018;branching&#x02019; reactions transfer ADP-ribose to the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl of the adenine or nicotinamide ribose of an already attached ADP-ribose chain. The sequential nature of the reaction therefore requires adjacent binding sites for the &#x02018;acceptor&#x02019; terminal ADP-ribose of the existing poly- or oligo-ADP-ribose chain, and for the &#x02018;donor&#x02019; NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ligand that will provide the ADP-ribose to be added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-2 acceptor site</title><p>To analyse interactions in the PARP-2 acceptor site, we modelled ADP into the crystal structure of PARP-2-CF by superimposing the crystal structure of the PARP-1-CF complex with carba-NAD (PDB: 1A26), as it has been demonstrated previously that the ADP moiety of this ligand delineates the binding site of a poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c39">39</xref>). All amino acid residues involved in the coordination of the ADP-moiety are conserved in PARP-2-CF, both in their identity and in their spatial arrangement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>b). The pyrophosphate backbone can be bound through the formation of hydrogen bonds to the N&#x003b5;2 atom of His370 (826: numbers in brackets indicate the topologically equivalent residue in PARP-1), the &#x003b6;-amino group of Lys445 (903) and the backbone amides of residues 531 and 532 (985 and 986). In addition, the hydroxyl groups of the ribose sugar can hydrogen-bond to Tyr449 (907) and to the catalytic residue Glu534 (988), with the adenine moiety packed against the side-chain of Met432 (890).</p><p>The local environment of the acceptor site in PARP-2-CF is modified compared to PARP-1 however, due to a three-amino acid insertion in the loop connecting &#x003b2;-strands <italic>k</italic> and <italic>l</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>a). Comparison of this loop in the two PARP structures identifies PARP-2 residues Leu523 and Leu530 as topologically equivalent to residues Asn980 and Leu984 of PARP-1, but with the additional PARP-2 residues 524-Asn-Pro-Glu-Gly-Tyr-Thr-530 forming a six-residue excursion from the backbone path observed in PARP-1-CF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>b). Within the longer PARP-2 loop, the side chain phenyl of Tyr528 (which has no equivalent in PARP-1) points directly into the acceptor site, with the hydroxyl group in a position to hydrogen-bond to the N&#x003b4;2 of Asn531 and/or to interact with the pyrophosphate backbone of bound PAR. Although the loop is well-ordered in the crystals, it has different conformations in the two crystallographically independent molecules in the crystal structure, with the peptide bond preceding Pro525 in a <italic>trans</italic> conformation in one and <italic>cis</italic> in the other. As well as providing the binding site for the terminal ADP-ribose of an existing chain in elongation and branching reactions, this site must also furnish interactions to position the glutamate and adjacent polypeptide chain of a protein acceptor in the initiation reaction. The nature of these interactions, which may afford some degree of protein substrate specificity for ADP-ribosylation, are unknown in both PARP-1 and -2.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-2 donor site</title><p>In the absence of an experimental structure for NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> bound to PARP-1 or PARP-2, we have modelled the binding of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the donor site of the PARP-2-CF molecule, on the basis of the structure of the NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-bound diphtheria toxin (a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase) (PDB: 1TOX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c40">40</xref>) as previously described for PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c41">41</xref>). As with the acceptor site, most of the residues involved in coordinating NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> within the donor site are conserved in PARP-1 and PARP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c41">41</xref>). The 2&#x02032; hydroxyl residue of the donor ribose group makes a hydrogen bond with the side-chain carboxyl of the catalytic residue Glu534 (988). This interaction positions the C1&#x02032;<sub>N</sub> for nucleophilic attack by the 2&#x02032; hydroxyl of the acceptor ribose group. Additional conserved hydrogen bonding interactions serve to position the donor NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> molecule: the backbone oxygen of Gly418 (876) to N6<sub>A</sub>, Asp315-O&#x003b4;2 (770) to N7<sub>A</sub>, the backbone nitrogen of Arg420 (878) to N1<sub>A</sub>, Ser406-O&#x003b3; (864) to O2&#x02032;<sub>A</sub>, the backbone oxygen of Gly405 (863) to N7<sub>N</sub>, the backbone nitrogen of Gly405 to O7<sub>N</sub>, Ser446-O&#x003b3; (904) to O7<sub>N</sub>, and Tyr449-OH (907) to O4&#x02032;<sub>N</sub>. The only difference between PARP-1 and PARP-2 in donor site interactions, is the replacement of Gln763 in PARP-1, with a lysine (308) in PARP-2. Gln763 hydrogen bonds to the pyrophosphate moiety of the donor site NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> via its side-chain amide group, but this interaction could be fully recapitulated by the N&#x003b5; of Lys308.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP inhibitor interactions</title><p>A large number of PARP-1 enzymatic inhibitors have been developed, the majority of which mimic to some degree the nicotinamide moiety of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and bind to the donor site of the protein. The residues in the donor site of PARP-1 that provide hydrogen-bonding interactions with these inhibitors, are completely conserved in PARP-2. Hydrogen bonds can be formed between Gly405-N (863), Gly405-O (863) and Ser446-O&#x003b3; (904) and an inhibitor&#x02019;s amide or lactame group with additional, non-polar interactions with Tyr438 (896) and/or Tyr449 (907). Additional inhibitor specificity has been correlated with the formation of additional hydrogen bonds either to the catalytic glutamate, Glu534 (988), or to the hydroxyl group of Tyr449 (907). Superimposition of known PARP-1/inhibitor complexes &#x0005b;PDB: 1EFY, 1PAX, 2PAX, 3PAX and 4PAX; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c42">42</xref>)&#x0005d; onto the PARP-2-CF structure, shows that the binding environment in both PARPs is virtually identical, suggesting that these existing PARP-1 inhibitors would show little discrimination between PARP-1 and PARP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>e). However, the position of 2-(3&#x02032;-methoxyphenyl) benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (BZC; PDB: 1EFY) within the donor site suggests that selectivity for (or against) PARP-2 inhibition could be introduced by inhibitor groups designed to interact with the positively charged terminal amino group of Lys308, which replaces the polar side chain of Gln763 found at this position in PARP-1. A second possible source of selectivity results from the displacement in PARP-2, relative to PARP1, of the top of helix F towards the catalytic site. In all the currently available PARP-1 structures (both in the presence or absence of bound inhibitors/substrates), helix F is presented in the same conformation&#x02014;with no movement of the helix either towards or away from the catalytic site. However, this helix is displaced in PARP-2 due to the replacement of the buried side-chain of Tyr757 in PARP-1, by the exposed side-chain of Glu302 in PARP-2, which presents the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser304 towards the donor site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh215f5">5</xref>d). Additional iso-form specificity could also be introduced by production of inhibitors that could simultaneously occupy both the donor and acceptor sites of the protein, providing hydrogen-bonding access to Tyr528; the most apparent difference between the two CFs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Of the 18 PARP activities identified in mammalian cells so far, only PARP-1 and PARP-2 are activated by the presence of interruptions in the DNA, and thereby are implicated in DNA damage repair. Consistent with this, both PARP-1 and -2 interact with the enzymes involved in small-patch gap repair (DNA polymerase &#x003b2; and DNA ligase III) and the associated XRCC1 scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c10">10</xref>). In addition, PARP-1 and -2 can both homo- and heterodimerize <italic>in vitro</italic> and reciprocally trans-ADP-ribosylate each other, suggesting that they may function as a unit <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c43">43</xref>). PARP-1 and PARP-2 may have redundant functions which are nonetheless essential for viability, as mice embryos homozygously defective in both genes (PARP-1 &#x02013;/&#x02013;, PARP-2 &#x02013;/&#x02013;) die with the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c43">43</xref>).</p><p>The overall three-dimensional structure of the CF of PARP-2 is very similar to that of PARP-1, but with some differences in the vicinity of the acceptor site, which could reflect differences in the substrate proteins ADP-ribosylated by the two enzymes, and may ultimately provide the means for engineering differential specificity into PARP-inhibitors targeted at DNA repair pathways. Development of isoform-specific inhibitors would also provide a method for dissecting and elucidating the precise cellular roles for each PARP protein. Some putative PARP-2 selective inhibitors have already been identified in yeast-growth inhibition studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh215c44">44</xref>), but co-crystal structures would be necessary to provide the necessary details of the drug&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>The most significant structural difference between the two enzymes occurs N-terminal of the common &#x02018;E&#x02019; domain and CF, where the large zinc finger DNA-binding domain (DBD) is replaced by a highly basic 64-residue DBD in PARP-2. Although able to bind DNA in isolation from the rest of the protein, the PARP-2-DBD does not have a folded structure in solution, indicated by Circular Dichroism and 1D-NMR spectroscopy experiments which both showed spectra characteristic of an unstructured polypeptide (our unpublished observations). The structural nature of the interaction of PARP-1 and PARP-2 DBDs with DNA has yet to be defined.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh215f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic representation of the functional domains of chicken PARP-1 and mouse PARP-2.

The extended loop unique to PARP-2 is clearly visible, consisting of residues Leu523&#x02013;Thr529.

(<bold>d</bold>) Helix F in PARP-2 is displaced towards the donor site. In comparison to PARP-1, the top of helix F in PARP-2 is displaced towards the donor site of the molecule.

(<bold>e</bold>) PARP inhibitors bound to the donor site. PARP inhibitors (for which the structures of complexes with PARP-1 are available) are shown bound to the donor site of PARP-2.
