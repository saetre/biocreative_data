The first precursor generation occurs in the extra-embryonic compartment, where the yolk sac (YS) blood islands produce erythro-myeloid-restricted precursors, from 7.5 days post-coitus (dpc). The second generation of hematopoietic precursors takes place, from 8.5 to 11.5 dpc, in the region comprising the Aorta and underlying mesenchyme, which is referred to first as para-aortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp: 8.5&#x02013;10 dpc), then as aorta-gonads-mesonephros region (AGM: 10&#x02013;11.5 dpc). The P-Sp/AGM produces hematopoietic precursors endowed with the multilineage differentiation potential and long term reconstitution (LTR) capacity that characterise Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC). The P-Sp/AGM prospective territory, the caudal intra-embryonic splanchnopleura (Sp: before 8.5 dpc) does not harbour a hematopoietic potential when cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>on OP9 stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Yet, when the early Sp is cultured <italic>in toto </italic>for a few days, it now produces hematopoietic precursors, which harbour a multilineage differentiation potential as well as LTR capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As the Sp are explanted before the establishment of vascular connection with the extra-embryonic vascular network, which occurs at the 4&#x02013;5 somite-stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], this observation shows that the intra-embryonic site is capable of autonomously generating HSC. In contrast, the progeny of similarly treated YS lacks both multipotentiality (they are unable to generate lymphoid cells) and LTR activity (they only provide short term erythro-myeloid reconstitution of irradiated recipients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of gene function during the successive steps leading to the emergence, in the YS, of hematopoietic precursors with limited differentiation and self-renewal potentials, by comparison to the events occurring in the intra-embryonic hemogenic site, constitutes a major issue for understanding the process leading to HSC generation. Indeed, the inability of extra-embryonic precursors to provide a lymphoid progeny and to maintain in the long term might result from a divergence in the pathways leading from mesodermal cells to a committed hematopoietic progeny. This divergence may be (potentially) reflected by differential gene expression at the time of hematopoietic induction in both hemogenic sites. We aim to assess whether genes differentially expressed in the extra- and intra-embryonic hemogenic sites do indeed play a role in the distinct potentials displayed by extra- and intra-embryonic precursors through the forced expression in the YS of genes only expressed in the intra-embryonic Sp.</p><p>Most of the investigations aimed to characterize hematopoietic development pathways in the mouse YS involve the analysis of either genetically engineered mice strains or <italic>in vitro </italic>differentiation potential of modified ES cells, which may be efficiently transduced by "classical" electroporation procedure or retroviral transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We here describe and test an alternative approach that might help to decipher early steps of developmental hematopoiesis, by directly targeting YS cells. Moreover, to be able to separate potential effects on the emergence of native hematopoietic precursors from the blood islands mesoderm from effects on further differentiation and maintenance of these precursors, we designed and compared two independent protocols. The first, aimed to transiently transduce early blood islands mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic cells involves <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation, followed by an organ culture step prior to hematopoietic development investigations. The second, designed to target YS-hematopoietic precursors at later stages is based on retroviral transduction.</p><p>Embryo transduction through <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], initially used mainly to analyse avian nervous system development, is now frequently used to study early stages of mouse ontogeny. This approach allows the introduction of transgenes into embryonic tissues explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or into cells of the gastrulating mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to follow cell fate, cell migration and lineage differentiation. We show here that this technique, which permits a controlled spatio-temporal delivery of transgenes and is compatible with the maintenance of transduced cells in their "natural" environment, is appropriate to analyze YS-blood islands mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Retroviral transduction also constitutes an efficient approach to transfer cDNA into hematopoietic cells as well as HSC. Although efficiently used to transduce ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], it has yet been rarely used to transduce cells from early embryos. To our knowledge, it has only been used once to target 8 dpc YS hematopoietic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study, hematopoietic precursors were shown to acquire long-term multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated recipients upon stable HoxB4 expression. However, the extent of efficiency and versatility of this method on YS cells was not reported. Here, it is shown that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer is inefficient to transduce YS mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors, but is a powerful method to genetically modify hematopoietic precursors from YS at later stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A-Gene transfer into early precursors from 7 dpc YS-blood islands</title><sec><title>I-Determination of suitable stages for mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic cell targeting</title><p>To precisely identify the stage when blood islands are enriched in immature mesodermal or pre-hematopoietic cells, we used lmo2 mRNA expression as a marker of immature blood islands precursors. Indeed, the LIM-zinc finger transcriptional co-regulator lmo2 is required for the generation of hematopoietic precursors of both extra- and intra-embryonic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Lmo2 is expressed in the extra-embryonic mesoderm that gives rise to hematopoietic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but also by their erythroid progeny. The differentiation of blood islands mesoderm into mature erythroid cells occurs extremely fast. We thus used &#x003b2;-H1 mRNA expression, as the earliest marker of differentiating erythroid cells, namely primitive erythroblasts. We compared the temporal evolution of the expression of both markers, during early blood islands formation (7.25 to 8 dpc), to select the time window when lmo2 is expressed and &#x003b2;-H1 not yet/poorly expressed.</p><p>Lmo2 transcripts are first detected at the OB stage in the whole extra-embryonic mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and are subsequently restricted, at the EB stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), to a subset of mesodermal cells, which might correspond to blood islands precursors. Upon proliferation of these precursors, lmo2 expression expends to encompass all hematopoietic derivatives of the blood islands, from the LB to LHF stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of the development stages enriched in immature precursors</bold>. Upper panel: Temporal evolution of lmo2 expression from the OB to LHF stages: initially expressed by most extra-embryonic mesodermal cells (A), lmo2 expression rapidly restricts to a smaller cell number at the EB stage (B).

Middle panel: Transcripts of the embryonic globin &#x003b2;-H1 are present in a minute cell number at the OB/EB stages (E, F).

The number of cell clusters expressing &#x003b2;-H1 gradually increases, leading to the formation, at the LB stage, of a ring which expression overlaps that of lmo2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref>). During the following stages (EHF/LHF), this correlation of lmo2 and &#x003b2;-H1 expression is maintained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). The correlation of these two expression patterns strongly suggest that mesodermal and/or pre-hematopoietic precursors are enriched in the OB to EB YS blood islands, even if mesodermal cells and native hematopoietic precursors may be still present in the blood islands at later stages. Targeting mesodermal cells was thus conducted at the OB to EB stages of development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> Lower panel).</p></sec><sec><title>II-Developmental constraints imposed on the choice of methodology</title><p>At these developmental stages, the determination and further proliferation/differentiation of hematopoietic precursors strictly depend on endoderm/mesoderm interaction. This implies that a method allowing the maintenance of tissue structure during transduction will be required for suitable development of a hematopoietic progeny from transduced cells. Accordingly, when we nevertheless tested the feasibility of dissociated cells transduction at the OB-EB stages using lipofection (using ExGen500) or retroviral transduction (see paragraph B2), we found that, in both instance, the transduction levels were naught, and cell viability drastically affected (Data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>III-Viral-mediated transduction and in situ electroporation of 7dpc YS-blood islands</title><p>Given these constraints, two alternative approaches could be undertaken to transfer genes into the YS while keeping its tri-dimensional structure, viral-mediated transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation.

OB-EB YS-explants were cultured in medium containing viral particles for 24 hours (for the method, see B). Explants were subsequently cultured in fresh medium for two days before assessing GFP levels and hematopoietic cell production. At the outset of the organ culture step, the morphology of transduced YS appeared affected by the process. Cytometry analysis of these YS explants showed that only 0.1% of viable cells expressed GFP.

A capillary, back-filled with 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l <italic>peGFP-C1 </italic>plasmid DNA solution is inserted into the YS cavity from the node region and through the amnios. Fast Green (0.01%) is added to the solution to visualise construct delivery. This injection mode, designed to limit plasmid release from the YS cavity, leads to the collapse of the amnion towards the ectoplacental cavity. Upon mouth driven-release of the plasmid, the amnion returns to its former position and an accurate injection can thus be visualized by the fast green filling of the YS cavity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Plasmid injection protocol</bold>.

In these conditions, the initial efficiency of transduction is reproducible and quantitatively high (60&#x02013;70% GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells).

Thus, dissociated OrgD1-YS cells were exposed to the retroviral supernatant with the same MOI and cultured as described above. Under these conditions, transduction efficiency is also highly reproducible, but lower (25&#x02013;30%) than in the former conditions. However, in sharp contrast with the former conditions, the absolute number of GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells increases between 4 and 8 days post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Moreover, the percentage of GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells also increases during the culture to reach a maximum (50&#x02013;60%) at day 4 post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Since about 15&#x02013;20% of GFP-negative cells sorted at day 1 post-infection are shown to acquire GFP expression over the following days in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), the increase in GFP<sup>+ </sup>population between day 1 and day 4 post-infection may result, at least in part, from <italic>de novo </italic>GFP expression. Interestingly, when observed in semi-solid culture, the colonies appear as entirely composed of strongly GFP positive cells, which indicates that the whole progeny of transduced hematopoietic precursors keeps the expression of the transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

The persistence of GFP expressing cells, when transduced cells derive from OrgD1-YS, thus reflects that the organ culture step indeed improves the targeting of immature precursors.</p><p>We therefore focused on the protocol including the organ culture step for further analyses of the hematopoietic phenotype and differentiation potential of transduced cells.</p></sec><sec><title>3-Hematopoietic development from YS transduced cells</title><p>Flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of 7AAD labelled cells shows no difference in cell viability between infected or non infected YS-cells after one or four days in culture on OP9 stromal cells (Data not shown).

This procedure is thus adapted to analyse the effect of candidate gene on YS-hematopoietic cells development.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The analysis of the first steps of hematopoietic development historically performed though the study of the yolk sac, is somehow limited by the poor level of available precursors, as well as their extremely fast differentiation. Great progress in the understanding of the development of primitive hematopoiesis was achieved, owing to the ES model, once the similarity of developmental sequence with that which occurs <italic>in vivo </italic>was firmly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The availability of large number of ES cells, amenable to genetic manipulations, further refined our knowledge of the mechanisms involved (e.g. through invalidated ES cells rescue experiments). Unfortunately, the gathered information cannot be easily placed back to back to similar experiments conducted in the "normal" YS developmental context.</p><p>Here we provide two gene transfer protocols, whose combination may allow a thorough study of both early and late events of hematopoietic development in the YS. Thanks to two markers which make it possible to discriminate between mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic (lmo2<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;-H1<sup>-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and their erythroid progeny (lmo2<sup>+</sup>/&#x003b2;-H1<sup>+</sup>), we precisely determined the stage when the YS blood islands are enriched in immature precursors. This expression analysis also allowed to precisely locate the prospective blood islands in intact 7 dpc YS. We next used this delineation to perform <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation, which keeps intact the mesoderm-endoderm interactions shown to be crucial for proper hematopoietic development at these stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This approach was proven here to be effective to target mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors and to be completely compatible with a normal viability and hematopoieisis of the transfected mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors upon organ culture and subsequent <italic>in vitro </italic>culture on OP9 stromal cells. Thus, our work provides for the first time a detailed procedure allowing the analysis of the very early steps (determination) of primitive hematopoiesis. However, although our protocol ensures a significant enrichment of hematopoietic cells in the transfected population (three folds), the overall yield remains low (about 1 transfected mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors per YS) for two reasons: 1- the intrinsic paucity of this precursor type in the 7.5 YS (about 10, after the 3 days in organ culture); 2- the relatively low, albeit usual in related experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], level of gene transfer through <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation. Yet, this limitation does not disqualify the procedure since qualitative analyses following transfer of candidate genes can be performed.</p><p>A complementary protocol was then provided to transfer gene in &#x000ab; late &#x000bb; (8 dpc) YS which contains numerous determined cells. At this stage, hematopoietic precursors are much less precisely localized than their mesodermal ancestors, but rather dispersed and diluted among an abundant differentiated (essentially erythroid) progeny. Moreover, the differentiation of these cells is not anymore dependent upon interaction with endodermal cells. We thus reasoned that a &#x000ab; blind &#x000bb; (i.e. non selective) but efficient method would be the most adapted and therefore performed ecotropic retrovirus-mediated gene transfer onto isolated YS cells. A similar strategy has been previously used to express HoxB4 into YS cells at about the same stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, neither indication about the efficiency of the method, nor quantitative data were provided. This is of particular importance given that the nature of the transduced gene in this study may confer such a high competitive growth/survival advantage that even a weak efficiency of transduction may have been sufficient. We show here that even for a &#x000ab;neutral&#x000bb; gene (<italic>eGFP</italic>), the transfer through ecotropic retrovirus in 8 dpc YS hematopoietic precursors is very potent, therefore overcoming the problem of precursor dilution. Indeed, over 60% of the YS cells were transduced using a MOI as low as 1. In fact, YS cells appear highly susceptible to retroviral transduction as a very short contact (4&#x02013;6 hours) with the viral supernatant is sufficient to produce a maximal transduction which therefore minimizes the potential side effects of concentrated viral supernatant or of polybrene, and allows a precise temporal targeting of the beginning of gene transfer. Moreover, we show that including a 24 h organ culture step before exposure to the viral supernatant markedly improves the targeting of immature precursors. This may result from an increased precursor frequency, as evidenced by the higher recovery of clonogenic precursors obtained when GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells are sorted from OrgD1-YS. As a consequence, even though the protocol that includes an organ culture step leads to a lower percentage of transduced cells, GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells steadily increase from day 4 post-infection, while they rapidly vanish when recovered from freshly transduced YS. Further analysis of the hematopoietic progeny of transduced cells is therefore easier under these conditions. Confirming the high permissiveness of YS cells to retroviral transduction, we found that a MPI vector carrying a 2 kb cDNA is almost as efficient as the empty one at transducing OrgD1-YS hematopoietic precursors.</p><p>As for <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation of 7 dpc YS, the recovery, survival and differentiation potentials of retrovirally transduced YS cells appear undistinguishable from that of non-transduced cells. Thus, retroviral transduction appears as a very convenient way to genetically modify hematopoietic precursors from 8 dpc YS.</p><p>Two potential problems, however, limit the use of retroviral transduction:</p><p>1- in our conditions, 7 dpc YS cells (i.e. containing mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors cells), which are amenable to gene transfer by <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation, appear almost totally refractory to retroviral transduction. The reason for this pitfall is unknown, but we suspect that, at this early development stage, mesodermal cells have not yet reached some degree of commitment/differentiation that allows retroviral transduction. Indeed, 7 dpc YS mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors become efficiently transduced after a two days of organ culture, which essentially recapitulates their <italic>in vivo </italic>progression toward committed precursors.</p><p>2- Retroviral vector are stably integrated, and therefore transduced cells are indelibly genetically modified. This is confirmed by the expression of GFP after at least two weeks of culture (latest time point analysed) in retrovirally transduced cells from late YS. In contrast while GFP is still detectable in electroporated cells from 7 dpc YS after 4 days, it completely vanished a few days later. In view of this limitation, we show that our <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation protocol transduce hematopoietic precursors from 8 dpc YS and thus deserves to be used notably if a transient expression is needed. Note that a 4 days expression may appear somewhat long with respect to the accelerated dynamic of embryonic events, especially in the case of early hematopoiesis. However, given the intense proliferation of early YS cells, we suspect that the plasmid delivered by <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation is in fact rapidly diluted so that the expression of labile proteins will be expected to be more really &#x000ab; transient &#x000bb; than that of GFP, whose half life exceeds 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), we provide and detail here two complementary methods to transfer genes in YS cells, at the earliest stages of hematopoietic development (7&#x02013;8 dpc). We studied the influence of several parameters and hence determined the most convenient for either early (mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic) and late (hematopoietic) precursor transduction. These two methods can be used to either enforce (as exemplified here) or knock-down (through vectorized siRNA) the expression of potentially important genes. They are thus likely to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms giving rise to primitive hematopoiesis and to understand the molecular basis underlying its limited potency, when compared to true HSC from the AGM or adult BM.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Assets and limitation of <italic>in situ </italic>electroporation and retroviral transduction to target YS blood islands precursors</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><italic>In situ </italic>electroporation</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Retroviral transduction</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">Asset</td><td align="center">Limitation</td><td align="center">Asset</td><td align="center">Limitation</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">7&#x02013;7.5 dpc: Mesodermal/pre-hematopoietic precursors</td><td align="left">- Transient<break/>- Layer specific delivery<break/>- Spatial control of delivery</td><td align="left">- Reduced number of precursors available for transduction</td><td></td><td align="left">- Causes extensive cell death<break/>- Refractory to transduction ?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Application</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Only possible method</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Unsuitable at this development stage</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">From 7.5&#x02013;8 dpc: Hematopoietic precursors</td><td align="left">- Transient <break/>- Layer specific delivery<break/>- Spatial control of delivery</td><td align="left">- Only a fraction of the YS blood islands is targeted</td><td align="left">- Easy<break/> - All hematopoietic precursors may be transduced</td><td align="left">- Does not allow layer specific targeting</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Application</td><td align="left" colspan="2">-Transient transgene delivery</td><td align="left" colspan="2">- Sustained expression of the transgene</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" colspan="2">- Possible layer specific delivery.</td><td align="left" colspan="2">- Possible delivery of ShRNA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" colspan="2">- Possible delivery of SiRNA or proteins</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Hematopoietic precursor frequency within whole control YS (electroporated without construct) and GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells sorted from electroporated YS-explants were determined through limiting dilution assay.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>1-Mice and isolation of embryo</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with French and European regulations.

HEK 293T cells (4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells; 30&#x02013;40% confluence) are seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% Penicillin-steptomycin (Invitrogen), in 150 mm culture dishes. The following day, the MPI expression vector (6.4 &#x003bc;g) is co-transfected with 3.2 &#x003bc;g phCMV-intron GagPol and 3.2 &#x003bc;g FB-MO-SALF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] helper plasmids, encoding the MLV gag-pol and ecotropic env proteins, respectively, using Fugene 6 (Roche), as transfection reagent, to produce retroviral particles. Viral supernatants are collected twice a day, from 24 h to 72 h post-transfection, filtered (0.45 &#x003bc;m) and concentrated on Centrifugal Filter Devices (Centricon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>Plus-20 from MICON Bioseparation). Concentrated supernatants are distributed into 30 &#x003bc;l aliquots, kept frozen at -80&#x000b0;C. Titration is performed by transducing mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (plated at 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in 6-wells plates) in exponential growth phase with 5 &#x003bc;l concentrated supernatant in the presence of 4 &#x003bc;g/ml polybrene. Cells are analysed for GFP expression 4 days post exposition to the viral supernatant, by flow cytometry using a Facscan (Becton Dickinson). Typically, the titre of concentrated supernatants is 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7 </sup>viral particles per ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Retroviral transduction conditions</title><p>Ten dissociated YS explants (about 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) are seeded in 48 well-plates containing 1 ml "Complemented OptiMEM medium", further supplemented with Flt3-ligand (20 ng/ml), Stem Cell Factor (100 ng/ml), EPO (10<sup>3 </sup>U/ml) and 4 &#x003bc;g polybrene. Viral supernatant is added to obtain one retroviral particle per cell (MOI = 1) during 12 hours. After infection, transduced cells are transferred on OP9 stromal cells and cultured as described below. Interestingly, a 25&#x02013;30% transduction efficiency is achieved on OrgD1-YS, either with a 24 hours or a shorter (4 or 6 hours) exposure to the retroviral supernatant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>5-Expression analyses</title><sec><title><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization</title><p>YS explants, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and rinsed with PBS, are hybridized with riboprobes at 65&#x000b0;C, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
