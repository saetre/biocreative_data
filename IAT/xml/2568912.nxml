The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 (PC2 or TRPP2), is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily and functions as a non-selective calcium channel. PC2 has been found to form oligomers in native tissues suggesting that it may form functional homo- or heterotetramers with other subunits, similar to other TRP channels. Our experiments unexpectedly revealed that PC2 mutant proteins lacking the known C-terminal dimerization domain were still able to form oligomers and co-immunoprecipitate full-length PC2, implying the possible existence of a proximal dimerization domain. Using yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays, we have mapped an alternative dimerization domain to the N terminus of PC2 (NT2-1-223, L224X). Functional characterization of this domain demonstrated that it was sufficient to induce cyst formation in zebrafish embryos and inhibit PC2 surface currents in mIMCD3 cells probably by a dominant-negative mechanism. In summary, we propose a model for PC2 assembly as a functional tetramer which depends on both C- and N-terminal dimerization domains. These results have significant implications for our understanding of PC2 function and disease pathogenesis in ADPKD and provide a new strategy for studying PC2 function.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>R21-DK069604</grant-num>, <grant-num>RO1-DK078209</grant-num> (to T.

ADPKD accounts for &#x0223c;10% of patients on renal replacement therapy and is therefore an important cause of end-stage renal failure world-wide. The cardinal feature of the ADPKD kidney is the presence of multiple fluid-filled cysts. However, cysts also arise in other epithelial structures such as the liver and pancreas. A number of non-cystic manifestations such as cardiac valve abnormalities, diverticular disease, and intracranial aneurysms have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in <italic>PKD2</italic> account for 15% of all patients with ADPKD. The PKD2 protein, polycystin-2 (PC2), is a Type II membrane protein of 968 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). PC2 has the properties of a high-conductance nonselective Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel. Because of significant homology, PC2 (or TRPP2) has been included in the TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily of channels, which broadly function as cellular sensors for multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). There is evidence that PC2 may transduce a mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) although it is unclear whether the mechanosensor is PC1, PC2, or another protein. However, it has also been reported that PC2 can function downstream of G protein-coupled receptor and/or receptor-tyrosine kinase activation at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The basolateral localization of PC2 in kidney tubules and cells has implicated a possible role in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion in association with PC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Finally, it has been reported that PC2 can function as an endoplasmic reticulum-located Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel in some systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>Previously we demonstrated that PC2 can exist as PC1-PC2 heterodimers as well as PC2 homodimers in native tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Interactions between PC1 and PC2 may regulate their trafficking and there is evidence for reciprocal activation or inhibition of activity in different experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). PC2 may also heterodimerize with TRPC1 through its C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). PC2-TRPC1 heteromultimers have been shown to possess distinct channel properties from PC1-PC2 heterodimers, being activated in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation in the kidney epithelial cell line, mIMCD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). In yeast two-hybrid assays, PC2 can homodimerize via a C-terminal domain, which is distinct from heterodimerization sequences for PC1 or TRPC1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). In this report, we describe the identification and functional characterization of a second dimerization domain for PC2 within the N terminus and propose a likely homotetrameric model for PC2 based on C- and N-terminal interactions.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated.

N-terminal HA-tagged full-length and mutant (L703X) PKD2 constructs were created by replacing an XbaI and SacII fragment of a wild-type <italic>PKD2</italic> plasmid (gift of S Somlo, Yale University) with the same fragment excised from the previously described HA-L224X plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). A C-terminal HA-tagged <italic>PKD2</italic> mutant construct, R742X, was generated by PCR using the wild-type PKD2Pk plasmid as a template including the HA epitope tag sequence and in-frame stop codon in the reverse primer. The missense <italic>PKD2</italic> mutation, D511V, was created by site-directed mutagenesis in the PKD2Pk plasmid template using a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The N-terminal Myc-tagged L224X plasmid was generated by PCR and subcloned into the XbaI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 (-). The plasmids CFP-PKD2-(1&#x02013;177) and CFP-PKD2-(1&#x02013;223) were generated by fusing the N-terminal sequences of <italic>PKD2</italic> in-frame with the CFP and FKBP cassette in the vector, CF.</p><p><italic>Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation</italic>&#x02014;HEK-293 and mIMCD3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was carried out on cells cultured to 90% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as previously described using epitope-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The PKD2 antibody, p30, generated to the C-terminal 258 amino acids of human PC2, has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p><p><italic>Yeast Two-hybrid Assays</italic>&#x02014;Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed in the yeast strain AH109 containing ADE2, HIS3, and LacZ reporter genes under the control of the GAL4 upstream activating sequences (UAS) by co-transforming bait and prey constructs of the entire intracellular N terminus of human PC2 (NT2) or its truncations into yeast cells using a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Full-length NT2-(1&#x02013;223) was subcloned into bait (BD) vector pGBKT7 and prey (AD) vector pGADT7 (Clontech), respectively, by PCR and DNA ligation. Similarly, the following NT2 truncations, NT2-(1&#x02013;207), NT2-(1&#x02013;198), NT2-(1&#x02013;177), NT2-(1&#x02013;117), NT2-(1&#x02013;61), and NT2-(178&#x02013;223) were constructed in both bait and prey vectors. After incubation at 30 &#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;4 days, positive co-transformants (containing both bait and prey plasmids) were picked from selective medium S.D./-LT (lacking tryptophan and leucine) and restreaked onto selective media S.D./-LTH (lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine), S.D./-LTH with 2 m<sc>m</sc> 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), and S.D./-LTAH (lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine), respectively, to activate the reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2. 2 m<sc>m</sc> 3-AT was used in the selective medium to suppress minor autoactivation of NT2-(1&#x02013;198) and NT2-(1&#x02013;177) in the pGBKT7 vector. The constructs pGBKT7&#x02013;53 (p53) and pGBADT7-T (SV40 T-antigen) were used as a pair of positive controls. Truncations of the PC2 C terminus (CT2) and PC1 C terminus (CT1), which mimic two naturally occurring mutants lacking their respective interaction domains <italic>i.e. PKD2</italic>-R742X and <italic>PKD1</italic>-R4227X, respectively, were generated as a pair of negative controls: pGBAD-B-CT1 (4107&#x02013;4227) and pACT2-B-CT2 (680&#x02013;742). At least three individual colonies were chosen from each plate to quantify growth.</p><p><italic>Live Cell Imaging</italic>&#x02014;IMCD3 and HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the following cDNAs: CFP-FKBP-L223 (CF-PKD2&#x02013;223), CFP-FKBP-L177 (CF-PKD2&#x02013;177), and Lyn11-FRB (LDR). Translocation of the fusion proteins to the cell surface was induced 24 h later by the addition of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> rapamycin (Calbiochem) to the culture media. In some experiments, co-expression of a surface-localized YFP fusion protein (C1 domain of PKC-&#x003b3;1, YFP-C1 (PKC)) was used to outline the plasma membrane. Live cell measurements were performed on an Olympus Imaging Systems inverted IX-71 microscope with a CFP and YFP filter set to capture cellular fluorescence images with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu), driven by Simple PCI software (C Imaging Systems). Fluorescence images of cells were taken every5sat room temperature. Changes in the mean fluorescence intensity over a given region of the cytosol and nucleus were quantified in individual cells (<italic>n</italic> = 6) using ImageJ (NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p><italic>Electrophysiology</italic>&#x02014;The whole cell voltage-clamp configuration was used in the perforated mode to measure transmembrane currents in single cells. Briefly, patch-clamp recordings were obtained from single cells at 37 &#x000b0;C using a Warner PC-505B amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). Glass pipettes (plain, Fisher Scientific) with resistances of 5&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9; were prepared with a pipette puller and polisher (PP-830 and MF-830, respectively, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). After the whole cell configuration was achieved, cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated before each recording period. Current measurements in time course experiments were made by applying a 100-ms pulse from a holding potential -60 mV to -100 every 10 s for 5 min. Current amplitude was extracted at -100 mV and plotted as function of time (min). I-V curves were derived from a voltage step protocol as follows: from a holding potential of -60 mV, voltage steps were applied from -100 to 100 mV in 20-mV increments with 200 ms duration at 3-s intervals. Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed off-line with pClamp 8. Statistical analysis was employed with the SigmaStat (Chicago, IL) software. Data were reported as means &#x000b1; S.E.

After rinsing the embryos in PBTX for 2 h, they were dehydrated, embedded in JB-4 (Polyscience), and sectioned at 10-&#x003bc;m thickness. Sections were stained with 1:1000 DAPI (KPL) solution for 3 min at room temperature, the slides rinsed once with PBS and then mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (KPL).

The D511V mutation has previously been shown to completely abolish PC2 channel activity whereas L703X and R742X have altered channel properties in some expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Relevant to the present study, D511V has been demonstrated to function as a dominant negative interfering allele in mIMCD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) and LLC-PK1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). As previously shown for endogenous PC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), full-length <italic>PKD2</italic> could be detected mainly as monomers under normal reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE but as oligomers under non-reducing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Apart from prominent dimers, several other high molecular weight bands were detected under non-reducing conditions. These could represent homophilic binding between PC2 subunits or heterophilic interactions with other proteins. <italic>PKD2</italic>-D511V, showed a similar pattern of oligomerization under these conditions (data not shown). Unexpectedly we found that <italic>PKD2</italic>-L703X, could still form dimers under non-reducing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similar results were found for <italic>PKD2</italic>-R742X (not shown). As predicted, <italic>PKD2</italic>-D511V bound to wild-type <italic>PKD2</italic>, but unexpectedly, so did <italic>PKD2</italic>-R742X in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). To exclude the effect of the epitope tags in the interaction, we repeated these experiments with different <italic>PKD2</italic> full-length (Myc-tagged) and mutant (C-terminal HA-tagged) constructs and obtained similar results (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that a proximal interacting domain could lie upstream of the previously described distal C-terminal domain, possibly in the N terminus.

This domain is shown to have a physiologically relevant role in zebrafish development as it phenocopied known loss-of-function constructs of PC2. We propose that the identification of this domain has important implications in type 2 ADPKD pathophysiology.</p><p>The tendency of native PC2 to oligomerize led us initially to investigate how PC2 homodimerization could be regulated. Unexpectedly, we found that two naturally occurring PC2 mutants lacking the C-terminal homodimerization domain (L703X, R742X) could still form oligomers and bind to full-length PC2 in mammalian cells. These findings led us to demonstrate the existence of a more proximal dimerization domain within the N-terminal domain and its functionality in two assays of PC2 activity <italic>i.e.</italic> nephrogenesis in zebrafish embryos and channel activity in mIMCD3 cells. These findings are compatible with a likely dominant negative effect in both models. Overall, our data would support a direct acute inhibitory effect of the mutant protein (PKD2-L223) on the PC2 channel itself, which also leads to subsequent degradation of PC2. Recently, it was reported that the transgenic expression of <italic>PKD2</italic>-L703X in rats gave rise to a cystic phenotype by an undetermined mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). We believe that our findings of an N-terminal dimerization domain support a dominant negative mechanism as a plausible explanation of the phenotype in this model.</p><p>The existence of both N- and C-terminal dimerization domains in PC2 provide supportive evidence that PC2 is likely to form functional homotetramers, a possible model is shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. This model does not require the binding of PC1 or that of other TRP subunits (such as TRPC1) both of which have been shown to interact with PC2 via distinct sequences or amino acids in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The evidence that PC2 homodimers can function independently <italic>in vivo</italic> is indirect: PC2 can function independently of PC1 at the embryonic node in the determination of LR asymmetry in the axial body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Nevertheless, an important question is what regulates the assembly of PC2 monomeric subunits into homotetramers or alternatively heterotetramers with PC1 or other TRP subunits. In addition, we do not know if PC2 truncation mutants (<italic>e.g.</italic> L703X), which retain the putative pore region and which can still dimerize via the N-terminal domain are still functional. In some assays, there is evidence for altered PC2 localization (<italic>e.g.</italic> increased cell surface expression) and for altered channel properties (<italic>e.g.</italic> loss of calcium responsiveness, voltage-dependence) of this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of plasma membrane PKD2 channel activity by CF-PKD2-(223).</bold> Time-dependent inhibition of native (<italic>A</italic>) or transfected PKD2 (<italic>E</italic>) channel activity by rapamycin (<italic>rap</italic>)-induced translocation of a CFP fusion of the PC2 N terminus (NT2, 1&#x02013;223) to the plasma membrane. mIMCD3 cells were transiently transfected with LDR plus CF-PKD2-(177) or CF-PKD2-(223) in the absence (<italic>A</italic>) or presence (<italic>E</italic>) of transfected wild-type mouse PKD2.

By contrast, a mutant PC2 monomer lacking the distal C-terminal dimerization domain (such as L703X) would still be capable of forming dimers via the proximal N-terminal domain: these mutant dimers could be functional. The incorporation of one mutant PC2 monomer with 3 normal PC2 monomers would permit the formation of a tetrameric structure but is likely to be non-functional.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0440853210007"></graphic></fig></p><p>Our results also raise the possibility as to whether cyst formation in PKD2 patients could arise by a dominant-negative mechanism as shown for the D511V mutant in addition to two-hit and haploinsufficiency models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). If PC2 forms an oligomeric structure, the association of a mutant protein with wild-type subunits would result in the generation of non-functional multimeric complexes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). For a tetrameric model, potentially 15 of 16 possible combinations between mutant and wild-type subunits could be affected. Therefore, although there will be 50% reduction in the wild-type protein, the reduction in function could approximate 100%. This mechanism would only be effective assuming that a stable mutant mRNA transcript and protein are produced in patients at levels that would bind in a stoichiometric fashion to wild-type monomers. Nonetheless, given the lack of specific inhibitors to PC2, the dominant negative strategy we have described could be a useful way to study the function of the endogenous protein in different systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D.
