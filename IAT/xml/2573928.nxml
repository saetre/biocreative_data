In vertebrates, these somatotropic hormones are controlled by the neuroendocrine brain. Hormone-like regulations discovered in nematodes and flies suggest that IGF signals in the nervous system can determine lifespan, but it is unknown whether this applies to higher organisms. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, we show that brain IGF receptors (IGF-1R) efficiently regulate somatotropic development. Partial inactivation of IGF-1R in the embryonic brain selectively inhibited GH and IGF-I pathways after birth. This caused growth retardation, smaller adult size, and metabolic alterations, and led to delayed mortality and longer mean lifespan. Thus, early changes in neuroendocrine development can durably modify the life trajectory in mammals. The underlying mechanism appears to be an adaptive plasticity of somatotropic functions allowing individuals to decelerate growth and preserve resources, and thereby improve fitness in challenging environments. Our results also suggest that tonic somatotropic signaling entails the risk of shortened lifespan.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Using a mouse model relevant for humans, we showed that lifespan can be significantly extended by reducing the signaling selectively of a protein called IGF-I in the central nervous system. This effect occurred through changes in specific neuroendocrine pathways. Dissecting the pathophysiological mechanism, we discovered that IGF receptors in the mammalian brain efficiently steered the development of the somatotropic axis, which in turn affected the individual growth trajectory and lifespan. Our work confirms experimentally that continuously low IGF-I and low growth hormone levels favor extended lifespan and postpone age-related mortality. Together with other recent reports, our results further challenge the view that administration of GH can prevent, or even counteract human aging. This knowledge is important since growth hormone is often prescribed to elderly people in an attempt to compensate the unwanted effects of aging. Growth hormone and IGF-I are also substances frequently used for doping in sports.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Inactivating IGF receptors in the brain decreased growth hormone and IGF-I, and increased lifespan in healthy mice.

Significantly, the regulation of aging in diverse species involves common major hormonal pathways, and the underlying mechanisms have clearly been conserved through evolution. Several lines of evidence suggest that the fundamental biological process might be an adaptive mechanism enabling individuals to adjust body size, metabolism, and lifespan to their environment, in particular to the challenging natural fluctuations of resources &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Such an adaptive mechanism would require individual plasticity, especially of the somatotropic hormone axis in response to environmental cues. Because the development of this hormone axis is steered by the central nervous system (CNS) through hypothalamic control of pituitary differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, it is possible that any somatotropic plasticity would involve the CNS. Indeed, previous work in nematodes and insects showed that insulin-like signals in the nervous system alter survival in a non-cell autonomous manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that neuronal control of aging through insulin-like signals might also be conserved. To test these ideas experimentally in a mammalian model, we genetically manipulated IGF signaling in the mouse brain and explored growth, metabolism, and lifespan in these mutants.</p><p>We found that brain IGF receptors strongly promote the development of the somatotropic function in mice. We show that developmental IGF signaling in the brain selectively determines somatotropic plasticity, regulates GH and IGF-I secretion, and thereby controls growth of peripheral tissues, adult glucose metabolism, and energy storage, as well as survival and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Brain IGF-1R Regulates Growth Hormone</title><p>To study the role of IGF signaling in the CNS, we generated mice with heterozygous and homozygous brain-specific IGF-1 receptor knockout mutations (b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) by conditional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g001">1</xref>B). Mutants and their controls were littermates with identical genetic background, and matings were performed such that the Nestin-Cre transgene was always paternally transmitted (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-se001">Text S1</xref> for breeding and genetic background). Homozygous mutants (b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) have no IGF-1R on CNS neurons or glia.

Though very interesting per se, the homozygous bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not show extended lifespan and their adult plasma IGF-I concentration was significantly higher than control values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg001">Figure S1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg001">S1</xref>G).

We therefore studied the heterozygous mutants<sc> (</sc>b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>), in which the IGF-1R levels in the CNS are half that in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). They were healthy and behaved normally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Their body growth, however, though initially normal, was progressively retarded from 20 d of age onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). By age 90 d, b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> adults weighed about 90&#x00025; of controls (males, 30.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 g, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12 versus 33.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 g, &#x02212;9.6&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 19, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; females, 24.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 g, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 18 versus 26.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 g, &#x02212;7.9&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and were 5&#x00025; shorter than controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-st001">Table S1</xref>). b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had normal IGF-1R levels in peripheral tissues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), so we speculated that endocrine growth regulation during development was disturbed. b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> pituitaries were indeed small from age 10 d onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), and total GH content remained low throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The GH concentration per milligram protein fell at age 20 d, suggesting that retardation of early postnatal somatotroph differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) started between day 10 and day 20. Plasma IGF-I, which strongly depends on GH, did not show any pubertal increase in b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice while controls displayed the normal surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Moreover, the concentration of the acid labile subunit (ALS), an important regulator of IGF-I stability and itself regulated by GH, was very low in mutants throughout postnatal life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Importantly, in this model the IGF-1R gene is knocked out in the hypothalamus but not in the pituitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Therefore, we suspected that this somatotropic phenotype was caused by alterations in GH-regulatory neurons of the hypothalamus, i.e. arcuate nucleus GHRH neurons and anterior periventricular somatostatin (SRIH) neurons whose endings converge on the external layer of the median eminence (ME). Indeed, hypothalamic GHRH expression in b<sc>IGF1RKO</sc><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was significantly low, and GHRH accumulation in the GHRH neuron endings was clearly diminished around age 10 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">3</xref>C). In contrast, hypophysiotropic SRIH-producing neurons in the hypothalamus exhibited a normal abundance of SRIH at age 10 d, evidence of the cell-specificity of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">3</xref>D). Accordingly, Pit-1 expression, which is controlled by GHRH neurons and steers somatotropic cell differentiation, was half normal in mutant pituitaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p><fig id="pbio-0060254-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Brain-Targeted Inactivation of the <italic>Igf1r</italic> Gene Using Cre-lox Mutagenesis</title><p>(A) CNS-specific Cre-lox recombination demonstrated using X-Gal staining (blue) in a sagittal section from a 2-wk-old <italic>NesCre</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/0</sup> mouse harboring a LacZ reporter (<italic>Rosa26R</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/0</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>NesCre</italic> is expressed in neuroepithelium by neuronal and glial precursors.

This result suggests that brain IGF-1R controls the set-up of the GH/IGF axis, thereby modulating growth, energy metabolism, and lifespan. In contrast, complete absence of brain IGF-1R in the homozygous knockout produced a very different phenotype leading to increased IGF-I; thus, the phenotype is strongly dependent on IGF-1R gene dose. Any life-prolonging effects of early growth retardation in the homozygous mutant were subsequently suppressed, possibly by increased IGF-I. However, phenotypic alterations in the homozygote were so complex that comparing them with the heterozygote seemed a futile endeavor. Interestingly, brain-specific inactivation of IRS2, a major signal transduction molecule downstream from IGF-1R and insulin receptors, increased lifespan and altered nutrient homeostasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, while apparently not involving the somatotropic axis.</p><p>The heterozygous bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype was somatotroph-specific and other neuroendocrine pathways were unaffected, implicating hypothalamic GHRH neurons. IGF receptors are indeed present in the arcuate nucleus where GHRH neurons reside. There is, however, little evidence for a specific developmental role for IGF-I in the regulation of GHRH neurons, and we cannot exclude the possibility that IGF-1R deletion from other brain areas affected GHRH neurons at a distance. Nevertheless, the similitude of bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with mutants lacking GHRH neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; or GHRH receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; also indicated that this phenotype could have been caused by reduced GHRH signals to the pituitary. Importantly, the number of GH-producing cells in bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> pituitaries was only a fraction of that in controls. This finding was corroborated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and concordant with the several-fold reduced pituitary GH content. GH depletion, in turn, explains the very low ALS concentration and absence of the pubertal surge in IGF-I. As the reduction in GHRH was proportionate to hypothalamic IGF-1R dose, GHRH action presumably triggers a disproportionate loss of GH cells. Several mechanisms may contribute to this: GHRH regulates the number of GH-positive cells, as well as GH production and secretion. Most likely, GHRH abundance must be above a certain threshold to stimulate hypothalamic-pituitary development and GH production. Moreover, not only GHRH but also SRIH neurons, which determine adult GH secretion, may be sensitive to IGF. SRIH was indeed above control concentrations in the adult bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> hypothalamus, suggesting that coordinate GHRH and SRIH action on somatotrophs may have contributed to the observed over-proportionate effects.</p><p>GHRH and SRIH accumulate in nerve endings at the ME, and are liberated into portal veins to regulate pituitary GH. During development, somatotroph proliferation and differentiation depend on local GHRH. In bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> hypothalamus, immunoreactive GHRH but not SRIH was less abundant than in controls. This difference in amount suggests a shift from GHRH to SRIH stimulation at the ME and has possible functional implications for pituitary development, e.g. via Pit-1. Early lack of GHRH in ME, as observed here, may be due to less GHRH neurons, fewer nerve endings, or diminished GHRH. Although we cannot conclude from our experiments, IGF receptors in the ME of adult bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> appeared to be less phosphorylated than those in the rest of the hypothalamus (38.8 &#x000b1; 2.6 versus 59.0 &#x000b1; 4.9, arbitrary units, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8; no difference in control mice; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B). Thus, ME may participate in somatotropic control, for instance by sensing circulating IGF-I. The ME also harbors numerous tanycytes, glia specialized in IGF-I transport to the brain, that may contribute to the modulation of somatotropic signals by acting on the maturation of GHRH neurons. Our various findings combine to indicate that IGF-I, the principal peripheral mediator of GH action, itself plays a major role in the development of the GH/IGF axis.</p><p>Cells in small organisms communicate trophic status via paracrine insulin-like signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Here, we describe a mechanism that determines the individual postnatal trajectory of the somatotropic axis and its adult set point. Somatotropic plasticity, as we observed here, may have evolved to adjust growth to environmental resources. We further demonstrated that early dietary restriction can trigger a neuroendocrine response similar to brain-specific IGF-1R knockout (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-se001">Text S1</xref>, Supplementary Results and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that in the bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> brain, the remaining IGF receptors were overphosphorylated in the cerebral cortex (120&#x00025; &#x000b1; 5&#x00025; of controls, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 16, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A) but not in hypothalamus. This cortical IGF-1R activation may be due to a compensatory local increase of ligand. In contrast, complete absence of IGF-1R in bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) resulted in microcephaly, indicative of a neurotrophic role for IGF-1R. We conclude that the IGF-1R gene is heterosufficient with respect to neurotrophic action, but heteroinsufficient with regard to its role in regulating somatotropic plasticity.</p><p>We showed that downregulation of somatotropic hormones postponed mortality and increased mean lifespan. The underlying developmental mechanism suggested that neuroendocrine control of lifespan may be physiologically relevant in mammals. Indeed, somatotropic plasticity may confer an evolutionary advantage: adaptation of individual body size to available resources would improve fitness in the face of environmental changes; control of size, energy metabolism, and lifespan contribute to preserving vital resources and to maintaining genetic diversity during periods of shortage. Therefore, the evolutionary significance of somatotropic plasticity may be that it cushions otherwise deleterious effects of selective pressure.</p><p>The Barker hypothesis and predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis claim that changes in development can have late consequences for health, modify mortality and lifespan, and entail a risk of maladaptation later in life, if environmental conditions differ grossly from those that led to the initial changes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. This may apply to bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, adapted to a poor environment (little IGF signaling to the brain), when food was available ad libitum. The resulting dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants may explain the rapid increase in late-life mortality and unusual combination of extended mean but normal maximum lifespan. Similar patterns of survival have been described in other aging models: in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>, ablation of ASI sensory neurons that modulate DAF-2 pathways in response to environment, increased mean, but not maximum lifespan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, targeted expression of human uncoupling protein 2 in adult neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, or inhibition of p53 specifically in the nervous system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, extended mean, but not maximum, lifespan. Common to these models is that the mutations were targeted to the nervous system, and it is possible that the perturbed neuronal responsiveness to environmental cues is the primary cause of prolonged lifespan in these models.</p><p>An alternative interpretation of our findings with bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is possible. The average lifespan of the mutants was longer than controls, but its variability was half than that for controls. Thus, individuals on the short-lived edge of the normal lifespan distribution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060254-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060254-sg004">S4</xref>) benefit most from reduced growth hormone and IGF-I: they respond with a lifespan extension of nearly 40&#x00025;. This finding raises the question of why genetically homogeneous wild-type populations display large variability in lifespan. A current explanation is that initially small stochastic differences between individuals are subsequently amplified during development and adult life; however, the mechanism for this remains unclear. Our data indicate that a full complement of brain IGF-1R is required for generating a high somatotropic tone, and this eventually increases the risk of dying early. This mechanism may produce much of the lifespan heterogeneity observed in wild-type mice. Remarkably, the variability of plasma GH was several-fold higher in controls than in bIGF1RKO<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the mutants having continuously low GH levels (M. Holzenberger, L. Kappeler, and A. Bekaert, unpublished data). There are indeed other mammalian species where short lifespan can be related to elevated somatotropic signaling, and vice-versa. In dogs, small size and low IGF-I are determined by one particular IGF-I allele &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, and small breeds live twice as long as large breeds &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060254-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.
