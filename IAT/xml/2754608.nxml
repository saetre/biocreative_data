TOY significantly extended the lifespan, when administered in either preventive or therapeutic manners, in both the LPS- and cecal ligation/puncture-induced sepsis models in mice. TOY markedly attenuated LPS-triggered NF-&#x003ba;B activation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and thrombus formation in multiple organs. Taken together, the targeting strategy for sequestration of LPS/MD-2 complex using the decoy receptor TOY is effective in treating LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis; furthermore, the strategy used in TOY development can be applied to the generation of other novel decoy receptor proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacterial infection is a life-threatening disease characterized by profound inflammatory responses, multi-organ dysfunction with marked thrombus formation, and a high mortality rate (&#x0223c;60&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Martin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although two research groups have tried to generate the extracellular domain of TLR4 protein as a decoy receptor for MD-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Visintin2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Hyakushima1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, it proved difficult to generate a substantial amount of the protein because it is insoluble, its production rate is extremely low, and it is hard to purify due to its intrinsic biochemical properties. Therefore, the trial of blocking TLR4 using a decoy receptor in preventing sepsis under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions has not been achieved until now. To overcome these problems, we recently developed a novel method, &#x02018;the Hybrid LRR Technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02019;, to generate a massive amount of soluble extracellular domains of TLR4 protein. Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are a new type of immune receptors in jawless fish. These receptors resemble the adaptive immune receptors in jawed vertebrates. VLRs and TLRs commonly contain the LRR domain in the extracellular fragment, which is composed of a signal sequence, an N-terminal cap (LRRNT), several LRR modules, and a C-terminal cap (LRRCT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kim2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, stable TLR4-VLR hybrid proteins can be generated in large amounts without any loss of the intrinsic structural integrity of TLR4 by replacing some LRR modules and LRRCT of TLR4 with those of VLR, termed TV3 and TV8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

For the sixth experiment, 20 mg/kg of TOY3 was given to the mice at 1 hr and 12 hr after generation of CLP (&#x02018;repeated treatment to therapeutic model&#x02019;).

These repeated administrations of TOY3 also significantly improved survival compared to the controls in both the LPS- and CLP-induced sepsis models (50&#x00025; survival: &#x0223c;69 hr versus &#x0223c;21 hr, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 in the LPS-induced sepsis model; &#x0223c;84 hr versus &#x0223c;32 hr, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 in the CLP-induced sepsis model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007403-g007"><bold>Figure 7A and 7B</bold></xref>).

We also show for the first time that a modified decoy receptor of TLR4, TOY, is effective not only for prevention, but also for treatment of LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis in mice. Because TOY would be used only once or twice during treatment of a life-threatening septic condition, the immune reaction against to TOY is not being considered. TOY3 and TOY8 produced almost identical effects in preventing sepsis; since TOY3 bears only the &#x02018;A patch&#x02019; of the TLR4, this result implies that the &#x02018;A patch&#x02019; of the TLR4 ectodomain is sufficient for MD-2 binding <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings give us additional structural information in TLR4 biology which shows that further application of TLR4 can be achieved with only the MD-2 minimal binding portion. Considering that TOY3 has a slightly higher production rate and smaller molecular size, it will be the most favorable construct for therapeutic use of TOY in the future. Recently, Roger et al. reported that a blocking antibody against the N-terminal and central domains of TLR4 also produced preventive and therapeutic effects in LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Roger1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, targeting TLR4 either by the blocking antibody or decoy receptor such as TOY could be an amenable tool to relieve LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Roger1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Daubeuf1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, since LBP and CD14 play accessory roles in LPS recognition by TLR4/MD-2 while MD-2 binds to LPS directly and induces TLR4 dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Barton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Kawai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, the efficacy of targeting TLR4/MD-2 using TOY could be different from that of blocking LBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Wu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> or CD14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007403-Tasaka1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the effectiveness of TOY and blockers of LBP or CD14 should be carefully compared in future studies. Taken together, TOY would be an effective alternative therapeutic molecule for treatment of patients with bacterial sepsis, and our method provides a new platform biotechnology to generate novel decoy receptor from TLR proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Generation of recombinant proteins</title><p>Gene constructs encoding different sizes of the ectodomain of human TLR4 &#x0005b;TFE (amino acid residues 27&#x02013;631), TOY3 (amino acid residues 27&#x02013;227), and TOY8 (amino acid residues 27&#x02013;527)&#x0005d;, the LRR module of hagfish VLR-B.61 (VLR), and the Fc domain of human IgG (Fc) were cloned into the pCMV-dhfr vector.
