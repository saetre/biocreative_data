CAP binds to DNA as a homodimer, in a complex with cyclic AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c1">1</xref>). Binding induces an &#x0223c;90&#x000b0; bend in its DNA-binding site <italic>in vitro</italic> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c5">5</xref>). DNA bending may be important in the function of CAP as a transcriptional activator: in the absence of CAP binding, replacement of the CAP-binding site with intrinsically curved A-tract DNA restores promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c7">7</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c8">8</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which CAP induces DNA bending are of great interest. CAP is the prototype of proteins that induce DNA bending towards the protein surface, a feature shared by the histone octamer core of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c9">9</xref>). Although crystal structures identify specific atomic interactions, they do not reveal the relative energetic contributions of such interactions to binding and induced conformational changes in the protein and DNA. DNA bending over short distances is energetically unfavorable and must be compensated for by the binding free energy of the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction. Obvious sources of such favorable free energy changes include counterion release from DNA, dehydration of the protein&#x02013;DNA interface, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions and electrostatic forces. Favorable interactions on the protein surface have been invoked to explain extensive DNA &#x02018;wrapping&#x02019; on proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c11">11</xref>). In addition to these conventional forces, we have been interested in the potential role of latent DNA bending forces revealed when phosphates in the DNA double helix are neutralized asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c13">13</xref>). Our previous studies have indicated that some DNA curvature can originate from asymmetric charge neutralization without any other attractive forces applied by the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c17">17</xref>). DNA collapse upon asymmetric charge neutralization is thought to reflect the unbalancing of small local interphosphate repulsions normally present along the DNA double helix.</p><p>To what extent does asymmetric phosphate neutralization play a role in the DNA bending observed in the complex with CAP? Gurlie and Zakrzewska used molecular modeling to explore the role of laterally asymmetric neutralizing salt bridge interactions in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>). Modeling of the unmodified CAP half-site predicted intrinsic DNA curvature of 38&#x000b0;, with the curvature being smoothly distributed along the modeled sequence. The direction of this curvature was predicted to agree with the direction of bending observed in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex. Through <italic>in silico</italic> neutralization of appropriate DNA phosphates, modeling predicted a 13&#x000b0; increase in DNA curvature (&#x0223c;34&#x00025; greater than unmodified), with no induced change in the direction of curvature. These authors also investigated the predicted sequence specificity of modification, demonstrating that the precise positioning of phosphate neutralizations was important to both the estimated DNA bend magnitude and direction.</p><p>Herein we describe an experimental measurement of the actual electrostatic contribution of asymmetric phosphate neutralization to the bending of a DNA duplex containing a single half-site CAP-binding consensus sequence (5&#x02032;-TGTGA). X-ray crystal structure data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>) were used to assign putative neutralizing interactions between CAP basic amino acid side chains and DNA phosphates. Appropriate phosphates were chemically neutralized by methylphosphonate substitution, to mimic sites of close approach by these cationic CAP amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c16">16</xref>). The shape of the DNA half-site was then evaluated, in the absence of protein, before and after site-specific neutralizations. DNA shape analysis was performed using a semi-synthetic DNA electrophoretic phasing assay that allows quantitative estimation of DNA bend magnitude and direction as a function of phosphate modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>). Our results confirm that the CAP DNA half-site is intrinsically curved in the direction enhanced in the complex with protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c5">5</xref>). Neutralization of five phosphates causes an &#x0223c;23&#x00025; increase in curvature (from 26&#x000b0; to 32&#x000b0;). This observation demonstrates that asymmetric phosphate neutralization by CAP makes a detectable favorable contribution to DNA bending in the complex. Our data suggest that asymmetric phosphate neutralization contributes to DNA bending, but cannot account for the full DNA deformation caused by CAP binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>Unmodified oligonucleotides were prepared by standard phosphoramidite chemistry.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f1">1</xref>B illustrates the structure of the left half-site of the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex and shows the five basic side-chains of CAP (K26, K166, R169, K188 and H199) that form apparent ion pairs with DNA phosphates. These DNA phosphates contacted by CAP are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f1">1</xref>C as red spheres. We targeted the corresponding phosphodiester linkages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f1">1</xref>D) for substitution by neutral methylphosphonates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f1">1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>We utilized a DNA phasing assay that allows quantitative estimation of DNA bend magnitude and direction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>A) to measure the effect of asymmetric phosphate neutralization in CAP half-site DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>). This assay format is comparable with conventional electrophoretic phasing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c24">24</xref>), except that chemically modified DNA is embedded directly into longer recombinant phasing probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>). This procedure requires far fewer modified DNA oligonucleotides than conventional ligation ladder experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c25">25</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>A, trimolecular ligations among a linear DNA duplex PCR product (left arm, <bold>L</bold>), a series of five different PCR products each containing a region of constant curvature (phased A<sub>5</sub> tracts) separated by a variable spacer from the left end of the arm (right arms, <bold>R</bold>) and a synthetic DNA duplex insert (<bold>I</bold>) whose shape is to be studied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B; <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold> to <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>) creates five different electrophoretic phasing probes. The length of DNA between the left terminus and the phased A<sub>5</sub> tracts (providing &#x0223c;54&#x000b0; of intrinsic curvature) in <bold>R</bold> differs for each insert (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>A). As a result, there are five distinct helical phasings between elements in the synthetic insert (<bold>I</bold>) and the phased A<sub>5</sub> tracts. This design allows quantitative analysis of the shape of the DNA in the synthetic insert. We demonstrated previously that this system is easily calibrated with synthetic inserts containing variable numbers of A<sub>5</sub> tracts and is sensitive to modest alterations in DNA curvature induced by methylphosphonate substitution in laterally asymmetric patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>).</p><p>An unmodified DNA duplex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B, <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold>) was designed, based on the DNA sequence used for CAP crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>). As described above, inspection revealed five salt bridge interactions that were targeted for modification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B, insert <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>).

If a curved DNA sequence is present in <bold>I</bold>, changes in the helical phasing between the two DNA elements (reference A<sub>5</sub> tracts in <bold>R</bold> versus curvature in <bold>I</bold>) will lead to alterations in electrophoretic mobility.

Duplex inserts were ligated between <bold>L</bold> and each of the five right arms <bold>R</bold> and electrophoresed through native polyacrylamide gels as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>A). Phasing probes containing the unmodified DNA (insert <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;5) displayed strikingly different electrophoretic mobilities, confirming the presence of intrinsically curved DNA in the unmodified CAP-binding site. The gel mobility of each probe was analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c22">22</xref>). Relative mobility, &#x000b5;<sub>rel</sub> (equation <bold>1</bold>), was plotted against the spacing (in base pairs) between the nucleotide designated 1 in the duplex insert (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B) and the center of curvature of the proximal 5&#x02032; A<sub>5</sub> tract in <bold>R</bold>. The results are depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>B (filled circles). Using techniques derived by Kerppola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c22">22</xref>) and a set of standard probes bearing A tracts in the insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>), the relative differences in probe mobilities were transformed (equations <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>) into estimates of DNA curvature magnitudes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>).</p><p>We deduced an apparent intrinsic DNA curvature of 26&#x000b0; based on unmodified duplex <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold>. The semi-synthetic phasing assay also permits estimation of the direction of DNA curvature. This information is revealed by the spacing at which the fitted cosine function is at a minimum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>). If it is assumed that the DNA helical repeat in the region analyzed is &#x0223c;10.5 bp&#x0002f;turn, the apparent bend direction in unmodified duplex <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold> is towards the major groove in a reference frame centered on the base pair position designated 2.0 (numbering as in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B). Previous experiments have provided various estimates of the intrinsic curvature of the CAP site through molecular modeling (&#x0223c;38&#x000b0; for the CAP half-site; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>) and through cyclization kinetics (&#x0223c;15&#x000b0; for the full site; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c5">5</xref>). Analysis of crystal structures had assigned the primary kink in the helix axis toward the major groove at base pair 6.5 and a secondary kink toward the minor groove at position &#x02013;1 to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>). Both kinks cause bends in the same overall direction and this is within &#x0223c;30&#x000b0; of the direction of the intrinsic DNA curvature we detect.</p><p>A different phasing profile was observed for duplex insert <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;10). The mobilities of these modified DNAs displayed a greater dependence on the position of the duplex insert in relation to the A<sub>5</sub> tracts of <bold>R</bold>. Mobility retardation was again maximal for products containing <bold>R</bold>&#x02013;<bold>C</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>A, lane 8), indicating that the loci of curvature are most nearly in phase for this probe. Quantitation of these data as described above predicts an apparent bend magnitude of 32&#x000b0;, a 23&#x00025; increase relative to duplex <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>). The bend direction was not significantly different from <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold> (both centered at position &#x0223c;2.1), supporting previous experiments and models where CAP binding alters the DNA bend magnitude without changing the bend direction significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref> also depicts the electrophoretic analysis of probes derived from the ligation of duplex <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold> between <bold>L</bold> and <bold>R</bold>. This design deliberately shifts the CAP neutralization pattern one half-helical turn away from the frame of reference of the natural CAP half-site. These ligation products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f3">3</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;15) display significantly reduced phase-dependent mobility anomalies.

The bend direction was centered at position 1.4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>). This result demonstrates that the neutralization pattern can predictably enhance or reduce intrinsic DNA curvature, depending on the phasing of the neutralized surface.</p><p>We performed additional experiments that altered the number and position of methylphosphonate substitutions by testing all combinations of top and bottom DNA strands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B). Results of these experiments are also summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>. Data are ordered from the largest to smallest apparent DNA bend. The data indicate that the presence of three consecutive neutralizations at positions between base pairs 1&#x02032; and &#x02013;3&#x02032; consistently enhances DNA bend magnitude by 6&#x02013;9&#x000b0; (23&#x02013;35&#x00025;). Interestingly, this result is relatively independent of the charge character of the other DNA strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>, compare <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>, <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> and <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>). When the neutralized patch was shifted by 5 bp (duplexes <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold>, <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold> and <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold>), the DNA bend magnitude was significantly reduced. This result again largely reflected the position of the group of three consecutive neutralized phosphates and was independent of the charge character of the top DNA strand. All bend directions were centered within &#x0223c;1 bp of the curvature in <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>u</bold>. Apparent DNA bend direction is obtained by the position of the minimum of the cosine function fit through the phasing data. If it is assumed that the DNA helical repeat remains constant and that bending occurs by base pair roll into a groove, the relative invariance of this minimum implies that the direction of DNA bending remains centered at nearly the same position. DNA side and end views mapping neutralization locations onto the left CAP half-site DNA are shown in columns 2 and 3 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>. Inspection clearly shows that induced bending largely corresponds to the prediction that DNA will bend toward its neutralized surface.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We used a DNA phasing assay to experimentally measure the relative contributions to DNA bending due to asymmetric phosphate neutralization in the CAP half-site. Our results indicate a relative increase in DNA curvature of &#x0223c;23&#x00025; when methylphosphonate substitutions are positioned to mimic sites of close contact by cationic amino acids observed in the CAP&#x02013;DNA crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>). This observation demonstrates that asymmetric phosphate neutralization by CAP makes a detectable favorable contribution to DNA bending, but does not fully account for the large DNA deformation (&#x0223c;90&#x000b0;) in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Of particular note is the apparent importance of the local modified phosphate pattern for DNA deformation. The presence of three consecutive neutralized phosphates on the bottom DNA strand made dominant contributions, regardless of sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>). When these methylphosphonates were placed to mimic sites of close approach by cationic amino acids, DNA curvature was enhanced, independent of the position of a pair of neutralizations on the other strand. When deliberately shifted one half-helical turn downstream, the same pattern of modifications induced a significant decrease in total DNA curvature. This dominant behavior of three consecutive neutralized phosphates was unexpected and is most evident in the bending behavior of duplexes <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>, <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> and <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>). The dominance of the group of three consecutive neutralized phosphates is also evident in the shifted sequence context (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>, duplexes <bold>s</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold>, <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold> and <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>s</bold>), although in this series the pair of top strand neutralizations also exerts an influence. These results suggest that the loss of local interphosphate repulsions due to three consecutive phosphate neutralizations exerts a disproportionate effect on DNA collapse relative to a pair of neutralizations. The induced bending by an isolated set of three neutralized phosphates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>, duplex <bold>u</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold>) demonstrates that neutralizations need not be positioned across a DNA groove to promote bending in a direction suggesting collapse of that groove. This result is not unexpected, as elimination of charge on either side of the groove reduces electrostatic repulsions as the groove is narrowed.</p><p>The DNA bending induced by phosphate neutralization in duplex <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>) corresponds well to a DNA deformation in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex termed the &#x02018;secondary kink&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>). This secondary kink occurs in each half-site. In the left half-site (studied in our experiments) the secondary kink collapses the DNA minor groove by &#x0223c;19&#x000b0; over a region of 3 bp, centered between base pairs &#x02013;1 and 1, as numbered in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f2">2</xref>B. Bending toward the minor groove at this position is consistent with the induced bend in this direction observed in neutralization pattern <bold>m</bold>&#x0002f;<bold>m</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf303f4">4</xref>). Thus, we propose that asymmetric phosphate neutralization plays a role in providing perhaps one-third of the DNA bending observed at this secondary kink site, and perhaps &#x0223c;15&#x00025; of the overall DNA bending in the complex with CAP.</p><p>It is important to compare our results with those obtained through other methods. Molecular modeling studies suggested a slightly larger intrinsic curvature of a similar unmodified CAP half-site sequence (38&#x000b0; versus 26&#x000b0;), but predicted a similar relative increase in curvature upon phosphate neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>). Our observation that the direction of DNA curvature does not change upon modification is also in agreement with these authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>). However, details of the prior modeling study deviate from our design. Certain phosphodiesters chosen for <italic>in silico</italic> neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c18">18</xref>) are likely to have been inappropriate due to the following considerations. The phosphodiester linkage between base pairs 2 and 3 was neutralized in the prior modeling study, but is actually contacted by the neutral amino acid Q170. The phosphodiester linkage between base pairs 3 and 4 was also neutralized, but forms hydrogen bonds with neutral residues T168, 169NH and 170NH. The phosphodiester linkage between base pairs &#x02013;2&#x02032; and &#x02013;3&#x02032; was not neutralized in the prior study, despite close contact by K26. The phosphodiester linkage between base pairs 9&#x02032; and 10&#x02032; was neutralized, but forms hydrogen bonds with neutral residues 179NH, S179 and T182. Finally, the phosphodiester linkage between base pairs 10&#x02032; and 11&#x02032; was neutralized in the modeling study, but forms hydrogen bonds with the neutral 139NH backbone. Despite these differences, an overall agreement with the prior modeling study exists in the sense that asymmetric phosphate neutralization enhances DNA bending in the predicted direction. Agreement also exists with the prediction from modeling that a 5 bp downstream shift of the neutralized linkages from sites predicted in the crystal structure results in an overall reduction in DNA curvature.</p><p>Few other studies are available for the evaluation of intrinsic curvature present in the free CAP half-site. Kahn and Crothers used Monte Carlo simulations coupled with cyclization kinetics to estimate &#x0223c;7.5&#x000b0; of curvature per half-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c26">26</xref>). It is unfortunate that, to our knowledge, a crystal structure of the uncomplexed DNA is not available for comparison.</p><p>We note that in the crystal structure of the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex the primary DNA kink is between base pairs 6 and 7, producing a large bend toward the major groove. Smaller kinks between base pairs &#x02013;1 and 1 exhibit roll angles of &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;, compressing the minor groove, with the DNA deformation distributed over 1&#x02013;2 adjacent base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c4">4</xref>). Ebright and co-workers have recently reported the results of experiments that further support the importance of sequence-non-specific electrostatic interactions in dominating the shape of DNA in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c28">28</xref>).</p><p>Our experimental approach is limited from the standpoint that individual DNA bends are not resolved; only a single virtual locus of curvature is detected by the phasing assay. It is possible that the presence of other intrinsically curved elements may contribute to the measured phasing dependence. Measured phasing amplitudes are also, to some extent, dependent on the position of a locus of curvature in the duplex inserts, relative to the position of the reference A<sub>5</sub> tracts in the right arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c19">19</xref>). Diminished phasing amplitudes are contributed by elements of curvature in the distal portion of the studied sequence. Our assay also requires the assumption that the DNA helical repeat is not changed significantly by substitution with methylphosphonate linkages, a result supported by our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Our results may also be compared with previous studies of the contribution of asymmetric phosphate neutralization to less extreme DNA bending induced by other proteins. Methylphosphonate substitution experiments with the PU.1 transcription factor binding site suggested that asymmetric phosphate neutralization between PU.1 and DNA was more than sufficient to account for all of the DNA bending observed in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c29">29</xref>). Tomky <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c16">16</xref>) also measured the contribution of asymmetric phosphate neutralization in bending of the AP-1 site by bZIP charge variants derived from GCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf303c30">30</xref>). It was observed that the amount of DNA bending induced by methylphosphonate substitution was of the same order as that induced by the binding of charge variants bearing additional basic amino acids. The fractional contribution to DNA bending by asymmetric phosphate neutralization may therefore be specific to each DNA&#x02013;protein complex and may be of lesser importance in complexes with extensive hydrogen bonding networks and other favorable contact forces. Nonetheless, our present results highlight a detectable role for latent DNA bending forces revealed by asymmetric phosphate neutralization in the CAP&#x02013;DNA complex.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf303f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Asymmetric phosphate neutralization in CAP&#x02013;DNA complexes.
