In both the rodent and the human HTRA3 is transcribed into two mRNA species (long and short) through alternative splicing. We have previously shown that HTRA3 is expressed in the mature rat ovary and may be involved in folliculogenesis and luteinisation. HTRA3 is also upregulated during mouse and human placental development. The current study investigated whether HTRA3 is also localised in the primate ovary (rhesus monkey n = 7). In addition, we examined the non-pregnant rhesus monkey endometrium (n = 4) and maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy (n = 5) to further investigate expression of HTRA3 in primate endometrium and placentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>HTRA3 mRNA levels in several rhesus monkey tissues was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression and localisation of HTRA3 was determined by immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Long and short forms of HTRA3 mRNA were detected in the ovary, aorta, bladder, small intestine, skeletal muscle, heart and uterus but not the liver nor the kidney. HTRA3 protein was immunolocalised to the oocyte of all follicular stages in the rhesus monkey ovary. Protein expression in mural and cumulus granulosa cells of late secondary follicles increased significantly compared to granulosa cells of primordial, primary and secondary follicles. Mural and cumulus granulosa cells of antral follicles also showed a significant increase in expression. Staining intensity was higher in the granulosa-lutein cells compared to the theca-lutein cells of corpora lutea (n = 3). In the non-pregnant monkey endometrium, HTRA3 was detected in the glandular epithelium. The basalis endometrial glands showed higher staining intensity than functionalis endometrial glands. During early pregnancy, strong staining for HTRA3 protein was seen in both maternal decidual cells and glands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that HTRA3 may be involved in folliculogenesis and luteinisation in the primate ovary. Furthermore, similar to previous findings in the human, HTRA3 is possibly a factor involved in and potentially important for primate placentation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The high temperature requirement factor A (HtrA) family of serine proteases was first identified in <italic>E. coli </italic>and is conserved from bacteria to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We identified and cloned a novel gene that is considerably upregulated in the mouse uterus in association with placentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. After cloning the full mRNA sequence of this gene in the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] [accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_053044.2">NM_053044.2</ext-link>, GenBank<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Identifier (GI) 24475740] we determined that this protease was structurally related to the previously identified mammalian proteases HTRA1 and 2. Consequently we named this new gene <italic>HTRA3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the human and the rodent, <italic>HTRA3 </italic>gene undergoes alternative splicing (long and short mRNA forms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In both the human and the rodent, the <italic>HTRA3 </italic>gene consists of 10 exons. Long <italic>HTRA3 </italic>is produced by utilizing exons 1 through to 10 except exon 7, whilst the short form is produced by utilizing exons 1 through to 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The alternative splicing of the <italic>HTRA3 </italic>gene into the long and short form mRNA results in two predicted protein isoforms in both the human and the rodent, 49 kDa and 38 kDa respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Mammalian HTRA1 and 3 share similar domain organisation including a highly conserved trypsin-like serine protease domain and a C-terminal postsynaptic density protein 95-Discs large-Zona occuldens 1 (PDZ) domain that mediates specific protein-protein interactions. Mammalian HTRA3 also consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, an insulin growth factor binding domain and a kazal-type S protease inhibitor domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whilst HTRA3 is a serine protease, that fact that it contains an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding domain at the N-terminal following the signal peptide, suggests that it can be secreted and may be involved in the IGF system.</p><p>In both the human and the rodent, the protein sequence of short HTRA3 is identical to that of the long except that it contains exon 7, whilst long form <italic>HTRA3 </italic>mRNA does not, and it lacks the C-terminal PDZ domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HTRA3 is well conserved between human, mouse and rat with identical bases at 87% and 79% for the mouse and the rat mRNA respectively and 95% similarity for both at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Northern analysis has shown high expression of HTRA3 mRNA in the mouse ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the rat, we have shown a significant increase of long form <italic>HTRA3 </italic>mRNA expression from immature to mature state ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. When HTRA3 protein expression was investigated throughout the rat estrous cycle, it was upregulated in the cumulus and mural granulosa cells of late secondary, antral and preovulatory follicles. High levels of HTRA3 protein were also localized in the corpora lutea (CL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore long <italic>HTRA3 </italic>mRNA increased significantly with FSH treatment of rat primary granulosa cells in culture for 16 h compared to control, concurrent with luteinisation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>HTRA3 was first identified as a pregnancy related serine protease, uniquely regulated at the time of implantation and placentation in the mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HTRA3 protein has been immunolocalised predominantly to the decidua basalis during mouse implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In human endometrium, both glandular and decidual expression of HTRA3 increased significantly in early pregnancy compared to normal endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In particular, decidual expression significantly increased during the first-trimester pregnancy when decidualisation advanced. Furthermore, HTRA3 protein was significantly elevated in the serum of women in first-trimester pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has also been reported that there is a clear association between HTRA3 and the human menstrual cycle. The endometrial expression of HTRA3 was found to be highest at the late secretory phase of the cycle, when the endometrium is prepared for maternal-trophoblast interaction should fertilisation occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we investigated the expression and regulation of HTRA3 mRNA and protein in the non-pregnant rhesus monkey ovary and endometrium, and at the maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy. We propose that similar to the findings in the rodent, HTRA3 may be associated with folliculogenesis and luteinisation in the primate ovary. In addition, HTRA3 is expressed in the endometrium during the monkey menstrual cycle and therefore may be associated with early pregnancy in the primate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue collection and processing</title><p>Rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were maintained in the Fu-Zhou Primate Research Centre, China. All experimental work was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Menstrual cycles of female monkeys were monitored for 2&#x02013;3 cycles before sampling (n = 10). One ovary and uterine tissue were collected 3, 2 and 1 day before (ov-3, ov-2 and ov-1 respectively), and 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 days after (ov+5, ov+9, ov+10, ov+11, ov+12, ov+14 and ov+15 respectively) ovulation. For pregnant monkeys (n = 5), animals were permitted to mate over a period of 3 days at the anticipated time of ovulation, the second day of mating was designated day 0 of pregnancy. The presence of a conceptus was confirmed by ultrasound diagnosis and uterine tissue collected. At the appropriate time of either the cycle (ov-3 to ov+15) or pregnancy (d22 or d35), the monkeys were sacrificed humanely, the ovaries, uterus, aorta, bladder, small intestine, skeletal muscle, heart, liver and kidney were removed. Appropriately selected wedges of the ovaries and the uterus were fixed in buffered formalin overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (TBS) and processed to paraffin wax blocks. The remaining sections of the ovary and the uterus and all other tissue types were collected in RNA later (Ambion, CA, US) and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction, purification and quantitation</title><p>RNA was extracted from adult monkey tissue by homogenisation in Trizol reagent (Qiagen Sciences, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

All ovarian sections underwent immunostaining in a single experiment as did all uterine sections. For each section of tissue, a serial tissue section was used as a negative control. Following antigen retrieval by microwaving the sections for 5 min in 0.1 M citric acid buffer (pH 6.0), the endogenous hydrogen peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For the ovarian tissue, non-specific binding was blocked by pre-incubation with a blocking buffer containing high salt TBS (0.3 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween 20, 15% rabbit serum and 2% normal human serum for 1 h at room temperature. A similar blocking buffer and method was used for the uterine tissue except 12% rabbit serum and 6% fetal calf serum were used in the buffer. The primary antibody [sheep anti-HTRA3 antibody #153 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (2 &#x003bc;g/ml for ovarian tissue, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml for uterine tissue) or pre-immune sheep IgG as a negative control, at the same concentration as the primary antibody] was incubated in a blocking buffer containing high salt TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% rabbit serum and 2% normal human serum at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h and washed with high salt TBS plus 0.6% Tween. The secondary antibody [#BA-6000, biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)] was applied in the same blocking buffer as the primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Positive immunostaining was revealed by incubating the sections with an avidin-biotin-complex conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DakoCytomation, Botany, Australia) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the application of the peroxidase substrate 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DakoCytomation) leading to a brown precipitate. The sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. Microscopy was performed using an Olympus BH2 microscope fitted with a Fujix HC-2000 high resolution digital camera (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>To determine the expression level and cellular localization of HTRA3 protein in the non-pregnant ovary, ovaries collected at ov-3, ov-2, ov+5, ov+9, ov+11, ov+12 and ov+14 were examined (n = 1 monkey for each day). Follicles were counted and investigated from all 7 monkeys (primordial follicles, n = 158; primary follicles, n = 119; secondary follicles, n = 78; late secondary follicles, n = 4; antral follicles, n = 5 (antral follicles were observed in monkeys at ov-3 and ov-2), corpora lutea, n = 3 (CLs were observed in monkeys at ov+11, ov+12 and ov+14). Non-pregnant uterine tissues sampled at ov-1 (n = 3), ov+5 (n = 3), ov+10 (n = 3) and ov+15 (n = 2) of the menstrual cycle were also examined. The relative intensity of the immunostaining was scored semiquantitatively by two independent observers; zero representing no staining and four representing maximal staining. Such analysis of immunostaining has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The scores for each type of cellular subtype in each different follicle type investigated by each observer were then averaged. Comparisons of staining intensities between cellular subtypes within different follicle types were performed using One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's <italic>post hoc </italic>test using PRISM v4 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). The staining intensity of the endometrial glandular epithelium of non-pregnant monkeys at different stages of the cycle was scored and analysed in a similar fashion, with the quantitation resulting in the average of the signal.

This increase in HTRA3, particularly in the granulosa cells, with the maturation of follicles is similar to that seen in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and indicates that HTRA3 is associated in the process of folliculogenesis not only in rodents, but also in primates.</p><p>Both the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte and the mural granulosa cells lining the follicle wall of late secondary and antral follicles showed significant upregulation of HTRA3, however the cumulus granulosa cells stained more strongly for the protein. An important stage in the maturation of follicles is the division of granulosa cells into cumulus and mural cells. Several factors are involved in this differentiation step including members of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily. In the mouse, lack of oocyte derived bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15) results in defective cumulus cell differentiation and cumulus expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Follicles fail to progress beyond the late secondary stage in the absence of oocyte derived growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Consequently it is clear that the cumulus cells are involved in promoting oocyte growth and developmental competence through bidirectional interactions with the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. HTRA3 is a newly identified protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and its function is still unclear. Supporting a possible role for HTRA3 protease action in the differentiation of granulosa cells into cumulus and mural cells is the report that HTRA3 can bind to various TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members and can inhibit the signalling of BMP-4, BMP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]and that HTRA3 protein was upregulated in the cumulus granulosa cells and the oocyte of antral follicles in the rat ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and in the primate in the current study.</p><p>HTRA3 may also be involved in the formation of a local extracellular matrix (ECM) by the cumulus cells which envelopes the cumulus oocyte complex (COC). This process plays a vital role in ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. HTRA3 exhibits substrate specificity toward &#x003b2;-casein and certain ECM proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] implying that HTRA3 may directly modulate the ECM microenvironment of the COC to facilitate ovulation.</p><p>High expression of HTRA3 was seen in the granulosa-lutein cells of the CL implying a role for this serine protease in luteinisation. This is supported by the localisation of HTRA3 in the rat CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A large number of proteinases involved in folliculogenesis and luteinisation are found in the CL. Proteoglycans such as decorin have been found in bovine CLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Decorin is a well known modulator of the ECM and recombinant HTRA3 can degrade ECM proteins such as decorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This suggests a role for ovarian derived HTRA3 in the regulation of the ECM microenvironment of the CL for the process of luteinisation.</p><p>In addition, oocytes in all follicles stained positive for HTRA3 protein. In most species, including humans, oocyte health, follicle growth and ovulation are dependent on some level of oocyte derived TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As HTRA3 is reported to be able to bind to a broad range of TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members and inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and the present study has shown that HTRA3 is expressed in similar cells in the ovary as TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]), it is possible that HTRA3is involved in the maintenance of the health of oocytes.</p><p>During the rhesus monkey menstrual cycle, HTRA3 was localised primarily in the endometrial glands. Interestingly expression of HTRA3 protein in these glands increased 5 days following ovulation and was maximal 10 days after ovulation. During this secretory phase of the cycle in the primate, the endometrium prepares for maternal-trophoblast interaction should fertilisation occur. Following implantation, HTRA3 was expressed strongly in the glands and decidual cells.</p><p>The high expression of HTRA3 protein in both the maternal decidual cells and the glands during early pregnancy correlates with previous findings in the human. HTRA3 was in particular significantly upregulated during first-trimester pregnancy when decidualisation is fully advanced and is also increased as stromal cells decidualise <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many growth factors and ECM proteins produced by the decidua regulate trophoblast proliferation, differentiation and invasion. It has been shown that HTRA3 and HTRA1 are able to degrade a number of ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is therefore possible that HTRA3 is directly involved in the decidua ECM microenvironment, assisting trophoblast invasion. In addition, strong expression of TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members has been reported in the decidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and these decidual TGF-&#x003b2;s have been demonstrated to be able to inhibit trophoblast invasion via paracrine manners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This suggests that in the decidua, HTRA3 may inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, thereby regulating trophoblast migration and invasion.</p><p>During early pregnancy, HTRA3 expression was also detected in synctiotrophoblasts and endovascular EVTs in the rhesus monkey. This is consistent with studies reported in the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, expression of HTRA3 in the trophoblast shell was below detection in the rhesus monkey in contrast to that seen in the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This may highlight the variation between the rhesus monkey and the human.</p><p>Both the rodent and the human HTRA3 and HTRA1 protein sequences include an IGF binding domain at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggesting that these serine proteases may be involved in the IGF/IGFBP system. Indeed, it has been reported that HTRA1 cleaves IGFBP-5 and that the inhibition of its protease activity suppresses IGF-I action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The IGF/IGFBP system is vital in modulating the maternal-fetal interface for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and all components of the system are expressed in the endometrium/decidua or placenta at various stages of pregnancy in all species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An important factor in the co-ordination of the IGF/IGFBP system is proteolysis of IGFBPs leading to increased IGF bioactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is thus possible that HTRA3 may be capable of modulating the IGF/IGFBP system particularly during placentation. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of HTRA3 during this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has demonstrated a clear association between HTRA3 expression and folliculogenesis and luteinisation in the rhesus monkey ovary. In addition we have reported a dynamic correlation between HTRA3 and endometrial function at the maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy in the rhesus monkey supporting previous findings in the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These results suggest a role for HTRA3 in primate female reproduction. In order to determine the mechanisms of HTRA3 in female reproduction, the next vital step in research is to determine HTRA3 substrate specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have read and approved the manuscript.
