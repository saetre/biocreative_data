Chemical shift changes of backbone amide resonances were monitored while the substrate, a hybrid 9-mer duplex, a DNA/DNA 12-mer duplex, or an RNA/RNA 12-mer duplex was titrated. The amino acid residues affected by the addition of each 12-mer duplex were almost identical to those affected by the substrate hybrid binding, and resided close to the active site of the enzyme. The results reveal that all the duplexes, hybrid-, DNA-, and RNA-duplex, bind to the enzyme. From the linewidth analysis of the resonance peaks, it was found that the exchange rates for the binding were different between the hybrid and the other duplexes. The NMR and CD data suggest that conformational changes occur in the enzyme and the hybrid duplex upon binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4690"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4691"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4692"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4693"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4694"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4695"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
