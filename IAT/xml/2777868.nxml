A classic role for ubiquitin is to flag proteins for destruction by the proteasome. Recent studies indicate that ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g. Rad23, Dsk2, Rpn10) play a pivotal role in transferring ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome. However, the specific role of these ubiquitin receptors remains poorly defined. A key to unraveling the functions of these ubiquitin receptors is to identify their cellular substrates and biological circuits they are involved in. Although many strategies have been developed for substrate isolation, the identification of physiological targets of proteolytic pathways has proven to be quite challenging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a genome-wide functional screen, we have identified 11 yeast genes that cause slower growth upon their overexpression in cells lacking two ubiquitin-binding proteins Rad23 and Dsk2. Our results suggest that proper functioning of Rad23 and Dsk2 is required for efficient pheromone response, transcription, amino acid metabolism, and DNA damage response. Two proteins identified by the screen are shown to be proteolytic substrates of Dsk2, validating the large scale synthetic dosage lethality screen as a new strategy for identifying substrates of a specific degradation pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, as proof-of-concept, we show that a synthetic dosage lethality screen, which is based on the toxicity induced by gene overexpression, offers an effective, complementary method to elucidating biological functions of proteolytic pathways.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In eukaryotes, the 26S proteasome handles the majority of regulated proteolysis and is pivotal for the proper function of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most proteins that are targeted to the proteasome for degradation are first modified by the ubiquitin (Ub) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Specifically, successive Ub molecules join to form a Ub chain on the substrates. How the ubiquitylated substrate is then delivered to and degraded by the 26S proteasome remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is now widely accepted that Ub-binding proteins (e.g. Rad23, Rpn10, and Cdc48) play important roles in facilitating substrate transfer to the proteasome. These proteins have distinct substrate specificity and functionally cooperate for substrate proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, how any one of these proteins works <italic>in vivo </italic>remains largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Rad23 belongs to a family of proteins that contain both the Ub-associated (UBA) domain and a <underline>Ub</underline>-<underline>l</underline>ike (UBL) motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The UBA motif binds specifically to Ub chain/conjugates <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The UBL motif directly binds the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Through these domain-mediated interactions, UBA/UBL proteins link ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, there are three UBA/UBL-containing proteins, Rad23, Dsk2 and Ddi1, which have been implicated in Ub-mediated proteolysis. The loss of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Rad23 and Dsk2 leads to the stabilization of an artificially designed Ub-fusion substrate Ub<sup>V76</sup>-V-&#x003b2;gal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the cell cycle inhibitor Far1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], misfolded protein CPY* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], an ER protein Hmg2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and the homologues of Rad23 are involved in the degradation of the CDK inhibitor Rum1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Pax3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the tumor suppressor p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with the role of Rad23 and Dsk2 in post-ubiquitylation events, the stabilized substrates in <italic>rad23&#x00394; dsk2&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells are fully ubiquitylated. Rad23 and Dsk2 play overlapping functions since cells lacking both <italic>RAD23 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>are more sensitive to various stress conditions (e.g., higher temperature, canavanine, high salt) than either single mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the biological pathways that require the functioning of Rad23 and Dsk2 remain to be identified.</p><p>Not all proteolytic substrates are degraded by the Rad23/Dsk2-dependent pathway. Other Ub-binding proteins, Rpn10, Rpn13, and the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex also promote proteasome-mediated proteolysis and exhibit distinct substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For example, the cell cycle protein Clb2 requires Rpn10, but not Rad23 for its degradation. And Deg1-GFP is degraded by the Cdc48/Ufd1 pathway, independent of Rpn10 and Rad23. The principle underlying the division of labor among these Ub-binding proteins is far from clear. A key to unraveling the functions of these Ub receptors (e.g. Rad23, Rpn10) is to identify their cellular substrates and biological functions. For example, using mass spectrometry, more than 50 proteins were shown to be preferentially accumulated in cells lacking <italic>RPN10 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These putative Rpn10 substrates are involved in cell cycle control, protein transport, metabolism, and transcription.</p><p>Here, we employ a new method to identify the biological function of Rad23 and Dsk2. The lack of overt phenotypes in <italic>rad23&#x00394; dsk2&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells likely reflects that redundant pathways are employed in buffering against mutations. Using a synthetic enhancement approach, we have isolated 11 genes that when overexpressed cause slow growth in <italic>rad23&#x00394; dsk2&#x00394; </italic>mutants. Our data expand the physiological processes that involve Rad23 and Dsk2. Furthermore, we show that two of the encoded proteins isolated by this method are ubiquitylated and degraded by the Dsk2-dependent pathway. Our results also suggest that the synthetic dosage lethality screen can be used to isolate physiological targets of a specific proteolytic pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains, media and plasmids</title><p>Yeast cultures were grown in rich (YPD) or synthetic media containing standard ingredients and 2% glucose (SD medium), 2% raffinose (SR medium), or 2% raffinose + 2% galactose (SRG medium).

Many strategies have been developed in the past to isolate the substrates of a particular Ub/proteasome pathway with varying degrees of success. Most of these methods explore the facts that substrates directly bind to the degradation machinery and/or substrates are ubiquitylated. Two challenges often encountered in these endeavors are the transient nature of the interaction between substrates and degradation components, and low levels of substrate expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To identify the physiological functions of Rad23 and Dsk2, we employed a synthetic dosage lethality screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The premise of SDL is that increased levels of a protein have little toxic effect on the growth of a wild-type strain but may cause growth retardation or even lethality in a mutant strain. Previous studies suggest that this strategy can be adapted to isolate substrates of the Ub/proteasome system. For example, overexpression of several cell cycle proteins (e.g., Clb2, Sic1, Scc1) in proteolysis-deficient cells (e.g. <italic>apc </italic>mutant, <italic>cdc34 </italic>mutant, <italic>ubr1 </italic>mutant) led to extremely slow cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). The growth defect induced by substrate Scc1 overexpression is particularly striking in the case of <italic>ubr1&#x00394; </italic>cells lacking the E3 enzyme of the N-end rule degradation pathway, since the absence of <italic>UBR1 </italic>alone does not significantly alter cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Accumulation of some proteasomal substrates leads to slower cell growth</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Compromised degradation of Scc1, but not Arg-&#x003b2;gal, in <italic>ubr1&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells causes toxicity. The plasmids bearing the N-end rule substrate Arg-&#x003b2;gal or Scc1 were separately introduced into wild-type JD52 or <italic>ubr1&#x00394; </italic>cells as indicated. The expression of these substrates are regulated by the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1 </italic>promoter. Exponentially growing yeast cells were spotted onto glucose-containing SD-ura (expression off) and galactose-containing SG-ura (expression on) media in serial five-fold dilutions.

In other words, would accumulation of large amounts of any substrate lead to growth retardation in proteolysis-deficient cells?

Deletion of <italic>UBR1 </italic>leads to the accumulation of Arg-&#x003b2;gal, which does not affect cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Similarly, we found that compromised degradation of another model substrate of the proteasome Ub<sup>V76</sup>-Val-&#x003b2;gal does not elicit toxicity in <italic>rad23&#x00394; dsk2&#x00394; </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], indicating that the toxicity triggered by substrate accumulation may depend on the physiological function of the target protein. These results further suggest that the SDL screen can identify a subset of substrates of a given proteolytic pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of yeast genes which cause slower growth in rad23 dsk2 mutant cells upon overexpression</title><p>The genome-wide SDL screen was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Although many strategies have been developed for substrate isolation, the identification of physiological targets of proteolytic pathways has proven to be quite challenging. For example, the first genetically defined Ub-dependent proteolytic pathway (i.e. N-end rule) was discovered in the mid-1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Despite over a decade of intense efforts, the first cellular substrate of the N-end rule pathway was identified fortuitously. A key cell cycle protein, Scc1 is cleaved at the metaphase-anaphase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and the resulting carboxyl-terminal fragment is destroyed by the N-end rule pathway to maintain chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, overexpression of Scc1 leads to lethality in mutant cells lacking the N-end rule E3 enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, and reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). This finding highlights the difficulty in obtaining proteolytic substrates and also suggests that an SDL screen could be effective for substrate identification.</p><p>An SDL approach was first employed to uncover genetic interactions in DNA replication or chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. More recently, it was demonstrated that SDL screens could be used to identify novel targets of a protein kinase (i.e. Pho85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our study further extends the effectiveness of the SDL screen to the Ub/proteasome system. The advantages of SDL as a screening tool for proteolytic substrate identification include that the assay is performed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the protein expression levels are enhanced by the strong promoter (i.e. <italic>GAL1</italic>). Like other approaches for target discovery, SDL screens have limitations. Of approximately 5000 yeast genes we screened, only two Dsk2 substrates were isolated. Several factors may contribute to the high false negative level: 1) redundancy of various substrate delivery pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Several known Dsk2/Rad23 substrates (e.g. Sic1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] were not recovered in this screen. In the absence of Dsk2/Rad23, other Ub adaptor molecules (e.g. Rpn10, Cdc48, Ddi1, Rpn13) may maintain sufficient proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; 2) genes that lead to severe growth defects in wild-type cells with increased dosage are likely to be excluded from such analysis; 3) not all substrates would elicit enhanced fitness defects in proteolysis mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) the screen is an indirect way for target discovery. Large number of false positives, partly due to a low colony size cutoff, may mask some true positives; 5) screening strategy and criteria for target identification may need further refinement. For example, the rapid turnover or absence of particular substrates might be a requirement under very specific environmental or physiological conditions, which were not covered by our standardized screening protocol (e.g. degradation of nuclear-specific Far1 in response to mating pheromone). Nevertheless, given the difficulty involved in substrate isolation, we believe that SDL provides another way to delineate the functional relationship between a substrate and the specific degradation pathway.</p><p>To our knowledge, GST-Kre22 is the first substrate that requires only Dsk2, but not other Ub receptors (e.g. Rpn10, Rad23) for degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, C, E, G</xref>). Interestingly, overexpressed Kre22 but not other proteasomal substrates suppresses Dsk2-induced toxicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Although the precise mechanism underlying the Dsk2-triggered toxic effect is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], one possible explanation is that excessive Dsk2 may engage in the abnormal activities that interfere with cell growth. And increased amount of specific substrates may keep Dsk2 in check. Our results suggest that Kre22 could serve as an important tool to understand the Dsk2-dependent proteolysis.</p><p>Most proteins identified are not direct proteolytic substrates of Rad23 and Dsk2. This is not unexpected since other genes that function in the linear pathway of Rad23/Dsk2 target may also induce toxicity in <italic>rad23 dsk2 </italic>mutant cells upon their overexpression. For example, in a separate study on the function of Rad23 and Dsk2, we identified a cell cycle protein involved in the spindle pole body (SPB) duplication as a degradation target of Rad23 and Dsk2 (C.L., H.R., unpublished results). Interestingly, this protein is known to act upstream of Spc98, a component of the SPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is likely that increased levels of Spc98 mimic the accumulation of this Rad23/Dsk2 target involved in spindle regulation to affect SPB duplication, which in turn triggers growth retardation in <italic>rad23 dsk2 </italic>mutant cells. Therefore, although the other eight proteins identified by our screen are not regulated directly by Rad23 and Dsk2, we suspect that these proteins work with Rad23/Dsk2 targets <italic>in vivo </italic>and cellular responses to their overexpression require the function of Rad23 and Dsk2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, as proof-of-concept, we show that an SDL screen offers an effective, complementary method to elucidating biological functions of proteolytic pathways. Dsk2 was first identified 11 years ago in a genetic screen for genes involved in SPB duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To our knowledge, the Spc98-induced toxicity in <italic>rad23 dsk2 </italic>mutant cells is the second piece of evidence linking Dsk2 and Rad23 to SPB duplication, which will help us to unravel the specific role of Rad23 and Dsk2 in this process. It is also conceivable that the SDL screen can be adapted to identify relevant ubiquitylation enzymes involved in substrate turnover. The creation of RNAi knock-down libraries and ORF overexpression collections would extend the use of SDL screens in the Ub/proteasome system to higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SPB: spindle pole body; Ub: ubiquitin; UBA: <underline>ub</underline>iquitin-<underline>a</underline>ssociated; UBL: <underline>ub</underline>iquitin-<underline>l</underline>ike; SDL: <underline>s</underline>ynthetic <underline>d</underline>osage <underline>l</underline>ethality; His6: hexahistidine; GST: <underline>g</underline>lutathione <underline>S</underline><underline>t</underline>ransferase.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CL, DvD and YL performed the experiments.
