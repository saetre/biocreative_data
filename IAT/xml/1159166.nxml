In addition, the <italic>EWS</italic> gene is involved in other sarcomas and with yet different partners, such as <italic>WT1</italic> (Wilms tumour 1 gene) in desmoplastic small round cell sarcoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d; or <italic>CHN</italic> in myxoid chondrosarcoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

The chromosomal translocations in Ewing's and other sarcomas are considered as primary initiating events. Thus the EWS fusions function in the cancer precursor cell and are required throughout tumour formation until the emergence of the overt cancer, because the chromosomal translocation is present in the cancer at the time of presentation. The fusion protein may therefore be instructive by imparting a phenotype on the cell by affecting a specific differentiation programme, which must be part of the genetic make-up of the cancer stem cell, since the chromosomal translocation is an initiating and persistent feature. The pre-existing chromosomal translocation creates a cellular environment allowing secondary mutations to arise in progeny cells, resulting in overt cancer. Conditional mouse models of the <italic>EWS</italic>- and <italic>FUS</italic>-associated chromosomal translocations should give insights into how these fusions influence the malignant phenotype. We have analysed whether EWS fusions function only in the domain of mesenchymal progenitors and whether they function in other cell lineages, specifically within committed cells, as has been demonstrated for MLL fusions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have developed mouse models mimicking chromosomal translocations by employing homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells to create mutant alleles in mice.

We have sought to determine whether an Ews-ERG fusion can be oncogenic in a cell type not generally associated with human tumours (specifically in lymphoid cells) and also to determine whether Ews-ERG fusion can initiate leukaemia from committed cells. We found that clonal T cell lymphoma arose in the invertor model when Cre expression was controlled by the lymphocyte-specific <italic>Rag1</italic> gene, showing that Ews-ERG is leukaemogenic in lymphoid cells.

This <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertor model is diagrammatically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. In outline, homologous recombination in mouse ES cells was used to introduce a floxed <italic>ERG</italic> cDNA cassette downstream of <italic>Ews</italic> exon 7.

Targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts, and these yielded normal numbers of chimaeras, which gave rise to heterozygous carriers of the <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertor allele (invertor mice). In these invertor mice, Ews-ERG protein can only be made after Cre-mediated inversion and thus can be cell-specifically dependent on Cre expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Ews-ERG Fusion Protein Causes T Cell Neoplasia in Invertor Mice</title><p>We investigated the ability of Ews-ERG fusion protein to contribute to leukaemogenesis by causing the inversion of the <italic>ERG</italic>-containing cassette in lymphoid cells using <italic>Rag1-Cre</italic> knock-in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

The situation with the thymomas of invertor mice varied from mainly CD4+CD8+ DP cells (e.g., M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g005">Figure 5</xref>) to mainly CD8+ single positive (SP) cells (e.g., M3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g005">Figure 5</xref>) to mainly double negative cells (e.g., M4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thirteen of the cohort of 25 leukaemic invertor mice were analysed for their thymic T cell profile by FACS (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t001">Table 1</xref>). While we found either CD8+ SP or CD4+CD8+ DP thymomas, none showed a CD4+ SP phenotype. Two of the thymomas had a mixed phenotype comprising mainly CD8+ SP cells, with a sub-population of DP cells (M3 and M6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The clonality of these T cell tumours was assessed by filter hybridisation of genomic thymoma DNA with a T cell receptor &#x003b2; probe <italic>(Tcrb)</italic> from the J&#x003b2;2 region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d; (diagrammatically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The probe detects a 5-kb band in non-lymphoid DNA corresponding to the intact <italic>Tcrb</italic> gene; if V-D-J or D-J joins have occurred, new restriction fragments are created, giving rise to &#x0201c;rearranged&#x0201d; bands on the hybridisation autoradiograph. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g003">Figure 3</xref>B shows the rearrangement status of 12 of the <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> thymomas. All except one (M9) showed at least one rearranged <italic>J&#x003b2;2</italic> allele and several have two rearranged alleles (e.g., M18). Variable amounts of residual germ line allele were present. The <italic>Tcrb</italic> rearrangement status of the cohort of <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> leukaemic mice is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Single <italic>Igh</italic> allele rearrangements were observed in about half of the cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t001">Table 1</xref>), including ones in which FACS analysis and <italic>Tcrb</italic> clonality hybridisations showed the tumours to be clonal T cell malignancies.

In all cases, N-region diversity is present between the V-D and D-J junctions. In the thymoma DNA from M2, a non-productive join has also occurred, in addition to the productive one, resulting in an out-of-frame joint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>EWS-ERG Can Mediate Haematopoietic or Mesenchymal Tumourigenesis</title><p>Human cancers of mesenchymal origin involve the <italic>EWS</italic> gene with various partner genes, such as in the chromosomal translocation t(21;22)(q22;q12) where <italic>EWS</italic> fuses with <italic>ERG</italic> to encode a novel EWS-ERG fusion protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, <italic>EWS</italic> gene fusions with various partners are described in clear cell sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumours, chondrosarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma, suggesting that EWS fusion proteins are functional for various cell types of mesenchymal origin and that restrictions in humans are dictated largely by the cells in which the chromosomal translocations occur. We tested the hypothesis of cell type specificity by assessing the possible universality of <italic>EWS-ERG</italic> as an oncogene. Our experimental system was designed to invoke conditional, cell-specific expression of the Ews-ERG fusion to analyse the target cell in which it can function. Consistent EWS-ERG occurrence in human sarcomas suggests that it may only function in mesenchymal cells, where it may function in initiation of the cancer as well as in maintenance of the cancer stem cell (i.e., cells within the tumour that have self-renewing capacity and maintain the tumour). Our results show that lymphomas arise when Ews-ERG is aberrantly expressed in the committed cells of the lymphoid lineage.</p><p>The <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertor allele was activated in lymphocytes, using the <italic>Rag1-Cre</italic> knock-in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;, to determine if lymphoid malignancies would arise. We found that invertor <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> mice develop clonal T cell malignancies. The T cells were of varying phenotypes but the majority of cases expressed CD8 on the cell surface and had productive V-D-J&#x003b2; rearrangements, indicative of mature T cells. Since Cre-mediated inversion through <italic>loxP</italic> sites recreates the <italic>loxP</italic> sequence, there is potential for the cassette to flip back and forth with continued Cre expression. This had no obvious deleterious effect on tumourigenesis in the <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertors as judged by various criteria (tumour penetrance, consistent T cell phenotype, and pathology). Thus, the invertor allele of transformed cells may be fixed in the correct orientation for synthesis of <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> mRNA when <italic>Rag1-Cre</italic> is no longer effective. On the other hand, the lack of CD4+ SP thymomas is difficult to encompass with this explanation, suggesting that other biological mechanisms may be involved in this bias.</p><p>The <italic>Rag1-Cre</italic> mouse line used constitutively expresses Cre in lymphoid cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and the resulting Ews-ERG fusion causes T lymphocyte tumours in mice, which is not known in the spectrum of EWS-associated human cancers. On the other hand, FUS-ERG has been found in leukaemias, albeit myeloid type &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. This implies that the EWS-FUS fusion proteins could be effective in a spectrum of cell types, broader than normally seen in human malignancies (i.e., sarcomas and myeloid leukaemias). In some cells, it may be that EWS-FUS fusions are lethal and thus those cells acquiring a translocation would die; in others, the fusion protein may be tolerated and thus may become tumours. In this respect, the absence of B cell tumours in the <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertors is of interest as both B and T cells undergo inversion of the <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> cassette (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g004">Figure 4</xref>) because <italic>Rag1-Cre</italic> is expressed in both cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d; (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The absence of B cell tumours may reflect toxicity of the fusion protein for B cells although this seems unlikely given that we can detect the fusion mRNA in selected B220+ B lymphocytes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030242-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Alternatively, it may mean that Ews-ERG does not function in B cells or that the development of B cell tumours is inhibited by the T cell malignancies, which may arise earlier and then dominate the lymphoid compartment. The ability of Ews-ERG to specifically cause B cell tumours could be evaluated by using B-cell-specific Cre-expressing mouse lines such as <italic>CD19-Cre</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Ews-ERG Can Promote Tumourigenesis in Committed Cells</title><p>Our results show that the Ews-ERG fusion, normally restricted to sarcomas in humans, can initiate T lymphocyte tumours, if conditionally expressed in committed lymphoid cells. Leukaemogenesis in <italic>Ews-ERG</italic> invertor mice thus concurs with the hypothesis that EWS fusions can cause neoplasia arising in various cell types. Further, our data imply that the cellular context of <italic>EWS</italic>-associated chromosomal translocations in humans does not have to be a stem cell or even a multi-potent progenitor, as committed lymphocyte precursors expressing <italic>Rag</italic> recombinase genes are the leukaemic precursors in our invertor model. The same conclusions can be applied to <italic>FUS</italic>-associated chromosomal translocations that seem to be largely interchangeable with <italic>EWS,</italic> given the spectrum of cancers in which these are found and the relatedness of <italic>FUS-</italic> and <italic>EWS</italic>-coded proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, <italic>EWS</italic> or <italic>FUS</italic> chromosomal translocations probably arise more by virtue of accessibility of the genes to chromosomal translocations than by the precise cellular specificity of the resultant fusion proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of targeting constructs and homologous recombination</title><p>The <italic>Ews</italic> genomic targeting clone was constructed from &#x003b3; phage DNA isolated from mouse 129 DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

In summary, an invertor cassette comprising a short intronic region with an acceptor splice site, human <italic>ERG</italic> cDNA sequence (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), a polyA site, and the <italic>MC1neopA</italic> gene all flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites (depicted by black triangles) was knocked in, using homologous recombination, into <italic>Ews</italic> intron 8. The transcription orientation of the targeted <italic>ERG</italic> cDNA invertor cassette was opposite from that of the endogenous <italic>Ews</italic> gene after initial homologous recombination. Germ line carrier mice of this targeted allele were crossed with <italic>Cre</italic>-expressing mouse strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and, as indicated in the right hand side of the diagram, the invertor cassette is turned around to create a transcription orientation identical with that of <italic>Ews</italic>. Thus, after transcription, a pre-mRNA is made with the donor splice site of <italic>Ews</italic> exon 7 adjacent to the acceptor site of the invertor cassette, allowing post-transcriptional fusion of <italic>Ews</italic> with <italic>ERG</italic> in an analogous format to that found in human sarcomas with t(21;22).</p><p>(B) Genomic sequence adjacent to the <italic>Ews</italic> exon 7 and the <italic>ERG</italic> invertor cassette (the derived amino acid sequence is shown in the single letter code) obtained from DNA of ES cells and of thymus after Cre-mediated inversion. The <italic>Ews</italic> intron 7/8 donor splice site is indicated by an arrow. The boxed sequence ( TCTAG/ CGAT) corresponds to the ligation of filled-in XbaI (<italic>Ews</italic> genomic) and ClaI (<italic>ERG</italic> invertor cassette) sites (for detailed description see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030242-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;). The boxed XbaI site ( TCTAGA) corresponds to the position of cloning of the mouse <italic>Af4</italic> intronic sequence (shaded) in the <italic>ERG</italic> invertor cassette. On the 3&#x02032; side of the fused XbaI-ClaI sites, there is a <italic>loxP</italic> site originating from the <italic>ERG</italic> invertor cassette (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) followed by the <italic>Af4</italic> intron 4 (shaded) upstream of the <italic>ERG</italic> cDNA sequence.

DNA was prepared from the thymoma and other tissues of M18, cleaved with EcoRI and hybridised to the 5&#x02032; <italic>Ews</italic> probe (which detects a 5-kb targeted <italic>ERG</italic> cassette fragment or a 6.5-kb Cre-inverted fragment). If the <italic>ERG</italic> cassette is inverted by Cre activity, the size of the EcoRI fragment increases from the initial targeted gene size, as indicated in the maps below the figure. The data shown are for DNA extracted from spleen (spl), thymus (thy), liver (liv), kidney (kid) or tail (ES cell DNA is used as a control). The Cre-mediated inverted band (&#x0223c;6.5 kb) is evident in thymus DNA (thymoma). The summary of the data from the cohort of invertor mice is in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t002">Table 2</xref>. Note that despite extensive infiltration of spleen detected by histology, we cannot see the inverted band by Southern blot; this presumably reflects regional clustering of neoplastic cells in spleen.

Each of 12 thymoma DNAs that were compared showed one or two J&#x003b2;2 alleles rearranged, signifying that these tumours were clonal T cells. In some thymoma samples, there is almost complete absence of the germ line band, indicating that the thymuses of these mice are solely comprised of malignant clonal T cells. DNA sequence analysis of the V-D-J junctions of mice M2, M5, M13, and M18 showed functional V-D-J joins (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030242-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>(C) Autoradiograph showing rearrangement status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes.
