A single cell from this population was sufficient to recreate a whole gland, and they were coined somatic mammary stem cells. These subpopulations are separated by their high expression of both CD24 and CD49f (&#x003b1;6 integrin, or CD29, &#x003b2;1 integrin), but their purity is unlikely to be higher than 5&#x00025;. Neither of these markers alone is useful for the identification of stem cells, or indeed resolution of whole mammary epithelial cell populations. Therefore, the behavior of the cells that are key to the growth or regeneration of glands has not yet been described.

Furthermore, the cells tend to become senescent in culture.

However, most basal cells have a low cell surface expression of Lrp5, and only cells with a high level have enriched stem cell function. This fraction includes 80&#x00025; of the mammary stem cells. Lrp5 is unique amongst the markers described so far for mammary epithelial populations for providing significant levels of stem cell enrichment without combining it with other markers.</p><p>Wnt1-induced mouse mammary tumors share a transcriptional signature with Brca1&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and carcinogen-induced tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Herschkowitz1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and these in turn share components of their basaloid signature with human basaloid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Perou1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Characteristically, all of these tumors have residual basal cells, and are likely to derive from the basal lineage. It is perhaps not surprising then that the key components of the oncogenic Wnt signaling pathway are specifically expressed by basal cells.</p><p>There are data to suggest that gain of function of Lrp5 or -6 is important to breast cancer. Some human breast cancer cells have an autocrine Wnt signaling loop (Bafico et al 2004). Recently, a splice variant of Lrp5, &#x00394;Lrp5, was found in the majority (85&#x00025;) of breast tumors, and was required for their continued growth. The deletion of the variant exons by splicing was associated with resistance to inhibition by Dkk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Bjorklund1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that ectopic Wnt signaling could be an important source of growth dysregulation in breast tumors. These tumors are not all basaloid, they include tumors of many classes, which suggests that the Lrp5-dependent growth pathway could become viable in many candidate tumor precursor cell types.</p><p>Lrp5 and -6 are co-expressed in the majority of basal cells. Lrp6 co-expression is high enough that the absence of Lrp5 has no effect on Wnt transactivation in response to Wnt3A (with no gross transcriptional compensation of Lrp6 mRNA). However, there is a very specific effect of the loss of <italic>Lrp5</italic> on the maintenance of adult somatic stem cell activity. This corresponds to the lack of tumorigenicity of Wnt1 in <italic>Lrp5</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mammary glands (Lindvall et al, 2006). This could be explained by the following scenarios - 1) Lrp5 has a distinct function in mammary stem cell biology compared to Lrp6, 2) Lrp5 expression augments Lrp6 expression to push the total expression over a critical threshold for growth promotion, 3) both Lrp5 and -6 are required for the stem cell function, 4) the ligand for Lrp5/Fzd is not Wnt1/Wnt3A (whereas Wnt3A binds and stimulates Lrp6/Fzd), or 4) Lrp5 has a different subcellular presentation from Lrp6.</p><p>Often, Lrp5/6 are used in experiments interchangeably, since they exhibit high sequence homology.

This specificity has been demonstrated for Wnt5A, which can induce canonical signaling only when Fzd4 and Lrp5 (not Lrp6) are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Mikels1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Wnt5A is known to be expressed and bioactive during mouse mammary gland development; a gain of function inhibits ductal outgrowth, and loss promotes hyperproliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Roarty1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Most Fzd mRNAs are expressed in virgin ductal mammary glands, except for Fzd4. If Fzd4 is expressed, it is a very low level, or in a very small subpopulation (unpublished data, Y C Kim and C M Alexander).</p><p>The overall output of canonical and other responses depends upon the relative amount of receptors and ligands. Non-canonical and canonical pathways can inhibit each other, and even non-productive interactions (for example Wnt5A:Lrp6) can compete with normal signaling activities (for example, activation of the non-canonical target Rac1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Bryja1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Hendrickx1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that Lrp5 binds Wnt5A during normal development (with no canonical signaling effect), but the absence of Lrp5 enhances the inhibitory effects of Wnt5A on ductal outgrowth (and more specifically, stem cell self-renewal).</p><p>Although the embryonic outgrowth of mammary rudiments is Wnt-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Andl1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-DasGupta1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the phenotype of early mammary development of <italic>Lrp5</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is only marginally affected. This suggests that only the adult somatic ductal stem cells require Lrp5, for either 1) stem cell specification during tree outgrowth, or 2) survival in adult glands. Prior modeling has predicted that if most cells in the mammary rudiment have at least 30 division cycles, there is a reserve of growth potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Paguirigan1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, the challenge of development appears to be to control and attenuate the growth potential to enable functional differentiation. In other words, there is no need to invoke stem cells to explain the growth associated with ductal outgrowth, estrus cycling, or pregnancy. The <italic>Lrp5</italic> null mouse is an example of this, as is the <italic>&#x003b2;1 integrin</italic> null mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Taddei1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Li1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Pontier1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Both these strains show approximately normal ductal extension, but neither ductal tree has significant regenerative capacity. Yet, we report that the stem cell-deficient gland is affected in a predictable way. When mammary epithelial cell populations are transferred to culture, there is increased expression of senescence-associated markers, such as p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and TAp63. (Our data suggests that senescence markers are transient <italic>in vivo</italic>, unless glands are actively growing; presumably cells are removed by apoptosis or autophagy). By separating the luminal and basal cells for independent culture, we show that the effect of the Lrp5 null mutation is evident not only in the basal cell population (where we would anticipate the effect of this mutation), but also in the luminal cells. We propose that this is consistent with the stem cell origin of this effect.</p><p>Cellular senescence is described as a natural mechanism of tumor suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006594-Ruzankina1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism of several tumor suppressors has been demonstrated to be the induction of senescence or apoptosis.

We conclude that profound differences in regenerative potential are not necessarily reflected at the gross level of epithelial organogenesis.
