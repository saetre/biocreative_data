Visually activated Arc did not colocalize with PV and was discarded from further studies. MD decreased visually induced c-Fos activation in GAD67 and CR positive neurons. The CB population responded to MD with a decrease of CB expression, while PV cells did not show any effect of MD on c-Fos expression. The persistence of c-Fos expression induced by deprived eye stimulation in PV cells is not likely to be due to a particularly low threshold for activity-dependent c-Fos induction. Indeed, c-Fos induction by increasing concentrations of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin in visual cortical slices was similar between PV cells and the other cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that PV cells are particularly refractory to MD, suggesting that different cortical subpopulation may show different response to MD.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well known that MD shifts the OD of neurons in the binocular portion of the primary visual cortex in favour of the nondeprived eye during a sensitive period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Wiesel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is still poorly understood whether all cortical cells shift similarly in response to MD. Recent data have shown that some cortical cells shift their response in favour of the deprived eye, with the direction of the shift critically depending on the amount of open-eye input and the net visual drive experienced during MD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-MrsicFlogel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies in cortical slices also show cell-specific effects of MD. For instance, visual deprivation can induce a cell-specific potentiation in the circuit between fast-spiking inhibitory cells and pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Maffei1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Inhibitory neurons have been involved in the mechanisms controlling visual cortical plasticity by several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Hensch1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that the effect of MD depends on the balance between excitation and inhibition, with the inhibitory circuitry acting as a &#x0201c;plasticity gate&#x0201d; over the excitatory components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Kirkwood1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, interfering with inhibitory function alters the response to MD: mice with a genetic deletion of the GAD65 isoform of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme have no OD shift after MD, and this deficit can be restored by enhancement of inhibition with benzodiazepines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Hensch2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that MD alters the excitation/inhibition balance by acting differentially on inhibitory neuronal populations. Indeed, a recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study of visual calcium responses showed a delayed effect of MD on inhibitory neurons labelled by GFP knocked in the <italic>GAD67</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Gandhi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

In particular, inhibitory interneurons can be classified according to the diverse expression of Ca-binding proteins, identifying three mainly non-overlapping populations, containing respectively parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), or calretinin (CR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-DeFelipe1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Defelipe1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present work we analyze the effects of MD on the cells positive for the general marker of inhibitory neurons GAD67 or for the specific markers PV, CB and CR, using an anatomical approach based on the activity-dependent expression of Arc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Tagawa1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and c-Fos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Majdan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. While Arc showed little co-localization with inhibitory interneurons even after visual stimulation, c-Fos expression was clearly induced by visual stimulation in inhibitory cells. c-Fos induction is a good marker of suprathreshold neuronal activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Dragunow1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Lanahan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that was previously used to assess MD effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Majdan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we adopted c-Fos staining coupled to GAD67, PV, CB and CR staining after visual stimulation of a long-term deprived eye to investigate MD effects on neuronal populations expressing these markers. We found that MD affected GAD67 and CR positive cells by reducing visual induction of c-Fos. CB positive neurons responded to MD by reducing CB expression. In contrary, MD did not affect visual activation of c-Fos in PV cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>c-Fos is a marker of the cortical effects of long-term MD on the inhibitory circuitry</title><p>To study the effects of long-term MD on the visual response of specific cortical interneurons, we used immunohistochemistry for the activity-dependent markers c-Fos and Arc.

To study whether this contralateral bias is also present in visual c-Fos activation within the different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons, we analyzed the strength of the rat ipsilateral and the contralateral pathways in activating c-Fos in cells positive for GAD67, CB, CR and PV. Visual c-Fos induction cannot be used to assess ocular dominance at single cell level, however the measure of c-Fos activation by visual stimulation of the contralateral and the ipsilateral pathways is a measure of the overall binocularity. Therefore, we measured population binocularity by calculating the ratio (C/I ratio) between the number of c-Fos positive cortical cells detected after stimulation of the contralateral eye and the number of c-Fos positive cells detected after stimulation of the ipsilateral eye. The C/I ratio was initially calculated for the entire cortical population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004342-g002">fig. 2</xref>). The results showed that visual stimulation of the contralateral eye activated c-Fos in about twice the number of cells observed with ipsilateral eye stimulation. We then calculated the C/I ratio for the c-Fos labelled cells that were also positive for GAD67, CB, CR or PV. The C/I ratio within these inhibitory subpopulations was not different from the C/I ratio obtained for the entire cortical population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004342-g002">fig. 2</xref>), indicating that binocularity of these neuronal subpopulations is similar to the average binocularity of cortical cells.</p><fig id="pone-0004342-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004342.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Contra/Ipsi ratio (C/I) of visual c-Fos induction in cortical neurons.</title><p>The ratio between the number of c-Fos positive cells activated by contralateral and ipsilateral stimulation is reported.

Thus, a consequence of MD on CB cells was the reduction of CB expression, but it is not known whether they also reduced their visual c-Fos activation.</p><p>In summary, MD decreases visually induced c-Fos activation in GAD67 and CR positive neurons. In the CB population MD decreased CB expression, while PV cells did not show any effect of MD on PV or c-Fos expression. Thus, PV cells are uniquely refractory to MD among the principal classes of cortical inhibitory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PV cells do not have a specifically low threshold for pharmacological activation of c-Fos</title><p>To check whether the permanency of the response of PV cells to stimulation of the deprived eye was due to a reduced threshold for activity-dependent induction of c-Fos in these cells, we perfused cortical slices with physiological solution containing increasing concentrations of the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist picrotoxin.

The effects of MD were assessed by analysing the induction of the immediate-early gene c-Fos in response to visual stimulation of the deprived eye. The main results of our study were that inhibitory cells did respond to MD, but the neuronal subpopulation expressing PV was refractory to MD maintaining normal levels of c-Fos induction by stimulation of the deprived eye. Similar data were obtained in the cortices contralateral and ipsilateral to the deprived eye. Differently from PV cells, the other inhibitory subpopulations analyzed were affected by MD. The CR expressing neurons displayed reduced visual c-Fos activation after MD, whereas CB cells were the only subpopulation on which MD resulted in a reduction of the marker expression. Most likely the cells that had lost CB expression remained viable although they could be functionally impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Airaksinen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the loss of the CB marker precluded the investigation of c-Fos activation in these cells. Therefore, MD affected neurons belonging to the CB class by altering their neurochemistry and possibly also their functioning, but it is not known whether it also changed their visual responsiveness.</p><p>It is generally held that c-Fos is a reliable marker for identifying activated cells and central nervous system circuits that respond to physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Increased neuronal expression of c-Fos results from the complex interplay of several cellular pathways. Stimulation of membrane receptors and subsequent rise in second messengers, including Ca, followed by kinase activation results in the induction of c-Fos expression. Spiking activity is also able to trigger c-Fos expression by increasing Ca levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Dragunow1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Lanahan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies on mouse sensory neurons in cell cultures showed that c-Fos expression can be differentially regulated by different patterns of action potentials, and that the temporal dynamics of intracellular signalling cascades are critical in decoding and integrating information contained in the pattern of neural impulse activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Fields1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to c-Fos, an immediate-early gene that has also been used to assess the effects of MD is Arc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Tagawa1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we found that Arc expression was not present in PV cells either in basal condition or after visual stimulation. This result agrees with a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Vazdarjanova1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, showing that Arc does not co-localize with inhibitory neurons in the rat hindbrain. Thus, Arc is not suitable to analyze visually induced gene expression in different populations of inhibitory cells.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Lack of MD effects on PV cells</title><p>Our study indicates that PV cells can be particularly refractory to MD effects. One possible alternative explanation of the persistency of visual c-Fos responses in PV cells of MD rats could be that this cell type can achieve c-Fos expression even in response to the weak activity elicited by visual stimulation of the deprived eye inputs. The nonlinear response of immediate-early genes could then mask the difference between the weak and the strong inputs of the deprived and the nondeprived eye. However, we think that this possibility is unlikely because the direct stimulation of visual cortical slices with different doses of PTX elicited similar c-Fos activation in PV cells and in the other cortical cells. These data indicate that PV cells do not have a particularly low threshold for c-Fos induction. Therefore, the lack of MD effect on c-Fos activation in PV cells is more likely due to a specific response to MD of these cells, or of their afferent inputs, rather than to a different sensitivity of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in PV cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the lack of plasticity of PV cells seems to be rather specific for MD. Although initial studies suggested that PV expression can be regulated by MD, further analyses have indicated that PV expression is not altered by MD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Hada1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Tropea1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data confirm the lack of effect of MD on PV expression and they also demonstrate that visual activation of c-Fos in PV cells is unaffected by MD. By contrast, PV expression and the morphofunctional development of PV cells are responsive to dark rearing or TTX treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Huang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Tropea1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Gianfranceschi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation suggests that PV cells are able to activate mechanisms of plasticity in response to changes of incoming activity, but that these processes are not activated by MD.</p><p>Many indications involve PV cells in regulating the effects of MD on visual cortical circuits. PV cells display a characteristic fast-spiking behaviour depending on the selective expression of the Kv3.1 potassium channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Chow1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Weiser1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

During development, PV positive cells appear in the visual cortex at P11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Alcantara1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and continue their maturation during the critical period for OD plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-delRio1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, manipulations that accelerate or delay the time course of the critical period such as dark rearing, BDNF overexpression, removal of polisialic acid, and infusion of Otx2 correspondingly regulate developmental maturation of PV cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Huang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-DiCristo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Chattopadhyaya1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Sugiyama1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The alfa1 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, that is highly enriched at the postsynaptic site of the basket synapse formed by PV cells on pyramidal neurons, is responsible for the capability of early diazepam treatment to prematurely trigger OD plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Fagiolini2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, during late development PV cells become surrounded by components of the extracellular matrix inhibitory for structural plasticity, namely chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which condensate in perineuronal nets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Hartig1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Removal of CSPGs from the visual cortex of adult rats promotes visual cortical plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Pizzorusso1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that PV cell maturation could be an important determinant of plasticity in the visual cortex, but they do not address how PV cells intervene in the plasticity processes activated by MD. Recent data showed that visual deprivation has opposite effects on PV cells and excitatory star pyramidal cells. Moreover, visual deprivation was shown to induce a cell-specific potentiation in the circuit between fast-spiking inhibitory cells and pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Maffei1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Maffei2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, visual deprivation can differently affect inhibitory and excitatory circuits, resulting in an alteration of the balance between excitation and inhibition. A modification of the excitatory-inhibitory balance towards inhibition in MD animals could directly contribute to the OD shift induced by MD by depressing cortical responses to deprived eye stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Mower1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Sillito1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it has also been suggested that the inhibitory system could filter the activity of the deprived eye inputs favouring plasticity processes leading to their functional disconnection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Kirkwood1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Heynen1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, a certain level of GABA inhibition might be necessary to support associative mechanisms of plasticity that rely on the precise timing between pre- and postsynaptic elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004342-Fagiolini2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a persistent action of the inhibitory system in MD animals could be important also to feed the correct activity pattern into the plasticity mechanisms that underlie the OD shift induced by MD. Our data support these hypotheses by showing that PV cells, at difference from the other cortical cells, preserve visual c-Fos activation in response to stimulation of the deprived eye. Direct measures of visually evoked activity of PV cells in MD animals, albeit technically challenging, are needed to confirm these theories.</p><p>In summary, we provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that a specific subpopulation of cortical inhibitory interneurons, characterized by the expression of PV, is not affected by long-term MD. These data suggest that PV cells are endowed with specific plasticity mechanisms that could be at the core of their central role in regulating cortical circuit plasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal treatment and surgical procedures</title><p>All experiments were performed on Long Evans hooded rats according to the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health for care and use of laboratory animals, with housing at 21&#x000b0;C in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.
