Most of these studies have been conducted at the DNA level, by evaluating how SINE copies affect chromatin structure, DNA recombination, replication and transcription. The effect of SINE sequences in mRNAs and the corresponding impacts on splicing, editing, degradation and translation processes have also been evaluated. Recently, several SINE polIII-specific transcripts were shown to act as noncoding riboregulators of basic cellular processes, including transcription and translation, in stress situations or in specific tissues. In rodents, following heat shock, several members of the SINE B2 family are actively transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Allen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Espinoza1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Selfing plants with severe developmental defects gave progenies composed again of a mixture of plants with mild to severe developmental defects.

Although a perfect RNA duplex also could bind HYL1, this association was less efficient compared to SB1 RNA, suggesting that HYL1 prefers dsRNA substrates containing unpaired nucleotide bulges and/or distal loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Using an RNase V1 protection assay, we defined more precisely the SB1 RNA binding sites of HYL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We observed that HYL1 binds mainly to the first and longest SB1 stem-loop, which corresponds to the region of SB1 RNA that adopts a fold similar to pre-miRNAs. Indeed, the protected region includes an RNA duplex containing mismatches and extends into the single-stranded terminal loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

The variable phenotypic penetrance within each line also suggests a stochastic effect of the RNA on these transition steps. Although we do not know the precise molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these phenotypes, our data raise the possibility that an interaction between SB1 SINE RNA and a subset of dsRBPs, some of which are involved in RNAi, could contribute to the developmental defects. Using a double-stranded RNA binding domain from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> ADAR1, we have shown that SB1 RNA is fit to bind highly divergent dsRBPs, and therefore many dsRBPs could be affected by SINE RNA expression. Not all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> dsRBPs are known to be involved in RNAi. For example, FIERY2 is a dsRBP involved in transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Xiong1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, while two other dsRBPs of unknown function (At1g48650, at5g04895) contain a helicase domain. Therefore SB1 RNA potentially affects basic cellular processes other than RNAi, and this in turn could affect plant development.</p><p>Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we propose that SB1 RNAs interact <italic>in vivo</italic> with HYL1, and consequently modify the steady-state level of several miRNAs and tasiRNAs. In this scenario, tasiRNA accumulation would be indirectly affected because tasiRNA biogenesis relies on miRNA-guided cleavage (miR173 targets TAS1 and TAS2 and miR390 targets TAS3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Allen2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). DCL4-DRB4-dependent miRNA accumulation is unaffected in SB1 transgenic lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with the inability of SB1 RNA to bind DRB4 in gel retardation experiments. The SB1/HYL1 interaction and its molecular consequences on the miRNA pathway are unlikely to be solely responsible for the observed SB1-induced phenotype. Indeed, the global reduction of miRNA levels in SINE-expressing lines is generally moderate to low (from 0.5 to 0.8 of the initial amount) and this level of reduction does not always correlate with detectable increases in corresponding mRNA target levels (for examples see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>). These relatively modest changes might be because several of these miRNAs derive from multigene families and thus potentially arise from several RNA precursors. In such cases, SINE RNAs would need to compete with several differently structured RNA precursors to limit effectively miRNA production. Also, <italic>in vivo</italic>, such competitions likely are influenced by the varying tissue/spatial distributions of different miRNAs:HYL1 complexes, which would probably effect the capacity of SINE RNA to modulate the production of a given miRNA in a given tissue. In conclusion, we propose that SB1 RNA compete for several dsRBPs, not only HYL1, and that these competitions likely accounts for the extent and unusual characteristics (such as the variable penetrance) of the SINE-induced phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>SINE RNA Can Bind HYL1 but not DRB4</title><p>We observed that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, HYL1 binds efficiently different imperfect double-stranded RNA molecules, including the rapeseed SB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g003">3</xref>) and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SB2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000096.s001">Figure S1</xref>) SINE RNAs, while DRB4 only binds perfect RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000096-g003">3</xref>).

This could in turn be important for promoting the cleavage activity of DCL1 on pri-miRNAs or for helping to precisely define the cleavage site on pre-miRNAs to generate mature products.

Using a double-stranded RNA binding domain from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> ADAR1, we have shown here that the plant SB1 RNA is fit to bind highly divergent dsRBPs. Therefore, the common trend of structural evolution observed for tRNA-related SINE could result in similar constraints imposed by a subset of dsRBPs across eukaryote species. If true, this predicts that SINE RNAs are under selective pressure to keep intact their capacity to interact with some dsRBPs.

The reason why SINE RNA/dsRBP interaction would be under positive selective pressure is unclear, but precise and punctual expression of SINEs during a key development step or in a stress situation, could induce genetic and/or epigenetic variations and increase diversity and/or adaptability. It is interesting to note that SINE-specific expression in their natural host is highly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by complex genetic and epigenetic processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Kramerov1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Schmid1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Pelissier1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). SINEs are non-autonomous in their mobility and need the activation of an autonomous LINE partner to retrotranspose. Therefore, based on our results, we suggest that the main purpose of limiting SINE-specific transcription is not to prevent its mobility (the control of LINEs is sufficient to achieve this) but to preserve cell homeostasis by preventing SINE RNA to interact with a large subset of dsRPBs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Material</title><p>The construction of the SB1 expressing transgenic lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Pelissier1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and the <italic>hyl1</italic>, <italic>drb4</italic> mutant phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Han1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000096-Adenot1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> were described previously.

Prior to RNase V1 digestion, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcript of SB2 was subjected to protection by increasing concentrations of following dsRBPs: Dr2, HYL1, combination of Dr2 and HYL1, or DRB4. Regions protected by HYL1 are marked alongside short run gel (A), long run gel (B) and predicted folding pattern (C) by green bars. Three independent experiments gave similar results as the one presented. Nucleotides marked with asterisks seem to adopt more prominent helical structure upon protein binding and, therefore, become more prone to RNase V1 cleavage. (HL) represents a partially hydrolyzed RNA ladder. Denaturating RNase A and T1 digests give the position of pyrimidine and G residues respectively. The control lane shows untreated RNA samples and the (0) lane represent RNase V1 digestion without recombinant proteins added. A labeled 23-mer oligoribonucleotide was also loaded on the gel to help in band size determination. The binding of HYL1 to SB2 is weaker compared to SB1 or 11Dr2(7). In this case, both Dr2 and DRB4 are showing no effect on RNase V1 cleavage, suggesting their low <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinity to SB2 RNA.</p><p>(4.82 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000096.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000096.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>mRNA levels of HYL1, DCL1 and HEN1 genes involved in miRNA production are unchanged in the Col-0-SB1(18) transgenic line. (A) HYL1 mRNAs accumulate to similar levels in wild-type and Col0-SB1.7(18) line as indicated by Northern blot analyses using total RNA from aerial tissues of 14 days-old plants. (B) Similar results were obtained for HYL1, DCL1 and HEN1 transcript levels by SemiQ-RTPCR using flower total RNA as samples and Actin2 (ACT2) and Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as internal references, suggesting that the inhibition of miRNA production in SB1.7-expressing lines is not attributable to misexpression of one of the main genes from the miRNA pathway. First strand cDNA synthesis was done by using 0.8 &#x000b5;g of flower total RNA following treatment with DNAse (DNA-free kit; Ambion). PCRs were run for 25 cycles with the Actin2 (ACT2), Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) and HYL1-specific primers and for 29 cycles for DCL1 and HEN1. For DCL1 the primers are positioned from each side of the miR162 target site, allowing amplification of the full-length DCL1 transcript only.
