These mechanisms include secreted antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), melanization, clotting, and phagocytic hemocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b001">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The most deeply studied of these mechanisms, AMP secretion, is controlled by the <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> pathways, which regulate the transcription of AMP genes in the fat body. Signaling through the <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> pathways is activated by microbial elicitors; for example, the receptor peptidoglycan receptor protein LC, one receptor that triggers <italic>imd</italic> signaling, is activated by diaminopimelic acid&#x02013;containing peptidoglycan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This material is found on most Gram-negative bacteria as well as some Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p>Mutations affecting the <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> pathways severely immunocompromise flies. Although <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> mutant flies get sick and die from infections, this does not resemble many infectious processes in healthy humans. For example, an <italic>imd</italic> mutation essentially turns flies into a passive culture medium for <italic>Escherichia coli;</italic> the bacteria grow 1,000-fold in 24 h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Immunocompromised infected flies likely die from the enormous load of bacteria that can reach levels of more than 1&#x00025; of the mass of the fly. Death from massive numbers of microorganisms can happen in humans, particularly in immunocompromised patients; however, the infectious agents that are responsible for the greatest mortality in humans&#x02014;<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> HIV<italic>, Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> and diarrhea-inducing microbes&#x02014;do not work in this manner. Instead, relatively small numbers of these infectious agents cause various pathologies that lead to death. To study microbial pathogenesis in the fly, it is necessary to follow microbes that cause disease in wild-type flies.</p><p>Pathogens are different from nonpathogenic bacteria and simple molecular elicitors of innate immunity, and thus the results we see from experiments with pathogens will be different than those observed for simple elicitors like <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Micrococcus luteus</named-content>. For one thing, pathogens can override the strong immune defenses of the fly; this causes disease. In flies, as in humans, there is more than one type of disease that results from infection. Pathogens have been observed to kill the fly in at least four different ways: first, overactivation of the <italic>Toll</italic> or <italic>imd</italic> pathways can be pathogenic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;; second, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Vibrio cholera</named-content> fed to flies kills the fly through the secretion of toxins that presumably cause physiological changes to the gut &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;; third, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> causes a wasting disease in flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;; and fourth, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella typhimurium</named-content> secretes effectors through its type III secretory system that increase the pathogenicity of the microbe. The fly gene <italic>eiger,</italic> the fly's sole tumor necrosis factor homolog, is implicated in causing pathology during this infection because <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content>&#x02013;infected <italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies live longer than infected wild-type flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. It appears that there are many physiological routes that can lead to death following infection.</p><p>We have begun to try to understand these physiological routes to death by analyzing the role played by <italic>eiger</italic> in a variety of infections. The <italic>eiger</italic> mutation divided our group of pathogens into two unanticipated groups. The first group of microbes kills <italic>eiger</italic> mutants more rapidly than wild-type flies; this group includes a fungus as well as both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The second group of microbes kills <italic>eiger</italic> mutants at the same rate or more slowly than wild-type flies; this group includes a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterial species and a mycobacterium.</p><p>These results cut across the previous descriptions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immunity, which groups microbes according to their gross physical characteristics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The most obvious way to explain the grouping of these pathogens in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants is not by grouping microbes according to their Gram-staining properties or kingdom, but rather by their pathogenesis mechanisms; the first group of microbes consists of extracellular pathogens while the second group contains microbes that can grow within professional phagocytes. <italic>eiger</italic> appears to play a role in innate immunity in fighting extracellular pathogens but plays a role in driving pathogenesis when fighting some intracellular pathogens. This study demonstrates that the examination of real pathogens and the use of outputs other than AMP transcription leads to the discovery of unanticipated immune pathways and reveals new complexities in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>To determine the role <italic>eiger</italic> plays in fighting microbial pathogens, we tested a collection of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens that could cause either intracellular or extracellular infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030041-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our goal was to test a broad group of microbes that used different virulence mechanisms and were recognized by different innate immunity pathways.</p><p>We tested a heterozygous combination of two <italic>eiger</italic> null alleles <italic>(w<sup>1118</sup>; egr<sup>1</sup>/egr<sup>3</sup>)</italic> and compared this to an isogenic <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>eiger</italic> mutants died much faster than wild-type flies when challenged with <italic>Beauveria bassiana, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The members of this group of microorganisms are very different from each other and include Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a fungus. The smallest effect on survival was a 50&#x00025; reduction in the mean time of death for <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. bassiana</named-content> infections. The effect was strongest with <italic>eiger</italic> mutants infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> and <italic>E. faecalis;</italic> whereas the chosen doses were nonpathogenic to wild-type flies (i.e., they died at the same rate as media-injected controls), <italic>eiger</italic> mutants died within 2 d. The one common characteristic of this group is that these microbes are all expected to produce extracellular infections.</p><p><italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies did not die faster when infected with the three facultative intracellular pathogens we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We reported previously that <italic>eiger</italic> mutants live longer than wild-type flies when infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content>. This result led us to suggest that <italic>eiger</italic> activity could be deleterious for the fly and was a cause of pathology. We found that <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content>&#x02013;infected <italic>eiger</italic> mutants also live longer than infected wild-type flies. Finally, <italic>eiger</italic> mutants and wild-type flies survive exactly the same amount of time when infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content>.</p><p>We tested <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> as a nonpathogenic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030041-sg001">S1</xref>). We define a pathogen as a microbe that increases the death rate of infected flies as compared to a control fly injected with medium. This microbe was chosen because it played a major role in characterizing the immune response of the fly. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> is normally a good inducer of innate immune responses when injected into the fly but will only cause disease in flies missing the <italic>imd</italic> pathway. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> injection does not kill <italic>eiger</italic> mutants or wild-type flies. This suggests either that <italic>eiger</italic> does not play a role in fighting a nonpathogenic infection or that <italic>eiger</italic>'s role is redundant and therefore undetectable by this assay.</p><p>We next decided to determine whether <italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies were killed faster by extracellular pathogens because of increased bacterial growth or increased pathogenesis by monitoring bacterial proliferation in infected flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As before, bacteria were injected into age-matched male wild-type parental or isogenic transheterozygous <italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies. Flies were collected and homogenized following bacterial challenge to measure bacterial loads.</p><p>Of the four bacterial species that showed increased virulence in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants, two&#x02014;<named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cepacia</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content>&#x02014;had statistically significant increased growth rates in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants. There was no clear effect on <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. faecalis</named-content> growth rates in <italic>eiger</italic> versus wild-type flies. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> showed a large variation in bacterial numbers toward the end of the infection that suggested a trend toward increased growth; for example, the highest levels of bacteria found in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants were 10,000 higher than those seen in wild-type flies. However, because the variation was so great in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants, the difference between wild-type and <italic>eiger</italic> mutants was not statistically significant. We suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> might not cause synchronous infections and thus that some flies succumb to infection rapidly and have high numbers of bacteria while others take longer to die and maintain lower levels of bacteria. This would result in a huge range of bacterial titers in a group of injected flies. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> were cleared at comparable rates in <italic>eiger</italic> and wild-type flies. <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. bassiana</named-content> was not tested because we do not have a good quantitative method of measuring fungal growth. In summary, these bacterial growth measurements show that <italic>eiger</italic> mutants are unable to limit the growth of two and possibly three of the four extracellular pathogens tested. This experiment does not rule out the possibility that <italic>eiger</italic> mutants suffer greater pathological effects of infection but does suggest that <italic>eiger</italic> in a wild-type fly plays a role in reducing the numbers of extracellular microbes.</p><p>The proliferation of facultative intracellular pathogens did not increase in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants. As we published previously, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> levels remained constant in an <italic>eiger</italic> homozygote as compared to an isogenic wild-type fly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> numbers decreased significantly in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants with respect to wild-type flies even though both wild-type and mutant flies died at the same rate. Our interpretation is that <italic>eiger</italic> is somehow helpful for the growth of <italic>Listeria</italic>. We did not measure the growth rate of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content>.</p><p>There is no simple interpretation, using <italic>Toll</italic> or <italic>imd</italic> signaling, that can explain the difference in sensitivity of <italic>eiger</italic> mutants to the tested pathogens. If the <italic>eiger</italic> mutation resulted in decreased <italic>Toll</italic> signaling, then we would expect <italic>Listeria</italic> to kill the flies rapidly as has been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, a reduction of <italic>imd</italic> activity would immunocompromise the flies to <italic>S. typhimurium. imd</italic> mutants are very sensitive to <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> and will die within 24 h when infected with as little as a single colony-forming unit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, if <italic>imd</italic> signaling was affected, we would expect flies to become sensitive to <italic>E. coli,</italic> which they do not &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. We are forced to conclude that the strong effects of <italic>eiger</italic> on the pathogenesis caused by extracellular microbes are not caused by a reduction in signaling through the <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> pathways.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> signaling are not grossly reduced by a mutation in <italic>eiger,</italic> we measured the induction of AMP transcription in <italic>eiger</italic> and parent strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Flies were challenged with <italic>S. typhimurium, B. cepacia, L. monocytogenes,</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> as well as an LB control, and these conditions were compared to expression levels seen in uninfected flies. We chose this subset of bacteria because it included both Gram-positive and Gram-negative examples of intracellular and extracellular pathogens. <italic>Toll</italic> signaling was monitored by following <italic>drosomycin</italic> gene induction using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, although we note that there are no perfect <italic>Toll</italic> responsive genes and <italic>drosomycin</italic> is responsive to both <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. To measure the output of the <italic>imd</italic> pathway, we monitored the expression of the <italic>diptericin</italic> gene. No statistically significant changes in <italic>drosomycin</italic> transcription were seen between parental and eiger mutant flies. Some conditions caused a relatively small, but statistically significant increase in <italic>diptericin</italic> transcription in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants. We do not understand how the slightly higher levels of AMP transcription found in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants might affect the <italic>eiger</italic> phenotype. The important point is that <italic>eiger</italic> mutants did not have lower levels of AMP gene expression than did wild-type flies, demonstrating that the <italic>eiger</italic> phenotype is not caused by reduction in <italic>Toll</italic> or <italic>imd</italic> signaling.</p><p>As <italic>Toll</italic> and <italic>imd</italic> signaling, and thus the majority of the antimicrobial peptide response in the fly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, does not seem to be responsible for changes in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants, we next probed the cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030041-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To determine whether <italic>eiger</italic> mutations might affect hemocyte function, we monitored phagocytosis in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> were injected into the hemocoel of wild-type or <italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies and the injected flies were given 1 h to phagocytose the particles. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> was chosen because FITC-labeled dead <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> are commercially available and we predicted that <italic>eiger</italic> alters the ability of hemocytes to fight this pathogen. Trypan blue was injected into the hemocoel of the flies following the 1-h incubation period. This dye quenches the fluorescence of extracellular FITC but allows phagocytosed particles to fluoresce brightly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The flies were examined around the dorsal anterior abdomen because hemocytes tend to gather in this area. Changes in phagocytosis can be seen by changes in the numbers of phagocytosing cells or by the fluorescence intensity. Both of these characteristics appear altered in <italic>eiger</italic> mutants compared to parental flies, suggesting that <italic>eiger</italic> mutant hemocytes were either reduced in number or had reduced phagocytic activity, or both.</p><p>We note that uninfected <italic>eiger</italic> mutants live longer than wild-type flies. This raises the possibility that the increased survival of <italic>eiger</italic> mutant flies after infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> is simply a consequence of general increased longevity. We argue that this possibility is unlikely, because it assumes that the cause of death due to old age is the same as the cause of death by infection; this is not observed in other animals and it is not supported by examination of published microarray studies of flies dying from infection or old age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030041-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Instead, we argue that <italic>eiger</italic> is a driver of pathogenesis. If <italic>eiger</italic> is indeed required to fight infections but can also cause pathology, then the phenotype we observed for a given infection is likely the sum of the positive and negative effects of <italic>eiger</italic>. Regardless of the interpretation of the effects of <italic>eiger</italic> on <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. marinum</named-content>, the important result remains that <italic>eiger</italic> mutations divide the fly's response to pathogens into two groups.</p><p>Why does <italic>eiger</italic> affect different microbes in different ways? We argue that <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> is removed from flies so rapidly and via so many mechanisms that the effects of <italic>eiger</italic> cannot be measured easily because of redundancy. In contrast, during an infection with a real pathogen, it may be easier to measure changes in immunity because the fly is fighting hard for survival and its immune mechanisms are not acting in a redundant fashion. Extracellular pathogens are clearly fought by the fly using <italic>eiger</italic>-dependent mechanisms because the loss of <italic>eiger</italic> results in a deeply sensitive phenotype. It is intriguing that flies lacking <italic>eiger</italic> are no worse at fighting intracellular pathogens. This suggests that these intracellular pathogens are normally immune to the effects of wild-type <italic>eiger</italic>. Intracellular pathogens like <italic>M. marinum, L. monocytogenes,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. typhimurium</named-content> use different virulence mechanisms for growing inside cells, but the common thread is that they can survive in professional phagocytes. We suggest that <italic>eiger</italic> function somehow alters hemocytes to increase their potency against microbes. The reduced ability of <italic>eiger</italic> mutant hemocytes to phagocytose <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> compared to wild-type hemocytes supports this hypothesis.
