We have investigated novel human endothelial receptors targeted by Opc and observed that Opc-expressing bacteria interacted with a 100 kDa protein in whole-cell lysates of human endothelial and epithelial cells. The identity of the protein was established as &#x003b1;-actinin by mass spectrometry. Opc expression was essential for the recognition of &#x003b1;-actinin whether provided in a purified form or in cell extracts. The interaction of the two proteins did not involve intermediate molecules. As there was no demonstrable expression of &#x003b1;-actinin on the surfaces of any of the eight cell lines studied, the likelihood of the interactions after meningococcal internalization was examined. Confocal imaging demonstrated considerable colocalization of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> with &#x003b1;-actinin especially after a prolonged period of internalization. This may imply that bacteria and &#x003b1;-actinin initially occur in separate compartments and co-compartmentalization occurs progressively over the 8 h infection period used. In conclusion, these studies have identified a novel and an intracellular target for the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> Opc invasin. Since &#x003b1;-actinin is a modulator of a variety of signalling pathways and of cytoskeletal functions, its targeting by Opc may enable bacteria to survive/translocate across endothelial barriers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nm) is a human respiratory mucosal commensal and occurs asymptomatically in up to 30% of the healthy population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cartwright, 1995</xref>). However, in susceptible individuals it can cause septicaemia and meningitis which can be life threatening. In such cases, Nm can spread rapidly from the site of colonization traversing the epithelial and endothelial barriers to reach the blood and, by the haematogenous route, disseminate to other organs including the brain. The rapidity of its spread may result in fatality as antibiotic therapy can be ineffective unless administered during early stages of the disease. Vaccines effective against several important disease-associated serogroups (A, C, W135, Y) are available and are based on their polysaccharide capsules. However, no effective vaccine is yet available against serogroup B strains currently responsible for the majority of meningococcal infections in the UK. Numerous studies have engaged in investigations on the mechanisms of pathogenesis with the aim of identifying novel vaccine antigens as well as intervention strategies which may prevent the worst outcomes of the infection. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of the molecular components of bacteria and the host that interact during infection and dissemination is yet unavailable.</p><p>An important aspect of Nm pathogenesis is its ability to interact specifically with human epithelial and endothelial cells. Several major meningococcal surface structures that contribute to the successful host cell adhesion and invasion include the outer membrane proteins Opa and Opc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">de Vries <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hardy <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The Opa proteins of Nm and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and the Opc protein expressed only by Nm are beta-barrelled transmembrane molecules with four and five extracellular loops respectively. They are basic in nature and target several human receptors of which at least one class of receptors, the heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is recognized by both these proteins particularly on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">de Vries <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). It is proposed that the basic residues of the proteins contained within the second loop (also known as HV1) of certain Opa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Grant <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) or within the first two loops of Opc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Prince <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) may be involved in targeting proteoglycans. Notably, more recent studies suggest alternative Opc sites may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cherezov <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, these adhesins may also bind to other receptors which may determine tissue tropism. For example, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that Opc is more effective in mediating acapsulate Nm adhesion to and invasion of endothelial cells than Opa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">1993</xref>). Observations on primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that bacteria expressing high levels of Opc were highly invasive for HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>); and while Opc also mediates invasion of epithelial cell lines of different origins (e.g. Chang, Hep-2 and A549), this occurs to a lesser extent compared with the invasion of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, certain meningococcal strains of the A4 cluster and the ET-37 complex that lack the <italic>opc</italic> gene can cause serious cases of meningococcal septicaemia but are less likely to cause meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sarkari <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Seiler <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), perhaps suggesting an important role of the Opc protein in crossing of the blood&#x02013;cerebrospinal fluid (B&#x02013;CSF) barrier. This notion has been further supported by a recent study that used Opc-deficient and Opc-proficient isolates of clonal groups ET-37 and ET-5 respectively. The strains of ET-37 complex were not able to cross human brain microvascular cell monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Opc-deficient bacteria were also not invasive for HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In our previous studies on the mechanisms of Opc-mediated interactions with human endothelial cells, integrins were identified as the major receptors at the apical surfaces of the cells. Binding to integrins occurred via a sandwich mechanism in which Opc was shown to first bind to serum-derived integrin ligands, particularly vitronectin and to a lesser extent fibronectin, and subsequently form a trimolecular complex with the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Such Opc interactions involving human brain endothelial integrins were observed more recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>. (2002</xref>). In addition to integrins, our previous studies also demonstrated the presence of other receptors for Opc on the basolateral surfaces of human endothelial cells. In this case, the interaction was shown to be independent of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to establish the identity of other possible receptors for the Opc protein, studies were undertaken using several distinct cell lines of human origin. The studies have led to the discovery of a novel interaction of meningococcal Opc protein with the human intracellular cytoskeletal protein &#x003b1;-actinin. Moreover, Opc-expressing bacteria were shown to colocalize with &#x003b1;-actinin after cellular invasion. Since previous studies have also shown that meningococci can traverse human cell monolayers using a transcellular route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pujol <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), the overall implication is that targeting of &#x003b1;-actinin, which is involved in the modulation of several receptor and cytoskeletal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>), may enable meningococci to influence cellular functions to facilitate their passage across human barrier cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of a 100 kDa Opc-binding protein of endothelial and epithelial cell lines</title><p>In an attempt to identify receptors other than integrins that might interact with Opc-expressing Nm, initially, proteins from whole-cell lysates of HUVECs were separated by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted and the blots were overlaid with Opc<sup>+</sup> and Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup> variants of Nm serogroup B strain MC58 and serogroup A strain C751 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). The results demonstrated that Opc-expressing Nm isolates bound to a 100 kDa protein present in HUVEC lysates. This interaction appeared to be Opc specific as neither Opa<sup>+</sup>Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup> nor Opa<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Nm bound to this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Other receptors such as HSPGs (for Opa and Opc) and CEACAMs (for Opa) were not detected presumably as these receptors are present at very low levels in the cells examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Majuri <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), do not maintain the configuration required for Opa/Opc binding or do not enter the gel systems due to their size (HSPGs molecular weight: &#x0003e; 400 000). Further, as integrin binding of Opc relies on prior binding to RGD-containing ligands, this interaction may not be observed as these ligands were not supplied and because integrin binding to its ligands requires certain conformation of the heterodimeric receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boettiger <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Meningococcal derivatives and their characteristics.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain/derivative</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serogroup</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Capsule</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pili</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opc</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opa</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MC58 (blood isolate)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opc<sup>+</sup>Opa<sup>+</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Opa<sup>+</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opc<sup>+</sup>Pil<sup>+</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C751 (CSF isolate)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opc<sup>+</sup>(Opa<sup>&#x02212;</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opa<sup>+</sup>(Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OpaD+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opa<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Opc<sup>&#x02212;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf1-1"><label>a</label><p>1: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Virji <italic>et al</italic>.

A dose-dependent inhibition of Opc<sup>+</sup> Nm binding to solid-phase receptor by soluble &#x003b1;-actinin was observed further confirming the interactions between Opc and &#x003b1;-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody inhibition assays</title><p>In blocking experiments, using polyclonal anti-&#x003b1;-actinin antibody, a dose-dependent inhibition of binding of soluble &#x003b1;-actinin to Opc-expressing bacteria coated onto ELISA plates was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2F</xref>). The pre-incubation of the antibody B306, directed against loop 2 of Opc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Merker <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), when used to block its epitope, caused a dose-dependent inhibition but did not abrogate &#x003b1;-actinin binding even at 15 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Another mAb against Opc, 154,D-11, which binds to loops 4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Merker <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), also caused some inhibition, but at much lower level compared with B306. In addition, heparin at high concentrations (up to 80 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) caused only a partial inhibition (relative inhibition: B306, <italic>c</italic>. 55%, 154,D-11 and heparin, &#x0003c; 30%). Overall, from these preliminary studies on the potential Opc binding sites for &#x003b1;-actinin, it would appear that &#x003b1;-actinin binding site may reside close to the antibody B306 binding site. Partial inhibition by other Opc-binding antibodies and ligands may be due to the flexibility of the Opc loops bringing the various binding regions in close proximity of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bond <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cherezov <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and resulting in a level of steric hindrance.

Interestingly, meningococcal isolates not expressing the Opc protein exhibit a lower propensity to cause meningitis; this implies a potential role for Opc protein in crossing human brain endothelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sarkari <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Seiler <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The detailed mechanisms of Opc targeting of human receptors are thus critical in understanding the pathogenesis of meningitis. As all the potential receptors for Opc have not been identified and previous studies have noted the existence of additional Opc receptors on human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), the current studies were undertaken to identify other target receptors for Opc. The approach of using bacterial overlay on Western blots of target cell proteins used in this investigation identified a novel receptor for Opc. This 100 kDa protein was identified as &#x003b1;-actinin by several criteria. The studies demonstrated a direct and specific binding of Opc to &#x003b1;-actinin present in extracts of both epithelial and endothelial cells. Moreover, purified chicken &#x003b1;-actinin with &#x0003e; 85% identity to human &#x003b1;-actinins bound specifically and in a saturable manner to Opc-expressing Nm.</p><p>For bacteria with largely extracellular lifestyle such as Nm, their target receptors may be expected to be expressed at the surfaces of cells.

Vimentin has also been shown in a secreted form in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

(1989</xref>) described that 12 h after infection, large numbers of internalized <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> were found free in the cytoplasm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Apicella <italic>et al</italic>. (1996</xref>) reported that internalized gonococci were predominantly contained within vacuoles, but were also occasionally found free in the cytoplasm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Williams <italic>et al</italic>. (1998</xref>) also showed that Opa<sup>+</sup><italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> bind to intracellularly located pyruvate kinase in infected cells further suggesting the possibility of pathogenic Neisseriae utilizing intracellular targets which may require their escape from the phagocytic vacuole. Another study has shown that Nm IgA1 protease can degrade LAMP-1, a major glycoprotein in the vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hauck <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). This may result in degradation of the vacuole and the escape of bacteria into the cytoplasm where they may interact directly with cytosolic/cytoskeletal proteins. Alternatively, it is possible that proteins such as &#x003b1;-actinin that can insert into phospholipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Niggli and Gimona, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Goldmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) may be inserted into the phagocytic vacuolar membrane in a manner that allows bacterial interaction.</p><p>Alpha-actinin is a family of closely related molecules and four forms of the protein have been described. Forms 1 and 4 with &#x0003e; 85% identity are found in numerous non-muscle cells and possess a number of molecular partners. In a variety of cells and tissues, &#x003b1;-actinin is found along the length of actin stress fibres and close to the plasma membrane at cell&#x02013;cell adhesion sites and focal contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Burridge <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Otey <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). It also interacts with other cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin (especially at focal adhesion sites) and transmembrane receptors including integrins, ICAMs, syndecan 4 at their cytoplasmic domains. It regulates receptor activity and serves as a scaffold to connect the cytoskeleton to a variety of signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). Thus, an important function of &#x003b1;-actinin is to serve as a link between the cytoskeleton and adhesive receptors such as integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Otey <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>) and syndecans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Greene <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>); and interestingly, both of these are receptors for Opc protein. Alpha-actinin itself is also a target for regulation by a number of signalling pathways, especially those activated by integrin engagement (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). Current studies have used antibodies that recognize either &#x003b1;-actinin 1 or both actinin proteins 1 and 4. Ongoing studies are suggesting that both forms may be targeted by Opc. However, despite their high-level identity, the &#x003b1;-actinin proteins 1 and 4 may be involved in differential signalling in non-muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). Whether there is a preference in binding of Opc to a particular isoform remains to be shown and is under investigation. A bias towards binding of either isoform may determine any downstream effects. At this stage, it can only be speculated that bacterial binding to the multifunctional protein favours bacterial survival and/or traversal following cell entry.</p><p>The possibility of binding of internalized Opc<sup>+</sup> Nm to &#x003b1;-actinin was explored using HBMEC, HMEC-1 and A549 cells by the examination of their co-localization in infected cells after 3 and 8 h incubation period. By confocal microscopy, colocalization of Nm with &#x003b1;-actinin could be demonstrated. The association of the two proteins appeared to require a period of intracellular residence as colocalization was apparently more frequent at 8 h than at 3 h. This may suggest that after cell entry, a period of adaptation of the phagocytic vacuole may be required before the interaction can occur. This period may involve upregulation of the <italic>&#x003b1;-actinin</italic> gene as has been observed recently in infected cells at the late stages (8 h) of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Schubert-Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It is therefore possible that high intracellular &#x003b1;-actinin concentrations are required for bacterial binding and are achieved over several hours following cellular invasion.</p><p>Although similarities exist in epithelial and endothelial interactions, Opc interaction with human epithelial cells differs from that with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">van Putten and Paul, 1995</xref>). In several distinct endothelial cells investigated, serum proteins help Opc targeting of apical integrins (C. Sa E Cunha, N.J. Griffiths and M. Virji, in preparation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Unkmeir <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). However, at either barrier, once inside the cells, &#x003b1;-actinin may be targeted as suggested by this study. Notably, although serum proteins bind to Opc, serum-mediated uptake of bacteria did not appear to prevent Opc-mediated binding to &#x003b1;-actinin in endothelial cells. The various possible sequences of events that could lead to co-compartmentalization of the two proteins are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Putative events during infection of human cells by Opc<sup>+</sup> Nm that may lead to Nm/&#x003b1;-actinin interactions. Opc-expressing Nm interact with integrin receptors (A) at the apical surface of endothelial cells (an RGD-bearing serum protein-dependent event) leading to invasion via binding to integrins and receptor-mediated endocytosis (B). Once inside the cell, over a period, possible intracellular growth, the degradation of the vacuole and escape of bacteria into the cytoplasm could lead to &#x003b1;-actinin/Nm binding (C). (This may also be observed in the event that Nm remain largely in a vacuole and occasionally become free in the cytoplasm where interaction with &#x003b1;-actinin may occur.) Alternatively, it is possible that &#x003b1;-actinin localizes at the vacuolar membrane as &#x003b1;-actinin can insert into phospholipid bilayers; the phagocytic vacuole may be modified and occasional entry of &#x003b1;-actinin into the vacuole may result in &#x003b1;-actinin/Nm interactions (D). The interaction may be enhanced by upregulation of &#x003b1;-actinin at later time points after cellular invasion (E). <italic>In vitro</italic> evidence for the possible occurrence of most of these events has been described in <italic>Discussion</italic>; broken lines are used where no direct evidence is available at present to link the events.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cmi0011-0389-f7"/></fig><p>In assessing the precise role of Opc/&#x003b1;-actinin pairing in meningococcal pathogenesis, the possibility that this interaction may be a chance phenomenon has also to be considered. It is of course possible that Opc binds to an &#x003b1;-actinin sequence that is shared by another yet unknown receptor. However, this study has shown that, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, internalized Opc-expressing meningococci colocalize with &#x003b1;-actinin, an event that leads to redistribution of &#x003b1;-actinin and possible downstream effect on the actin cytoskeleton. This suggests that the organism has the capacity to exploit its interaction with intracellular &#x003b1;-actinin. The intracellular compartments and events that may allow this interaction to occur in human endothelial and epithelial cells as well as the downstream consequences are the subjects of current investigations.</p><p>In conclusion, the study presented here has identified a potential intracellular target of Nm Opc invasin as the cytoskeletal and signalling modulator protein &#x003b1;-actinin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct interaction of Opc-expressing Nm with a cytoskeletal protein. Although the true significance of this observation remains to be demonstrated, at this stage it can only be speculated that this interaction may facilitate Nm to modulate the intracellular events for increased survival and manipulate the cytoskeleton in such a way as to aid its traversal across cellular barriers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec><title>Bacteria and growth conditions</title><p>Growth conditions used in these studies have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Virji <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>).

Approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were suspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of octyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (OG) buffer (200 mM OG, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF, 100 mM). After overnight lysis at 4&#x000b0;C, samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble cellular material. Protein lysates (20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;l) were then separated usually using 5% polyacrylamide gels. The lysates were not subject to heating and mercaptoethanol was not used in the loading sample, although low level of SDS is present as usual in the electrophoresis buffer, thus the gels are run under &#x02018;semi-denaturant&#x02019; conditions. For Western blotting, gels were loaded with proteins in individual tracks or in a single trench and after electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Sch&#x000fc;ll, BioScience).
