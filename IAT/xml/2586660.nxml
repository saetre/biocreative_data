Wild type cells undergo a RelA-dependent arrest after treatment with serine hydroxamate to contain an integer number of chromosomes and a replication origin-to-terminus ratio of 1. The growth rate prior to starvation determines the number of chromosomes upon arrest. Nucleoids of these cells are decondensed; in the absence of the ability to synthesize ppGpp, nucleoids become highly condensed, similar to that seen after treatment with the translational inhibitor chloramphenicol. After induction of the stringent response, while regions corresponding to the origins of replication segregate, the termini remain colocalized in wild-type cells. In contrast, cells arrested by rifampicin and cephalexin do not show colocalized termini, suggesting that the stringent response arrests chromosome segregation at a specific point. Release from starvation causes rapid nucleoid reorganization, chromosome segregation, and resumption of replication. Arrest of replication and inhibition of colony formation by ppGpp accumulation is relieved in <italic>seqA</italic> and <italic>dam</italic> mutants, although other aspects of the stringent response appear to be intact. We propose that DNA methylation and SeqA binding to non-origin loci is necessary to enforce a full stringent arrest, affecting both initiation of replication and chromosome segregation. This is the first indication that bacterial chromosome segregation, whose mechanism is not understood, is a step that may be regulated in response to environmental conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Management of cell growth and division in response to environmental conditions is important for all cells. In bacteria, nutritional downturns are signaled by accumulation of the nucleotide ppGpp. Amino acid starvation causes a programmed change in transcription, known as the &#x0201c;stringent response&#x0201d;; ppGpp also causes an arrest of cell cycle in bacteria, whose mechanism has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we show that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, when the stringent response is in effect, complete chromosomal replication but do not initiate new rounds and arrest with an integer number of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes corresponds to the growth rate prior to arrest. In polyploid arrested cells, the chromosomal regions at which replication initiates are segregated, whereas the termini regions remain colocalized. The <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome remains decondensed and unsegregated during arrest and rapidly resumes replication and segregation, concomitant with chromosome condensation, upon release. The protein SeqA, a DNA binding protein and negative regulator of replication, is necessary for enforcing this arrest.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial cells encounter varied environmental stresses and make appropriate adjustments to ensure survival. One such stress is amino acid starvation, which triggers physiological reprogramming known as the &#x0201c;stringent response&#x0201d;. Signaling of the stringent response is achieved by accumulation of effector nucleotides, guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate ppGpp and pppGpp (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Potrykus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), with the former the predominant and more stable of the two species. Two enzymes, RelA and SpoT, control the levels of ppGpp: RelA (PSI, or ppGpp synthetase I) synthesizes ppGpp in response to uncharged tRNA, the consequence of amino acid starvation; SpoT (PSII) possesses weak synthetase activity and is the sole hydrolase for ppGpp degradation.</p><p>The stringent response is RelA-dependent and is the most well-studied of stress responses signaled by ppGpp (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Potrykus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). RelA associates with the ribosome and is triggered to produce ppGpp when the ribosome stalls with an uncharged tRNA in the acceptor site.

This method has the advantage of ppGpp accumulation independent of ribosome signaling and which is not accompanied by translational stalling. This allows us to distinguish ppGpp-specific effects from those associated indirectly with starvation or translation inhibition. If ppGpp accumulation is sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest, we would expect DNA profiles from pRelA&#x02032; induced cells to resemble those after treatment with serine hydroxamate. Indeed, cell cycle arrest and integer chromosome number was apparent by flow cytometry in IPTG-induced pRelA&#x02032; cells as compared to non-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000300-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This confirms that accumulation of ppGpp, rather than inhibition of translation or starvation itself, is responsible for the arrest. We did note that the integer chromosome number after RelA&#x02032; overexpression was somewhat lower, with a more predominant 2N peak, and more asynchronous, with a strong 6N peak, than that seen for serine hydroxamate.

This implies that SeqA and Dam specifically control cell cycle and do not have global effects on the stringent response, including levels of ppGpp.</p><p>In bacteria, as well as other organisms, control of the cell cycle is likely to be an important component of stress responses. Our previous work suggested that SeqA may limit replication in the face of chronic DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Sutera1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of the stringent response, it may be advantageous to limit replication in the presence of diminishing translational capacity since stalled forks may be subject to cleavage and collapse, causing the demise of both chromosomes. Arrest with two or more replicated chromosomes provides an opportunity for recombinational repair if one of the chromosomes becomes damaged and two potential templates for gene expresssion. Decondensation of the nucleoid, potentially induced by the stringent response, may facilitate the dynamic interactions between sister chromosomes that are required for recombinational repair.</p><p>Bacterial cells fail to proliferate when ppGpp levels rise, such as caused by overexpression of RelA or loss of the ppGpp hydolase SpoT (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Potrykus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>)&#x02013;our experiments suggest that this is due in large part to SeqA-dependent arrest of cell cycle.

Neither SeqA nor Dam bind guanine nucleotides; therefore some factor responsive to ppGpp is implicated in their control. An obvious candidate is RNA polymerase. Although transcription is required to initiate replication (and is therefore blocked by the RNA polymerase inhibitor, rifampicin), the mechanism of this control is still obscure, since promoter activity at <italic>oriC</italic> is not required for initiation under normal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Bates2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

An attractive model is that transcription sensitive to ppGpp may be required to reverse inhibitory effects of SeqA on replication initiation and chromosome segregation. This could be because SeqA binding blocks some DNA site required for cell cycle progression, with the act of transcription of this locus directly reversing this. Or alternatively, ppGpp-sensitive transcription of some unknown gene may be required to dissociate SeqA.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that DnaA expression decreases during the stringent response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000300-Zyskind1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, DnaA is unlikely to directly influence chromosome segregation arrest during the stringent response. Nonetheless, it is possible that multiple mechanisms of cell cycle control, such as the DnaA levels and the regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA), cooperate to control cell cycle in response to ppGpp.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000300-t002">Table 2</xref>) were grown at 30&#x000b0;C, 34&#x000b0;C, 37&#x000b0;C as previously described on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, consisting of 1&#x00025; Bacto Tryptone, 0.5&#x00025; yeast extract, 0.5&#x00025; sodium chloride and, for plates, 1.5&#x00025; agar or in M9 minimal medium (48 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>-7H2O, 22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8.5 mM NaCl, 19 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1 mM CalCl<sub>2</sub>) with 0.2&#x00025; glucose, 0.4&#x00025; glucose, or 0.4&#x00025; arabinose, and 0.2&#x00025; casamino acids with 1.5&#x00025; agar for plates.

For DAPI staining alone, cultures were fixed in 3&#x02236;1 methanol acetic acid. 10&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;l of cells was placed on poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (1 mg/ml)-coated slides and air-dried. Cells were washed 3 times with 1&#x000d7; Phosphate-Buffered-Saline (PBS &#x0005b;pH 7.4&#x0005d;) and allowed to air dry. Cells were then stained with 10 &#x000b5;l of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml DAPI (4&#x02032;,6&#x02032; diamido-2-phenylindole) for 10 min and washed three times with PBS and mounted in 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine 90&#x00025; glycerol in PBS, mounted with 5 &#x000b5;l VectaShield mounting medium and analyzed as described below. Living cells harboring pALA2705 (ParB-GFP) were grown at 34&#x000b0;C without supplementation of isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce synthesis of the GFP fusions. A suspension of growing cells was added to a 2&#x00025; agarose pad (MP Biomedicals, Inc) and covered with a cover slip over the residual media. Slides were analyzed with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a RGB liquid crystal color filter. Images were acquired with a Qimaging Retiga Exi camera by using the manufacturer's software.

Briefly, the chromosomal DNA was triple digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, and <italic>Eco</italic>RV and the fragments were separated on a 1.0&#x00025; agarose gel. The DNA was vacuum-transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham). The membrane was prehybridized with BSA for more than 1 h at 65&#x000b0;C and hybridized overnight at 65&#x000b0;C with <sup>32</sup>P a-dATP. The probe consisted of two DNA fragments that anneal to the chromosomal regions <italic>gidA</italic> (84.3 min), and <italic>relB</italic> (34.8 min). The DNA fragments were labeled using Random Primer Labeling (Molecular Cloning).

Approximately 1 &#x000b5;g of RNA sample was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1&#x00025; non-denaturing agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was photographed under UV light. Amount of rRNA was determined by band intensity of the 16S, 23S, and unprocessed rRNA bands in the image using Quantity One&#x000e2; imaging software (Bio-Rad). To determine the amount of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d; labeled rRNA, corresponding rRNA bands were cut out from the gel, dissolved, and analyzed in a scintillation counter.

The samples were subjected to two rounds of freezing and thawing before microcentrifugation at 14, 000 rpm for 2 minutes to remove cellular debris. 6 &#x000b5;l of supernatant were spotted onto 20&#x000d7;20 cm polyethyleneimine cellulose on polyester TLC plates (Sigma) in 1.5 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 3.4) for 2 h. After chromatography, nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a MolecularImager FX PhosphorImager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Unlabeled GDP and GTP were spotted on the plates as markers and visualized after chromatography by UV light-induced fluorescence. The identities of the labeled (p)ppGpp were inferred from their positions in the chromatograph relative to the origin and GTP. (p)ppGpp levels are normalized to levels of GTP observed in the same sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank S. Austin, M. Cashel, and K.
