Various highly conserved palindromic structures and an ORF that could code for a NTP-binding protein were identified within the backbone structure and may be involved in plasmid maintenance and replication. Each plasmid contains at comparable locations a module which specifies components of different restriction-modification (R/M) systems. The R/M module of pFV1 contained, in addition to the genes of the GGCC-recognizing R/M system MthTI, an ORF which may be involved in repair of G-T mismatches generated by deamination of m5C at high temperatures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6501"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6502"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6503"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6504"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6505"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6506"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00235-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6507"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
