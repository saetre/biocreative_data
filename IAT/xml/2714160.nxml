How and why these new neurons are formed has become an intriguing question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because the circadian clock machinery can control intrinsic regulation of cell proliferation in peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] we hypothesized that clock genes might influence neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) division in the central nervous system.</p><p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mammals is a plastic process placed under the control of environmental stimuli, which is comparable to the regulation of circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hormonal cycles and psychosocial stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], serotonin metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], sleep deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and enriched living conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] influence the rate of neuronal renewal and survival in various adult organisms. This suggests that mechanisms controlling life-long neurogenesis in the postnatal CNS are adapted to complex extrinsic inputs. Neurogenesis appears to be regulated by such physiological and behavioural parameters that are somehow connected to the circadian clock that synchronizes itself to changing environmental conditions to optimize an organism's performance. Recent work has consistently shown a diurnal rhythm of neurogenesis among the olfactory projection neurons in the crustacean brain, with peak of neuroblasts proliferation during the hours surrounding dusk, the most active period for lobsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These data suggest the possibility that light-controlled rhythms may be primary regulators of neuronal proliferation, and that previously demonstrated hormonal and activity-driven influences over adult neurogenesis may be secondary events in a complex circadian control pathway.</p><p>Intriguingly, the expression of circadian genes that belong to the intracellular clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have also been described in other brain areas, in peripheral organs and even in immortalized cell lines in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The <italic>mPer2 </italic>gene is one of the three mammalian orthologs (<italic>mPer1</italic>, <italic>mPer2 </italic>and <italic>mPer3</italic>) of the Drosophila circadian clock gene <italic>period </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In situ hybridization experiments have established that <italic>mPer1 </italic>and <italic>mPer2 </italic>genes are expressed in the hippocampus and particularly in the DG where their function remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The rate of cell cycle kinetics and neurogenesis are tightly coupled in the adult mammalian DG. The overall duration of the cell cycle in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells is about 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and very close if not identical to the circadian period. There is already substantial in vivo evidence that outside the mammalian brain, circadian rhythms control the timing of cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Accordingly, light/dark variations of the mitotic index and DNA synthesis occur in many tissues, i.e. oral mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], tongue keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we wanted to decipher whether mPER2, one of the central component of the circadian clock machinery, regulates the proliferation and the maturation of NPCs into granule neurons in the hippocampal DG of adult mice. We used the <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mutant mice line to assess the specific requirement of <italic>mPer2 </italic>in adult neurogenesis. Here, we showed that mPER2 was non-rhythmically expressed in the granule neuronal lineage in the adult DG. In adult <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice, we found an increase in both the proliferation of NPCs and the number of immature granule neurons expressing DCX and NeuroD. Strikingly, the pool of adult generated mature granule cells was not enlarged, as one would expect. The accumulation of supernumerary mature granule cells was prevented by apoptosis in the DG of <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice. Our results suggest that <italic>mPer2 </italic>belongs to the molecular machinery that underlies the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the early cellular events leading to the production of post-mitotic granule cells in the DG.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Constitutive expression of mPER2 in the adult dentate gyrus</title><p>The expression profile of mPER2 in the DG region of the hippocampus was established by immunohistochemistry using two different polyclonal antibodies on 40 &#x003bc;m-thick coronal sections from P45 adult male mice. Both anti-mPER2 antibodies lead to similar expression patterns (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>). mPER2 was highly expressed throughout the adult hippocampus and particularly in the granule cell layer (GCL), subgranular layer (SGL) and the hilus (H) of the DG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In order to determine whether mPER2 expression levels could undergo rhythmic oscillations in the DG, immunostainings and Western blots were performed at several circadian time points including ZT0, ZT6, ZT12 and ZT18. Surprisingly, immunolabellings revealed that the level of mPER2 was comparable throughout circadian ZTs (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In contrast, mPER2 expression displayed circadian oscillations in the SCN with a peak of expression at ZT12 (compare fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Western blots analysis performed on micro-dissected DG confirmed that mPER2 levels were constitutively stable with time, as previously described for its transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as compared to the SCN, where the maximum of mPER2 expression occurs at ZT12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The mPER2 protein is constitutively expressed in the adult dentate gyrus</bold>.

Our data show that mPER2 clock protein expression is not oscillating in the murine adult DG. This is the first demonstration suggesting that a mammalian clock protein is constitutively expressed in a specific region of the adult brain. Previous findings in agreement with this observation showed a non-circadian expression of <italic>mPer2 </italic>mRNA in the adult DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It is commonly established that the adult DG is composed of several cell types that include quiescent or slowly dividing and highly proliferating NPCs, immature and mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our results indicated that mPER2 expression starts in proliferating NPCs and remains sustained in newborn neurons from the early post-mitotic stage up to mature granule neuronal stage. Similar to the adult DG, murine testes and thymus also retain, to a certain extent, self-renewal capacities during adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In these organs, the constant expression of circadian clock gene, including mPER2, strongly suggest that this constitutive expression is a general feature of adult differentiating tissues and that these genes may have new clock-unrelated functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We wanted here to characterize the putative functions of <italic>mPer2 </italic>in the DG of the hippocampus during adult neurogenesis. Our results indicate that a functional impairment of <italic>mPer2 </italic>(i.e. <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice) increased both the number of proliferating NPCs and the production of immature newborn neurons in the DG of adult mice. Hence, the increased number of early newborn post-mitotic neurons that we observed in the DG of <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice provided evidence that the expansion in the NPCs pool is not attributable to a delayed cell cycle exit. In line with our in vivo findings, in vitro analyze revealed that cultured NPCs isolated from the DG of <italic>mPer2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice generated larger neurospheres as compared to WT. This result argues in favour of <italic>mPer2 </italic>control of NPCs proliferation in neurospheres. In addition, the number of neurons generated from <italic>mPer2</italic><sup><italic>Brm1 </italic></sup>neurospheres significantly increased, suggesting that <italic>mPer2 </italic>regulates the differentiation NPCs into postmitotic neurons. Altogether, these observations obtained from complementary models strongly support a dual function for mPER2 during adult neurogenesis. Our data support the circadian gene <italic>mPer2 </italic>as a new intrinsic regulator of both the proliferation and differentiation in NPCs of the adult murine DG. Interestingly, mPER2 could belong to a global machinery that coordinates the proliferation with the differentiation of NPCs as other molecules (FGF-4, IGF1 and TLR4) controlling both events have recently been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In line with our observations, the inhibition of mPER2 synthesis in ganglionic eminence cultures results in an increased proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Although the molecular events triggered by mPER2 to regulate these events are not well characterized, the transcription of the proto-oncogene c-myc is deregulated in <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice, which consequently are prone to hyperplasia and tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, and p53, is deregulated in many tissues of <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, reduced levels of mPER2 expression were observed in different tumours including lymphoma, breast or endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and the overexpression of mPER2 in tumour cells led to dramatic growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These data are consistent with the observation that <italic>mPer2 </italic>may prevent cell cycle progression and promote the exit of the cell cycle of NPCs in the adult DG. However, the molecular pathways underlying <italic>mPer2 </italic>activity in these cells and which role cell cycle-related genes may play to mediate these effects still need to be elucidated.</p><p>By associating with specific cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and hence blocking their catalytic activities during cell cycle progression, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors promote cell cycle exit at G1 restriction point in various tissues during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Among them, p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>and p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>are expressed in neuroblasts and newly developing neurons in the adult DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our preliminary data suggests that p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>expression broadly overlaps with mPER2 in early post-mitotic hippocampal immature neurons (data not shown). In addition, the proliferation and the number of DCX<sup>+ </sup>cells in the adult DG, are increased in p21<sup>cip1-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that the circadian clock component BMAL1, regulates the expression of p21<sup>cip1 </sup>in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest p21<sup>cip1 </sup>and p27<sup>kip1 </sup>as strong candidates that could act downstream <italic>mPer2 </italic>to inhibit NPCs proliferation in the adult DG.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the number of newly formed mature granule neurons was similar in WT and <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brdm1 </italic></sup>mice. During the first weeks following cell cycle exit, only a part of the newly generated cells find their definitive place in the hippocampal circuitry while around 50% of them are naturally eliminated through apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Previous works have shown that programmed cell death is a physiological process that occurs during neurogenesis in the adult DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brdm1 </italic></sup>mice, despite an increased proliferation of NPCs and an increased number of early newborn neurons, we did not find any significant enlargement of the DG. However, we observed more TUNEL<sup>+ </sup>cells in the DG of <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brdm1</italic></sup>. We can suggest two possible explanations for this increased cell death phenomenon. First, mPER2 may regulate the expression of pro-survival genes that would be underexpressed in <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brdm1 </italic></sup>and lead to the death of newly born granule cells in the DG. Such selective or combined effects on distinct phases of neurogenesis have already been reported. For instance, an enriched environment is known to affect only cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] whereas physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] or absence of TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] increase both cell proliferation and cell survival. Alternatively, the excessive cell death observed in <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brdm1 </italic></sup>mouse DG could be an indirect consequence, i.e. a secondary and compensatory response to increased cell proliferation in <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>brmd1 </italic></sup>mice. In this case, the production of new neurons in the hippocampus would be regulated by a physiological and homeostatic parapet. Similar homeostatic regulations of the formation of new neurons have been described for mCD24-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] or after a treatment with antidepressant drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Reciprocally, enhanced survival of new granule cells was reported after hampering cell proliferation with methylazoxymethanol or in synapsin III knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Excess number of immature, DCX<sup>+ </sup>and NeuroD<sup>+ </sup>neuroblasts as reported in the DG of <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice may increase competition for trophic signals required for the maintenance of a mature DG neuronal phenotype as suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, these data implied that precursor cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell differentiation are all essential events that regulate the final number of new granule neurons in the adult hippocampus. Importantly, our results show that an increased neuronal cell death prevents the accumulation of supernumerary newborn neurons in <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mutant mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present work has unravelled an original functional link between the constitutive expression of the circadian gene <italic>mPer2 </italic>and the intrinsic control of NPCs proliferation, cell death and neurogenesis in the adult DG.

Primary spheres obtained after five days were dissociated in enzyme solution (as above) and dissociated cells were re-suspended into fresh medium solution at 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. It has been previously demonstrated that culturing cells at this density resulted in clonal neurosphere colonies, as formed in single-cell cultures. Neurospheres do not arise as a result of cell aggregation at this cell culture density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. All experiments were performed between passage two and three. Neurospheres size was determined by measuring the diameter of individual neurosphere (assuming a spherical shape) using ImageJ software.</p><p>Neural stem cell differentiation was induced in neurospheres plated onto poly-L-ornithin (15 &#x003bc;g/ml) and laminin (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) coated coverslips in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), B27 with vitamin A (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech). After five days of differentiation, neurospheres were fixed in 4% PFA and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above with primary antibodies against GFAP (1:100, DAKO), &#x003b2;-III tubulin (1:500, Tuj1 clone, Babco, Richmond, CA, U.S.A.), O4 (1:100, Millipore) and nestin (1:250, Novus, Littleton, U.S.A.). All these experiments were done in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Immunostained sections were imaged using the Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal system equipped with the Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus Europa GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). For each 40 &#x003bc;m-thick section, the whole DG, was Z-scanned using the 40&#x000d7; objective, and the composite of the &#x000ab;Z-stack&#x000bb; images was analyzed. All sections prepared for comparison were stained at the same time, in the same conditions and were selected at the same stereological location.</p><p>Drawing a box across the GCL and measuring the mean intensity value in pixels determined fluorescence intensity of mPER2 levels. Background value taken from unlabeled areas was subtracted from measured value for every field analyzed. Three separate sections were analyzed, in three different animals and Prism software was used for statistical analysis, and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine significance levels.</p><p>To estimate the total number of immunolabelled cells in the GCL of the DG, we used a modified version of the optical fractionator method, as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Briefly, a systematic random sampling of every sixth 40-&#x003bc;m coronal section (240 &#x003bc;m) along the rostro-caudal axis of the DG (-1.06 mm to -3.80 mm form bregma) was selected from each animal and processed for immunohistochemistry. Immunopositive cells in the GCL were counted under a 40&#x000d7;-magnification microscope objective. The total number of positive cells was estimated by multiplying the results by six (because every sixth section were used) to provide an estimate of the total number of cells per DG.</p><p>To estimate any volumetric discrepancy between the DG of WT and <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice, we compared similar GCL areas between WT and <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice using adjacent coronal sections throughout the entire rostral/caudal extent of the hippocampus (from Bregma -1.06 mm to Bregma -3.80 mm) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Every sixth 40 &#x003bc;m-thick section has been NeuN immunostained and imaged. Using ImageJ software, the GCL has been outlined and the area obtained. Volume has been estimated using the formula &#x003a3;AxTxI, where &#x003a3;A is the sum of the area measured on each section, T is the section thickness, and I is the number of section intervals. The number of sections varied between genotypes; thus, sampling began at the first indication of a complete DG and ended when the DG was no longer visible. We showed that there were no volumetric differences between GCL of the hippocampus of the WT and <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brdm1 </italic></sup>mice (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Mice were killed at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12 or ZT18 by cervical dislocation. Brains from P45 WT mice were removed, placed rostral-side up in 35 mm Petri dishes and covered with a 3% solution of low-gelling temperature agarose at 37&#x000b0;C and then immediately placed at 4&#x000b0;C to harden the agarose solution. Brains were cut on a vibratome (Leica, Zaventem, Belgium) into viable 700 &#x003bc;m coronal sections in ice-cold PBS solution containing 30% glucose, and the DG of the hippocampus or the SCN were removed under a dissecting microscope. Tissues were lysed on ice using 200 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer [Hepes 10 mM pH 7,9, KCl 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>2 mM, EDTA 0,1 mM, Igepal&#x02122; 0,1% (Sigma-Aldrich), DTT 1 mM, PMSF 1 mM and protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche Applied Science)]. After five minutes on ice, the samples were centrifuged 5 minutes at 2000 g. The pellet was washed two times with 500 &#x003bc;l of washing buffer [Hepes 10 mM, pH 7,9, KCl 20 mM, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>2 mM, EDTA 0,1 mM, DTT 1 mM, PMSF 1 mM, and protease inhibitors cocktail]. The samples were then homogenized with 50 &#x003bc;l of extraction buffer [Hepes 20 mM pH 7,9, MgCl2 1,5 mM, EDTA 0,02 mM, NaCl 0,63 mM, H<sub>2</sub>0, Glycerol 25%, DTT 0,5 mM, PMSF 1 mM, protease inhibitors cocktail] and incubated for 30 minutes on ice and 10 minutes at -80&#x000b0;C. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 14000 g for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatants were used as nuclear fraction and the protein concentration was determined using RC DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium). Nuclear protein lysates (20 &#x003bc;g) were then mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer (glycerol 20%, SDS 4%, Tris 100 mM, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol 5% and bromophenol blue) before being boiled for three minutes. Proteins were then loaded on a 7,5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel run 20 minutes at 100 volts. Proteins contained in the gel were transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) by semi-dry electroblotting in transfer buffer (Glycine 192 mM, Tris 25 mM and methanol 20%). Membranes were then blocked one hour at RT in 0,2% I-BLOCK (TROPIX, Bedford, MA, U.S.A.) diluted in TBS supplemented with 0,05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) (TTBS) corresponding to the blocking buffer. Membranes were incubated one night at 4&#x000b0;C in the blocking buffer containing the primary antibody directed against mPER2 (H-90) (1:2500 in the blocking buffer, SC-25363, Santa Cruz or Per21 A, ADi). After washing three times with TTBS, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000, ABCAM, Cambridge, U.K.) one hour at RT. Blots were then washed extensively with TTBS and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence ECL substrate (Pierce, Aalst, Belgium). Membranes were stripped with Restore&#x02122; blot stripping buffer (Pierce), wash three times in TTBS and incubated one night at four &#x000b0;C with BAF57 antibody (1:2500, rabbit, Sigma-Aldrich). After washing, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000, ABCAM) and developed as described above. Quantification of the bands was carried out by densitometric analysis using Image J software.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BrdU: 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine; cdk: cylin-dependent kinase; DCX: doublecortin; DG: dentate gyrus; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; GCL: granule cell layer; H: hilus; i.p: intra-peritoneal; <italic>mPer1</italic>: period 1 gene; <italic>mPer2</italic>: period 2 gene; mPER2: period 2 protein; <italic>mPer3</italic>: period 3 gene; mRNA: ribonucleic acid; NPC: neural progenitor/stem cell; PBS: phosphate buffer saline; <italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Brmd1</italic></sup>: per2 mutant mice; PFA: paraformaldehyde; RT: room temperature; SCN: suprachiasmatic nuclei; SGL: subgranular layer; TBS: tris buffer solution; TTBS: tween-20/tris buffer solution; TUNEL: terminal dUTP-biotin nick end labelling; WT: wild-type; ZT: Zeitgeber.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LB, PB, RV carried out the studies and participated in the data analysis.
