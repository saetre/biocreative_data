Isolation of mutants in this amoeba has largely been limited to non-essential genes: <italic>nsfA</italic>&#x02014;the gene for NEM-sensitive factor&#x02014;remains the only essential gene for which conditional (ts) mutants exist. These ts mutants were generated by gene replacement using a library of mutagenised <italic>nsfA</italic> containing a selectable marker: transformants were then screened for temperature sensitivity. The success of this approach depended on the high level of homologous recombination prevailing at this locus: &#x0223c;95&#x00025; of selected clones were homologous recombinants. This is unusually high for <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>: homologous recombination at other loci is usually much less, usually between 0&#x02013;30&#x00025;, making the isolation of ts mutants much more tedious.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In trying to make ts mutants in <italic>sec1A</italic>, homologous recombination was found to be only &#x0223c;25&#x00025;. A new approach, involving single <italic>loxP</italic> sites, was investigated. <italic>LoxP</italic> sites are 34 bp sequences recognised by Cre recombinase and between which this enzyme catalyses recombination. A <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> line containing a single <italic>loxP</italic> site adjacent to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>sec1A</italic> gene was engineered. A <italic>sec1A</italic> replacement DNA also containing a single <italic>loxP</italic> site in a homologous position was then introduced into this cell line.

Methods have been available for some time for removing non-essential genes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and many of these, particularly those associated with the cytoskeleton, have been inactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Noegel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the most effective way of analysing the functions of essential genes is through temperature sensitive (ts) mutants and, to date, such mutants have been isolated in only one gene, <italic>nsfA</italic>, a gene whose function is required for many steps in intracellular membrane transport. At the restrictive temperature, the phenotype of <italic>nsfA</italic> showed that it is unsurprisingly required for several membrane processes, such as fluid phase endocytosis and phagoctyosis. Interestingly, however, NSF is also required for cell locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Thompson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting the view for a dynamic role for membranes in movement. The isolation of these ts mutants depended both on the earlier demonstration that homologous recombination can occur between an introduced replacement vector and the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-DeLozanne1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Manstein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and on the unusually high level of homologous recombination which was found at this site: &#x0223c;95&#x00025; of isolated transformants were found to be homologous replacements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Thompson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This enabled mutagenised replacement DNAs to substitute the native gene and a screen to be performed to find ts mutants. Other genes are more refractory to this approach; this is largely due to the lower level of homologous recombination which prevails at these other loci. This makes it more difficult to screen a mutagenised library and, in turn, to isolate temperature sensitive mutants. The aim of the present work was to obtain ts mutants in the single-copy gene, <italic>sec1A</italic>. Sec1 is a member of the Sec1/Munc18 family of proteins which, in combination with SNARE pairs, control membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Carr1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Burgoyne1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Sec1 itself is required for exocytosis in yeast and, as there is only one gene homologous to Sec1 in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, it seemed likely that it too would be essential and required for exocytosis. As membrane circulation may be of prime importance for cell movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Bretscher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000724-Bretscher2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> it seemed of particular interest to discover what effect the loss of sec1p activity would have.</p><p>In preliminary experiments we found that the rate of homologous recombination at the <italic>sec1A</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000724-g001">Fig 1A</xref>) is &#x0223c;25&#x00025;; when a replacement vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000724-g001">Fig 1B</xref>) bearing the selectable marker&#x02014;a blasticidin cassette&#x02014;just beyond the C-terminus of the gene was introduced into amoebae, only 25&#x00025; of the blasticidin-resistant clones were homologous recombinants. In the remaining 75&#x00025; the cassette had integrated elsewhere in the genome. A new route was devised which raised the level of homologous recombination to &#x0223c;80&#x00025; and this has enabled several useful ts mutants to be isolated. The same procedure may assist in the isolation of ts mutants in other genes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and perhaps can be adapted for use in other organisms.</p><fig id="pone-0000724-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000724.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The <italic>sec1A</italic> locus of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and constructs.</title><p>(A) Layout of genomic site of <italic>sec1A</italic>; in each figure the dots at each end of a DNA stretch indicate that that DNA is part of the genome.

The cassette, flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites, is introduced into a target gene by homologous recombination. The cassette is then removed from the genome by Cre recombinase in an intramolecular circularisation event which removes the blasticidin cassette so that the cell line is once again blasticidin-sensitive. This allows other genes to be disrupted in succession. When excision occurs, a single <italic>loxP</italic> site remains in the target. For the present method, the relevant point is that it is possible to introduce single <italic>loxP</italic> sites into the genome in this round-about fashion. This poses the question: if a gene replacement vector has only a single <italic>loxP</italic> site, and if the target gene itself has a single appropriately placed <italic>loxP</italic> site, would site-specific recombination, by an intermolecular recombination event, be enhanced in the presence of Cre recombinase?</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The layout of the <italic>sec1A</italic> region is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000724-g001">Fig 1A</xref>.

When introduced into Ax2 amoebae, the rate of homologous recombination was found to be &#x0223c;25&#x00025; (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000724-t001">Table 1</xref>). In other experiments (not shown) two vectors carrying a new restriction marker site, <italic>NgOM</italic>IV, (designed not to alter the sec1p sequence and placed &#x0223c;600bp before the PstI site) were constructed, one having an in-phase UAA codon next to the NgOMIV site and the other without. Homologous recombinants bearing the NgOMIV site could not be obtained with the first vector (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000724-t001">Table 1</xref>), whilst many were obtained with the second. In other words, no recombinants having an in-phase termination codon could be isolated.
