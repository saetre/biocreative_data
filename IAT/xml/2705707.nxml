Nearly 30% of all eukaryotic proteins are membrane proteins, and these include protein targets for over 40% of all drugs in use today. There is little understanding of the mechanisms and atomic interactions of any one of these. This is primarily because they are membrane proteins, where preparation in a structurally homogeneous and functionally active-state, and subsequent structure determination has been extremely challenging. Where classes of membrane proteins are represented in prokaryotes, it is likely that structures for a homolog will be determined first for prokaryotic or archaeal members, so target proteins will be first sought from these organisms. Our plan proposes structure determination of membrane protein targets with two or more membrane crossings, from prokaryotic, archaeal, extremeophile, and human genomes. Many human proteins have no good homologs in prokaryotes or archaea, thus human membrane targets are also included with the goal of coverage of the folds of the membrane proteome. The human genes are the only ones from a eukaryote, selected because their structures can instruct in structure-based drug design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Overall organization of the U54 research center</title><p>CSMP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://csmp.ucsf.edu">csmp.ucsf.edu</ext-link>) supports an integrated program aimed at facilitating the cloning, expression purification, crystallization, and structure determination of membrane proteins with the aim of coverage of the membrane proteome. The core capabilities provide for fermentation, cell culture, gene cloning, expression, protein purification, characterization, X-ray diffraction at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, structure determination by 2-D electron microscopy, and structure determination by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques (NMR).</p><p>The executive council consists of the seven principal investigators. Delegated areas of responsibility include responsibility over the projects. Dr. Sali directs the effort in dynamic target selection, and also the final step in using structures determined in the Center to model the structures of homologs. Dr. Choe leads the effort to optimize expression of human membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> using the MISTIC system that he discovered. Dr. Stroud will manage the standardized effort to express bacterial and archeal membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Drs. Choe, Minor and Stroud will oversee the purification and characterization of proteins produced in their projects. In almost all cases, prokaryotic and human membrane protein targets are investigated through the CSMP and all the other eukaryotic membrane protein targets are investigated through MPEC. However, the funding of the MPEC center did not provide funds for crystallography or structure determination equipment or personnel. Therefore, promising eukaryotic membrane protein targets that move through the Stroud portion of the MPEC protein expression and purification pipeline to a pure, homogeneous, and stable preparation state are then incorporated into the CSMP crystallography and structure determination pipeline.</p><p>The Principal Investigators derive from four institutions, all located in California. The institutions are UCSF (Stroud, Sali, Minor, and Holton), Salk Institute (Choe, Riek, and Kwiatkowski), UCDavis (Stahlberg), and UCLA (Kaback). The PIs and members of the team meet each week in televised conference (1.00&#x000a0;pm&#x02013;3.00&#x000a0;pm each Tuesday) to present progress in rotation. After 1.5&#x000a0;years we held a self-evaluation to identify weak projects and to plan for any redirection of effort, and resources. Each aim will now be gauged by 3-monthly milestones that will be used to adjust direction and necessary funding. This will be reviewed annually to assure direction.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The principal investigators</title><p>The investigators are in close touch with each other via an intranet, phone, and direct contacts. The institutions are UCSF (Stroud, Sali, Minor, and Holton), Salk Institute (Choe, Riek, and Kwiatkowski), UCDavis (Stahlberg), and UCLA (Kaback). Each principal investigator has played a key role in the discovery of major membrane protein biology, and/or in the development of procedures to understand membrane proteins at the molecular level.</p><p>Robert Stroud and his group have studied many membrane protein systems seeking characterizations and crystal structures. So far they have determined 7 high-resolution structures of membrane proteins at atomic resolution, one to 1.35&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution, currently the highest resolution of any membrane protein structure. They also report the mechanism of targeting membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the signal recognition particle and its receptor complex interaction.</p><p>Dr. Andrej Sali is a leader in development of methods for protein structure analysis and prediction. He has played a key role in the New York Structural Genomix Research Consortium aimed at soluble proteins.</p><p>Senyon Choe&#x02019;s group has elucidated mechanisms of potassium channels from structure analysis of domains of these channels. Dr. Choe has pioneered the MISTIC method for production of membrane proteins from all species, in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Daniel Minor has also played a key role in understanding the regulation of potassium and calcium channels. He determined key structures that help elucidate the mechanisms of these channels. He has also developed schemes to test for membrane stability.</p><p>Ronald Kaback is world renowned for his extensive studies of the Lactose permease. Over many years he has been a pioneer in membrane biology. Kaback recently was coauthored with Iwata of the high-resolution structure determination of the Lac permease. Thus his extensive mutational analysis of Lac permease is legendary and can now be interpreted.</p><p>Henning Stahlberg is a world leader in electron and atomic force microscopy of membrane proteins. He beautifully elaborated the structures of the GlpF and other aquaporin channels in their membrane environment.</p><p>Dr. Roland Riek is an inventor of TROSY and an expert in the use of NMR for three-dimensional structure determination focused on membrane proteins. He studied under the tutelage of Dr. Kurt Wuthrich.</p><p>Dr. James Holton (a key person at the ALS) is one of the world leaders in development of synchrotron and storage ring sources for high throughput X-ray diffraction. He has made fundamental contributions to the operations of beamline 8.3.1 that is currently the model for others as they come on line at the ALS. He is a highly innovative developer. For example he developed a robotic mounting system for crystals at beamline 8.3.1 for under $5,000.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Scientific progress</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Progress in the development of new methods, technology, approaches, and ideas for protein production and structure determination</title><p>This PSI Specialized Center focuses on membrane proteins. We target prokaryotic proteins expressed in prokaryotic organisms as the most amenable system for producing proper expression and targeting of these proteins to the cellular membranes. We believe that these will provide the most efficacious pathway to determining the structures of new membrane protein folds and proteins. We believe that archaebacterial and human membrane proteins provide an intermediate pathway to provide new folds and proteins since they may be evolutionarily intermediate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins. We also focus on human membrane proteins, while they represent the most technically difficult class of targets; they also have the highest potential value for structure based drug design. Finally, we use all of our skills and technology at our disposal to also target selected membrane protein complexes for expression and subsequent purification, crystallization, and structure determination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Molecular biology of selected targets</title><p>With over 700 <italic>E. coli</italic> targets to modify for the <underline>L</underline>igation <underline>I</underline>ndependent <underline>C</underline>loning (LIC) method and test for proper insertion of the target gene into the various expression vectors, we were right on the border of being able to efficiently using medium to high throughput molecular biology as opposed to purely manual methods. Melissa Del Rosario was instrumental in developing methods and techniques for using vacuum manifold based techniques on 96 well plates. These techniques permitted the screening of 288 constructs/day and allowed the efficient incorporation of our target genes into a variety of expression vectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Expression</title><p>The initial bottleneck for determining structure is membrane protein expression. Expression in bacteria is being carried out utilizing a novel scheme developed and applied by Senyon Choe, termed MISTIC, and by standardized procedures in <italic>E. coli</italic> that have already yielded high-resolution membrane protein structures in the Stroud and Kaback laboratories. We are also using codon optimization to improve expression of non-native proteins in our expression host cells, and Cell-Free Synthesis to target proteins that resist in vivo expression methods.</p><p>Human membrane proteins that are not expressed adequately or correctly folded by the above procedures will also be expressed through the NIH Roadmap Center directed by Stroud (GM-73210, Membrane Protein Expression Center, MPEC) funded in October 2004. The Membrane Protein Expression Center focuses specifically on developing novel methods for expression of eukaryotic (only) membrane proteins, and synergism with that center is expected to leverage results with this Structural Center.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Purification and characterization</title><p>Purification, solubilization and characterization are carried out as core functions at UCSF. The Protein Analysis Core at the Salk run by Kwiatkowski is developing High Throughput SELDI mass spectroscopy for molecular mass identification, NMR Analysis for detergent exchange, and ultracentrifugation to determine quaternary structure. As we approach the 4th year&#x02019;s operation of CSMP, many targets are emanating from the expression efforts and entering the Purification and Characterization cores. In our hands, automation of purification is still premature as an option for membrane proteins primarily because of the need for hand-tuned optimization of extraction, purification stability, and solubility, in which each step involves screening many different detergents. Thus, as our expression pipeline is becoming efficient, protein purification to a pure homogeneous and stable form is the current bottleneck. We have addressed this bottleneck by setting up 5 HPLC stations, 2 Tetra Detector HPLC Analysis stations and 5 single detector isocratic or gravity chromatography stations several with auto-injectors and auto fraction collectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>High throughput crystallization methods and trials are being developed at UCSF. James Holton (UCSF and the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley) is addressing bottlenecks in X-ray data collection and data analysis for 3D structure determination. Henning Stahlberg, UCDavis, is developing methods for streamlining EM structure determination, including automation of data collection and sample preparation. Electron crystallography is also being used to validate that the structures of 3-D crystalline samples are congruent with those in the 2D bilayer. Some membrane proteins may evade both structure determination schemes. NMR will be applied in these cases by Roland Riek for small size targets in addition to its own set of targets from <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>MISTIC homologs (Senyon Choe, Salk)</title><p>Mistic-based over-expression of bacterial kinase receptors has provided a significant advantage of over-producing this class of target proteins over other methods. But for mammalian integral membrane protein targets, it still needs significant optimization. Apart from using Mistic for protein expression, we have also made efforts to understand the function of the Mistic protein in the Bacillus organism. We have focused on the role by up-regulating the expression of Mistic in <italic>Bacillus</italic>. It led to a surprising consequence. It promotes the formation of biofilm and endows antibiotic resistance in <italic>Bacillus</italic>. To some extent, the same physiological results can be reproduced when <italic>E. coli</italic> is transfected and up-regulated by Mistic expression. Several Mistic homologs have been studied for their structures. One such homolog we termed M2 behaves well, and a 3.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; dataset has been obtained from M2 crystals. The structure solution has not yet been obtained. Another such homolog we termed M1 behaves well in solution, for which high-quality NMR spectra have been obtained. Near complete assignment of M1 spectral peaks has been accomplished. These homologues have 62&#x02013;93% residue identity, and are all 84 residues in length, corresponding to the three helices minus the first N-terminal helix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Mistic. In every case, these Mistic homologs have an overlapping gene read-out with a downstream gene that resembles a potassium channel protein. The functional relationship between the two genes is unknown.</p><p>Mistic technology has a limited use for eukaryotic targets. In order to explore the possible use of Mistic for eukaryotic targets, we have initiated using Mistic in lieu of a signal sequence present at the N-terminus of typical eukaryotic membrane protein genes. Initial expression constructs have been designed and will be compared to a comparable designer vector containing only the first alpha helical domain in place of the entire Mistic sequence. Once the designed vectors are available for tests, we will use the human integral membrane protein library that consists of ~3,270 target genes that have been constructed as a Gateway-adapted entry vectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>In vitro expression (Robert Stroud)</title><p>Reconstituted cell-free (CF) protein expression systems hold the promise of overcoming several of the traditional barriers associated with in vivo systems. To evaluate the potential of cell-free expression, we cloned 120 membrane (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;kDa) proteins from <italic>E. coli</italic> and compared their expression profiles in both an <italic>E. coli</italic> in vivo system and an <italic>E. coli</italic> derived cell-free system. Our results indicated that cell-free was a robust system able to express 63% of the targets compared to 44% in vivo (reported in Yr. 2). However, when evaluating an expression system, many factors, such as cost, complexity, throughput, reaction efficiency and duration, personnel time, and protein quality, must be taken into account. While cell-free is a robust expression system capable of expressing more proteins than an in vivo system and suitable for production of membrane proteins at the milligram level for a relatively small cost when producing the S30 fraction in house; the in vivo system is more streamlined, able to be scaled up much easier with our equipment, and more economical in all cases where expression is successful. We are investigating the addition of lipids and/or detergents into the cell-free reaction mixtures to investigate the potential to increase expression and perhaps address the reaction duration issues. If we select a high value target that is not amenable to in vivo expression systems, we will try the cell free approach, but even if the expression level in vivo is quite low (&#x0003c;0.1&#x000a0;mg/l), our Sartorius fermentor units (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;l and 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;l) can usually provide enough protein to perform useful experiments.</p><p>In year 3, we tested all of the phase 1 constructs that were positive for in vivo expression in larger growth volumes and prepared them for insertion into our regular in vivo expression, purification, and crystallization pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Gene redesign and codon optimization (Robert Stroud UCSF)</title><p>Expression of functional protein targets in heterologous hosts is a key element of our efforts within the center. Utilization of codon optimized synthetic genes has been demonstrated in hundreds of published cases to increase, often significantly, the levels of expressed material for soluble proteins. Our efforts in CSMP focus on attempts to translate this observation to expression of integral membrane proteins. Within the past year we have generated codon-optimized genes for 21 different proteins that have lead to seven targets now in crystallization trials. Of these, three have crystallized (Tacid1, SecY and PfAQP) and have been optimized. Codon optimization for each of these proteins was essential for expression success and moving forward to crystallization trials. For instance, the native PfAQP protein did not express, likely owing to the AT rich character of the Plasmodium genome. Following optimization we are now obtaining ~42&#x000a0;g of purified protein/liter of culture. As evident from our initial expression results, we generally observe an improvement in protein expression levels. PfAQP has now had its structure determined to 2.05&#x000a0;&#x000c5; (PDB: 3C02).</p><p>The Stroud laboratory now has a collaboration with DNA2.0 Inc. to pursue a study of the efficacy of codon-optimized genes. Dr. Franklin Hays has provided DNA 2.0 with our hENT1 genes and with the collaboration of Dr. Claus Gustafsson at DNA2.0, DNA2.0 will produce 20&#x02013;25 different codon-optimized genes for CSMP to expression test and prepare for eventual crystallization trials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Progress table for the codon usage experiments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Gene</th><th align="left">Species</th><th align="left">Design</th><th align="left">Opt.

screening required for the efforts of the labs involved in this PSI center, the Stroud and Minor labs have developed a suite of expression vectors that implement Ligation Independent Cloning (LIC) strategies. This approach obviates the use of restriction enzymes for joining target protein DNA to the vector and the need for enzymatic ligation steps in clone preparation. The method is efficient and yields ~90&#x02013;100% positive clones. We have constructed LIC <italic>E. coli</italic> vectors bearing two N-terminal affinity tags in series, His6 and maltose binding protein (MBP), followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site (termed HMT). The His6- and MBP-tags allow for two orthogonal affinity steps to be used in purification. The TEV site permits specific cleavage of the tags following purification. LIC cassettes with different combinations of tags and utilizing the 3C (PreScission) protease have also been constructed and used primarily by the Stroud laboratory.</p><p>Because CSMP focuses on the potential value of the MISTIC fusion protein as a tool for expression of membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we made LIC constructs (termed HMisT) bearing, in series, His6, MISTIC, and the TEV site. We have also generated HMT LIC and HMisT LIC vectors that have an N-terminal signal peptide for use on target proteins where the N-terminal domain is known to be extracellular (ssHMT and ssHMisT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Development of a rapid expression assay based on GFP for proper expression and membrane insertion (Daniel Minor)</title><p>In an effort to facilitate the screening and evaluation of target proteins, we have developed an LIC expression vector that uses green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor target protein expression levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> directly. This vector bears an LIC site followed by GFP and a His8 affinity tag. The premise is that only proteins that are expressed and properly folded will give robust fluorescence signals, as it is known that inclusion body formation suppresses the formation of the GFP chromaphore. Our initial experiments confirmed that well-expressed proteins turn the cells visibly green.</p><p>In the past year of effort we have used our GFP vector format to screen the expression of 314 membrane proteins from extremophilic organisms. We found that 67/314 (21%) of our extremeophile targets expressed as well or better than the benchmark proteins in the GFP assay. To investigate whether there was a correlation between GFP fluorescence values (FSUs) and the amount of protein produced in the membrane fraction, we took 36 targets (29 from the &#x0003e;60,000 FSU pool and seven from the &#x0003c;60,000 FSU pool) and subjected them to an expression optimization protocol. We evaluated expression levels for each construct (108 total) at three expression temperatures (18, 25, and 37&#x000b0;C). 17 of our targets, once optimized, express at &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;mg/l in the membrane fraction. Thus, the GFP screen appears to be a reliable way to identify targets that have good potential to express at high levels in the membrane. Based on our results, there is a 90% probability that a target with a fluorescence value &#x0003e;60,000 FSU can be expressed at 0.5&#x000a0;mg/l or better, levels that are sufficient for further characterization and crystallization trials.</p><p>We pursued purification and characterization of 24 of the targets that expressed at 0.5&#x000a0;mg/l or better. We are actively pursuing purification optimization for each candidate as well as crystallization trials. Our plans for FY04 are to pursue crystallization and structure determination of our cohort of well-expressed extremeophile membrane proteins. Additionally, we plan to work with Dr. Greg Hura at ALS beamline 12.3.1 to collect Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data on all well-behaved samples. Recent implementation of robotic sample handling on the 12.3.1 SAXS end station together with our cohort of well-expressed, readily purified targets provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the potential of a yet underutilized way to obtain medium resolution information (particularly regarding multimerization state) for membrane proteins. It is anticipated that such efforts will also aid in sample improvements for our efforts on structure determination by crystallization and X-ray diffraction methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Protein expression core (Witek Kwiatkowski, Casey Johnson, Luis Esquivies, Christopher Dickson, Inno Maslennikov, SALK)</title><p>We have standardized the steps of vector construction, detergent screening, mini-scale expression tests, and protein scale-up and subsequently trouble-shooting. Using these standardized protocols, we plan to process 4 vectors made per week, and 2 protein expression and scale-up per week, on average. Once the expression vectors are made and confirmed, mini-scale protein expression tests are performed. Experiments to determine the optimal detergent type, most effective solubilization time and detergent concentration will be performed and the data entered into CSMP Central Database. Once the detergent is selected from the screening and expression is confirmed, the expression vectors are tested for scale-up protein preparation. As a general guideline, we evaluate by testing detergent exchange and concentration by NMR, testing by HPLC sizing, ion exchange chromatography, testing oligomeric state of the protein in solution by Analytical Ultracentrifuge, choosing purification protocol, setting up crystallization screens. If necessary, we change detergent (decyl-<sc>d</sc>-maltopyranoside (DM), dodecyl-<sc>d</sc>-maltopyranoside (DDM), octyl l-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (OG), nonyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (NG) are the choices) and repeat. This is performed by the Protein Analysis Core. A typical target protein will take 7 working days to pass through the detergent screening with day one and two being used to solubilize membrane preparations prepared before-hand, days 3 and 7 to run the samples on size exclusion chromatography and run signature SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels and western blots and change and test different buffer conditions. Most of this work is not particularly suited to automation except through the use of auto-injectors on the HPLC systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Purification and characterization: high throughput characterization of membrane protein detergent complex (Kwiatkowski, SALK)</title><p>The identification and characterization of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) require stable protein-detergent complexes (PDCs) to be formed. We used a combination of light scattering, refractive index measurement, mass spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and ultracentrifugation to carefully characterize detergents and proteins and their relative compositions in the PDCs. This information was essential to evaluate oligomeric states of samples, and thus the feasibility of crystallization.</p><p>We use 1D-NMR spectroscopy to quantitatively monitor detergent concentration during sample purification. These data provide a useful gauge of the detergent&#x02019;s extraction potential for a given protein, detergent exchange efficiency, and detergent concentration after final ultra-filtration. To assess the homogeneity and oligomeric state of PDCs we used HPLC in line with light scattering, UV and refractive index instruments or, alternatively, the sedimentation velocity measurement by analytical centrifugation. These methods provide us with the quantified detergent-to-protein ratio and the mass of the entire PDC, and thus with the precise PDC composition. They also allow us to assess the capability of detergent additives to influence these important parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Crystallization and structure determination: automation of crystallization trials (Robert Stroud)</title><p>In the process of 3D structure determination of biological macromolecules, crystallization constitutes one of the major bottlenecks. The scarcity of sample for crystal trials constitutes a limiting step in particular in the case of membrane proteins. At the CSMP, we have implemented a &#x02018;high-throughput&#x02019; crystallization strategy that covers two aspects: Robotic screening and optimization of crystallization conditions. A nanoliter scale crystallization robot (Mosquito<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> from TTP LabTech) is used to perform crystallization trials in 96 well-format plates. It is designed to prepare drops in both hanging- or sitting-drop mode using the vapor diffusion method. Drop size can be reduced to 200&#x000a0;nl (100&#x000a0;nl&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;nl) without loss of accuracy and efficiency. This robot is easy to use, and it is a positive displacement pipetting robot that uses disposable tips. It therefore eliminates the risk of cross-contamination, and it eliminates the need for cleaning the tips.</p><p>This system is used for screening initial crystallization conditions and also for optimization using a set of additive screens. We keep approximately 20 commercial crystallization screens of 96 conditions on-hand giving researchers 1,920 unique crystallization conditions in addition to custom chemical components. Working with 100 nl of a protein solution and 100&#x000a0;nl of the crystallization screen requires &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of protein solution instead of the 192&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l needed for manual drop setting methods (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l drops). This represents a 20&#x000d7; reduction in the protein needed for each screen and thus a 20&#x000d7; increase in the number of screens that we can perform with a given volume of protein preparation. This improvement in efficiency permits effective screening with proteins that express 20&#x000d7; less that before, putting our minimum useful expression level around 0.1&#x000a0;mg/l. This crystallization robot was purchased by CSMP, and is shared, (as are costs) by all members of CSMP, and also by the Macromolecular Structure Group (msg.ucsf.edu), the Gladstone Research Institute, and the QB3 Institute. About 20 different groups currently use this robot.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Optimizing X-ray structure determination (James Holton, Robert Stroud, ALS/UCSF)</title><p>Work continues on narrowing the large numerical gap between collected data sets and published structures. World wide, this gap is roughly 50 to 1, and our analysis of the problem has demonstrated that this gap is due to a lack of understanding of the data quality requirements of modern structure-solving algorithms. Clearly, it is always best to have high quality data, but optimizing throughput, efficiency and success rates requires that the minimum data quality requirements be known.</p><p>Establishing these limits empirically would require collecting data sets from a wide range of proteins and systematically varying different parameters such as crystal size, mosaic spread, exposure time and others. This is a very large parameter space. To aid this search, a quantitative model of the diffraction experiment and all its various sources of error was constructed. This diffraction experiment simulator (MLFSOM) is now a mature system and has begun to produce exciting results. Nearly all important physical phenomena in the diffraction experiment, including radiation damage, spot shape, anomalous differences, diffuse scattering, shutter jitter and beam flicker are all modeled from first principles. The simulation is performed on an absolute scale, so once the correct real-world values of flux, crystal volume and other physical parameters are entered the simulated images are not only remarkably realistic, but on the same scale as measured diffraction patterns. The simulated images are output in the .SMV file format so they can then be processed with modern data-processing software. In this way, the effect of varying experimental parameters (such as exposure time in seconds or crystal size in microns) can be precisely correlated to data quality and the &#x0201c;threshold of solvability&#x0201d; established for each. The advantage of absolute scale is that the optimal parameters derived from the simulation have the same units as the optimal parameters for data collection. For example, it has been found that the read-out noise of a modern detector has almost no impact on the accuracy of anomalous difference measurements, which implies that MAD/SAD data sets can be divided over many more images than previously thought. This prediction was experimentally tested, and it was found that higher redundancy with the same total exposure actually improves overall data quality. This new data collection strategy is now strongly encouraged at ALS 8.3.1.</p><p>In May 2007, the ADSC Q210 detector in ALS 8.3.1 was replaced with a new, larger, ADSC Q315r detector. The increased surface area and lower intrinsic noise have enabled larger unit cell work, improved signal-to-noise (longer detector distances) and a 10-fold increase in the allowable data redundancy over the old detector. It is now clear from our studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and others that radiation damage is fundamentally unpredictable. We have shown that heavy atom sites decay exponentially with dose, and the decay constants are reproducible for a given sample type. We have established that the best strategy for MAD data collection is to begin with a complete data set of very short exposures (1&#x000a0;s or less) and then repeat the complete data set with 2&#x000d7; the exposure time, then 4&#x000d7; the exposure time and continue until the crystal shows signs of decay. This decay can either be evaluated by monitoring the XANES spectrum of the metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] or by visual inspection of the decaying diffraction pattern. If the sites are robust, then all the data sets can be merged together, and if the sites are found to decay rapidly, then the radiation induced phasing (RIP) technique can be applied between the first and last data sets. Thus the same set of data is applicable to several structure solution pathways.</p><p>Of course, once the requirements of a crystal are known, one must find a crystal that meets them. Two novel screening technologies are in development at ALS 8.3.1: the <underline>O</underline>ffline <underline>T</underline>arget <underline>I</underline>ndication <underline>S</underline>ystem (OTIS) and the &#x0201c;plate goniometer&#x0201d;. OTIS circumvents the crystal-centering problem by using optical microscope images of a hand-centered crystal to re-center it at a later time. This effectively enables unattended data collection, which is done late at night. Screening is then done during the daylight hours, when users are more alert. Delayed data collection has now become a popular feature for users with overnight shifts.</p><p>The &#x0201c;plate goniometer&#x0201d; is an in&#x000a0;situ screening system developed in collaboration with the SIBYLS beamline 12.3.1 and Fluidigm Corporation. It is now operational and screening crystals at a rate of one per minute. With this system, crystals can be probed in their growth chamber, which eliminates the caveats and the labor of harvesting, mounting and cryoprotecting each crystal, all important considerations in crystal optimization. We have recently begun applying this technology to novel structural projects, including a membrane protein from CSMP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Describe plans for FY04 research activities</title><p>The initial goals and principal persons proposed continue along the lines of their initial goals. We need to make a more seamless transfer of membrane proteins to electron microscopic analysis, which is underutilized due to supply at present.

Increased focus will be added to the human membrane protein genes being assembled in GATEWAY vectors by Dr. Choe. These will be expressed as MISTIC fusions at CSMP.</p><p>We have set-up a multi-center crystallization method comparison with several PSI centers (Hauptman&#x02013;Woodward Institute, Ismagilov Laboratory at the University of Chicago, and the Kenis Laboratory at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, Fluidigm Corporation) that specialize in high throughput crystallization methods. We will be able to assess the success of each method via their results with a standardized protein preparation that we provide.

First, we identified integral membrane protein families in the Pfam database of protein families. Second, we collected protein sequences encoded by a diverse set of 34 genomes of interest to CSMP and predicted &#x003b1;-helical transmembrane proteins. Third, we generated sequence profiles for the identified membrane proteins in each genome and annotated the sequences in each sequence profile with organism and protein family identifiers. Fourth, we enumerated membrane protein families in each genome and connected significantly related membrane proteins both within organisms and across organisms. Finally, we constructed comparative protein structure models for all known sequences from Uniprot based on known atomic structures of membrane proteins.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Bioinformatic flow chart for CSMP protein target selection</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10969_2008_9058_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Complete profile-based sequence coverage of the yeast genome therefore requires 361 total targets of the 622 total.

Finding homologs that can be modeled based on a template structure is the first step in the modeling process. We use our sequence profiles for each target sequence as a proxy for how many sequences could be modeled if we had a structure of the target. In total, there are 415,983 sequences in Uniprot that are detectably homologous to one or more of the CSMP targets.

In the Stroud laboratory, we have a three phase organization to our work. First, we initially started on a 120 protein project investigating in vitro translation/expression. The results of this work were published in 2007 and the target proteins that expressed successfully moved into the purification pathway, this work is continuing. The second phase was our &#x0201c;408&#x0201d; protein project that was headed by Melissa Del Rosario. The proteins in this project were selected with the aid of the bioinformatics group in the Andrei Sali laboratory to provide extensive coverage of the Pfam classes in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Phase 2 has provided a large number of proteins that are ready for expression and solubility testing. From prior experience it was decided to test for solubility in octyl glucopyranoside (OG) detergent only. With this operational filter, we still had enough proteins that solubilized in OG to saturate our purification resources. In Phase three, since we had covered a significant part of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome already in the first two phases, it was decided to complete the entire <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane protein proteome by selecting the remaining unselected proteins.

So far, 155 proteins express at levels high enough to proceed to solubility testing using a detergent screen with six different detergents representing three detergent chemical families. 85 of the solubilized proteins have been successfully purified on Ni IMAC. Once the Ni immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification efficiency has been assured by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blots, the histidine tags are cleaved for preparative SEC runs. If the SEC produces a pure homogenous single peak, the sample is tested for stability; at this time, 34 of the post-SEC proteins are pure, homogenous, and stable (PHS). If a protein preparation can not be adequately purified by SEC, ion-exchange chromatography using methyl sulphonate (S) or quaternary ammonium (Q) matrices are used for further purification. Size exclusion chromatography is routinely employed to test the PHS condition of all preparations. Once a protein preparation is PHS it is ready for crystal trials. At the end of year 3, the Stroud laboratory has 735 prokaryotic membranes cloned, 240 proteins demonstrating significant expression, 55 that have been solubilized, 36 in membrane purification; 11 entered crystallization, 11 crystallized, six diffracted and have four structures.

Kefala)</title><p>Crystal structures of bacterial histidine kinase receptors are the main targets of our efforts. To facilitate the structure determination, we have carried out a systematic approach in selecting and constructing expression vectors of these family members. Based on the complete analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, we identified 25 such <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02019;s kinase receptors, 23 of which are histidine kinase receptors and the remaining two being tyrosine kinase receptors. All these receptors are part of two-component transmembrane signaling systems.</p><p>We have prepared a two-prong approach in making expression constructs in order to analyze the effectiveness of Mistic fusion on protein expression. Our laboratory uses Gateway expression vector technology to construct these vectors so it is very easy of put these vectors together. One is fused with Mistic (Misticated), and the other without Mistic (non-Misticated). Both carry an octahistidine tag as an affinity tag to facilitate purification. These are further expanded by removing the putative signal sequence present in the gene, also by the addition of response regulators. This combinatorial mix of about 100 protein constructs are at various stages of the pipeline for overproduction. About 12 of those have reached the stage of well-behaving protein (grade A) purified at sufficient quantity for further work. The crystallization efforts are being made with various combinations of additives and detergents. The project utilizes significantly a high-throughput crystallization using Honeybee 96 robot in the laboratory. For human targets, we continue to optimize the high-throughput tools and vectors as well as control vectors to benchmark the progress in order to process 35 plates currently in possession, each containing 96 human targets. Lately, we have initiated a new approach using Mistic as a signal sequence of yeast expression system. All these expression vector systems rely on the Gateway technology to ease the exchange of expression vectors for a target gene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Bacterial secondary transporters (UCLA&#x02014;Kaback): Nucleobase Cation Symporter 2 (NCS2) family</title><p>The H<sup>+</sup>/nucleobase-ascorbate symporter YgfO, which belongs to the NCS2 family of transport proteins, is ubiquitously found in all cells from archaea to eukaryotes. This highly conserved family consists of purine, pyrimidine and <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate transporters, with members specific for the cellular uptake of uracil, xanthine or uric acid (microbial and plant genomes) or vitamin C (mammalian genomes), as well as several important purine-related drugs (5-fluorouracil, allopurinol, oxypurinol). Thus, a crystal structure of YgfO would be relevant to the development of anti-cancer drugs, drugs to treat gout and anti- oxidants. We cloned four members of NCS2 family from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, <italic>P. furiosus</italic> as well as <italic>T. maritimus,</italic> and expressed them in <italic>E. coli</italic> DE3 strain.

All LctP members are proposed to have 14&#x02013;16 transmembrane -helices with both N- and C-terminal exposed to the periplasm. We used the PhoA fusion approach where the expression construct is made with an embedded alkaline phosphatase sequence, permitting the gene expression to be easily monitored by a simple alkaline phosphatase assay. LctP appears to contain 14 transmembrane domains. <italic>E. coli</italic> LctP transports both <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-lactate and is a lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporter. It is also highly interesting that LctP is one of a group of acidic substrates that seems to be coupled to the pH gradient (interior alkaline) at ambient acidic pH values, but coupled to the membrane potential (interior negative) at more alkaline pH values. Recently, it was reported that LctP from <italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic> is important for pathogenesis. Crystals of LctP were obtained with PEG400/(NH4)2SO4 (pH 8.6) after several months incubation. At the ALS beamline 8.2.1, anisotropic diffraction is observed to 3.2/6.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5; and a data set was completed to 7.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Topology of MISTIC</title><p>MISTIC is a protein from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that is reported to facilitate expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We have utilized the alkaline phosphatase (<italic>phoA</italic>) fusion approach to study the topology of MISTIC in the membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The following PhoA fusions have been constructed: MISTIC-K28, -Y58, P63, Q66, K86, G115 and T139. The letters and numbers refer to positions in MISTIC where PhoA (alkaline phosphatase) fusions were constructed. For example, K28 means that the fusion construct is MISTIC from position 1 to 28, and the rest of the fusion protein is alkaline phosphatase. In order to be active alkaline phosphatase must be translocated into the periplasm. Since none of the fusions that Lan Guan constructed&#x02014;which run the length of MISTIC&#x02014;have alkaline phosphatase activity, the observations would be interpreted to mean that MISTIC has no transmembrane domains. Incidentally, this is a technique that was developed originally by Manoil and Beckwith in the early &#x02032;90s, and it has been used to test the hydropathy models of many polytopic membrane proteins in addition to LacY.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Transporters and channels (Stroud)</title><sec id="Sec38"><title>Ammonia channels</title><p>Inhibitory complex of the transmembrane ammonia channel, AmtB, and the cytosolic regulatory protein, GlnK, at 1.96&#x000a0;&#x000c5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Ammonia conductance is highly regulated.

It has been demonstrated to conduct ammonia without pH dependence seen in the human Rh channels and the mechanism is remarkably conserved to that of the Amt subfamily. Gas conduction is not yet demonstrated in our functional testing. Unlike many Rh ammonia channels, NeRh is not glycosylated. It is a trimer of 42&#x000a0;kDa monomers.

STEM imaging will advance due to the installation in the summer 2008 of an aberration-corrected and energy filtered 200&#x000a0;kV FEG STEM/TEM instrument at UC Davis, for which the Stahlberg lab is designing a new electron detector system and protocol to optimally harvest the phase contrast signal from that instrument. The Stahlberg lab is also hosting the next international workshop on electron crystallography of membrane proteins at UC Davis, which will take place Sept. 7&#x02013;13, 2008 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://2dx.org/workshop/2008">http://2dx.org/workshop/2008</ext-link>). The Stahlberg lab continues structural investigations of a number of membrane protein systems by lipid membrane reconstitution, 2D crystallization and electron microscopy imaging trials. We have successfully reconstituted cell-free expressed CCR5 (from the Choe lab) and see first signs of structure formation within the membranes. UhpB (Choe) is reconstituted and forms first small 2D crystals. Reconstitution was successful, but so far no crystals were obtained for the sensor protein PhoQ (Choe), the lactate permease LctP (Kaback), and ABC-R (from the lab of Krys Palczewski). The Stahlberg lab also has obtained 2D crystals of a KcsA-MloK1 chimera protein, in collaboration with Crina Nimigean, NY. These crystals might reveal the KcsA gating mechanism, since the MloK1 cyclic nucleotide binding domains can activate or block the KcsA channel function. 2D crystals of the membrane embedded KscA-MloK1 chimera are obtained at different pH values, and structural analysis is ongoing. We are streamlining the process of membrane protein structure determination by electron crystallography of 2D crystals.</p><sec id="Sec42"><title>2D Crystal trial volume reduction</title><p>Current 2D crystallization trials are done by dialyzing a protein-detergent-lipid mixture of a volume of ~100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l against detergent-free buffer. The Stahlberg lab has developed devices and a protocol for dialyzing much smaller 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l volumes. First results show that 2D crystallization does not scale linearly. Crystallization conditions for small and large volumes are different, and better crystals are generally obtained with larger volumes. Nevertheless, the smaller volumes allow screening a larger number of conditions with available protein material, after which the best conditions can be refined with larger volumes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>STEM imaging</title><p>Cryo-EM imaging of frozen hydrated and tilted specimen in the electron microscope suffers from beam-induced specimen movement or specimen charging, both of which severely limit the resolution of the structure in the direction perpendicular to the membrane plane. The Stahlberg group has compiled data that show that Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is not affected by this problem, thereby bypassing the major bottleneck of electron crystallography. However, STEM imaging exposes the samples to very high dose rates of electron beam irradiation, and STEM imaging conventionally does not give phase contrast images, so that the resulting images have little contrast at lethal electron doses for the proteins. The Stahlberg lab now has developed an aberration-corrected STEM imaging protocol that allows to operate the instrument at membrane-protein compatible electron doses (5 electrons per square angstrom), and also allows access to the phase contrast signal of the electron-beam/sample interaction. The Stahlberg lab also has obtained proof of a strong phase contrast signal under the developed conditions. While it is not yet clear if the phase contrast signal is comparable to the phase contrast signal in conventional bright-field cryo-EM imaging, this development nevertheless appears likely to allow membrane protein structure analysis by cryo-EM, without the limitation from beam-induced specimen movement or charging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Image processing</title><p>The Stahlberg lab continues developing new algorithms for membrane protein structure reconstruction from cryo-EM images of badly ordered 2D crystals. Realizing that the majority of the 2D crystals are not perfectly ordered, or that quasi-native membrane environments provide no crystallinity at all, such image processing will enable structure determination also from reconstituted but not crystalline membrane proteins. The Stahlberg lab is developing a single-particle 3D maximum likelihood software solution for such images, which is integrated into the user friendly 2dx software package that the Stahlberg lab is distributing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://2dx.org">http://2dx.org</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Structure determination of integral membrane proteins by NMR (Salk, Riek)&#x02014;small bacterial targets</title><p>Based on our structural investigations with MISTIC, we aim to determine several 3D structures of small integral membrane proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic>. <italic>E. coli</italic> has at least 52 integral membrane proteins with size smaller than 150 amino acids.
