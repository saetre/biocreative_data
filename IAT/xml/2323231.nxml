Intracellular iron deficiency leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], whereas an excess of cytosolic iron causes oxidative stress and necrosis through the production of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since neither iron deficiency nor excess are tolerated by cells, iron uptake and consumption must be tightly coordinated. Nearly all extracellular iron is bound to transferrin and uptake of iron-loaded transferrin is mediated primarily by the transferrin receptor (also named TfR1 or TFRC), which is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Iron is released from transferrin in the acidic endosomal environment and reaches the cytosol via divalent metal transporter 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Transferrin and its receptor recycle back to the cell surface where transferrin dissociates and is used for further cycles of iron binding and uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). There are three main determinants for transferrin and iron uptake: the rate of receptor internalization (k<sub>endo</sub>), the rate of recycling (k<sub>exo</sub>), and the total number of transferrin receptors involved in the endocytic cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Here we performed a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of the human signaling proteome to identify signaling molecules and pathways that regulate transferrin uptake and can thereby limit iron availability and cell growth.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Automated image-based quantification of iron-loaded transferrin uptake in HeLa cells. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic representation of the transferrin-mediated iron uptake system.

Increases or decreases in the rate of transferrin uptake were detected by monitoring the endosomal concentration of fluorescent transferrin using automated and quantitative high-throughput imaging. We applied automated image processing to measure the fluorescence intensity of perinuclear recycling endosomes in hundreds of individual cells per well of a 96-well plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The median of the measured single cell fluorescence intensity values (F) in a well was used as a measure of transferrin uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). This quantification was sufficiently sensitive to measure the time-course of transferrin uptake and recycling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>), as well as to detect expected decreases in transferrin uptake when we knocked down elements of the endocytic machinery, &#x003bc;2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor (AP2M1) or clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), using diced pools of siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). The coefficient of variation of the measured uptake values in a 96-well plate format was less than 5% (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1).</p><p>In order to probe the signaling pathways that may regulate transferrin uptake, we generated a library of diced siRNAs (d-siRNA) that included a comprehensive set of 1,920 genes from the predicted human signaling proteome (see Additional data file 2 for the complete list of the targeted genes). Targeted gene products were selected based on their signaling domain content, for example, kinase, SH2, PH, or PDZ domains, as well as descriptive key words, such as signal transduction, endocytosis and exocytosis, as annotated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Refseq and Conserved Domains (CDD) databases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; Additional data file 2). Components of canonical signaling pathways were included (for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cAMP, and ERK), as well as less characterized and putative signaling proteins and pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). We also targeted a number of specific vesicular transport-associated proteins expected to affect transferrin trafficking, such as clathrin chains, clathrin adapters and coat proteins, and included them as positive controls. This signaling RNA interference (RNAi) library was synthesized using a 96-well formatted protocol to generate double-stranded RNAs that were digested <italic>in vitro </italic>with recombinant human RNase III Dicer protein to produce target specific d-siRNA pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (see Figure S2 in Additional data file 1 for an illustration of the method). Amongst the initial 1,920 d-siRNAs, 1,804 passed our quality controls (see Materials and methods) and will be eventually considered. D-siRNAs have been shown in previous studies to provide, in nearly all tested cases, more than 50% knock-down of targeted gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Diced-siRNA screen of the human signaling proteome identifies regulators of transferrin uptake. <bold>(a) </bold>Selected d-siRNAs include proteins with known signaling related domains (as named and annotated in the NCBI CDD database of 20 July 2005 [29].

The average of the two normalized F scores is shown for each of the 1,804 d-siRNAs in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>. The scatter plot of the F scores obtained from duplicated d-siRNAs shows that the majority of hits that strongly deviated from the median were reproducible (Figure S3 in Additional data file 1).</p><p>An important step for identifying signaling proteins and pathways in a siRNA screen is to decide whether a particular value significantly deviates from the stochastic experimental noise. We developed a tool that we call CAsH (for Confidence Analysis of siRNA Hits) that compares each measured value to the noise distribution observed in the screen. The distribution of the variances between the duplicate measurements was used to evaluate the noise distribution, assuming that multiple measurements of the same d-siRNA, whether effective hits or not, have the same variance as repetitions of control d-siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Thus, the experimental noise is directly estimated from the relevant data set with no need to assay in parallel a large population of identical d-siRNAs. For each average F score from each d-siRNA, the calculated CAsH parameter then gives a probability score between -1 and 1. For instance, an effect with a CAsH score equal to -0.90 or 0.90 is expected to be observed 90% of the time as siRNA with suppressor or activator activity, respectively. Whereas the z-scores frequently used in siRNA screens are indicative of the position of a given siRNA relative to the whole data set distribution (therefore, their values depend on the hit content of the library), the CAsH scores reflect the confidence that the effect of a siRNA of interest will be observed again. Our screen had 183 d-siRNAs that resulted in an absolute value of the CAsH score &#x02265;0.95. (see Additional data file 3 for the list of primary hits and Figure S4 in Additional data file 1 for the distribution of the CAsH scores).</p><p>To reduce the number of false positive caused by systematic sources of noise occurring during the screening process, the primary hits were assayed again (using a higher concentration of d-siRNAs; 100 nM versus 20 nM). There were 154 genes (84%) that presented similar or stronger effects than observed in the primary screen. Amongst these genes, 91 were selected (based on consistency between replicates, quality of the diced siRNA pools (aspect on gel) and the length of their coding sequence (&#x0003e;900 base-pairs (bp) to allow the synthesis of a second independent batch of d-siRNA; see below)) and further assayed with a new batch of d-siRNA using the same sequence as the one used to perform the initial screen: 71 genes (approximately 80%) showed identical results between the two batches (Additional data file 3). Furthermore, in order to determine whether a particular hit is caused by on- or off-target effects, we performed another round of validation by testing a second set of d-siRNA pools that targeted a different region of the mRNA coding sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>, and see Additional data file 6 for the nucleotide sequences of the primers used). The probability that off-target effects were observed for such matching pairs of d-siRNAs is predicted to decrease with the square of the off-target rate for a single d-siRNA (off-target rate for paired hits is estimated to be &#x0003c;2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup>; see Materials and methods). Using both sets of d-siRNAs (at a concentration of 20 nM), we identified 21 pairs among the 71 selected genes that showed a significant effect for both the first and second d-siRNA pools (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f,g</xref>, and see Additional data file 4 for the list of the 21 high confidence hits). This validation rate of 21 out of 71 is likely not a result of off-target effects since we estimate that the upper limit for off-target effects is 5% (see Materials and methods). Systematic variations occurring during the d-siRNA synthesis process or intrinsic differences of the two template regions in producing efficient d-siRNAs, might explain why only one out of two d-siRNA pool is effective.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the mTOR pathway as primary signaling module controlling transferrin uptake</title><p>This set of 21 high confidence regulators of transferrin uptake contained a striking fraction of proteins from the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3)-target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Two of these proteins, TSC2 and PTEN, are known mTOR suppressors whose knock-down enhances transferrin uptake. Three others (PDK1, alias PDPK1, AKT1, and mTOR, alias FRAP1) are known activators whose knock-down reduces transferrin uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). We call such a match of the players, as well as of the direction of the effects, a signature of a particular signaling pathway. In addition to signature proteins of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR pathway, the other hits could be grouped into a set of miscellaneous putative signaling proteins that included three protein phosphatases, a PKA regulatory subunit, a cytoskeletal associated protein, PLEKHC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as well as TAOK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which has been proposed to be involved in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. A third identified group included components and regulators of the vesicular trafficking and endocytosis machinery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>, Additional data file 4).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR signaling pathway controls transferrin uptake. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic representation of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR signaling pathway. <bold>(b) </bold>Quantification of the effects of different siRNAs targeting the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR pathway and rapamycin (RAPA) on transferrin uptake.

When we compared the effect of d-siRNA pools and synthetic siRNAs, we found that knocking-down the identified activators of this pathway (mTOR, PDK1, AKT1) led in both cases to a reduction of transferrin uptake, whereas knocking-down inhibitors (TSC2, PTEN) increased uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, Figure S5a in Additional data file 1). We also tested for the effects of two other players in the mTOR pathway, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), which was initially not included in our d-siRNA library, and the GTPase RHEB. TSC1 synthetic siRNA increased transferrin uptake as did its partner TSC2, whereas RHEB synthetic siRNA had a strong inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). We further confirmed the involvement of the mTOR signaling pathway by treatment with rapamycin (20 nM for 24 hours), a small molecule inhibitor of mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which reduced transferrin uptake to a similar extent as mTOR knock-down (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p><p>We then verified whether the identified d-siRNAs targeting the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR module interfere with mTOR signaling by using phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (on Ser235/236) as a cell-based readout for mTOR activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c,d</xref>). We found marked effects on S6 protein phosphorylation that closely corresponded to the effects on transferrin uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). This supports the notion that the identified genes are part of the same signaling module that includes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and mTOR signaling. Taken together, these results further argue that transferrin uptake is under the control of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR signaling pathway.</p><p>The specificity of mTOR signaling for regulating transferrin uptake was investigated by comparing the effect of rapamycin on uptake of transferrin, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) using fluorescently labeled ligands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). Consistent with a preferential role of mTOR signaling for transferrin uptake, the effect of mTOR inhibition was significantly stronger for transferrin uptake compared to LDL or EGF uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>The PI3K-mTOR pathway controls iron uptake by regulating the number of transferrin receptors per endocytic vesicle</title><p>Transferrin uptake activity is dependent on endocytic and recycling rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), and mTOR has been reported to regulate bulk flow as well as specific forms of receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether part or all of the rapamycin effect on transferrin uptake could be explained by mTOR-mediated regulation of the endocytosis or recycling rates. A rapamycin-induced reduction in either one of the rates would reduce the measured transferrin uptake. While rapamycin treatment reduced the steady state concentration of internalized endosomal transferrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), neither the time constant for endocytosis nor recycling were significantly altered by rapamycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>mTOR controls transferrin uptake by regulation of the number of transferrin receptors per vesicle and not endocytosis or recycling rates. <bold>(a) </bold>Effect of rapamycin on the time-course of fluorescent transferrin endocytosis (left) and recycling (right).

Earlier studies have shown that mTOR can regulate the concentration of specific proteins and cell mass by enhancing translation via the translation regulators S6 kinase 1 and eIF4E-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as well as by regulating protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We tested whether the concentration of the transferrin receptor is affected by using an immunofluorescence-based assay in permeabilized cells, using transferrin receptor-specific antibodies. Targeting mTOR with d-siRNAs caused a 20% reduction of the integrated transferrin receptor fluorescence. Targeting AKT1 and PDK1 had smaller inhibitory effects, whereas targeting TSC2 or PTEN led to an increase in the integrated transferrin receptor fluorescence intensity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, and Figure S5b in Additional data file 1). The amplitude of the effects of different d-siRNAs on transferrin uptake were correlated with the number of transferrin receptors per cell, suggesting that increases and decreases in mTOR signaling are translated into higher and lower numbers of transferrin receptors resulting in increased or decreased transferrin uptake (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). As a control, knock-down of clathrin heavy chain d-siRNAs (CLTC), which suppresses transferrin uptake by reducing endocytosis rates, did not show the same concomitant decrease in transferrin receptor concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). We also confirmed that rapamycin treatment (20 nM for 24 hours) had a similar effect on the integrated transferrin receptor fluorescence compared to the effect of mTOR d-siRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). As a control, we also found that the number of transferrin receptors is much more strongly affected by mTOR inhibition compared to two other abundant reference proteins, actin and tubulin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). This also suggested that cell mass was only weakly affected for the conditions used in our experiments.</p><p>The reduction in transferrin uptake and total transferrin receptor number likely reflects a lower number of transferrin and transferrin receptors per endocytic carrier but could also reflect a lower number of transferrin-containing endocytic carriers. We therefore measured the relative number of transferrin molecules per vesicle by using a texture algorithm that integrated the total intensity of each vesicle over a local background. As shown in the histogram of the fluorescence intensity of individual endocytic vesicles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>), rapamycin treatment induced a marked decrease in the transferrin staining per vesicle but only a relatively small decrease in the number of endocytic vesicles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g</xref>). Taken together, this indicates that the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR pathway primarily regulates the number of transferrin receptor molecules per endocytic vesicle rather than recycling rates or endosome number and that this regulation is preferential for transferrin over LDL and EGF uptake.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study identifies the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mTOR signaling pathway as an important regulator of transferrin uptake, adding a new function to this important regulatory system for cell growth. The mTOR pathway is known to integrate inputs from growth factor receptors, amino acid availability, AMP/ATP ratio and 'stress' (hypoxia, DNA damage) and to respond by adjusting the rate of cell growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since excess iron is toxic and since iron uptake is also rate-limiting for cell growth, cells may use PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 -mTOR regulation of transferrin uptake to reduce the toxic effect of iron accumulation as well as to promote cell growth and proliferation. Considering the critical dependence of oxygen-based metabolism on intracellular iron concentration, these results may also explain the reported correlation of mTOR activity with mitochondrial oxygen consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The question of how mTOR regulates the number of transferrin receptors remains open. mTOR-dependent stabilization of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) or c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], both well characterized transcriptional activators of the transferrin receptor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], could account for the observed effect of mTOR activity on transferrin receptor level but other mechanisms based on translation or protein degradation are also plausible.</p><p>Our study provides a proof-of-concept that small human siRNA libraries focused on the signaling proteome can serve as powerful and unbiased genomic survey tools to discover or rank signaling pathways that regulate a particular cell function. Here we show that the key role of an important signaling pathway can be demonstrated from what we call a siRNA signature that consists of multiple suppressor and activator proteins in that pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of diced-siRNA pools</title><p>The protocol used to synthesize d-siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] has been scaled-up to synthesize the 1,920 d-siRNAs library as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Specific primers for each selected gene (Additional data file 5) were automatically designed and were used to amplify from a cDNA library an approximately 600 bp PCR fragment of the 3' region of the coding sequence. A second amplification was performed with a set of nested primers bearing a T7 promoter sequence on their 5' extension. Nested PCR products with no products or products of unexpected size (116 genes among the 1,920) were eliminated from the analysis of the screen. Nested PCR products were transcribed <italic>in vitro </italic>(T7 MEGA script kit, Ambion; Austin, TX, USA) and the resulting double-stranded RNAs were annealed and processed with 30 units/reaction of human recombinant Dicer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 15 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The 21-mer d-siRNAs were separated from incompletely digested fragments using a succession of isopropanol precipitations and filtration on glass fiber plates (Nunc; Rochester, NY, USA). Synthetic siRNAs were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Transfection and transferrin internalization assays</title><p>HeLa cells were plated at a density of 1,800 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The d-siRNAs (approximately 20 ng/well) in a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l were transfected the following day using Gene Silencer (Genlantis; San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two and a half days after transfection, cells were washed twice with warmed DMEM/HEPES and incubated with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>594-labelled holotransferrin (Invitrogen) for 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Surface-bound transferrin was stripped off with a 1 minute incubation in NaCl (500 mM)/acetic acid (200 mM). Following pH neutralization with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and nuclei stained with Hoechst.</p><p>Time-courses of transferrin uptake (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) were determined as indicated above but transferrin accumulation was stopped at the indicated time. For recycling experiments, cells were first loaded with fluorescent transferrin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C and then washed and incubated with non-fluorescent transferrin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) for the indicated times.

Thirteen pairs of images (Hoechst and Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>594 channels) were acquired per well. Image analysis was performed using the ImageXpress database and software. Images were corrected for non-uniform illumination and segmented using the nucleus-associated Hoechst fluorescence. Nuclear regions were then symmetrically expanded (+5 &#x003bc;m) in order to include the perinuclear endosomal recycling compartment. For each detected cell, the background-subtracted average intensities of the perinuclear regions were measured in the Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>594 channel. This method is independent of the size of the cells but the size of nuclei might have influenced the scoring but only slightly since average intensities were considered. The scores of d-siRNAs strongly affecting cell viability did not affect the final scoring since 'toxic' d-siRNAs were generally outliers (for example, KIF11/Eg5) or did not score at all because the scores were calculated on few living cells, which were not probably transfected. COPB1 and ARCN1 affected cell viability but were considered as hits because transferrin internalization was greatly reduced even in the remaining cells.</p><p>For immunostaining, intensities integrated over the entire cell area were used to estimate the total amount of TFRC, as well as the total amount of actin or tubulin per cell. These values were extracted automatically in two steps: first, nuclear regions were expanded (+20 &#x003bc;m) in order to include the entire cells; and second, expanded regions were shrunk to fit the cell perimeters (using the antibody-associated intensities to threshold the images). The resulting cell areas were used to calculate single cell integrated intensities. To compare transferrin, LDL and EGF uptake, a texture detection algorithm implemented in the ImageXpress 1.0 software suite was used to identify fluorescent punctuate structures and to estimate the vesicular density per cell, as well as the average vesicle intensity. Single cell, average phospho-S6 immunofluorescence intensity was measured in a 3 &#x003bc;m ring around cell nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the relative number of transferrin molecules per vesicle</title><p>For the results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f,g</xref>, a Gaussian filter adjusted for an average vesicle diameter of 2.2 pixels was used to subtract a local background intensity of each transferrin containing vesicle. The average of five pixel intensity values was used as a measure of the intensity of transferrin-loaded vesicles. The 30 brightest vesicles per cell were used for analysis. Rapamycin treatment reduced the average intensity of these 30 brightest vesicles by 25%. This was used to adjust the relative intensity threshold used for counting the number of vesicles in the control case as well as for the rapamycin treated cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of the number of hits in the primary screen: CAsH analysis</title><p>The experimental noise distribution was estimated using the distribution of the deviations of the duplicated F values.

The estimate for the off-target probability was based on the 10% hit rate of the initial screen, approximately 183/1,804. Hits occurred approximately 5% of the time in a given direction (increase versus decrease). Assuming that all the hits are off-target effects (worst case scenario), the upper boundary for off-target effects from the screen becomes 5% and the probability for two independent siRNAs to both be off-target and go in the same direction is therefore expected to be less than 0.25%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>The following additional data is available with the online version of this manuscript.
