Neutrophils and monocytes have abundant ANXA1 levels. AIM: We have investigated, for the first time, ANXA1 ultrastructural expression in rat eosinophils and compared it with that of extravasated neutrophils. The effect of inflammation (carrageenin peritonitis) was also monitored. METHODS: Electron microscopy was used to define the sub-cellular localisation of ANXA1 in rat eosinophils and neutrophils extravasated in the mesenteric tissue. A pair of antibodies raised against the ANXA1 N-terminus (i.e. able to recognise intact ANXA1, termed LCPS1) or the whole protein (termed LCS3) was used to perform the ultrastructural analysis. RESULTS: The majority of ANXA1 was localised in the eosinophil cytosol (approximately 60%) and nucleus (30-40%), whereas a small percentage was found on the plasma membrane (&#x0003c; 10%). Within the cytosol, the protein was equally distributed in the matrix and in the granules, including those containing the typical crystalloid. The two anti-ANXA1 antibodies gave similar results, with the exception that LCPS1 gave a lower degree of immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane. Inflammation (i.e. carrageenin injection) produced a modest increase in eosinophil-associated ANXA1 reactivity (significant only in the cytoplasm compartment). Extravasated neutrophils, used for comparative purposes, displayed a much higher degree of immunoreactivity for the protein. CONCLUSION: We describe for the first time ANXA1 distribution in rat eosinophil by ultrastructural analysis, and report a different protein mobilisation from extravasated neutrophils, at least in this acute model of peritonitis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
