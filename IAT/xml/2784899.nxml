Here we investigated biological effects and signaling pathways of ASIP. Melan-a non agouti (<italic>a/a</italic>) mouse melanocytes produce mainly eumelanin, but ASIP combined with phenylthiourea and extra cysteine could induce over 200-fold increases in the pheomelanin to eumelanin ratio, and a tan-yellow color in pelletted cells. Moreover, ASIP-treated cells showed reduced proliferation and a melanoblast-like appearance, seen also in melanocyte lines from yellow (<italic>A</italic><sup><italic>y</italic></sup><italic>/a</italic> and <italic>Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup><italic>/ Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup>) mice. However ASIP-YY, a C-terminal fragment of ASIP, induced neither biological nor pigmentary changes. As, like ASIP, ASIP-YY inhibited the cAMP rise induced by &#x003b1;MSH analog NDP-MSH, and reduced cAMP level without added MSH, the morphological changes and depigmentation seemed independent of cAMP signaling. Melanocytes genetically null for ASIP mediators attractin or mahogunin (<italic>Atrn</italic><sup><italic>mg-3J/mg-3J</italic></sup> or <italic>Mgrn1</italic><sup><italic>md-nc/md-nc</italic></sup>) also responded to both ASIP and ASIP-YY in cAMP level, while only ASIP altered their proliferation and (in part) shape. Thus, ASIP&#x02013;MC1R signaling includes a cAMP-independent pathway through attractin and mahogunin, while the known cAMP-dependent component requires neither attractin nor mahogunin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pheomelanin</kwd><kwd>agouti</kwd><kwd>Mc1r</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>melanoblast</kwd><kwd>attractin</kwd><kwd>mahogunin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Many animal colors and patterns as well as human hair and eye color are genetically determined through the relative amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesized. Humans with red (pheomelanic) hair in general, and with specific hypomorphic <italic>MC1R</italic> mutations in particular, have increased susceptibility to melanoma, and the mechanism for this remains uncertain. Melanin, especially pheomelanin, has been implicated in mutagenesis in melanocytes by ultraviolet light, particularly UVA, via release of reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA. Ability to regulate the switch between eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis in cultured melanocytes would greatly aid studies of mutagenesis and photocarcinogenesis in these cells. This work may also shed some light on the longstanding puzzle of how cAMP levels and ASIP can control both melanocytic differentiation and pigment-type switching.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The diverse patterns of mammalian coat color are determined by the quantity and distribution of just two types of organic pigment: eumelanin (black to brown) and pheomelanin (yellow to red) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ito, 2003</xref>). Both are produced by melanocytes in the hair bulbs and basal epidermis. They are synthesized and accumulate in melanosomes, specialized organelles which are transferred to keratinocytes of the hair and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jimbow et al., 2000</xref>). Each melanocyte can produce either eumelanin or pheomelanin, depending on the hormonal and chemical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>). In agouti (wild-type) mice the dorsal hairs are black with a sub-apical yellow band because, in the hair cycle, follicular melanocytes produce first eumelanin, then pheomelanin, then eumelanin again (pigment-type switching) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Genetic studies of coat color in mice have contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms of melanin synthesis and its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bennett and Lamoreux, 2003</xref>). Two major loci are central to pigment-type switching in mouse. One is the agouti locus encoding agouti signal protein (ASIP), with mutants including non agouti (<italic>a</italic>, giving a eumelanic black mouse in the absence of other mutations) and dominant yellow (<italic>A</italic><sup><italic>y</italic></sup>); the other is the melanocortin-1 receptor (<italic>Mc1r</italic>) locus, formerly extension (<italic>e</italic>), also with both eumelanic and pheomelanic mutants (e.g. recessive yellow<italic>, Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>). Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptor for which the best-known agonist is the soluble peptide &#x003b1;MSH, cleaved from the precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the pituitary and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Garc&#x000ed;a-Borr&#x000f3;n et al., 2005</xref>). Binding of &#x003b1;MSH to MC1R is known to activate adenylate cyclase and cAMP synthesis, promoting eumelanin synthesis through both post-translational [review: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bennett, 1989</xref>)] and transcriptional pathways via microphthalmia-related transcription factor (MITF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bertolotto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levy et al., 2006</xref>). Microphthalmia-related transcription factor is a master regulator for eumelanogenesis, melanocyte differentiation, proliferation, and survival. It promotes transcription of melanocyte-specific gene products including melanosomal enzymes tyrosinase, TYRP1 and DCT and the matrix protein SILV/PMEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levy et al., 2006</xref>). Synthesis of both eumelanin and pheomelanin starts from tyrosine oxidation catalyzed by tyrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ito, 2003</xref>). The resulting dopaquinone can be a precursor for either eumelanin synthesis, promoted by TYRP1 and DCT, or pheomelanin in the presence of high cysteine concentrations and/or low tyrosinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ito, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Land et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Agouti signaling protein is a soluble protein of 131 amino acids, apparently secreted by dermal papilla cells in hair bulbs. It competitively antagonizes &#x003b1;MSH at the MC1R and inhibits the eumelanogenic signal, downregulating melanogenic enzymes and leading to pheomelanin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Millar et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The above account does not however explain certain data on pigment-type switching. Firstly, a homozygous null mutation of <italic>Pomc</italic> has no effect on the black pigmentation of <italic>a/a</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Slominski et al., 2005</xref>), and has also been reported in a black-haired human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cl&#x000e9;ment et al., 2008</xref>) consistent with reports that MC1R has constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Garc&#x000ed;a-Borr&#x000f3;n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sanchez-Mas et al., 2004</xref>). While ASIP requires the MC1R to affect melanocytes, it can signal in the absence of added &#x003b1;MSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdel-Malek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sakai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sviderskaya et al., 2001</xref>), thus acting as an inverse agonist at the MC1R rather than just an MSH antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>). Secondly, molecules outside the cAMP pathway are indispensable for ASIP to signal pheomelanogenesis. Mice with null mutations at the attractin (<italic>Atrn,</italic> formerly mahogany) or mahogunin (<italic>Mgrn1,</italic> formerly mahoganoid) loci produce eumelanin and no pheomelanin, even in the presence of ASIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">He et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2003</xref>). Attractin is a type I transmembrane protein proposed to be an obligatory accessory receptor for ASIP, while MGRN1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>). Although their precise contributions to ASIP signaling remain unclear, ATRN and MGRN1 are components with ASIP and MC1R of a conserved biochemical and genetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">He et al., 2003</xref>). Thirdly, ASIP has not been found to enhance pheomelanogenesis in cultured melanocytes, although ASIP can inhibit cAMP generation in MC1R-expressing cells including melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdel-Malek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Le Pape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ollmann et al., 1998</xref>). No culture conditions have been developed in which melanocytes produce exclusively pheomelanin, even with ASIP. This suggests that either a factor(s) present in vivo is missing, or that something present in cultures may prevent pheomelanogenesis.</p><p>To aid understanding of ASIP signaling, we have sought to develop culture conditions under which ASIP contributes to overt pheomelanin synthesis by the melan-a immortal murine melanocyte line. We report conditions enabling substantially increased pheomelanin/eumelanin ratios and visibly yellow cell pellets. To elucidate ASIP signaling, we also established new mouse melanocyte lines of four relevant mutant genotypes, namely <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>y</italic></sup> mutant cells from mice with constitutive ASIP synthesis from a housekeeping promoter, <italic>Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup><italic>/ Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup> cells with a non-functional MC1R receptor, and melanocytes with null mutations of <italic>Atrn</italic> and <italic>Mgrn1</italic>. Taken together, the data demonstrate that ASIP signaling can reduce melanocyte growth and induce morphological dedifferentiation as well as affecting pigmentation. These biological effects are mimicked in genetically yellow melanocytes without added ASIP, are incomplete in <italic>Atrn-</italic> and <italic>Mgrn1-</italic>null melanocytes, appear independent of cAMP downregulation, and require the amino terminus of ASIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Melanoblast-like morphology and reduced proliferation of melanocytes grown with ASIP</title><p>Melan-a cells (<italic>a/a</italic>) grown with 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) normally show a dendritic, well-differentiated appearance with abundant eumelanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bennett et al., 1987</xref>). The appearance of these cells was dramatically changed however within 5 days&#x02019; culture with 10 nM murine ASIP. The cells became shorter, smaller, and less dendritic, often with a crescent shape and ruffled membrane on the convex side, and markedly less pigmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). This appearance resembled that of normal and immortal melanoblasts &#x02013; unpigmented melanocyte precursors &#x02013; in similar media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sviderskaya et al., 1995</xref>).

Agouti signaling protein was apparently inducing rapid morphological dedifferentiation of melan-a cells, although a few cells (possibly non-dividing) remained well-pigmented. Transitional forms were rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The proliferation rate of melan-a cells was also significantly reduced in the presence of ASIP (data in a later section), as also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Le Pape et al.

Agouti signaling protein had no detectable effect on these cells, indicating that the morphological effect is specific (details in a later section).</p></sec><sec><title>Pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio markedly enhanced by ASIP, cysteine, and PTU</title><p>Pheomelanin and eumelanin content and their ratio in melan-a cells were quantitated by chemical degradation and high performance liquid chromatography. In preliminary experiments, no increase of pheomelanin content was detected on growth with ASIP alone, as previously reported by others. Therefore other relevant factors, the cysteine concentration and tyrosinase activity [using the tyrosinase inhibitor phenylthiourea (PTU)], were modulated together with ASIP addition. Cells were preincubated with PTU for 2 weeks beforehand to allow dilution of preexisting eumelanin by cell proliferation (melan-a cells in the absence of keratinocytes do not significantly secrete or degrade melanin, as recently confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Le Pape et al. (2008)</xref>), and monitoring only of melanin synthesized during the experiment. In a typical experiment, eumelanin content was reduced around 10-fold after growth with 10 nM ASIP for 14 days, while pheomelanin content was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio was thus increased over 10-fold. In the presence of ASIP, an additional 2 mM cysteine reduced eumelanin content further, and increased pheomelanin content, while continuation of PTU addition (100 &#x003bc;M) substantially reduced eumelanin content without significantly affecting pheomelanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). With ASIP, cysteine, and PTU together pheomelanin content was around four times that with ASIP alone. In the experiment shown, the pheomelanin and eumelanin ratio in cells grown with ASIP, cysteine, and PTU was 0.13, over 200-fold higher than with no addition, and strikingly high compared with other findings with cultured melanocytes. Cell pellets were brown rather than black in color (not shown). In a separate experiment, melan-a cell pellets were prepared after culture with and without combinations of these factors and TPA (TPA was previously present throughout). Here cells were precultured with 500 &#x003bc;M rather than 300 &#x003bc;M PTU to assist complete depletion of eumelanin, and grown with ASIP etc for 5 days only. The combination of ASIP and high cysteine now gave a tan-yellow cell pellet, or white with continued PTU addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). Overlap of the exposure to high PTU with ASIP treatment would have prevented the synthesis of any eumelanin in the period before ASIP had taken effect, but reduction of the PTU level was then necessary for any melanin synthesis at all to occur. Supplementation of the precursor cysteine was evidently needed for synthesis of enough pheomelanin to give a yellow color. Pellets of cells grown without TPA were darker than those with TPA, and smaller, reflecting lower cell numbers (slower growth).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Marked increases in pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio and tan coloration by agouti signaling protein (ASIP), cysteine and phenylthiourea (PTU).

Melanocytes of both yellow genotypes were difficult to grow, with sparse plating and slow growth in all cultures compared with other genotypes in our experience. Initially the cells were maintained in standard conditions with TPA and cholera toxin (CT, 200 pM) to promote proliferation. Cultures of a given genotype appeared similar. The three melan-e cultures appeared hypersensitive to 200 pM CT, with high dendricity, pigmentation and reduced growth; accordingly CT was varied and stocks were grown with 20 pM CT (which appeared optimal) for a number of passages. Cells in all lines of both genotypes now appeared similar: dark, well-differentiated, large, flat, bipolar or polygonal cells, usually with numerous visible melanosomes, and similar to melan-a cells with 20 pM CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). The cell color by light microscopy and the pellet color (not shown) were black. For further studies a single line of each type was used, melan-Ay1 and melan-e2. Cholera toxin was removed entirely from both lines after passage 10. Growth seemed to be transiently inhibited, then recovered. Both melan-Ay and melan-e cells without CT became small, curly and bipolar, with few dendrites and little pigment, again resembling melanoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Melan-Ay cells grew more slowly in growth medium alone than with 20 pM CT or 100 pM NDP-MSH [(4-Nle, 7-D-Phe)-&#x003b1;-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a serum-stable synthetic MSH analog] (doubling times 2.6, 1.6 and 1.5 days respectively, averaged over three passages with duplicate dishes). Likewise, melan-e cells showed doubling times of 2.1 and 1.4 days without and with 20 pM CT. Like melan-a cells with ASIP, some melan-Ay and melan-e cells without CT remained heavily pigmented and dendritic. The change was reversible in both melan-Ay and melan-e cells: when reincubated with CT, they regained the previous melanocytic appearance (melan-e: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>; not shown for melan-Ay).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Melanoblast-like appearance of melan-Ay and melan-e cells in the absence of CT.

This domain of ASIP is sufficient for high-affinity receptor binding in vitro. ASIP-YY displaces NDP-MSH from human melanocortin receptors expressed on HEK-293 human kidney cells, and inhibits &#x003b1;MSH-stimulated cAMP production, demonstrating competitive antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">McNulty et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, melan-a cells grown with up to 100 nM ASIP-YY showed no visible difference from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref>), and no effect on melanin content nor cell growth, although 10 nM ASIP induced the usual shape-change and depigmentation in parallel cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B, C</xref>). To ensure that our ASIP-YY preparation retained its known inhibitory activity, we evaluated its inhibition of MSH-induced cAMP production in melan-a cells. Cells were stimulated with 30 pM NDP-MSH (found to give maximal stimulation in this assay &#x02013; data not shown), and intracellular cAMP was quantitated by ELISA. NDP-MSH alone induced a more than 200-fold increase in cAMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>, black bars). Neither 1 nM ASIP nor 1 nM ASIP-YY affected this increase, but 10 nM and 100 nM ASIP reduced it by 2/3 and to zero respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>, striped bars). ASIP-YY did inhibit the cAMP stimulation to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>, dotted bars). To exclude the possibility that ASIP-YY is rapidly degraded in serum-containing medium, 100 nM ASIP or 100 nM ASIP-YY were incubated with culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C overnight and the mixture was used as stimulating buffer for cAMP measurements. Both ASIP and ASIP-YY still inhibited the MSH-induced cAMP rise completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>, bars with asterisks). Thus, ASIP-YY could inhibit cAMP stimulation as effectively as ASIP. Lastly, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5C</xref>, melanocytes cultured in the absence of added melanocortin showed similar decreases in cAMP level with either ASIP or ASIP-YY.

The promotion of pheomelanogenesis by PTU is consistent with the biochemical kinetics favoring cysteinyldopa formation at low tyrosinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ito and Wakamatsu, 2008</xref>). The inhibition of melanogenesis and proliferation by ASIP in melan-a cells were also recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Le Pape et al. (2008)</xref>, but genetic requirements, receptor-specificity and cysteine effects were not analyzed. There were some minor differences in outcomes, for example they saw a reduction in pheomelanin content with ASIP alone and we did not; these may be attributable to differences in protocol (for example our longer treatment times), in exact culture conditions or in cell passage level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Le Pape et al. (2009)</xref> have also now reported a valuable microarray analysis of gene expression changes in melan-a cells grown with ASIP, which supports the concept of partial dedifferentiation and complements the present findings; for example reduced expression of a large number of pigmentary genes including <italic>Mitf</italic> was noted after growth with ASIP.</p><p>Several observations in the present study indicate that the morphological dedifferentiation seen with ASIP is a specific effect rather than due to a contaminant. Firstly, the cell shape change was deficient in MGRN1-null melan-md cells and ATRN-null melan-mg cells, and completely absent from MC1R-null melan-e cells grown with a trace of CT. Secondly, the altered cells looked like normal melanoblasts rather than appearing abnormal or unhealthy. We have never observed any other substance to transform melan-a cells in this way; on the other hand ASIP does inhibit forward differentiation of melanoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aberdam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sviderskaya et al., 2001</xref>). Thirdly, the same melanoblast-like shape was also observed in melan-Ay cells without CT (and without added ASIP), indicating that it could also be induced by endogenous mouse ASIP. Again it was seen in melan-e melanocytes without CT, and it was suppressed in both melan-Ay and melan-e cells by CT.</p><p>Surprisingly, these morphological changes and reduced melanin content were not provoked by the ASIP C-terminus (ASIP-YY), although this fully inhibited the stimulation of cAMP by MSH, and reduced the cAMP level in the absence of added melanocortin. Thus, reduced intracellular cAMP is not sufficient for any of the biological effects of ASIP observed here, even though many findings support the sufficiency of increased cAMP for forward melanocytic differentiation [reviews: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bennett, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bertolotto et al., 1998</xref>)], including the effects reported here of CT, a cAMP agonist.</p><p>The growth inhibition by ASIP apparently also required the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of ASIP, as it was not produced by ASIP-YY. However it required neither MGRN1 nor ATRN, as melan-md and -mg cells were also inhibited, if anything more markedly than melan-a cells. This was the only tested biological effect of ASIP not diminished in melan-mg and -md cells. Surprisingly, it appeared independent of the ability to reduce cAMP level, as ASIP-YY affected cAMP but not growth. We cannot entirely discount the possibility that this growth inhibition was partly non-specific, but a counterargument is that slower growth than in wild-type melanocytes also accompanied the melanoblast-like phenotype seen in melan-Ay cells which make endogenous ASIP, and melan-e cells without CT.</p><p>Melanocortin receptors and ATRN are the only molecules known to bind ASIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdel-Malek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">He et al., 2003</xref>). Attractin is required for ASIP effects in the mouse, and was suggested to function to enhance ASIP&#x02013;MC1R binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barsh, 2006</xref>). Thus it was surprising that we saw partial morphological and depigmentation effects of ASIP on ATRN-null melanocytes. Perhaps ASIP also has some partial effects in vivo in ATRN-null mice, but they are not sufficient to dilute visibly the black color of hair. Agouti signaling protein (ASIP)&#x02019;s morphological effects were very deficient in MGRN1-null melanocytes, consistent with the requirement of MGRN1 for ASIP action in mice.</p><p>Through which signaling pathway does ASIP/MC1R induce biological effects, if not through reduced cAMP? Each of five melanocortin receptor subtypes couples to adenylate cyclase, generating cAMP and activating PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Garc&#x000ed;a-Borr&#x000f3;n et al., 2005</xref>). Other signaling intermediates reported to be activated by MSH/MC1R in melanocytes or melanoma cells include protein kinase C, nitric oxide, p38MAPK and p42/p44MAPK, with the first three reported to stimulate melanogenesis/differentiation, but in each case there was evidence that the effect was dependent on cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Buffey et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Englaro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Smalley and Eisen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Tsatmali et al., 2000</xref>). Another candidate pathway is through G<sub>q</sub> and/or phospholipase C. Coupling to inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>signaling (which G<sub>q</sub> and phospholipase C could mediate) has been reported for a number of human and mouse melanocortin receptors, including MC1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Eves et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Garc&#x000ed;a-Borr&#x000f3;n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Mountjoy et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, a novel high-affinity ligand for MC1R was identified in dogs, namely canine &#x003b2;-defensin 103 (CBD103), encoded at the <italic>K</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Candille et al., 2007</xref>). Transgenic mice expressing cDNAs for either of two (canine) CBD103 alleles on an <italic>A/A</italic> (agouti) background had a black coat color. Canine and human &#x003b2;-defensins could bind dog, mouse and human MC1Rs, but not ASIP-YY. Interestingly, neither canine cDNA affected cAMP concentration in melan-a melanocytes. CBD103 might act by competitively inhibiting ASIP binding, or might elicit cAMP-independent signaling from the MC1R to promote eumelanogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Candille et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Considering this with our results, we hypothesize dual signaling from MC1R, as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>). Melanocortin-1 receptor can activate both cAMP and another signaling pathway X. Activation of X may be cAMP-dependent or -independent; X may also be the cAMP-independent pathway activated by &#x003b2;-defensins. Agouti signaling protein can antagonize cAMP signaling through its <italic>C</italic>-terminus (as in ASIP-YY) and independently antagonize X signaling through its <italic>N</italic>-terminus and through ATRN and MGRN1, resulting in inhibition of eumelanogenesis, enhancement of pheomelanogenesis (under suitable conditions), and melanoblast-like morphology. To explain the activation of eumelanogenesis by cAMP, yet persistence of eumelanogenesis when the cAMP signal is withdrawn, we suggest a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>), likely to involve MITF as MITF mediates melanocytic differentiation. Agouti signaling protein can also downregulate MITF gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Le Pape et al., 2009</xref>). The components of this proposed loop remain to be elucidated, but we suggest that MGRN1, a ubiquitin ligase, may break the loop by ubiquitinating and destabilizing one component Y. This would lead to a less-differentiated state with low MITF activity, permissive for pheomelanogenesis.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Model to account for responsiveness to cAMP level in activation but not inactivation of eumelanin synthesis.

Likewise, pheomelanin content in melan-a cells was not increased by ASIP alone in this study. With ASIP, cysteine and PTU however, a substantially increased pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio of 0.13 was seen here, although this was not complete pigment type-switching, as the ratio in yellow mouse hair can exceed 100:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Ozeki et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, visibly yellow pelletted cells were obtained with a specific combination of intensive PTU pretreatment, ASIP and cysteine, illustrating the sensitivity of the pheomelanin&#x02013;eumelanin ratio to precise culture history. Further work is needed to produce overt pigment-type switching in culture, but further combinations of the above factors may prove fruitful.</p><p>Receptor-specific induction of a melanoblast-like shape from melanocytes by ASIP and a similar effect of MC1R inactivity have not been reported before. The recurrent melanoblast-like morphology in genetically yellow and ASIP-treated melanocytes suggests a possible relationship between dedifferentiation and pheomelanogenesis, supported by the known inhibition of forward melanoblast differentiation by ASIP. <italic>Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup><italic>/Mc1r</italic><sup><italic>e</italic></sup> melanocyte cultures were reported previously, but were grown with dibutyryl cAMP and were described only as pigmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Costin et al., 2004</xref>). Melan-a cells treated with ASIP lose expression of TYRP1, DCT, and SILV/PMEL, all needed to generate normal eumelanosomes but not pheomelanosomes, while retaining low tyrosinase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sakai et al., 1997</xref>) which would favor pheomelanogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ito, 2003</xref>). Thus a partial equivalence between melanoblasts and the cells that make pheomelanin seems possible; melanoblasts do express some tyrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sviderskaya et al., 1995</xref>), have low DCT, TYRP1, and MITF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aberdam et al., 1998</xref>), and contain premelanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hirobe and Takeuchi, 1978</xref>). Premelanosomes and pheomelanosomes are evidently not the same, as the latter contain pheomelanin, but the difference may depend on relatively minor factors such as cysteine concentration.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that ASIP&#x02019;s biological effects require a cAMP-independent signaling pathway via MC1R and MGRN1 and facilitated by ATRN, which plays a key role in regulating melanogenesis and melanocyte morphology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Tissue culture plastics and FBS were from Gibco Europe (Paisley, UK).

Melan-a cells are functionally <italic>Ink4a-Arf</italic> null, expressing neither p16<sup>INK4A</sup> nor ARF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sviderskaya et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Melanin and cell proliferation assays</title><p>Lyophilized samples of 0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> melanocytes were processed for chemical analyses to detect the specific degradation product of eumelanin, pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA), after permanganate oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ito and Fujita, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Ito and Wakamatsu, 1994</xref>) and the specific degradation product of pheomelanin, 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (4-AHP), after hydriodic acid hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ito and Fujita, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wakamatsu et al., 2002</xref>). Both products were quantified by HPLC. The amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin were obtained by multiplying the amounts of PTCA and 4-AHP by conversion factors of 50 and nine respectively. For measurement of total melanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Friedmann et al., 1990</xref>), cell pellets were resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l NaOH (1 M) and diluted with 400 &#x003bc;l water. The OD<sub>472</sub> was measured and converted to melanin content via a standard curve using synthetic melanin (Sigma). This was normalized to cell number.</p><p>To calculate cell doubling times, triplicate cultures were plated at the specified density on 3-cm dishes. When cells were nearly confluent, they were detached with trypsin-EDTA, counted in triplicate by hemocytometer, and replated at a recorded density. A growth curve was drawn from the relative population increase. Cell doubling time over 30 days&#x02019; growth was calculated from the curve.</p></sec><sec><title>cAMP assays</title><p>Cellular cAMP concentrations were measured using the HitHunter&#x02122; cAMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with slight modifications. Cells were plated into 96-well plates at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well, 100 &#x003bc;l medium/well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in normal culture conditions overnight. Medium was gently aspirated. Then, unless specified, cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI1640 with BSA (1 mg/ml) and 0, 10 or 100 nM ASIP at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO<sub>2</sub> for 30 min. To assess the effect of incubation of ASIP in medium, RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS and 100 nM ASIP was incubated under the same conditions for 12 h and this medium was applied in place of the medium with fresh ASIP. For cell stimulation, NDP-MSH (30 pM) and IBMX (1 mM) were added directly to the ASIP-containing medium and cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The cells were lysed and processed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. One hour after the last reaction step, the luminescence of each well was measured with a Synergy&#x02122; HT Multi-Mode microplate reader equipped with KC4 for Windows data-reduction software (Bio-Tek Instruments, VT, USA). The cAMP concentration in each sample was calculated by comparing relative luminescence of the sample with that of a cAMP standard.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Simon Hill for expert assistance in establishing the melan-e cell lines, and Marta Cantero for technical assistance with mice.
